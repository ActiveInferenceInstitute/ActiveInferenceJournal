00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:09,876
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:12,412
Welcome to the Active Inference
Lab today.

3
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:15,448
It's October 22nd 2021

4
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:19,085
and it's ActInfLab Gueststream
number 11.1.

5
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:20,253
I'm Daniel.

6
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,956
I'm here with Bleu and our guest Greg.

7
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,458
So Greg,
thank you so much for being here.

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,962
And please introduce yourself
and take it away.

9
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,131
We'll be monitoring the live chat.

10
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,600
So if you have any questions
during the presentation, please

11
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,403
feel free to ask them
and we'll talk about them at the end.

12
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:40,673
But otherwise, thanks again for being
here and looking forward to this event.

13
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:42,275
Wonderful.

14
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,911
Hey, it's a real honor to be here.

15
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,914
I've seen a couple of other presentations
are really fascinating.

16
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:51,618
I look forward to sharing
some of my version of reality.

17
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:56,556
So let me give you a little bit
of orienting coordinates for me.

18
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,693
So I am Professor in the Combined
Integrated

19
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:05,065
Clinical and School Doctoral Program
at James Madison University.

20
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:08,368
Where I've been since 2003.

21
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,671
The role
I function there is to train individuals

22
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:12,872
to be

23
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:15,375
psychological doctors is the term we use.

24
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:19,079
The reason we use that is because
in psychology, in the profession

25
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,681
side, there are different practice areas,

26
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:26,786
clinical counseling and school
are the dominant practice areas.

27
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:31,825
But we want to transcend those
into a more general combined integrated

28
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:37,230
perspective that affords us a way
to kind of get out of some of the old

29
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:42,902
traditional institutional silos and
get a more general integrated picture.

30
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,639
So I've been there since 2003.

31
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,741
My journey in this is

32
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:54,214
I went to undergrad, got my major
in psychology and was just going to be

33
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,817
a behavioral scientist
that wanted to be a clinician.

34
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:02,055
My sense was the right thing to do
was to apply the methods

35
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,290
and findings of science
to the clinical world.

36
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:09,095
I went off, got my masters in clinical
and community psychology

37
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,999
in 1994 and

38
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:14,467
well well

39
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:14,801
why don't I

40
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,037
go ahead and start the presentation
and then I'll walk you through some

41
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,773
of that history
and then we'll get to the scenario

42
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,077
where ultimately you get this
weird cartoon of a garden on behind me

43
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:27,780
and we'll get to there over a period
and then we'll start into

44
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,415
what we're actually dealing with.

45
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:33,253
So make sure my screen here

46
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:38,758
so so we're talking about

47
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:42,262
the ontology of mental behavior and

48
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,398
just going to give it a context

49
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,601
my basic point

50
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:52,839
for defining this talk
is then to be in contrast

51
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,709
to the current mainstream approach
in academic psychology.

52
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:01,281
The mainstream approach
in academic psychology is really best

53
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:05,051
frame is what I would call
methodological behaviorism.

54
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:09,155
Methodological Behaviorism,
a term by Jane Moore.

55
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:14,460
But all it means is basically what is
psychology in the academy right now?

56
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,931
Is that it applies
the methods of behavioral science

57
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,000
to a thing very vaguely

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,904
defined as behavior
and mental process. OK,

59
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:26,906
and indeed,

60
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:31,778
the methods of science really are
what end up defining the term behavior,

61
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,714
which is the shit
you can see from our science perspective.

62
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,618
OK, and then the mental processes
are sort of the stuff

63
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:42,288
that's inferred
that give rise to the change in behavior,

64
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,557
at least if you're a mentalist
or a cognitive test

65
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,428
in traditional psychology as opposed
to, say, a radical behaviorist.

66
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:52,966
OK, so the science of psychology
is really defined

67
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,536
by an institution
that applies methods of science,

68
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:00,340
methods of behavioral science
in particular to analyze behavior

69
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,210
and then develop models of mental process
that are for the explanation

70
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:09,182
now the structure of it is broken
at the level of coherence.

71
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,216
And what I mean by that

72
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:14,053
is it doesn't there's
no organizing framework for psychology

73
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,389
psychology is not

74
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,926
defined by
and never has been defined by a paradigm

75
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:24,130
meaning a full in a cooney
in sense paradigm meaning a full

76
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,767
like Newton developed a paradigm
for classical mechanics

77
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,337
that then established psychology
that is a is a field

78
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,440
that had lots of different schools
of thought mini paradigms

79
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,944
that tried to manifest itself
as sort of the dominant paradigm.

80
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,113
That didn't happen.

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,715
There were no dominant paradigms
in psychology.

82
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,219
It gave rise to
what's called the crisis in psychology

83
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,522
that led Vygotsky specifies in 1927.

84
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:53,059
So we're talking
now over almost 100 years ago

85
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,863
in fact it was at first identified
in 1899 a crisis

86
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,999
in psychology
then just punts on the issue.

87
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,901
It's like, what do you,
what do you mean by that.

88
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,303
What's the field subject matter.

89
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,003
And the answer is

90
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:07,774
well different schools of thought
will frame that in different ways. OK,

91
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:09,876
the ontology of

92
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:13,012
mental behavior is the argument
that actually we can do better than that.

93
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,850
We don't have to define the field
based on epistemology, i.e.

94
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,352
the methods of science,

95
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:23,890
but we actually can define the field
based on a scientific ontology

96
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,260
that clarifies
what is meant by mental behavior.

97
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:33,633
And in so doing it affords a coherent
solution to the problem of psychology.

98
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:37,704
So the problem of psychology
is the inability of the field to cohere

99
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,707
around a particular conception

100
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,609
of its subject matter.

101
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,512
So that's the basic structure.

102
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,916
I'm like I said, I'm
at James Madison combined integrated.

103
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,084
So what's the basic

104
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,487
just just to get a lay of the landscape
from where I'm coming from.

105
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,357
And I'm, you know, I'm an odd bird.

106
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,728
So you should be very clear
that I I'll be doing a weird version

107
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:06,999
of psychology now for for a long time,
I started to say this.

108
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,769
I entered into the field
sort of in a conventional sense.

109
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:13,606
I got trained in the normal methods
of behavioral science

110
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:17,343
and analysis of variance and,
and all that good stuff and was like,

111
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:22,048
oh, well, clearly we want to employ
a standard empirical method to delineate

112
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,985
you know, what the sort of the truth is
or the most accurate models.

113
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,155
And so but then I encountered this thing

114
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,358
called the problem of psychotherapy
what's that?

115
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:36,362
We actually get into the room
with people, and that's a trick.

116
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,433
And then you're a real person
in a real situation

117
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,469
in the idiosyncratic processes
by which you have to make active

118
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:47,240
inferences about what is
operating in the moment. OK,

119
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:48,841
means

120
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,844
that a generalized aggregate
variable analysis

121
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,614
so that the rest of the field does like,
oh, here's a problem.

122
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,549
It's called major depressive disorder.

123
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:00,420
Here's a specific specified intervention
called cognitive therapy.

124
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:05,224
And now you're to imply this cognitive
therapy intervention with this person.

125
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:09,495
Sorry, but what I learned
and I didn't know it at the time,

126
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,998
but what I learned
was the level of abstraction

127
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:16,669
at the variable aggregate level
relative to the actual process

128
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,272
by which you engage
in feedback in the room,

129
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,142
in a participatory, real relationship
of course, I have language for this

130
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,479
now that I didn't have then,
but the bottom line was that, you know,

131
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,383
what I actually saw in the field
was that the best of the best,

132
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,852
depending
on regardless of the school of thought,

133
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:36,055
the best of the best
did the best, surprisingly enough.

134
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:40,193
And lousy players from various
all the different schools did lousy

135
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,061
and most people did average.

136
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,497
And the schools of thought really don't
generate

137
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:48,401
systematic difference,
at least of bonafide schools of thought.

138
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,469
So essentially

139
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,139
what you get in psychotherapy is the
what's called the dodo bird finding.

140
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:54,540
I'm president

141
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,311
elect of the Society for the Exploration
of Psychotherapy integration,

142
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,548
which is a field that has long
standing questions in relationship

143
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,551
to the relationship
between the schools of thought

144
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,556
and and I got then introduced in 1994.

145
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:17,196
This is basically to the field through
a potentially integrative perspective. So

146
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,233
for me that was fascinating.

147
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,402
It turns out that my orientation
is actually what's called a big picture

148
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:27,173
coherent test orientation, meaning
that I actually want to zoom the way

149
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:31,611
to organize pieces in a particular way
so that I can create a coherent

150
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:35,715
frame of reference and then zoom back in
with the coherent frame of reference.

151
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,850
That's the way my mind operates.

152
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,554
So I had zoomed out and then realized
that there is actually no coherence

153
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,858
at the level of psychotherapy, and people
have known this for a long time.

154
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,794
And then this whole field that emerged
in the mid 1980s, this was like

155
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:53,332
15 years ten years down the road
from that emergence of that field

156
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:57,136
with the psychotherapy
integration problem.

157
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,705
And then I was fascinated by it
and I did something

158
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,642
that's actually no one's ever done,
which is kind of interesting.

159
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,112
I looked at medicine
and this is just all intuitive.

160
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,180
I looked at medicine

161
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,649
and I said, you know,

162
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,051
you don't have all these different
schools of thought and medicine.

163
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:16,022
It's not like you have, you know,
the cardiologists are not battling with

164
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:21,060
the endocrinologist versus, you know,
the people that emphasize the gut.

165
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,263
You know, they all are like,
hey, there are different systems

166
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,867
of biological adaptation that function
together in a whole and thing.

167
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,370
We have a thing called human biology
human biology

168
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,507
is the science
that organizes the various domains

169
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,677
and that affords a descriptive

170
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:41,480
explanatory framework that then should
inform the practice of medicine.

171
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,384
So if we jump up a level,
it seems reasonable to me

172
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:49,355
or it seemed intuitively reasonable to me
that there should be a human science

173
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:52,391
of human psychology that should organize

174
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,861
the descriptive explanatory
network of understanding, OK?

175
00:09:56,696 --> 00:10:00,666
And then apply that to the field
all right.

176
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,301
So now notice what I had done.

177
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,970
I got socialized into the empirical

178
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,872
methodological behavioral science
approach of psychology,

179
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:10,142
dropped into the problem
of psychotherapy backed up

180
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,043
and was like, Oh, wait a minute.

181
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:15,114
What I really need as a practitioner is
I need a holistic conception

182
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,849
of human psychology

183
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:20,152
that affords clarity about what the hell
the field is actually talking about.

184
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,289
Sorry, I'll probably drop an F bomb here
or there if that's OK.

185
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,591
But anyway, what I basically realized

186
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:30,596
then here is I shifted perspective
and I said, Well, what is psychology?

187
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:34,300
And then I realized, Oh my God,
nobody knows what the fuck psychology is.

188
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,535
There's no word that

189
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:40,239
everyone's got different reference points
for this fundamental work, OK?

190
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,108
And that's the problem of psychology.

191
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:46,045
There's a dramatic set of reference
points that.

192
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:51,217
And so I then took a couple of left
turns that I can tell you about in 1996

193
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:55,855
and then a big one in 1997, and all of
a sudden I actually developed a vision,

194
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,158
not like some transcendent vision
although it has these elements.

195
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,029
I developed a picture,
an organizing picture,

196
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,899
really a new map of big history,
as it were, that afforded me

197
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,903
a new way to address this problem
of what psychology is, OK?

198
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,940
And that ultimately gives rise
to a clear ontology of the mental.

199
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,778
All right, we'll specify
what I mean by that and then by affording

200
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,747
clarity about what the scientific
conception of the mental is.

201
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:27,086
I could then organize my work,
then return to the original problem

202
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,522
and develop
a framework for psychotherapy.

203
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,858
And so that's what the project is about.

204
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,529
Now, my journey over this time period
basically is the first thing is, Hey,

205
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,564
there's a problem. And I need this.

206
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:42,168
And then I built this thing
called the Tree of Knowledge System.

207
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,371
The Tree of Knowledge System
is this natural scientific ontology

208
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,474
that maps the world in a particular way
that affords a science

209
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,210
of a natural science
view of what the mental is.

210
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:52,745
I worked

211
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,914
on that and said, Hey, it organizes
the field.

212
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:56,382
I did.

213
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,552
You know, I can tell
about my publication, history, et cetera.

214
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,289
And then ultimately that evolved in
what's called the Unified

215
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,157
Theory of psychology.

216
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:08,527
The Unified Theory of Psychology
specifies the tree of knowledge

217
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:12,098
and then a couple of other key ideas
that then provide

218
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,468
a conceptual architecture
for assimilating.

219
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,403
And then in writing the schools
of thought

220
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,772
and major empirical findings
into a coherent whole.

221
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,875
So again,
it provides a conceptual architecture

222
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,578
for assimilating
and integrating the schools of thought

223
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,447
and the major, major schools of thought
and major empirical findings

224
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,350
to afford a coherent
whole of the picture.

225
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,620
And basically then create a new unified

226
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,423
theory of psychology

227
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:41,227
I then shifted that I did that,
but published that in 2011.

228
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,297
I then returned to the original problem

229
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:50,503
and from 2011 2016 or so worked out
been given this framework.

230
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,239
What would a unified approach
to psychotherapy be?

231
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,176
Well,
and I don't delineated four key ideas

232
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,146
that could help organize the field
and generate

233
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:03,983
a unified approach to psychotherapy,
at least with individual adults.

234
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:08,020
OK, child's are different blah blah blah
I was honed in on sort of standard

235
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,791
individual psychotherapy, especially
for neurotic adults, which are the vast

236
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,393
majority people come in for psychotherapy
or neurotic adults.

237
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:20,366
So this affords then a one of a way
to organize the key insights and then and

238
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:26,071
so then you would have a unified theory
of psychology and a unified approach OK

239
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:31,744
well then in 2016, as I was delineating
that I took another weird turn.

240
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:32,978
All right.

241
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:37,483
And there are a lot of reasons as to why
but the short story is I was

242
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:42,755
I was at a conference called
Cultivating the Globally Sustainable Self

243
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,658
about transformative education

244
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,928
and the massive global problems
that we face in relation.

245
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,231
And it was in the context
of that conference.

246
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,402
I had created this model
the unified theory and unified approach

247
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,137
and was called a 21.

248
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,773
OK, let's
I just dropped into the language.

249
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:01,607
You know, things were get more

250
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:05,211
and more efficient,
you know, as you teed up on a tour.

251
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:06,846
So I'm just like you total.

252
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,248
I was like,
wow, let's do that, blah, blah, blah.

253
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,384
So I'm at this conference
and they're doing this

254
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,387
talking
fundamentally about how to do this thing

255
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,357
called cultivate
a globally sustainable self, meaning

256
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:23,095
how do we transform our education
for children in the rural world

257
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:26,298
that we're in given all the crises
and challenges that we face,

258
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,500
what does that actually look like?
And fast conference.

259
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,971
And at the end of it,
there was a panel discussion

260
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,874
and panel discussion actually got
all the people they invited there

261
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,674
and they came up

262
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,644
and they actually all fumbled over
the question as far as I was concerned.

263
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,246
Like they were brilliant people.
They did this.

264
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,781
They couldn't
actually there was a summary opportunity.

265
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,884
I left the conference
and I was walking away

266
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,952
and I was talking to somebody else, like,
you know what we should do?

267
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,622
We should plant a two
a seeds and grow it to a tree,

268
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,159
which sort
of fell out of me as a light bulb moment

269
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,762
and then turned into the thing behind me,
which is this garden.

270
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,567
And all of a sudden
I basically then transform this build

271
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,903
this construction that I had
with all these different

272
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,772
sort of like a cathedral
that I got transformed into a garden.

273
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:11,076
I actually then got called
into like spiritually, artistically

274
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:15,447
to build this garden
so that now this knowledge system

275
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:19,218
then can be represented
symbolically in a garden.

276
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,486
And that's what's by me.

277
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:24,456
So it's a it's a layer knowledge system
sort of like, for example.

278
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,424
Well, just so that's,

279
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,228
that's, that's and then, you know,
I got pulled more into that

280
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:33,365
and then that shifted me further
and further into the orbit of weirdness.

281
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:33,832
All right.

282
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:37,536
But anyway, that's
basically what I realized fundamentally

283
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:42,608
is why I got pulled into this
level of abstraction was something

284
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,645
that I sort of got clearer on
as I've been writing my current book.

285
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,449
And that is a real understanding
fundamentally

286
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,652
of what's going on here in relationship
to kind of our knowledge system.

287
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:58,157
So we have a foundational problem
in our knowledge and what I call

288
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,260
this foundational problems
called the Enlightenment gap.

289
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,795
What the hell is that?

290
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,098
The Enlightenment gap
is the point that when science emerged

291
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:11,337
came in from Galileo and Newton
coming off of the scholastics

292
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,873
when we built physical science
and the epistemology

293
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,343
and ontology
that emerged with physical science,

294
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:22,982
that was never of ability to take what
we learned from the physical sciences

295
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,784
and create a holistic, synthetic
philosophy.

296
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,654
Conte tried, Hegel tried, et cetera.

297
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:32,424
But what you basically get in
the Enlightenment is a gap a failure

298
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:33,459
to get the proper

299
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,595
relationships first on the relationship
between matter and mind.

300
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,031
OK, some based body problem.

301
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,699
What the hell is that?
How do you actually solve that?

302
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:44,570
And then the other thing emerges
as a secondary or joint problem is

303
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:49,041
what is actual scientific knowledge
relative to social knowledge, OK?

304
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,976
And this problem emerges.

305
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,811
We see in the 20th century
with the emergence

306
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,748
of the philosophical postmodern
critique of modernity,

307
00:16:56,648 --> 00:17:00,786
which basically says,
hey, modernity made too many abstract

308
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,789
pure, reasoned progress, claims
that they were actually

309
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:07,126
that you could find genuine truth
that's not contextualized

310
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,863
in a socio historical justification
context.

311
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,297
Of the postmodern critique.

312
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,567
And actually you can't really make
knowledge claims that are transcendent.

313
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,738
They're all imminently contextualized
in the socio historical context.

314
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,508
And Lo and behold, look at the way
the knowledge systems emerge.

315
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:27,946
They privileged cisgendered, white
colonial men who go around and create

316
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:31,583
oh yes, this history of reason and bobble
behold is actually normative

317
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,853
for us and we get to distribute
our power structures around the world.

318
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,357
And so you've got a philosophical
and a social justice postmodern critique

319
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,592
about what science says
relative to social knowledge.

320
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,494
That never actually gets resolved.

321
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,497
OK, and that's why we have postmodern
versus modern

322
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,634
anto epistemological debates
about the nature of knowledge.

323
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,469
And so the Enlightenment gap

324
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,372
basically is a description
of the current state of affairs

325
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,408
where we have
we're lacking a philosophical framework

326
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,044
that affords us clarity
about matter in mind.

327
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,780
On the one hand, and science
and social knowledge on the other.

328
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:07,119
OK, so that's the gist of the
location about where we are.

329
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,521
I built this

330
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:12,825
thing called the Unified
Theory of Knowledge.

331
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:13,926
What is unified?

332
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:18,330
Unified is taken directly from the book
Conciliate the Unity of Knowledge. E.O.

333
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,432
Wilson wrote a book called Consilience

334
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,302
in 1998 called The Consultants
The Unity of Knowledge.

335
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,071
That's what unified means.
I means conciliate.

336
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:29,708
There's a conciliate coherence,
big picture view that actually

337
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,877
gets the pieces of the puzzle correct.

338
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:36,648
So we actually understand
knowing and knowing how we know

339
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,218
and knowing what we mean
when we know things physically

340
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,955
and what we know things biologically,
what we actually mean psychologically,

341
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,089
human psychologically

342
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:47,626
into the social sciences,
how we know scientifically relative to

343
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,730
how do we know subjective
what do we know about ethics, et cetera.

344
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:55,267
There's actually a coherent synthetic
philosophy that is available

345
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,470
that frames these problems
that wasn't achievable before

346
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,875
and so here's the garden crime.

347
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,112
And what it has here is so for example,
right here,

348
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,648
this little thing is called
the stepping stone.

349
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,051
What is that step stands for?

350
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:18,056
The Standard Theory of elementary
particle physics and the stepping stone.

351
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,926
Then grounds
you in physics in a particular way.

352
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,763
Then this first branch is the tree
of knowledge system, the base of

353
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:28,300
which is the energy information
quantum field structures

354
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,570
that live underneath matter
and go back to Big Bang.

355
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:35,440
And then each one of these
is a layered system of information

356
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,010
processing called life, mind and culture.

357
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,580
And it is that arrangement of energy
information

358
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:46,451
gives rise to a classic material field,
and then life emerges and then mind.

359
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,387
And I'll explain what I mean by mind here

360
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,756
emerges at the animal, mental,
behavioral level.

361
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:55,460
And then culture emerges so
that we become go from primates to people

362
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,964
as we talk to each other and build
what are called systems of justification.

363
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,633
So that just gives you a flavor for it.

364
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,101
There's other things
that are going on here

365
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,803
that I won't necessarily get into,

366
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:08,574
but it basically says
there's actually a knowledge system here.

367
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,910
The left side is the unified theory.

368
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,379
You can see actually there's a little
you here and a T

369
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,282
and these four ideas make up
what's called the unified theory.

370
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:21,086
There's a U and an A, which stands
for the unified approach.

371
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,856
OK, this right here
is a symbol of mindfulness

372
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,925
on the right side of the branches.

373
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:30,262
The way in which we relate to people
in healthy psychological ways.

374
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:31,997
It's actually called calm memo.

375
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,466
It's integrative approach
to psychological mindfulness.

376
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,237
It's the processes by which we can hold
each other and ourselves

377
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:42,207
and deal with difficult social emotional
relations that are forward, productive,

378
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,510
virtuous looping, as opposed to
what often happens to people is

379
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,079
they get trapped in negative cycles

380
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,782
attack each other and then get in
vicious, destructive looping.

381
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,351
That's just one example.

382
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,420
So the tree
then as eight key ideas, four of which

383
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,590
make up the unified approach
this is, by the way, the tree of Life.

384
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,026
The Tree of knowledge is the first branch
tree of life.

385
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,461
That's for here, for here.

386
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,596
And then as a symbol in the middle,

387
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:09,301
which is actually called the metaphysical
empirical flower, metaphysical

388
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:13,238
empirical flower creates a dialectic
between metaphysics and empiricism.

389
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:17,843
And that was missing in the structure
of the Enlightenment, which we need

390
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,678
is the thing down here called the coin.

391
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,313
But I'll pause here, just plenty of

392
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,282
structure there.

393
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,784
Let me make a few more comments
and then actually I'll pause after this.

394
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:30,922
So ultimately, what the unified theory
does is it affords a new opportunity

395
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:34,092
to think about the Enlightenment
gap, and I argue resolve it.

396
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,897
And what it does is it sets the stage
for a unified theory of psychology

397
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,700
and frames
a unified approach to psychotherapy.

398
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,671
OK, so that's basically
then we can get into

399
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,206
what does all this mean in relationship
to some of the deep theory?

400
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,010
But I wanted to give folks an opportunity
for the basic gist of where I'm

401
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,011
coming from.

402
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,783
Thank you for the summary.

403
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,552
Cool work and symbolic images.

404
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,220
So anyone watching

405
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,791
live can definitely write questions
but that's a great place to start.

406
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:09,828
We got the personal
and the multi-level narrative

407
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:14,366
coming together with a little bit
of a challenge and a response

408
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,135
which will then learn more about.

409
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,305
So maybe we can just go blue
if you have any comments.

410
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,140
Otherwise we
can go into the next section.

411
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,278
I don't know if we want
to go through some of my questions now.

412
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,549
I mean, I have some that relate to the
Unified Universal Theory of knowledge.

413
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,585
So if we want to maybe pull up that slide

414
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,755
or if Greg is still showing slides,
we don't have to.

415
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,591
I can just read it off the slide.

416
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:40,525
So the. Perfect.

417
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,960
Yeah, and it's on the screen as well.

418
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,096
So here's one.

419
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,564
Just summary quote

420
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:49,434
first, the UTI, OK, differentiates
the mental behavior of animals

421
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,536
from the behavior
of other living creatures,

422
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,538
both metaphysically
and better theoretically.

423
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,606
Which you mentioned.

424
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:58,477
And second, it differentiates
the mental behavior of human persons

425
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,113
from the mental behavior

426
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,683
of other animals, both metaphysically
and better theoretically.

427
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,386
OK, so similar,
but a little bit different there.

428
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:10,856
So what are the distinctions
that are critical for psychology

429
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,725
what distinctions does your work make?

430
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,460
How do we know those are the right ones?

431
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,496
How did you carve UTI?

432
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:21,433
OK at the G exaggerates beautiful ok.

433
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:22,467
So yeah, love that.

434
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:25,637
That's a wonderful set of questions
and gets right to the heart

435
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,205
of some of the key issues.

436
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:31,643
OK, so let's talk about the
so the the tree of Knowledge

437
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,980
Divides is a descriptive
metaphysical system.

438
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,480
That's a,

439
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,716
the picture

440
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,786
is an it shows matter
like mind and culture.

441
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,321
OK, so basically coming off Big Bang.

442
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:46,591
So you start what's called
an energy information singularity.

443
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:47,426
All right.

444
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,629
That's how you go back to Big Bang,
13.8 billion years ago.

445
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:51,430
ET cetera.

446
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:56,535
You free run the tape back and everything
collapses into quote unquote a point

447
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,971
or a singularity
because this is just general cosmology.

448
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:00,906
All right.

449
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,675
I'm getting to the question,
but I just give this background.

450
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,812
OK, so according to modern cosmology,

451
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:10,549
the universe essentially begins
in a state of pure energy information.

452
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,917
That's at least what I refer to it as.

453
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:16,388
We can talk about the term
and then out of that comes matter time.

454
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,892
And basically what you get is
you get all the four fundamental forces

455
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,995
in nature that's electromagnetism,
gravitation, strong,

456
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:27,132
weak, differentiating to create fields.

457
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:31,203
And then you get a coalescence,
a cooling in the freezing and coalescence

458
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:34,139
of energy into chunks of matter
in the form of particles,

459
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:38,376
atoms up into then chemicals and certain
unique context.

460
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,911
And then across scale that builds

461
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:43,715
things like stars and galaxies
and mega galaxy clusters.

462
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:47,552
OK, so this is
then our physical universe.

463
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,353
All right.

464
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,255
And notice what I've done
and the reason I had to say

465
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,291
this is because one of the first things
we have to note from classical mechanics

466
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,995
is that modern physicist physics
teaches us that there's a thing beneath

467
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,198
the classical material world
called quantum

468
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:03,902
field theory and the energy information
singularity of Big Bang.

469
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,772
The reason that's really important
because we have to understand

470
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:11,009
the fundamental substance
ontology of the world,

471
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,379
which is energy information fields,
not billiard balls.

472
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:19,551
OK, so there we're working in the initial
sort of ontology is billiard ball shit.

473
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:23,588
And it's like, no, that's
actually not the ground of the universe.

474
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:24,623
Ground of the universe

475
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:28,293
is sort of like an energy information
superpower horse field theory, right?

476
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,329
Which by the way for mental
and the implications

477
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:34,900
to understand the way mental structures
work, it's important.

478
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,069
It's some people like Bernardo Castro,
please drop it all the way round.

479
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,038
Call that Big Mind
I don't agree with that.

480
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,407
But fundamentally,
we do want to understand that, OK,

481
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,243
then we come and we jump up.

482
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,645
We don't know how this exactly happens.

483
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,613
What about four or 3.8 billion years ago?

484
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:53,351
We see the jump in the world
from chemicals, complicated

485
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:57,722
chemical protein, lipid structures
that somehow jump together organized.

486
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,624
And we get life.

487
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:02,060
OK, so the miracle of life. All right.

488
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,931
So the miracle of life then creates

489
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:10,101
the jump from quasi organizing systems

490
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:15,540
that then get into fundamentally sloping,
into self-organize.

491
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:19,578
What Deakin Terence Deakin calls

492
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:24,449
intentional phenomena
that operate across Abstentia.

493
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:29,688
OK, so intentional phenomena meaning that
basically there is some descriptively

494
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:33,458
not explanatory, but descriptively
these cells behave with a goddamn purpose

495
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:37,963
and they're doing it OK,
and it somehow is that they're imagining

496
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,064
that they are black

497
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:42,534
and then they move toward black
like they're hungry and they go

498
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,636
and they don't want to die
and they move around.

499
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:48,506
OK. Incomplete Nature is Terrence
Deakins analysis of this jump.

500
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,843
Well, this is really important
to understand the emergence

501
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:55,413
of complex adaptive dynamic systems
because that's what life is.

502
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,816
It's a complex, adaptive, dynamic system.

503
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:01,686
That has embedded in it
energy information systems

504
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:04,155
that are the capacity to pull.

505
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,592
I'll use a slightly different call
for some free energy

506
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:12,130
from the environment to do work
to maintain its complex organization.

507
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,399
So survives and reproduces.

508
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,235
OK, and the reason I have to tell you
all of that

509
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:22,073
is because the ground that we need
to understand the dynamic biological

510
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:26,778
ground out of which then minded
animals are going to emerge from

511
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:31,416
so so that we get a natural selection
operating on genetic combinations.

512
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,752
And what happens according to unified
theory is actually you get

513
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:37,989
an orthogonal dimension of activity,
orthogonal to the real in some ways.

514
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,157
What I mean by

515
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:43,495
that is the subject of information
processing, the epistemic information

516
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,565
processing of a cell is like
the cell is actually making judgments

517
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:53,538
and quasi even decisions as it engages in
some kind of primitive act of inference

518
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:57,375
OK. And so then that becomes the ground.

519
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,445
And then basically you get bacteria
that are doing that for a long time

520
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,980
in other kinds of animal kingdom.

521
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,451
I mean, you know, algae, another kinds
of properties kind of kingdom stuff.

522
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,821
And then you get multicellular
plants, OK,

523
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:14,059
that afford the opportunity
for what big historians call big life

524
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:17,929
so you get multi cellular plants
and you also are going to get fungi

525
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:22,434
mycologist study things
like they do really weird stuff.

526
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,102
Fungi

527
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,638
and then you get
so you're going to get these active

528
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:29,541
multicellular entities

529
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,711
that are still though fundamentally

530
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,514
organized and grounded
and change their environment

531
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:39,551
through their growth
potentials within the cell.

532
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:43,421
So even things like mushrooms,
what mushrooms don't do is they don't

533
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,090
get up and walk around.

534
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:45,924
All right.

535
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,260
But what they do is they send out
growth signals into particular things

536
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,962
and then they grow
in really interesting ways,

537
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:54,199
but they are confined by their boundaries
all right.

538
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,902
But what happens
is that in the animal kingdom,

539
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,674
there's a shut off in relationship
to this so that this system

540
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:06,778
now becomes as a multi
organizing system becomes mobile.

541
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,446
All right,

542
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:12,250
so 700 million years ago,
you're going to get then a transition

543
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:18,656
into basically jellyfish like creatures
that have distributed neural networks

544
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,460
that have some degree of capacity
for coordinating their behavior.

545
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:23,461
All right.

546
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,530
Through the distributed neural net

547
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,066
that's the first step towards a mind it
animal.

548
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,501
It's not there yet.

549
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:34,973
You then get bilateral planning
with an an emerging integration

550
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:39,210
between the sensory motor structures
OK like in a plenary a worm

551
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,313
now a plenary worms
got a centralized controlled center

552
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,784
a sudden distributing
and it's got bilateral movement

553
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,619
to coordinate its movement
in a particular way.

554
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,788
Now you're very close to the plenary
or worm to what

555
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,623
I would call a minded animal.

556
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:55,193
The final thing is that you
then get the Cambrian explosion

557
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:58,363
550, 520 million years ago.

558
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:02,400
And in this short period of time,
basically you get a much greater

559
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,135
complexity
creation of the nervous system.

560
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:08,173
You get a centralized nervous system
and you get a complex active body plan.

561
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:12,510
That complex active body plan
then regulates a sensory motor looping

562
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,747
OK that affords the animal
to get up and move around.

563
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:17,382
All right.

564
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,950
Now that's a game changer.

565
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,020
It moves the entire structure
as a sensory motor loop.

566
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,157
OK, and it is that division,
that joint point

567
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,495
between life living organisms
and mind it animals

568
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,432
that the tree of knowledge points to
and says, Hey, that Cambrian explosion

569
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:38,403
thing is when minded animals
blew out of living organisms,

570
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:41,973
there's a joint point thing
that's as important to understand

571
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:46,110
in our big picture as the joint point
between non inanimate matter and that.

572
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,748
And it follows a very similar pattern
because what you see like with cells,

573
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:51,182
what did you get?

574
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,385
You got an RNA DNA information
processing closure

575
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:57,622
around a lipid with protein generation
that's then creates

576
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,158
a communication network
between other cells.

577
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:03,361
Well, the nervous system is very much
akin to the RNA.

578
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:05,864
It's a centralized control system.

579
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,467
And what it does is it knocks all
the cells together in a coordinated way.

580
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,337
So the animal gets to move
as a whole unit.

581
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,908
So the sensory motor
looping of animal movement, that becomes

582
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:20,478
a fundamental another dimension
of information processing communication.

583
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,815
We get animal animal movement
working with each other

584
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:27,652
in a communication network,
you get the base of the mind dimension.

585
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,688
OK, so in the unified theory, that's

586
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,192
and you can then it's defined
behaviorally and descriptively.

587
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,362
So it's a complex active body
moving in relationship

588
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,731
to each other with functional outcomes.

589
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:41,366
That's what it is.

590
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:45,370
So when you go and you walk your dog,
your dog is exhibiting this,

591
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,672
the insects are exhibiting this, OK?

592
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:52,677
And it's, it's called mindedness
or mind it's the functional animal,

593
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,713
the behavior as a whole, mediated
by the nervous system, OK?

594
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,016
It produces
a reliable, understandable fact.

595
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:02,420
The base of this looping,
I see as basic, you know,

596
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:03,922
predictive processing,

597
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,926
active inference, essential, OK,
there's a fundamental iterative process

598
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,828
that is regulating information, energy
and particular structures

599
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,831
that theory, the matter
theoretical structure I bring to bear

600
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,200
is called behavioral investment theory.

601
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,971
OK, behavioral investment
theory is a meta perspective

602
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,874
that takes together
what's called energy economics.

603
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:27,845
So you have to solve the problem
of entropy and energy expenditure.

604
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,414
So it's those first principles energy

605
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,850
economics, second is evolution,
the natural by natural selection

606
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,253
and other any other things
we have to add to that.

607
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,188
But that's the general just the third

608
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,590
principles, behavioral genetics,
which means the genetic

609
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,394
the gene system is going to bias
the system in a particular way.

610
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,564
The fourth principle is neuro
computational control.

611
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:51,269
So neural computational control
then the processes by which we engage

612
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,871
in neural computational control
then is analyzed

613
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,908
deeply by an act of inference
predictive processing.

614
00:32:57,675 --> 00:33:00,812
The fifth principle is learning
and of course then that's how a system

615
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:04,415
upgrades and relationship to experience
and the six principles life history

616
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:07,952
development, meaning depending on where
the animal is in its life history.

617
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:08,920
Is it young?

618
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,389
Is it adolescent,
is it late life, et cetera?

619
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:15,093
It's reproductive and survival strategies
are going to change based on its life

620
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:15,860
history development.

621
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,862
So the six principles
of behavioral investment

622
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,865
and what they do
then is they yoked together

623
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:24,702
neuroscience and evolutionary theory
and computational cognitive.

624
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,905
And by the way, behavioral science
from the vantage point

625
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:30,341
of a radical behavioral position
like a skinner.

626
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,278
This is actually I come through this
from Skinner, by the way, which is weird.

627
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:39,517
OK, so so Skinner actually what Skinner
does is he just sits on the outside.

628
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:44,055
He basically says, oh, it's fucking
black box, it's physiology, black box.

629
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:48,860
But what I will track is I will track at
a very fine grain analysis consequences,

630
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,261
the animals, what I can do.

631
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:53,564
And something is got consequences
and it is the consequences that pull

632
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:54,365
the animal in.

633
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,568
It's behavioral investment
and I can navigate the consequences

634
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,938
as an instrument, as an engineer,
he thinks like an engineer.

635
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,940
He's not thinking like a theorist.
He's really an engineer.

636
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,511
You know, he wanted to be a poet, OK,
but it basically fails.

637
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:07,912
There's a poet and there's like, what?

638
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:08,212
Really?

639
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,015
But, you know, I think it really
we can do a psychodynamic interpretation

640
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:11,849
what happens to him.

641
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,619
But I don't have any structure
focusing on how to control

642
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:18,189
the consequences
to pull investment from an animal.

643
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:22,126
And so that's an exterior behavioral
position, and that's radical behaviorism,

644
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,462
which, by the way, is totally different
than mythological ruins.

645
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:28,599
Various, you know, 5% psychologists go
this applied behavior analysis.

646
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:32,370
But it's really key because we want to be
able to bring the fact of the matter is

647
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,840
a dynamic control, consequential system
from the outside, behavioral,

648
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,077
outside, is going to connect
to the offer active inference.

649
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,346
So somebody asks a questions like, hey,
can we connect enactment?

650
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:46,584
And an activism and representational ism
with a behavioral selection structure

651
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,553
like yeah, yeah, you can.

652
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,289
OK, so anyway,
that's behavioral investment theory.

653
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,157
And what that does is
it takes you from basic

654
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:56,727
the Cambrian explosion and crabs
all the way up and oil everything's

655
00:34:56,727 --> 00:35:00,631
changing, but you can go all the way
up to primates following this line.

656
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,700
And that's the dimension of mindedness.

657
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,470
We can talk about the stack,
but behavioral assessment theory tracks

658
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:10,541
that stack in the evolution of mind
brain behavior in the animal kingdom,

659
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,644
it's called Mind as a capital
M is really an introduction

660
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,813
of a particular term,
and it's the first joint point

661
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:19,617
and so what the descriptive metaphysics
and ontology is, oh, here's

662
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,854
the set of mental behavior, the meta
theories, behavioral investment theory,

663
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:28,159
OK? And that goes then from organisms
into animal mental behavior.

664
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:31,229
And it's a joint point
that people fail to see too often.

665
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:34,999
So I'll stop there and say this is
then the ground of mental behavior

666
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,168
is we've set up
and then we'll go all the way up

667
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:40,171
through the animal kingdom
and then we'll jump into the human

668
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,107
primate to become a person
and what that does.

669
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,942
And then finally
we actually got to come back

670
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:48,146
and actually talk about the psyche
but not the whole another almost.

671
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:51,816
So so just to clarify here, like you're

672
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:56,954
you're presenting two things as central
and kind of required for mind

673
00:35:56,954 --> 00:36:00,358
with the capital
M, and those are mobility

674
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,994
and a central nervous system,
is that correct?

675
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:03,794
Right.

676
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:08,132
It's really it's a complex active body
with a central nervous system

677
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:11,002
that ties up a motor system
in a sensory system together.

678
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:15,139
There's interesting analysis of evolution
about how you get a sensory system

679
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,575
in a motor system, how do they actually
evolve when they come together.

680
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:22,113
So when you have an exemplar of a mind
did animal is a complex,

681
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,515
centralized nervous system,
an active body

682
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,417
that produce a functional effect
on the animal environment.

683
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:30,454
Well, so how do you rectify like things

684
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:34,058
like people who are paralyzed, are they
then mindless because they're not mobile?

685
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,426
Oh, of course. Not.

686
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:37,295
So then we need well, dialog. Exactly.

687
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:40,531
So, so now we're within dialog
about the different domains of mind.

688
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,301
OK, so ultimately
we'll take somebody like

689
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,604
Stephen Hawking OK, so Stephen

690
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:50,141
Hawking has an entire shell of existence
right

691
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,545
through the mediation of the sensory
motor control system

692
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,248
on the behavioral extension
to Lou Gehrig's disease.

693
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:00,084
Unplugs that, you know,
what a nightmare, right?

694
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,054
And then you get what he then experiences
what's called mind.

695
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:06,457
He still has in my language,
we can get to a mind.

696
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,960
One is inside the organism.

697
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,429
The neural computational layering
of the modeling inside

698
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:15,032
the organism is called mind one, and
that's the neuro computational structure.

699
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:19,537
OK, if you mind one, a is the inside mind

700
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:22,807
one, B is the mediated by the sensory
motor looping.

701
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,778
OK, so definitely you
then the entire definition

702
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:30,848
in the large scale of what the exemplar
is, is the sensory motor loop.

703
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,385
But obviously then what happens is
what's called mind one A

704
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,555
is the neurocognitive infrastructure
within the nervous system,

705
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:41,826
OK, versus my one B,
which is the actual observable

706
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:45,162
from the exterior
mediated by the muscle movements.

707
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,866
So what happens is with people
like we get this mind one, B gets X,

708
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:52,036
OK, but my one, hey,
the architecture is still there.

709
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:53,971
Now if we now jump up to humans,

710
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:57,241
they have what's called mind
to like other primates and idea

711
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,745
that we can argue how far it goes mind to
is called subjective conscious

712
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:03,814
experience of being is first
for the hard problem of consciousness.

713
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:08,419
The first person experience of being mind
one gives rise to do

714
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:13,090
we can dialog about this mind to mind
two is available from the inside

715
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,393
subject of conscious experience

716
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,728
and then mind three
is the justifying mind

717
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:20,431
which other animals don't have,
but humans do ok.

718
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,934
And then we created information interface
with Stephen Hawking

719
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:27,371
so that he kept after his entire system
got shut down.

720
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:28,406
Instead of locking him

721
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,042
in, we were able
to create a verbal interface

722
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,077
so we can maintain contact
with this brilliant mind

723
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:34,779
and he could tell us about, Hey,

724
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:35,179
actually,

725
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,147
I don't think the information

726
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,849
is lost in black holes
and I can actually even do the analysis,

727
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,186
ok, but if we didn't have that interface,
he would have been lost

728
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,956
but we would have known that, yes,
he would have had mind one a

729
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,193
the insight inferential architecture
mind to the first person

730
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:52,863
experience of being and mind three
A which is the internal narrator

731
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,432
but he would have lost Mind three

732
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,934
B, which is what I'm doing right
now, talking to you publicly.

733
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,470
But thankfully
we maintain his information interface

734
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,073
and maintain
contact with this great mind.

735
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,644
Thank you, Greg. So

736
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:10,648
I just wanted to kind of recap two points
and just maybe show

737
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,050
a little point of contact
with what you mentioned

738
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,252
and some of the big themes
in active inference.

739
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:19,190
So first,
you mentioned how there was these

740
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,527
abstractions and mean field
approximations in the clinical field.

741
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:27,164
And so that didn't
that was like speaking to a disconnect

742
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:30,000
between theory and application
and practice

743
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:33,571
and making impact on the systems
that people care about.

744
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,974
And then also to the more deeper
physical question

745
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:40,611
about mean field approximations
and whether you can study

746
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:44,281
like the trajectory of one particle
versus just take the time average,

747
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:47,685
the space average, we're not going to go
into the whole Ergodic city

748
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,552
non equilibrium

749
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:52,323
steady state definition, but
those are key terms for active inference.

750
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,692
So they come into play with that
inference like.

751
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:58,496
I am, I am, I don't have mastery,
I am a non

752
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,598
the active inference
meaning of a lot of those terms.

753
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:03,200
So I need to get I need to be brought up
to speed on some of that.

754
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:04,735
But it's exactly that.

755
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:09,206
If someone says, well, you know
the machine in the mean field it works.

756
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,010
But what if one in a hundred failed
catastrophically then is that an approach

757
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,378
that works, for example?

758
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,247
So if she never come up in some machine
learning context.

759
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,948
So that was kind of a cool

760
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:22,119
showing how the idea of the part
particular trajectory versus

761
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,322
the mean field
and how that plays out in the way that

762
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:29,059
our knowledge and application systems,
health care systems are constructed,

763
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,796
which is an initial modification
through us.

764
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,332
And then
so then the second one was like that

765
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:39,970
combination of appeal
to general frameworks universals

766
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,474
and the historical trajectory

767
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:47,411
of the whole horizon of life on Earth.

768
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:52,383
And of course our developmental
trajectory as psychological individuals.

769
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,586
So then it's like, well, that looks goal
oriented a lot.

770
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:58,022
I thought goal orientation
had to be purged.

771
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,824
Well,
I mean, the first easy answer is just

772
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:04,662
that was a period of disinformation
and that that stance is simply incorrect.

773
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:07,765
So that's one way to simplify the debate.

774
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,735
But then the other maybe longer answer,
you said

775
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,738
it's energy information fields,
not billiards.

776
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:20,678
So we don't appeal to anything
when we see diffusion and ink diffusing.

777
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:25,683
Now that's kind of slam dunk,
but are there diffusion processes

778
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:30,488
for metabolism
strategy, narrative communication.

779
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:35,960
So why don't we need anything more
to just allow those flows to also happen?

780
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,331
And so in academic, we talk a lot
about those types of models as well.

781
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,867
So certainly a lot of cool areas.

782
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,535
Nice first section.

783
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,069
Yeah, no.

784
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,871
OK, so the tree of knowledge is both

785
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:50,140
continuous so allows for full deflation
on the one hand

786
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:54,445
or reductive continuity
into energy information on the one hand.

787
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:58,482
And then if you look at it, it's
actually discontinuous dramatically so

788
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:02,653
in its funnels
so matter like mind and culture.

789
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,523
And so there's a profound
discontinuity as well.

790
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,892
And it is the process
by which if we really want to get

791
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:11,028
at this, it's the process
by understanding this very complicated

792
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:15,900
dynamic of continuity and discontinuity
and that the unified theory affords

793
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:19,303
a particular way
to understand the discontinuity of matter

794
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:24,808
out of energy, life, out of matter,
mind out of life and culture out of mind.

795
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:29,213
And so yeah,
but the real reason when I heard course,

796
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:32,016
you know, especially free energy stuff,

797
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,952
although I still am trying to wrap
my head around all the terminology,

798
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,087
I haven't devoted myself
to really uncovering it.

799
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:42,159
OK, but the tree of knowledge basically
is a depiction of neg entropic curvature.

800
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,963
OK, and then the question
is how does a system pull

801
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,933
how do the

802
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:52,836
tracking forms that actually function,
subtract forms and make predictions?

803
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:57,775
And it's got to create anticipatory
structures that both navigate

804
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:02,313
the dialectic of stability and plasticity
to pull free energy into the structure.

805
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,848
And I use that term more in a Aizen way.

806
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:09,553
He's a cosmic evolutionary biologist,
I mean cosmologist and talks

807
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:12,656
about the evolution of mega entropy
through a free energy principle.

808
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:18,262
And because I learned that first
and then I was I've been entangled some

809
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:22,466
with some of the confusion on at least
classic call, for instance, free energy.

810
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,301
But anyway, it's, it's very close.

811
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:25,269
I mean, I just I'm sure

812
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:29,406
it's just a technical set of terms
I need to download to be clear about.

813
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:30,841
Well,

814
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:35,479
we and many others,
including anyone who listens to this

815
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:40,250
are part of the sense making and we're
working on a participatory ontology.

816
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,285
There's a lot more to say.

817
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,253
But let me just
give one free energy answer

818
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:47,224
and then maybe let's dove
back to a presentation of yours. Yep.

819
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:51,795
So to return to this idea of energy
and information fields being primary,

820
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:53,530
not billiards.

821
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,368
So in a world where matter, energy is

822
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,205
heterogeneous easily distributed,
some as in stars, some as in interstellar

823
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:04,341
space or whatever systems
that resist dissipation,

824
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:08,679
what we use the blanket terminology
to discuss smart blanket systems

825
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,849
that reduce dissipation and have a non

826
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,785
death equilibrium stationary state.

827
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:18,889
Those systems are at least acting
as if they're trying,

828
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:23,594
which in complex symbolic ecosystems

829
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:27,665
means anticipatory predictive behavior

830
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:30,901
anticipatory predictive signaling.

831
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:35,139
And therefore it's helpful
to have a action loop

832
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:38,375
model perception,
cognition, action, niche impact.

833
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,578
It's helpful to have that type of model

834
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:45,382
which is in the pre active inference
work of Carl Forrest and others.

835
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:48,852
Also Central, the dynamical equations

836
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:52,122
and stochastic simulations
and things like that.

837
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,190
So there's a lot to say,

838
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,828
but that we all hope to be resolving
that uncertainty that comes up.

839
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:58,262
Great.

840
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:01,465
I'll pop in where I'm coming from
on this real first lecture screen.

841
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:02,900
Go to a different awesome.

842
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,703
There's a I think I need to go.

843
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:10,307
You're all alone one second
because I wanted to pull this up.

844
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,343
Ah, and

845
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:16,714
did I.

846
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,048
Maybe I'd closed it.

847
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:18,949
Oh well

848
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:21,485
yeah.

849
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:23,520
I'll take a second here. One second.

850
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,988
Let me just look at this.

851
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:25,422
Oh sure.

852
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:31,161
I ended up with here

853
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:43,607
OK, sure.

854
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,943
Reset your priors. Yeah,

855
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:52,082
well,
this is more complicated than normal.

856
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:53,751
Let me see if I got it right here.

857
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:57,454
OK, I go here and.

858
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:01,291
One other short
thought while you're OK, go for it.

859
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:10,100
And I'm going to close that down
one second.

860
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,368
I'm sorry. Oh, yeah. Take your time.

861
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:12,269
Just one other short.

862
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,706
Dark blue
do you want to do anything first?

863
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:18,742
OK, chin Bergen's questions.

864
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,546
So part of a pluralistic approach

865
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:26,383
towards understanding includes
mechanistic and historical answers.

866
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:31,388
And so the way that you situated this
in the sort of ecological critique

867
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:34,792
and the socio ecological critique,
the relativist

868
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,662
and not just like nihilist,
like relativist, things are relational.

869
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:41,498
It's interactions all the way down
rather than particles all the way down.

870
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,536
So that
and the dialectical tradition as well.

871
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:47,037
So many interesting threads.

872
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:50,340
So appreciate
how you concisely discuss that.

873
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:51,441
Great

874
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:53,110
yeah.

875
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,378
And I'm happy to pick that up.

876
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:57,481
Sorry for my clumsiness here,
but this is so here we go.

877
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:02,386
In terms of the basic structure
that you will recognize.

878
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,957
So here's the I came at this from
what's called perceptual control theory.

879
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:09,359
I don't know if, you know, not too many.

880
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:11,195
It's underdeveloped relative

881
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:15,032
to at least in my field, clinical psych
really don't pay any attention to it.

882
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:18,902
Well, William Powers
developed perceptual control theory.

883
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,572
It comes off the old cybernetic tradition
and archive.

884
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:25,042
And a lot of this will feel similar.

885
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:28,612
But anyway, behavioral investment theory
then evolves

886
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:31,849
in from a perceptual control
theory model,

887
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:35,819
which I see is very, very much in line
in essentially what you're doing here.

888
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,354
This is the basic schematic.

889
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,388
I don't get in.

890
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,390
I'm not well versed in mathematics.

891
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,459
My son's a math major
who teased me all the time.

892
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:45,762
I can't even goddamn read differential
equations, which is to my shame.

893
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,498
But whatever it is, part of my reality.

894
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:52,035
The bottom line is
here is the basic schematic, OK?

895
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:56,406
So you get salient control variables,
you get an input transduction function,

896
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,643
then you're going to create
a model perception that's going to create

897
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:03,714
a valence value in structure
that's an energizing action in return.

898
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:07,351
So this basic loop is the loop
that I've been operating off of.

899
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:11,755
And basically it's an active inference
control loop in, you know,

900
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:15,392
not without getting under the hood
of the neural computational specifics

901
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:20,397
about how things are set in terms of its
sensitivity, but you can follow this

902
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:23,233
at a more sort of psychologically

903
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,802
higher level of organization.

904
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:28,739
So that's what I just wanted to show
is that it's

905
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:32,476
the the ground to be able investment
theory is this perception

906
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:36,546
action calibrating loop structure
that functions.

907
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,882
And an example in perceptual control
there is you

908
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:42,953
create an image of an ideal egg
and then you run through a bunch

909
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:46,723
of subgoals in relationship
to reducing discrepancy towards that.

910
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,027
You're having emotional reactions
in relationship to whether or not you're

911
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:53,797
achieving the efficiency of those goals
in expected time frames.

912
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:57,100
As long as you're not getting surprised
and in the constraints

913
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,535
and moving in the right direction,

914
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:01,438
you're getting jolted with positive
affect and continue the investment.

915
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:05,108
If all of a sudden, you know, you break
the egg the wrong way, you overcook it,

916
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:06,743
there's no eggs in the fridge

917
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:10,681
that can interrupt the structure,
you get a negative activation of affect,

918
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:14,484
and then that reboots a possible
new behavior investment path.

919
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:18,121
So anyway, just in terms of sort
of the basic architecture of

920
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,791
that structure.

921
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,293
That's actually a perfect short

922
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:26,163
section. So thanks for making that clear.

923
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:28,498
Let's get the active loop up

924
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:32,202
so I'll mention two points of contact
with active

925
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:35,706
and the loop that you described
and then Bleu.

926
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:38,141
So the first one is that in fact in.
