00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:44,879
uh

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,239
i've seen a couple of other

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,920
presentations they're really fascinating

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,840
i look forward to

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,480
sharing some of my version of reality um

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,079
so let me give you a little bit of

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,440
orienting

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,039
coordinates for me um so i am professor

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,520
uh in the combined integrated clinical

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,000
and school doctoral program at james

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,159
madison university uh where i've been

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,000
since 2003

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,960
uh the role i function there is to train

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,560
individuals

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,799
to be psychological doctors is the term

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,960
we use uh the reason we use that is

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,119
because in psychology in the profession

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,759
side there are different practice areas

34
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,520
uh clinical

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,920
counseling and school are the dominant

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,320
practice areas but we want to transcend

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,840
those into a more

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,400
general combined integrated

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,600
perspective

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,320
that affords us a way to kind of get out

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,840
of some of the old

42
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,640
traditional institutional silos and

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,360
get a more general integrated picture so

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,720
i've been there since 2003

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,439
my journey in this is

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,320
i

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,479
went to undergrad got my major in

48
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,240
psychology and was just going to be a

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,479
behavioral scientist

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,320
that wanted to be a clinician

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,719
my sense was the right thing to do was

52
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,799
to apply the methods and findings of

53
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,119
science to the clinical world

54
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,759
i went off got my master's in clinical

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,080
and community psychology

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,480
in 1994.

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,160
and um

58
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,760
well why don't i go ahead and start the

59
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,360
presentation and then i'll walk you

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
through some of that history and then

61
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,040
we'll get to this scenario where

62
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,879
ultimately you get this weird cartoon of

63
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,040
a garden on behind me and

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,879
we'll get to there over a period and

65
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,400
then we'll start into

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,239
what we're actually dealing with let me

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,360
share my screen here

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,360
so

69
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,680
so we're talking about the ontology of

70
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
mental behavior um

71
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,360
and uh

72
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,360
just to kind of give it a context um

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,879
my basic point for defining this talk

74
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,760
is then to be in contrast to

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,519
the current mainstream approach in

76
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,599
academic psychology

77
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,280
the mainstream approach in academic

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,760
psychology is really best frame is what

79
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,840
i would call

80
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,239
methodological behaviorism

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,720
methodological behaviorism term by jay

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,599
moore

83
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,760
but all it means is basically what is

84
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,959
psychology in the academy right now is

85
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,640
that it applies the methods of

86
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,560
behavioral science

87
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,080
to a thing

88
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,879
very vaguely defined as behavior and

89
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,480
mental process

90
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,000
okay

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,360
and indeed the methods of science really

92
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,120
are what end up defining the term

93
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,360
behavior which is the you can see

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,840
from a science perspective okay

95
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,920
uh and then the mental processes are

96
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,599
sort of the stuff that's inferred that

97
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,120
give rise to

98
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,720
the change in behavior at least if

99
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
you're a mentalist or a cognitivist in

100
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,120
traditional psychology as opposed to say

101
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,760
a radical behaviorist okay so the

102
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,040
science of

103
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,439
psychology is really defined

104
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,760
by an institution that applies methods

105
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,920
of science methods of behavioral science

106
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,200
in particular

107
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,959
to analyze behavior and then develop

108
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,519
models of mental process that afford the

109
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,720
explanation

110
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
now the structure of it is broken at the

111
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,920
level of coherence and what i mean by

112
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,560
that is it doesn't there's no organizing

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,720
framework for psychology

114
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,600
uh psychology is not defined by and

115
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,160
never has been defined by a paradigm

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,400
meaning a full in a cuneian sense

117
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,120
paradigm meaning a full like newton

118
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
developed a paradigm for classical

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,040
mechanics that then established

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,680
psychology has had is a is a field that

121
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,520
had lots of different schools of thought

122
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,160
many paradigms that tried to manifest

123
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,240
itself as sort of the dominant paradigm

124
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,919
that didn't happen

125
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,000
um there were no dominant paradigms in

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,160
psychology uh it gave rise to what's

127
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,560
called the crisis in psychology that led

128
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,759
vygotsky specifies in 1927. so we're

129
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,800
talking now

130
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,680
over

131
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,000
uh almost 100 years ago in fact it was a

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,520
first identified in 1899 the crisis

133
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,680
um and psychology then just punts on the

134
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,199
issue it's like what do you what do you

135
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,960
mean by the what's the field subject

136
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,880
matter and the answer is well

137
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
different schools of thought we'll frame

138
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,039
that in different ways okay

139
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,880
the ontology of mental behavior is the

140
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,400
argument that actually we can do better

141
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,520
than that

142
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,680
um we don't have to define the field

143
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,479
based on epistemology i.e the methods of

144
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,120
science but we actually can

145
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
define the field based on a scientific

146
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,320
ontology that clarifies what is meant by

147
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,919
mental behavior

148
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,479
and in so doing it affords a coherent

149
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,759
solution to the problem of psychology so

150
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,680
the problem of psychology is the

151
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,479
inability of the field to cohere around

152
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,280
a

153
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
particular conception

154
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,759
of its subject matter

155
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,120
so that's the basic structure um i'm

156
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,800
like i said i'm at james madison

157
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,120
combined integrated so what's the basic

158
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,280
gist just to get a lay of the landscape

159
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,520
from where i'm coming from and i'm you

160
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,919
know i'm an odd bird

161
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,919
so we should be very clear that i i've

162
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,560
been doing a weird version of psychology

163
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,400
now for uh for a long time i started to

164
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,560
say this i entered into the field sort

165
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,319
of in a conventional sense i got trained

166
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,319
in the normal methods

167
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,560
of behavioral science and analysis of

168
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,039
variants and and all that good stuff and

169
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,479
it's like oh well clearly we want to

170
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,199
employ a standard empirical method to

171
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,080
delineate you know what the sort of the

172
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,880
truth is or the most accurate models um

173
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,960
and so uh but then i encountered this

174
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,919
thing called the problem of

175
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,520
psychotherapy

176
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
uh what's that we actually get into the

177
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,120
room with people

178
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,880
and that's that's a trick

179
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,800
um and then you're a real person in a

180
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,600
real situation in the idiosyncratic

181
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,039
processes by which you have to make

182
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,960
active inferences about what is

183
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,800
operating in the moment okay um means

184
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,280
that the generalized aggregate variable

185
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
analysis that the rest of the field does

186
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,880
like oh here's a problem it's called

187
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,520
major depressive disorder here's a

188
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,840
specified intervention called cognitive

189
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,720
therapy and now you're to imply this

190
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
cognitive therapy intervention with this

191
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,319
person um sorry but what i learned and i

192
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,919
didn't know it at the time but what i

193
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,319
learned was the level of abstraction at

194
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,560
the variable aggregate level

195
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,039
relative to the actual process by which

196
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,759
you engage in feedback in the room in a

197
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,000
participatory real relationship of

198
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,440
course i have language for this now that

199
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,800
i didn't have them but the bottom line

200
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,400
was god you know uh what i actually saw

201
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,919
in the field was that the best of the

202
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,319
best depending regardless of the school

203
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,000
of thought the best of the past did the

204
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,960
best

205
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,599
surprisingly enough and lousy players

206
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,520
from various all the different schools

207
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,000
did lousy and most people did average

208
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,840
and the schools of thought really don't

209
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,800
generate um systematic difference at

210
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,639
least the bona fide schools of thought

211
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,160
so essentially what you get in

212
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,400
psychotherapy is what's called the dodo

213
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,960
bird finding uh i'm president-elect of

214
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,720
the society for the exploration of

215
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,960
psychotherapy integration

216
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,280
which is a field that has long standing

217
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,120
questions in relationship to the

218
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,280
relationship between the schools of

219
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,560
thought um and uh and and i got then

220
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,759
introduced in 1994 this is

221
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,680
basically to the field through a

222
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,800
potentially integrated perspective

223
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,160
so

224
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,639
for me that was fascinating um it turns

225
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,319
out that my orientation is actually

226
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,400
what's called a big picture coherentist

227
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,240
orientation meaning that i actually want

228
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,080
to zoom way back

229
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
organize pieces in a particular way so

230
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,000
that i can create a coherent frame of

231
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,479
reference and then zoom back in with the

232
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,919
coherent frame of reference that's the

233
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,958
way my mind operates so i had zoomed out

234
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,719
and then realized there was actually no

235
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,039
coherence um at the level of

236
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,040
psychotherapy and people had known this

237
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,480
for a long time and then this whole

238
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
field that emerged in the mid 1980s this

239
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,279
was like you know 15 years 10 years down

240
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,040
the road from that emergent of that

241
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,519
field with the psychotherapy integration

242
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,120
problem

243
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,279
and then i was fascinated by it and i

244
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,480
did something that's actually no one's

245
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,120
ever done which is kind of interesting

246
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,440
um i looked at medicine and this is just

247
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,160
all intuitive i looked at medicine um

248
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,760
and i said you know

249
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,800
you don't have all these different

250
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,320
schools of thought in medicine it's not

251
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,920
like you have you know the the

252
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,160
cardiologists are not battling with the

253
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,720
endocrinologist um versus uh you know

254
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,440
the people that emphasize uh the gut you

255
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,120
know they all are like hey they're

256
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,600
different systems of you know biological

257
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
adaptation that function together in a

258
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,720
hole and think we have a thing called

259
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,399
human biology

260
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,399
human biology is the science that

261
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,600
organizes the various domains um

262
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,680
and that affords a descriptive

263
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,760
explanatory framework that then should

264
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,320
inform the practice of medicine so if we

265
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,959
jump up a level it seems reasonable to

266
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,040
me or it seemed intuitively reasonable

267
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,959
to me that there should be a human

268
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,760
science of human psychology that should

269
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,680
organize the descriptive explanatory

270
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,800
network of understanding okay

271
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,240
and then apply that to the field

272
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
all right so now notice what i had done

273
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,000
i got socialized into the empirical

274
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,760
methodological behavioral science

275
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,000
approach of psychology dropped into the

276
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,240
problem of psychotherapy backed up and

277
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,680
was like oh wait a minute what i really

278
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,600
need as a practitioner is i need a

279
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,800
holistic conception of human psychology

280
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,560
that if ford's clarity about what the

281
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,079
hell the field is actually talking about

282
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,760
sorry i'll probably drop an f-bomb here

283
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,240
or there if that's okay but anyway what

284
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,560
i basically realized

285
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,880
then here is i shifted perspective and i

286
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,279
said well what is psychology and then i

287
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,040
realized oh my god nobody knows what the

288
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,120
 psychology is

289
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,200
there's no word that everyone's got

290
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,480
different reference points for this

291
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,040
fundamental word okay and that's the

292
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,360
problem of psychology there's a dramatic

293
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,880
set of reference points um that and so i

294
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,519
then uh took a couple of left turns that

295
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,519
i can tell you about in 1996 and then a

296
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,399
big one in 1997 and all of a sudden i

297
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,880
actually developed a vision um not like

298
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,640
some transcendent vision although it has

299
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,920
these elements i developed a picture an

300
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,000
organizing picture really a new map of

301
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,839
big history as it were

302
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,240
that afforded me a new way to address

303
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,440
this problem of what psychology is okay

304
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,040
and that ultimately gives rise to a

305
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,600
clear ontology of the mental all right

306
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,680
we'll specify what i mean by that and

307
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,760
then by affording clarity about what the

308
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,160
scientific conception of the mental is i

309
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,519
could then uh organize my work and

310
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,360
return to the original problem and

311
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,240
develop a framework for psychotherapy uh

312
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,800
and so that's what the project is about

313
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,640
now my journey over this time period

314
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,480
basically is the first thing is hey

315
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
here's a problem and then i need this

316
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,000
and then i built this thing called the

317
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,600
tree of knowledge

318
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,519
system the tree of knowledge system is

319
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,519
this natural scientific ontology that

320
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,279
maps the world in a particular way that

321
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,880
affords a science

322
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,639
of a natural science view of what the

323
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,839
mental is

324
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,680
um i worked on that and said hey it

325
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,639
organizes the field um i did a you know

326
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,959
i can tell about my publication history

327
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,399
etc

328
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,079
and then ultimately that evolved in

329
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,839
what's called the unified theory of

330
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,040
psychology

331
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,720
the unified theory of psychology

332
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
specifies the tree of knowledge and then

333
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,120
a couple of other key ideas

334
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,279
that then provide a conceptual

335
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,680
architecture for assimilating and

336
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,440
integrating the schools of thought and

337
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,519
major empirical findings into a coherent

338
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,399
whole

339
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,079
i'll say again it provides a conceptual

340
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,000
architecture for assimilating and

341
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,839
integrating the schools of thought and

342
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,360
the major major schools of thought and

343
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,200
major empirical findings to afford a

344
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,360
coherent poll of the picture

345
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,959
and basically then

346
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,279
create a new unified theory of

347
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,519
psychology

348
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,760
i then shifted that i did that that

349
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,160
published that in 2011.

350
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,920
um i then returned to the original

351
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,480
problem um and from 2011 2016 or so

352
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,720
worked out then given this framework

353
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,160
what would a unified approach to

354
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,240
psychotherapy be

355
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,120
and i then delineated four key ideas

356
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,600
that could help organize the field and

357
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,519
generate a unified approach to

358
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,440
psychotherapy at least with individual

359
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
adults okay childs are different blah

360
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,360
blah blah i was honed in on sort of

361
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,120
standard individual psychotherapy

362
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,360
especially for neurotic adults which are

363
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,639
the vast majority of people come in for

364
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,519
psychotherapy or neurotic adults okay so

365
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,240
this forwards then a one-on-one a way to

366
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,320
organize the key insights and then and

367
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,800
so then you would have a unified theory

368
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,680
of psychology and a unified approach

369
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,880
okay

370
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,440
well then in 2016 as i was delineating

371
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,639
that i took another weird turn all right

372
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,480
um and there are a lot of reasons as to

373
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,600
why uh but um the short story is as i

374
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
was at a conference uh called

375
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,399
cultivating uh the globally sustainable

376
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,440
self

377
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,760
um about transformative education and

378
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,160
the massive global problems that we face

379
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,040
in relation um and it was in the context

380
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,639
of that conference

381
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,199
um i had created this model the unified

382
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,639
theory and unified approach it was

383
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,000
called a tua okay that's it just dropped

384
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,199
into the language you know how things

385
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,399
would get more and more efficient you

386
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,360
know it's ut and ua and you tattoo uh

387
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,720
somebody's like what the hell's your two

388
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,320
lines like how's this video blah blah

389
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,199
blah

390
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,360
so i'm at this conference and they're um

391
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,680
uh doing this talking fundamentally

392
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
about how to do this thing called

393
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,920
cultivate a globally sustainable self

394
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
meaning how do we transform our

395
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,720
education for children in the

396
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,800
world that we're in given all the crises

397
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,480
and challenges that we face what does

398
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,600
that actually look like it was

399
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,199
fascinating conference

400
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,639
and at the end of it there was a panel

401
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,199
discussion okay and panel discussion

402
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,639
actually got all the people they invited

403
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,160
there and they came up and they actually

404
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,079
all fumbled over the question as far as

405
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,440
i was concerned like they were brilliant

406
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,560
people they did this they couldn't

407
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,160
actually there was there's a summary

408
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,240
opportunity i left the conference and i

409
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,440
was walking away and i was talking to

410
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,399
somebody i was like you know what we

411
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,320
should do we should plant it to a seeds

412
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,399
and grow it to a trees

413
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,199
okay

414
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,279
um which sort of fell out of me as a

415
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,040
light bulb moment and then turned into

416
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,320
the thing behind me which is this garden

417
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,000
so all of a sudden i basically then

418
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,639
transformed this build this construction

419
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,160
that i had with all these different sort

420
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,000
of like a cathedral that got transformed

421
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,720
into a garden i actually then got called

422
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,440
into like spiritually artistically to

423
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,199
build this garden

424
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,600
so that now this knowledge system then

425
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
could be represented

426
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,000
symbolically in a garden and that's what

427
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,560
spine is a it's a it's a layered

428
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,399
knowledge system so like for example

429
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,880
well i'll just so that that's that's and

430
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
then you know i got pulled more into

431
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,800
that and then that shifted me further

432
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,440
and further into the orbit of weirdness

433
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,759
all right but anyway that's basically

434
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,079
what i realized fundamentally is why i

435
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,920
got pulled into this level of

436
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,600
abstraction um was something that i sort

437
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,240
of

438
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,920
got clear on as i've been writing my

439
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,839
current book

440
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,839
and that is a real understanding

441
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,600
fundamentally of what's going on here in

442
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,199
relationship to kind of our knowledge

443
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,160
system so we have a foundational problem

444
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,199
in our knowledge and what i call in this

445
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,240
foundational problem is called the

446
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,720
enlightenment gap what the hell is that

447
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,399
the enlightenment gap is the point that

448
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,320
when science emerged okay um in from

449
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,399
galileo and newton coming off of the

450
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,199
scholastics okay when we built physical

451
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,959
science and the epistemology and

452
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,880
ontology that emerged with physical

453
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,560
science um there was never a ability to

454
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,399
take what we learned from the physical

455
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,040
sciences and create a holistic synthetic

456
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,560
philosophy can't tried hegel tried etc

457
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,160
but what you basically get in the

458
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,880
enlightenment is a gap a failure to get

459
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,720
the proper relationships first on the

460
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,199
relationship between matter and mind

461
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,040
okay some base mind body problem what

462
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,079
the hell is that how do you actually

463
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,839
solve that and then the other thing that

464
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,680
emerges as a secondary

465
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,360
joint problem is what is actual

466
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,600
scientific knowledge relative to social

467
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,560
knowledge

468
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,440
okay

469
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,360
and this problem emerges we see in the

470
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,120
20th century with the emergence of the

471
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,040
philosophical post-modern critique of

472
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,639
modernity

473
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,199
which basically says hey modernity

474
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,160
made too many abstract pure reason

475
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,839
progress claims that they were actually

476
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,679
that you could find genuine truth that's

477
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,439
not contextualized in a socio-historical

478
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,119
justification context that's the

479
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,799
post-modern critique and actually you

480
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,640
can't really make knowledge claims that

481
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,959
are transcendent they're all imminently

482
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,199
contextualized in the socio-historical

483
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,119
context and lo and behold look at the

484
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,799
way the knowledge systems emerge they

485
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,199
get they privilege cis-gendered white

486
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,400
colonial men who go around and create oh

487
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,640
yes this is true reason and behold it's

488
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,240
actually it's normative for us and we

489
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,160
get to distribute our power structures

490
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,600
around the world and so you get a

491
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,360
philosophical and a social justice

492
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,120
post-modern critique about what science

493
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,880
is relative to social knowledge that

494
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,200
never actually gets resolved okay that's

495
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,760
why we have post-modern versus modern

496
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,840
onto epistemological debates about the

497
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,600
nature of knowledge and so the

498
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,440
enlightenment gap basically is a

499
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,799
description of the current state of

500
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,200
affairs where we have we're lacking a

501
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,760
philosophical framework that affords us

502
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,360
clarity about matter and mind on the one

503
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,440
hand and science and social knowledge on

504
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,640
the other

505
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,840
okay

506
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,320
so that's the gist of the location about

507
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,520
where we are

508
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,720
um

509
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,559
i built this thing called the unified

510
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,799
theory of knowledge okay

511
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,720
what is unified unified is taken

512
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,039
directly from the book consilience the

513
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,039
unity of knowledge e.o wilson wrote a

514
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,760
book called consilience in 1998 called

515
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,080
the consultancy unity of knowledge

516
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,360
that's what unified means it means

517
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
conciliating there's a consilient

518
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,919
coherent big picture view that actually

519
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,000
gets the pieces of the puzzle correct so

520
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,760
we can actually understand

521
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,799
knowing

522
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,280
okay and knowing how we know and knowing

523
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,640
what we mean when we know things

524
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,840
physically and what we know things

525
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,919
biologically what we actually mean

526
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,080
psychologically human psychologically

527
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,880
into the social sciences how we know

528
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,000
scientifically relative to how do we

529
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
know subjectively

530
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,000
what do we know about ethics etc there's

531
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,160
actually a coherent synthetic philosophy

532
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,400
that is available that frames these

533
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,280
problems that wasn't achievable before

534
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,400
um

535
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,760
and so here's the garden okay uh and

536
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,559
what it has here is this so for example

537
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,240
right here this little thing's called

538
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,400
the stepping stone what is that

539
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,799
s-t-e-p-p stands for the standard theory

540
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,280
of elementary particle physics and the

541
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,440
stepping stone then grounds you in

542
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,600
physics in a particular way then this

543
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,679
first branch is the tree of knowledge

544
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,080
system the base of which is the energy

545
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,559
information quantum field structures

546
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,720
that live underneath matter and go back

547
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,240
to big bang

548
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,320
and then each one of these is a layered

549
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
system of information processing called

550
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,480
life mind and culture

551
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,960
and it is that arrangement of energy

552
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
information gives rise to a classic

553
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,679
material field and then life emerges and

554
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,280
then mind and i'll explain what i mean

555
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,440
by mind here emerges at the animal

556
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,320
mental behavioral level and then culture

557
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,240
emerges so that we become go from

558
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,640
primates to people as we talk to each

559
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,919
other and build what are called systems

560
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,440
of justification

561
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
okay so that just gives you a flavor for

562
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,720
it there's other things that are going

563
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,240
on here that i won't necessarily get

564
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,720
into but it basically says there's

565
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,120
actually a knowledge system here

566
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,000
the left side is the unified theory you

567
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,679
can see actually there's a little u here

568
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,919
and a t and these four ideas make up

569
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,840
what's called the unified theory there's

570
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,000
a u and an a which stands for the

571
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,760
unified approach

572
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,000
okay this right here is a symbol of

573
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,280
mindfulness

574
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,960
on the right side of the branch is the

575
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,559
way in which we relate to people in

576
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,799
healthy psychological ways it's actually

577
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,720
called calm mo it's an integrative

578
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,799
approach to psychological mindfulness

579
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,880
it's the processes by which we can hold

580
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,039
each other in ourselves and deal with

581
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,799
difficult socio-emotional relations that

582
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,000
afford productive virtuous looping as

583
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,440
opposed to what often happens people as

584
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,120
they get trapped in negative cycles

585
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,880
attack each other and then get in

586
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,520
vicious destructive looping that's just

587
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,840
one example so the tree then has eight

588
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,760
key ideas four of which make up the

589
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,679
unified approach this is by the way the

590
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,520
tree of life the tree of knowledge is

591
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,600
the first branch tree of life has four

592
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,440
here four here and then as this symbol

593
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,280
in the middle which is actually called

594
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,720
the metaphysical empirical flower

595
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,480
metaphysical empirical flower creates a

596
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
dialectic between metaphysics and

597
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,440
empiricism and that was missing in the

598
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,520
structure of the enlightenment which we

599
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,039
need there's another thing down here

600
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,559
called the coin but i'll pause here just

601
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,120
so there's plenty of um structure there

602
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,640
let me make a few more comments and then

603
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,159
actually i'll pause after this so

604
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,360
ultimately what the unified theory does

605
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,440
is it affords a new opportunity to think

606
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,200
about the enlightenment gap and i are

607
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,240
you resolve it um and what it does is it

608
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,240
sets the stage for a unified theory of

609
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,600
psychology

610
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,039
and frames a unified approach to

611
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,960
psychotherapy okay

612
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,360
um so that's basically then we can get

613
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,640
into what does all this mean in

614
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,400
relationship to some of the deep theory

615
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,760
but i wanted to give folks an

616
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,840
opportunity for the basic gist of where

617
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,559
i'm coming from

618
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,720
thank you for the summary cool

619
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,200
work and symbolic images

620
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,360
so anyone watching live can definitely

621
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,280
write questions but that's a great place

622
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,520
to stop we got the personal

623
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,400
and the multi-level narrative

624
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,039
coming together with a little bit of a

625
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,960
challenge and a response

626
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,600
which we'll then learn more about so

627
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,520
maybe we can just go blue if you have

628
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,200
any comments otherwise we can go into

629
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,120
the next section

630
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,039
um i don't know if we want to go through

631
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,960
some of my questions now i mean i have

632
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,280
some that relate to the uni unifor

633
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,080
universal theory of knowledge um so if

634
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,000
we want to maybe pull up that slide or

635
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,159
if uh greg is still sharing slides we

636
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,679
don't have to

637
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,760
i cannot just read it off this slide so

638
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,280
the first perspective yeah and it's on

639
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,080
the screen as well so here's um uh one

640
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,600
just summary quote

641
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,919
first the the ut okay differentiates the

642
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,919
mental behavior of animals from the

643
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,679
behavior of other living creatures both

644
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,440
metaphysically and metatheoretically

645
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,760
which you mentioned and second

646
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,600
it differentiates the mental behavior of

647
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,678
human persons from the mental behavior

648
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,760
of other animals both metaphysically and

649
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
metatheoretically okay so

650
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,600
similar but a little bit different there

651
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,440
so what are the distinctions that are

652
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,360
critical for psychology

653
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,679
what distinctions does your work make

654
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,440
how do we know those are the right ones

655
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,200
how did you carve

656
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,480
ut okay

657
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,320
at the jigsaw joints

658
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,400
beautiful okay so yeah i love that

659
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,480
that's a wonderful set of questions and

660
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,080
right gets right to the heart of some of

661
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,039
the key issues okay so let's talk about

662
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,720
the so the the tree of knowledge divides

663
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,880
is a descriptive metaphysical system

664
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,559
that's a um

665
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,760
the picture is and it shows matter life

666
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,320
mind and culture okay so basically

667
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
coming off big bang so you start at

668
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,840
what's called an energy information

669
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,919
singularity all right that's how you go

670
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,640
back to big bang 13.8 billion years ago

671
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,120
et cetera you for you run the tape back

672
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,120
and everything collapses into

673
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,840
quote-unquote a point or a singularity

674
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,320
because this is just general cosmology

675
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,000
all right i'm getting to the question

676
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,120
but i just give this background okay so

677
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,880
according to modern cosmology the

678
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,720
universe essentially begins in a state

679
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
of pure energy information that's at

680
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,320
least what i refer to it as we can talk

681
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,559
about the term and then out of that

682
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,919
comes matter

683
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,960
okay uh and basically what you get is

684
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,880
you get all the four fundamental forces

685
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
in nature that's electromagnetism

686
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,919
gravitation strong weak

687
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:27,200
differentiating to create fields and

688
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,000
then you get a coalescence a cooling and

689
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,240
freezing and coalescence of energy into

690
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,520
chunks of matter in the form of

691
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,720
particles atoms up into them chemicals

692
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
in certain unique contexts and then

693
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,320
across scale that builds things like

694
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,039
stars and galaxies and mega galaxy

695
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,279
clusters okay

696
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,679
so this is then our physical universe

697
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,440
all right and notice what i've done and

698
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,720
the reason i had to say this is because

699
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,080
one of the first things we have to note

700
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,159
from classical mechanics is that modern

701
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,919
physicist physics teaches us that

702
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,520
there's a thing beneath

703
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,760
the classical material world called

704
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,080
quantum field theory and the energy

705
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,279
information singularity of big bang

706
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,960
the reason that's really important

707
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,919
because we have to understand the

708
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,559
fundamental substance ontology of the

709
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,200
world which is energy information fields

710
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,279
not billiard balls

711
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,600
okay so they were working in the initial

712
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,760
sort of ontology is billiard

713
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,760
and it's like no that's actually not the

714
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,240
ground of the universe ground of the

715
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,600
universe is sort of like an energy

716
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,080
information super force field theory all

717
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,000
right which by the way for mental

718
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,760
implica the implications to understand

719
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,480
the way mental structures work it's it's

720
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,559
important that some people like bernardo

721
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,240
castro drop it all the way around call

722
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,000
that big mind i don't agree with that

723
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,360
but fundamentally we do want to

724
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,120
understand that okay

725
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,200
then we come and we jump up

726
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,559
we don't know how this exactly happens

727
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,720
but about 4 or 3.8 billion years ago we

728
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,559
see the jump in

729
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,360
the world from chemicals complicated

730
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,279
chemical protein lipid structures that

731
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,919
someone get jumped together organized

732
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,600
and we get life

733
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,679
okay so the miracle of life

734
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,720
all right

735
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,799
so the miracle of life

736
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,360
then creates the jump from

737
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,039
quasi-organizing systems that then get

738
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,360
into fundamentally slooping into

739
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,320
self-organized

740
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,360
what

741
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,320
deacon

742
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,520
terence deacon calls an intentional

743
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,720
phenomena that operates across abstentia

744
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,200
okay so intentional phenomena meaning

745
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,880
that basically there is some

746
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,720
descriptively not explanatory but

747
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,559
descriptively these cells behave with a

748
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,080
goddamn purpose

749
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,000
they're doing okay

750
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,919
and it somehow is that they're imagining

751
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,840
that they are black and then they move

752
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,840
toward the lack like they're hungry and

753
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,559
they

754
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,080
and they don't want to die and they move

755
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,640
around okay incomplete nature is terence

756
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,440
deacon's analysis of this jump

757
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,720
well this is really important to

758
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,480
understand the emergence of complex

759
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,720
adaptive dynamic systems because that's

760
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
what life is it's a complex adaptive

761
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,240
dynamic system that has embedded in it

762
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,559
energy information systems that afford

763
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,799
the capacity to pull

764
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,240
i'll use a slightly different color

765
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,279
first and free energy from the uh

766
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,120
environment to do work to maintain its

767
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,720
complex organization so the survivor

768
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,320
reproduces

769
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,360
okay

770
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,960
and the reason i have to tell you all of

771
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,200
that is because the ground at what we

772
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,360
need to understand the bi dynamic

773
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,520
biological ground out of which then

774
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,240
minded animals are going to emerge

775
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,360
okay

776
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,760
so so that we get a natural selection

777
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,440
operating on genetic combinations and

778
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,120
what happens according to unified theory

779
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,880
is actually you get an orthogonal

780
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,120
dimension of activity orthogonal to the

781
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,440
real in some ways what do i mean by that

782
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,960
it's the subjective information

783
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,520
processing the epistemic information

784
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,120
processing of a cell

785
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,559
okay it's like the cell is actually

786
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,799
making judgments and quasi even

787
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,080
decisions as it engages in some kind of

788
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,480
primitive act of inference

789
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,360
okay

790
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
um and so then that becomes the ground

791
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,039
and then basically you get bacteria that

792
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,799
are doing that for a long time and other

793
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,960
kinds of animal kingdom i mean uh

794
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,200
you know algae and other kinds of

795
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,120
protists kind of kingdom stuff

796
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,360
and then you get multicellular plants

797
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,760
okay um that afford the opportunity for

798
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,480
what big historians call big life so you

799
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,360
get

800
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,039
cellular plants and you're also going to

801
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,320
get fungi

802
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,200
um mycologists study things like they do

803
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,799
really weird stuff uh fungi um and then

804
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,559
you get so you're gonna get these active

805
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:30,559
multicellular entities

806
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,799
that are still though fundamentally

807
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,880
organized and grounded

808
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,720
and change their environment through

809
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,640
their growth potentials

810
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,279
within the cell so even things like

811
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,120
mushrooms what mushrooms don't do is

812
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,039
they don't get up and walk around

813
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,120
all right um but what they do is they

814
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,960
send out growth signals into particular

815
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,159
things and then they grow in really

816
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,080
interesting ways but they are confined

817
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,760
by their boundaries

818
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,880
all right

819
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,399
but what happens in the

820
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,720
in the animal kingdom

821
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,200
as a shoot-off in relationship to this

822
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,520
so that this system now becomes as a

823
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,760
multi-organizing system becomes mobile

824
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,240
all right so 700 million years ago

825
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,640
you're going to get then a transition

826
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,919
into

827
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,720
basically jellyfish-like creatures okay

828
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,799
that have distributed neural networks

829
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,880
that have some degree of capacity for

830
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,960
coordinating their behavior

831
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,799
all right through the distributed neural

832
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:25,600
net

833
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,679
that's the first step towards a minded

834
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,000
animal it's not there yet okay

835
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,360
you then get bilateral planning with an

836
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,520
in an emerging integration between the

837
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,159
sensory motor structures okay like in a

838
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,760
planarial worm

839
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,520
now a planaria worm's got a centralized

840
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
controlled center okay that's then

841
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,440
distributing and it's got bilateral

842
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,960
movement to coordinate its movement in a

843
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,640
particular way now you're very close

844
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,919
with a planaria worm to what i would

845
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,600
call a minded animal

846
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,679
the final thing is that you then got the

847
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,600
cambrian explosion

848
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,039
550 520 million years ago and in this

849
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,760
short period of time basically you get a

850
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,440
much greater complexification of the

851
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,799
nervous system you get a centralized

852
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,799
nervous system and you get a complex

853
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,559
active body plan

854
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,399
that complex active body plan then

855
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,039
regulates a sensory motor looping

856
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,960
okay that affords the animal to get up

857
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,640
and move around

858
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,120
all right now that's a game changer it

859
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,279
moves the entire structure as a sensory

860
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,480
motor loop

861
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,760
okay and it is that division that joint

862
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,640
point

863
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,440
okay between life living organisms and

864
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,960
minded animals that the tree of

865
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,360
knowledge points to and says hey that

866
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,760
cambrian explosion thing is when minded

867
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
animals blew out of living

868
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,159
organisms there's a joint point thing

869
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,480
that's as important to understand in our

870
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
big picture as the joint point between

871
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,880
non-inanimate matter and matter

872
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,640
and it follows a very similar pattern

873
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,640
because what you see like with cells

874
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,720
what did you get you get an rna dna

875
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,960
information processing closure around a

876
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,039
lipid with protein generation that then

877
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,519
creates a communication network between

878
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,720
other cells

879
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,320
well the nervous system is very much

880
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,799
akin to the rna dna it's a centralized

881
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,039
control system and what it does is it

882
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,480
yokes all the cells together in a

883
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,640
coordinated way so the animal gets to

884
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,960
move as a whole unit

885
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,360
so the sensory motor looping of animal

886
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,600
movement then becomes a fundamental

887
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,279
another dimension of information

888
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,440
processing communication and we get

889
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
animal animal movement at working with

890
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,039
each other in a communication network

891
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,240
you get the base of the mind dimension

892
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,960
okay so in the unified theory that's and

893
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,159
you can and then it's defined

894
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,399
behaviorally and descriptively so it's

895
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,799
just a complex active bodies moving in

896
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,080
relationship to each other with

897
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,200
functional

898
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,480
outcomes

899
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,320
that's what it is so when you go and you

900
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,120
walk your dog your dog is exhibiting

901
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,200
this the insects are exhibiting this

902
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,399
okay

903
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,519
and it's it's called mindedness or mind

904
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,120
it's the functional animal the behavior

905
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,720
as a whole mediated by the nervous

906
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,960
system okay it produces a reliable

907
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,919
understandable effect the base of this

908
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,880
looping i see as basic you know

909
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,559
predictive processing active inference

910
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,960
essentially okay there's a fundamental

911
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,960
iterative process that is regulating

912
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,320
information energy in particular

913
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,399
structures that theory the meta

914
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,000
theoretical structure i bring to bear is

915
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,880
called behavioral investment theory

916
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,039
okay behavioral investment theory is a

917
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,279
meta perspective that takes together

918
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,440
what's called energy economics so you

919
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,399
have to solve the problem of uh entropy

920
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,720
and energy expenditure so first

921
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,399
principles energy economics second is

922
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,399
evolution the natural by natural

923
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,360
selection

924
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,720
and other any other things we have to

925
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,720
add to that but that's the general gist

926
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,080
the third principle is behavioral

927
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,399
genetics which means the genetic

928
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,240
the gene system is going to bias the

929
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,320
system in a particular way the fourth

930
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,279
principle is neuro-computational control

931
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,840
so neural computational control then the

932
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,519
processes by which we engage in neural

933
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,320
computational control then is analyzed

934
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,399
deeply by an active inference predictive

935
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,600
processing

936
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,519
the fifth principle is learning and of

937
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,360
course then that's how a system upgrades

938
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,039
in relationship to experience and the

939
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,399
sixth principle is life history

940
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,159
development meaning depending on where

941
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,240
the animal is in its life history is it

942
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,880
young is it adolescent is it late life

943
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,640
et cetera it's reproductive and survival

944
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
strategies are going to change based on

945
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,080
its life history development so those

946
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,360
are the six principles of behavioral

947
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,399
investment

948
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,240
and what they do then is they yoke

949
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,320
together neuroscience and evolutionary

950
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,039
theory and computational cognitive and

951
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,279
by the way behavioral science from the

952
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,039
vantage point of a radical behavioral

953
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,880
position like a skinner

954
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,720
this is actually i come through this

955
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,600
skinner by the way which is weird okay

956
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,000
so so skinner actually what skinner does

957
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,559
is he just sits on the outside he's he

958
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,480
basically said oh it's black box

959
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,720
it's physiology black box but what i

960
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,120
will track is i will track at a very

961
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,440
fine-grained analysis consequences the

962
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,960
animals doing something has got

963
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,799
consequences and it is the consequences

964
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,880
that pull the animal in its behavioral

965
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,720
investment and i can navigate the

966
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,080
consequences

967
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,760
as an instrument as an engineer he

968
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,200
thinks like an engineer he's not

969
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,559
thinking like a theorist he's really an

970
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,399
engineer you know you want to be a poet

971
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,039
okay but it basically fails as a poet

972
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,480
and he's like well what really but you

973
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,399
know really we can do a psychodynamic

974
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,918
interpretation what happens to him but

975
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,599
actually then he starts just focusing on

976
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,800
how to control the consequences to pull

977
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,040
investment from an animal and so that's

978
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,960
an exterior behavioral position and

979
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,399
that's radical behaviorism which by the

980
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,280
way is totally different than

981
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,040
mythological behavior and it's a very

982
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,639
you know five percent psychologists go

983
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,719
this week applied behavior analysis but

984
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,480
it's really key because we want to be

985
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,320
able to bring the fact of the matter is

986
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,560
the dynamic control consequential system

987
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,879
from the outs behavioral outside is

988
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,480
going to connect to the after active

989
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,079
inference so somebody asks there's

990
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,679
questions like hey can we connect

991
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,879
enactment and an activism and

992
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:45,599
representationalism with a behavioral

993
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,918
selection structure yeah yeah you

994
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,639
can okay so anyway that's behavioral

995
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,000
investment theory and what that does is

996
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,760
it takes you from basic the cambrian

997
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,918
explosion and crabs all the way up

998
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,599
although everything's changing but you

999
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,599
can go all the way up to primates

1000
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,119
following this line and that's the

1001
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,200
dimension of mindedness we can talk

1002
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,320
about the stack but behavioral

1003
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,119
investment theory tracks that stacking

1004
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,599
the evolution of mind brain behavior in

1005
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,920
the animal kingdom it's called mind as a

1006
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,760
capital m as really an introduction of a

1007
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,200
particular term and that's the first

1008
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,599
joint point and so what the descriptive

1009
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,520
metaphysics and ontology is oh here's

1010
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
the set of mental behavior the meta

1011
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,359
theory's behavioral investment theory

1012
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,000
okay and that goes then from organisms

1013
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,800
into animal mental behavior and it's a

1014
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,880
joint point that people fail to see too

1015
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,040
often so i'll stop there and say this is

1016
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,440
then the ground of mental behavior is

1017
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,800
we've set up and then we'll go all the

1018
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,000
way up through the animal kingdom and

1019
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,960
then we'll jump into the human primate

1020
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,440
to become a person and what that does

1021
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,640
and then finally we actually got to come

1022
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,560
back and actually talk about the psyche

1023
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,839
but that's a whole nother the whole

1024
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:48,960
another step

1025
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,920
so so just to clarify here like you're

1026
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,560
you're presenting two things as central

1027
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,119
and kind of required for mind with the

1028
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,480
capital m

1029
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,440
and those are mobility and a central

1030
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
nervous system is that correct

1031
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,119
right it's really it's a complex active

1032
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,560
body um

1033
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,640
with a central nervous system that ties

1034
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,480
up a motor system in a sensory system

1035
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,040
together there's interesting an analysis

1036
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,800
of evolution about how you get a sensory

1037
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,079
system and a motor system how do they

1038
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,760
actually evolve when they come together

1039
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
so it's when you have an exemplar of a

1040
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,560
minded animal is a complex centralized

1041
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,640
nervous system sent active body that

1042
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,760
produces a functional effect on the

1043
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,359
animal environment relation

1044
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,440
well so how do you rectify

1045
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,119
like things like people who are

1046
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,119
paralyzed are they then mindless because

1047
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,640
they're not mobile

1048
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,320
oh of course not so then we need we'll

1049
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,320
dialogue exactly so so now we're gonna

1050
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,440
then dialogue about the different

1051
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,560
domains of mind okay so ultimately we'll

1052
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,640
take somebody like you know um stephen

1053
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,200
hawking okay so seaman hawking had an

1054
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,880
entire shell of existence right i put

1055
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,040
through the mediation of the sensory

1056
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,359
motor control system on the behavioral

1057
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,839
exam to lou gehrig's disease unplugs

1058
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:58,560
that

1059
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,480
you know what a nightmare right and then

1060
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,400
you get what he then experiences what's

1061
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,280
called mind he still has in my language

1062
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,520
we can get to it mind one

1063
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,960
is inside the organism the

1064
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,640
neurocomputational layering and the

1065
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,160
modeling inside the organism is called

1066
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,359
mind one and that's the neural

1067
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,880
computational structure okay if you mind

1068
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,640
one a is the inside mind one b is the

1069
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,680
mediated by the sensory motor looping

1070
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,560
okay

1071
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,280
so

1072
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,200
definitely you then the entire

1073
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,800
definition in the large scale of what

1074
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,560
the exemplar is is the sensory motor

1075
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,800
loop but obviously then what happens is

1076
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,880
what's called mind1a is the

1077
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,800
neurocognitive infrastructure within the

1078
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,400
nervous system

1079
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,200
okay versus mind1b which is the actual

1080
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,839
observable from the exterior mediated by

1081
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,240
the muscle movements so what happens is

1082
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,520
with people that would get this is

1083
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,520
mind1b gets x

1084
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,599
okay but mind one a the architecture's

1085
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,280
still there now if we now jump up to

1086
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,599
humans they have what's called mind two

1087
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,599
like other primates and i will we can

1088
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,680
argue how far it goes mind two is called

1089
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,000
subjective conscious experience of being

1090
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,280
this first for the hard problem of

1091
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,880
consciousness the first person

1092
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,680
experience of being mind one gives rise

1093
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,760
to then we can dialogue about this mind

1094
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,560
two mind two is available from the

1095
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,359
inside subject of conscious experience

1096
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,359
and then mind three is the justifying

1097
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,880
mind which other animals don't have but

1098
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,960
humans do okay

1099
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,560
and then we created informational

1100
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,480
interface with stephen hawking so that

1101
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,040
he kept after his entire system got shut

1102
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,200
down instead of locking him in we were

1103
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
able to create a verbal interface so we

1104
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,800
can maintain contact with his brilliant

1105
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
mind and he could tell us about

1106
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,079
actually i don't think the information

1107
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,520
is lost in black holes and i can

1108
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,920
actually even do the analysis of it

1109
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,880
okay but if we didn't have that

1110
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,800
interface he would have been lost but we

1111
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,079
would have known that yes he would have

1112
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,200
had mind one a the inside inferential

1113
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
architecture mine two the first person

1114
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,280
experience of being and mine three a

1115
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,440
which is the internal narrator but he

1116
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,119
would have lost mine 3b which is what

1117
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,400
i'm doing right now talking to you

1118
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,320
publicly but thankfully we maintained

1119
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
his information interface and uh

1120
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,079
maintain contact with his great mind

1121
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,240
thank you greg so

1122
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,320
um i just wanted to kind of

1123
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,640
recap two points and just maybe show a

1124
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,640
little point of contact with what you

1125
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,480
mentioned in some of the big themes in

1126
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,119
active inference so first you mentioned

1127
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,880
how there was

1128
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,880
these abstractions and mean field

1129
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,920
approximations in the clinical field and

1130
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,119
so that

1131
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,640
didn't that was like speaking to a

1132
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,480
disconnect between theory

1133
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,640
and application and practice

1134
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
and making impact on the systems that

1135
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,200
people care about and then also to the

1136
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,079
more deeper physical question about mean

1137
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,079
field approximations and whether you can

1138
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,160
study like the trajectory of one

1139
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,839
particle versus just take the time

1140
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,760
average the space average we're not

1141
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,680
going to go into the whole ergodicity

1142
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,400
non-equilibrium steady state definition

1143
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,000
but those are key terms for active

1144
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,839
inference so they come into play with

1145
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,480
that difference like i i'm i am i don't

1146
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,119
have mastery around the on the active

1147
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,240
inference meaning of a lot of those

1148
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,760
terms so i need to get i need to be

1149
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,680
brought up to speed on some of that but

1150
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,520
it's exactly that if someone says well

1151
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,280
you know the machine

1152
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,000
in the mean field it works but what if

1153
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,160
one in 100 fail catastrophically then is

1154
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,240
that an approach that works for example

1155
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,359
so we've seen that come up in some

1156
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,560
machine learning context so that was

1157
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,119
kind of a cool um showing how the idea

1158
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,680
of the part particular trajectory

1159
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,000
versus the mean field and how that plays

1160
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,560
out in the way that our knowledge and

1161
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,160
application systems health care systems

1162
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
are constructed which is a niche

1163
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,400
modification through us

1164
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,599
and then um

1165
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,599
so then the second one was like that

1166
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,160
combination of appeal to general

1167
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,280
frameworks universals

1168
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,319
and the historical trajectory of the

1169
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,599
whole

1170
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,200
horizon of life on earth and of course

1171
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,960
our developmental trajectory as

1172
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,359
psychological individuals so then it's

1173
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,520
like well that looks goal-oriented a lot

1174
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,599
i thought goal orientation had to be

1175
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,440
purged well i mean the first easy answer

1176
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,119
is just that was a period of

1177
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,280
disinformation and that

1178
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,200
that stance is simply incorrect so

1179
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,000
that's one way to simplify the debate

1180
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,200
but then

1181
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,319
the other maybe longer answer you said

1182
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,160
it's energy information fields not

1183
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,440
billiards

1184
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,480
so we don't appeal to anything when we

1185
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,680
see diffusion and ink diffusing now

1186
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,560
that's kind of slam dunk but are there

1187
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,480
diffusion processes for

1188
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,160
metabolism

1189
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,760
strategy narrative communication so why

1190
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,599
don't we need anything more to just

1191
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,400
allow those flows to also happen and so

1192
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,560
in active we talk a lot about

1193
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,800
those types of models as well

1194
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,520
so it's totally a lot of cool areas nice

1195
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,680
yup first section yeah no okay so and

1196
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,440
the tree of knowledge is both continuous

1197
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,599
so it allows for full deflation on the

1198
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,640
one hand

1199
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,200
or reductive continuity uh into energy

1200
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,280
information on the one hand and then if

1201
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,560
you look at it it's actually

1202
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,280
discontinuous dramatically so in its

1203
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,240
funnels

1204
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,119
so

1205
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,280
matter like mind and culture and so

1206
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,599
there's a profound discontinuity as well

1207
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,359
and it is the process by if we really

1208
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,119
want to get at this it's the process by

1209
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,359
understanding this very complicated

1210
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,599
dynamic of continuity and discontinuity

1211
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,240
and the the unified theory affords a

1212
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,160
particular way to understand the

1213
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,160
discontinuity of matter out of energy

1214
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,599
life out of matter

1215
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,400
mind out of life and culture uh out of

1216
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,920
mind um and so yeah but but the the

1217
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,760
reason when i heard carl you know

1218
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,000
especially free energy stuff

1219
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,359
although i still am trying to wrap my

1220
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,040
head around all the terminology and i

1221
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,160
haven't devoted myself to really

1222
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,119
uncovering it okay but the the tree of

1223
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,560
knowledge basically is a depiction of

1224
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,760
negan tropic curvature okay uh and then

1225
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,319
the question is how does a system pull

1226
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,200
uh

1227
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,119
how to via

1228
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,359
tracking forms it actually functions to

1229
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,880
track forms and make predictions and

1230
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,800
it's got to create anticipatory

1231
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,280
structures that both

1232
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,040
navigate the dialectic of stability and

1233
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,760
plasticity to pull free energy into the

1234
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,680
structure and i use that term more in an

1235
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,520
eric liaison way he's a cosmic

1236
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,680
evolutionary biologist i mean a

1237
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,960
cosmologist

1238
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,480
and talks about the evolution of mega

1239
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,960
entropy through a free energy principle

1240
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,760
um and because i learned that first and

1241
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,319
then i was i've been entangled some with

1242
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,000
some of the confusion on at least

1243
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,640
classic uh call fristens free energy but

1244
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,560
anyway it's it's very close i mean i

1245
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,720
just i'm sure it's just a technical uh

1246
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,800
set of terms i need to download to be

1247
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,000
clear about

1248
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,760
well

1249
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,640
we and many others including anyone who

1250
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,720
listens to this are part of the sense

1251
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,800
making and we're working on a

1252
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,720
participatory ontology there's a lot

1253
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,240
more to say but let me just give one

1254
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,920
free energy answer and then maybe let's

1255
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,359
dive back to a

1256
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:46,960
presentation of yours

1257
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,920
yep so

1258
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,160
um to return to this idea of energy and

1259
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,319
information fields being primary not

1260
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,599
billiards

1261
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,599
so in a world where matter energy is

1262
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,200
heterogeneously distributed some is in

1263
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,520
stars some is in interstellar space or

1264
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,640
whatever

1265
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,960
systems that resist dissipation

1266
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,880
what we use the blanket terminology to

1267
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,800
discuss markov blanket systems that

1268
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,400
reduce dissipation

1269
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,599
and have a non-death equilibrium

1270
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,440
stationary state

1271
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,160
those systems are at least acting as if

1272
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,359
they're trying

1273
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,560
which in

1274
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,720
complex symbolic

1275
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,240
ecosystems

1276
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,119
means anticipatory predictive

1277
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,400
behavior

1278
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,960
anticipatory predictive signaling

1279
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,319
and therefore it's helpful to have a

1280
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,880
action loop model perception cognition

1281
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,359
action niche impact

1282
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,680
it's helpful to have that type of model

1283
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,720
which is

1284
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,640
in the pre-active inference work of karl

1285
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,040
frist and others also central the

1286
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,480
dynamical equations and stochastic

1287
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,400
um simulations and things like that so

1288
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,720
there's a lot to say but that we all

1289
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,400
hope to be resolving that uncertainty in

1290
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,000
the country

1291
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,440
great i'll pop into where i'm coming

1292
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,960
from and this real fast i'll share

1293
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,440
screen go to different awesome there's a

1294
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,240
um i think i need to go

1295
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,200
here hold on one second uh because i

1296
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,880
wanted to pull this up

1297
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,560
all right

1298
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,799
and

1299
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,720
did i

1300
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,880
maybe i closed it oh well um

1301
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,760
yeah

1302
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,599
i'll take a second here one second let

1303
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,359
me just look at this i thought for sure

1304
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,759
i headed up

1305
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,599
reset your priors

1306
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,839
yep

1307
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:50,720
this is

1308
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,480
more complicated than normal let me see

1309
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,960
if i got it right here okay

1310
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,960
if i go here

1311
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,319
and then

1312
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,000
one other short thought while you're oh

1313
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,280
unless you have okay go for it

1314
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,760
i'm gonna just close that down one

1315
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,359
second i'm sorry oh yeah take your time

1316
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,880
just one other short thought blue do you

1317
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,680
want to say anything first

1318
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,599
okay um tim bergens questions

1319
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,480
so

1320
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,960
part of a pluralistic approach towards

1321
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,200
understanding includes mechanistic and

1322
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,680
historical answers and so the way that

1323
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,079
you situated this in the sort of

1324
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,880
ecological critique and the

1325
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,119
socio-ecological critique the relativist

1326
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,720
and not just like nihilist like

1327
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,960
relativist things are relational its

1328
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,240
interactions all the way down rather

1329
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,880
than particles all the way down so

1330
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,119
that and the dialectical tradition as

1331
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,440
well so many interesting threads so

1332
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,680
appreciate how you concisely

1333
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,200
discuss that

1334
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,240
great

1335
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,319
um yeah and i'm happy to pick that up

1336
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,560
sorry for my clumsiness here but this is

1337
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,119
so here we go in terms of the

1338
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,599
basic structure uh that you will

1339
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,560
recognize um so here's the i came at

1340
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,920
this for what's called perceptual

1341
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,640
control theory i don't know if you know

1342
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,800
not too many it's underdeveloped

1343
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,040
relative to um at least in my fields

1344
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,400
clinical psych really doesn't pay any

1345
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,200
attention to it well william wt powers

1346
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,200
develop perceptual control theory it

1347
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,119
comes off the old cybernetic tradition

1348
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,640
okay

1349
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,640
and all a lot of this will feel uh

1350
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,720
similar but anyway behavioral investment

1351
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,559
theory then evolves in from a perceptual

1352
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,280
control theory model which i see is very

1353
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,880
very much in line and essentially what

1354
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,720
you're doing here this is the basic

1355
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,280
schematic i don't get in i'm not well

1356
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,200
versed in mathematics my son's a math

1357
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,640
major he teases me all the time i can't

1358
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,079
even god damn you have differential

1359
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,160
equations which is to my shame but

1360
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,559
whatever it is part of my reality um the

1361
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,720
bottom line is is here's the basic

1362
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,440
schematic okay so you get saline control

1363
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,920
variables you get an input transduction

1364
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,680
function and you're going to create a

1365
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,599
model perception that's going to create

1366
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,920
a valence valuing structure that's an

1367
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,240
energizing action in return

1368
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,240
so this basic loop is the loop that i've

1369
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,079
been operating off of and basically it's

1370
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,880
an active inference uh control loop uh

1371
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,960
in you know not without getting under

1372
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,720
the hood of the neural computational

1373
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,880
specifics about how things are set in

1374
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,359
terms of its sensitivity um but you can

1375
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,000
follow this uh at a more sort of

1376
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,599
psychologically

1377
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,400
higher level of organization um so

1378
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,680
that's what i just wanted to show is

1379
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,720
that it's

1380
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,640
the the ground of behavioral investment

1381
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,440
theory is this perception action

1382
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,920
calibrating loop structure that

1383
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,079
functions and an example in perceptual

1384
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,319
control theory is you create an image of

1385
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,640
an ideal egg and then you run through a

1386
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,800
bunch of sub goals in relationship to

1387
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,040
reducing discrepancy towards that you

1388
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,559
having emotional reactions in

1389
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,079
relationship to whether or not you're

1390
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,400
achieving the efficiency of those goals

1391
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,480
in expected time frames as long as

1392
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,400
you're not getting surprised and in the

1393
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,920
constraints and moving in the right

1394
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,359
direction you're getting jolted with

1395
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:00,880
positive affect and continuing the

1396
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,119
investment if all of a sudden you know

1397
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,480
you break the egg the wrong way you

1398
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,160
overcook it there's no eggs in the

1399
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,839
fridge they can interrupt the structure

1400
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,720
you get

1401
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,880
negative activation of affect and then

1402
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,760
that

1403
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,599
reboots a possible new behavioral

1404
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,920
investment path um so anyway just in

1405
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,839
terms of sort of the basic architecture

1406
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:21,119
of uh that structure

1407
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,319
that's actually a perfect short

1408
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,160
section so thanks for making that clear

1409
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,480
let's get the active loop up

1410
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,440
so

1411
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,680
mention uh two points of contact with

1412
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,520
active and the loop that you described

1413
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,040
and then blue

1414
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,559
um so the first one is that in active

1415
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,480
the preferences are over sensory

1416
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,760
outcomes

1417
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,359
so that's very much and i don't know

1418
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,839
which um if we had a unified knowledge

1419
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,319
management system theory of knowledge

1420
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,559
then we could search through which

1421
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,240
discussions we discussed it but

1422
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,720
perceptual control theory did come up

1423
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,480
because preferences are over sensory

1424
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,480
outcomes so they're not over hidden

1425
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,920
states of the world which are inferred

1426
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,400
using latent bayesian

1427
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,559
models but preferences are over sensory

1428
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:06,480
outcomes so that relates very well to

1429
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,760
the embodied

1430
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,640
approach

1431
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,119
and then another just key point of

1432
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,280
contact which um in the bayesian space

1433
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,520
it might not feel like this is a major

1434
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,440
thing but relative to the development of

1435
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,160
ideas it is and that's related to

1436
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,880
the experience is perception

1437
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,880
and the experience of perception is

1438
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,599
generative so like a neil seth's being

1439
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,160
you new book summarizing it as well as

1440
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,400
many other approaches like we're

1441
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,280
experiencing the generative half

1442
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,319
not the sensory incoming half which is

1443
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:39,440
the total

1444
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,200
signal processing

1445
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,160
info out there model of the world

1446
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,599
yep

1447
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,240
name in yeah that's that's all part of

1448
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,520
so i have uh

1449
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,280
um in terms of my own

1450
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,559
i've

1451
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,079
now comple i don't know if you guys know

1452
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,599
john vervicky's work i don't know if his

1453
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,680
work has come up at all uh so me and

1454
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,599
john have completely unsynced up we

1455
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,760
found each other 18 months ago or

1456
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,920
whatever and he built um you know

1457
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,359
cognitive science and philosophy he

1458
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,800
built what's called recursive relevance

1459
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,280
realization as a core

1460
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,800
structure that builds right into

1461
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,880
predictive processing you know and then

1462
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,680
the uh what level that like you then

1463
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,680
that becomes really refined in terms of

1464
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,079
the difference and i certainly get john

1465
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,680
here if he's got time he's really busy

1466
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,520
but the bottom line is that that john's

1467
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,440
recursive relevance realization model

1468
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,280
meta theory of cognition and his

1469
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,280
taxonomy of knowing in the 40s got four

1470
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,040
peers of knowing are now completely

1471
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,760
synced up with the unified you talk okay

1472
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,760
we did three different

1473
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,400
video series one on consciousness one on

1474
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,280
the self and one on human transformation

1475
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,920
the last with uh zach stein who's a

1476
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,079
developmental metapsychologist

1477
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,720
educational metapsychologist on expert

1478
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,119
transformation so anyway these systems

1479
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,680
now are affording all sorts of

1480
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,720
productive interplay um in relation so

1481
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,319
they now and it's a hand in glove

1482
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,599
relation i mean he comes out of

1483
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,359
cognitive science and activism and

1484
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:02,839
philosophy i'm coming out of

1485
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:04,720
psychotherapy and

1486
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,319
clinical psychology into the science of

1487
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:08,160
psychology and really from a behavioral

1488
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,760
and evolutionary perspective as i got

1489
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,960
dropped in

1490
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,200
neo behaviorals and really it's where my

1491
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,319
training is

1492
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:15,440
roots

1493
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,520
so anyway then you get so you get an

1494
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,079
activism there you know and his stuff

1495
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,079
connects so it's a real there's a real

1496
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,760
matrix of connection that's actually

1497
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,160
operating

1498
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,920
blue

1499
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,880
nice that's like a perfect flow into um

1500
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,880
the question that i had related to both

1501
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,680
active inference and in activism

1502
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,640
so one of the like fundamental things

1503
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,280
that active inference does it kind of

1504
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,720
um unifies this inactive embodied

1505
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,599
approach as well as representationalist

1506
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,359
approaches like where

1507
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,280
you know there's mental mental

1508
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,880
representation centered around mental

1509
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,520
representation um through this like

1510
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,359
action perception

1511
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,520
loop which is essentially behavior i

1512
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,680
mean in some way

1513
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,599
and so i just was wondering what has

1514
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,760
active inference been fitted to like

1515
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,240
this unification of mentalist and

1516
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,960
structuralist and behaviorist approaches

1517
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,760
or

1518
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,800
do you think that that would be an

1519
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,559
appropriate way to leverage active

1520
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,559
inference or how else could it maybe be

1521
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,400
used in your work

1522
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,079
well yeah no that's exactly um so i

1523
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,559
i totally see that i totally see it as

1524
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,400
you know the representational and an

1525
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,240
activism in fact john and i i'm fine

1526
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,559
with representation john likes modeling

1527
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,400
as a better term rather than than

1528
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,559
representation a little uh

1529
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:35,839
he wonders a little bit about some of

1530
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,200
the history of that term you know it's

1531
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,119
got it's one of the classic terms that

1532
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,200
means all these different things but at

1533
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,640
a generic level i'm totally fine with

1534
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,640
term representation uh and indeed i'm

1535
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,319
sort of a neo behavior is coming off an

1536
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,800
old cognitive simplistic cybernetic

1537
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,079
model which is basically all

1538
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,760
representation you've got a mentalist

1539
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,680
model of representation and then you're

1540
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,680
mapping the world cognitive maps from

1541
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,079
you know uh tolman all the way back to

1542
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,880
that so for me that bridging is very

1543
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,359
clear and necessary and brilliant and

1544
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,599
beautiful that an act of inference does

1545
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,760
um and it's just one of the network

1546
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,280
possibilities of different kinds of

1547
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,480
schools of thought

1548
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,440
okay

1549
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,200
that are afforded and the unified theory

1550
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,640
basically what i focus on essentially is

1551
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,119
the class of cognitive approaches weakly

1552
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:21,680
defined and then really that the thorn

1553
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,520
in my side was skinner i was like hello

1554
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,839
he gets skinner over here okay and at

1555
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,000
first i just axed him i was like he and

1556
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,640
you know he totally negates the agent

1557
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,160
and information processing from the

1558
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,040
within in a totally unacceptable way and

1559
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,640
therefore his philosophy of ryan is

1560
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,480
wrong after all trump's killed him

1561
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,799
anyway um so that was my justification

1562
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,160
then i actually learned what skinner was

1563
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,760
trying to do i agree with everything i

1564
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,440
just said by the way but it was also the

1565
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,200
case that's that skinner was also on to

1566
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,319
an angle

1567
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,960
um that red that ultimately sits in

1568
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,640
psychology as the fundamental mental

1569
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,720
behavioral kind of schism

1570
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,400
and ultimately the articulation of

1571
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,040
mental behavior as the ontology of

1572
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,119
mental behavior

1573
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,200
is the way in which you conceptually

1574
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,400
resolve the underlying disputes in that

1575
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,119
structure all right so my basic point is

1576
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,000
yeah 100 we can actually weave all of

1577
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,559
these schools together now and afford a

1578
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:17,040
link a sinking a synergistic linking

1579
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,119
with coherence that was never afforded

1580
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,200
before and obviously active inference

1581
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,799
doing that with representationalism and

1582
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,559
activism is great it's a piece of the

1583
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,319
puzzle we can now sync that now that i'm

1584
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,160
synced in with john this thing all loops

1585
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,079
back around i'm telling you this thing's

1586
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,880
about ready to blow

1587
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,040
we have too many people in uh the active

1588
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,119
inference field that are also modelers

1589
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:38,119
so

1590
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:40,480
representationalism is a useful term as

1591
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,040
opposed to to modeling because it's uh

1592
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,200
you know it's modeling is like what i do

1593
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,359
to

1594
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,599
of representation or i don't have a

1595
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:50,400
problem

1596
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,319
i live in my representations and my

1597
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,920
models and they hang out fine together

1598
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,440
a lot of

1599
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,079
a lot of things i wrote down just wanted

1600
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,400
to give one point of difference between

1601
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,160
the perceptual control theory and active

1602
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,920
inference and maybe some of these other

1603
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,119
approaches because i understand that

1604
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,960
those are commonly used or at least

1605
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,440
known so if someone came to the

1606
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,920
you know department of xyz and said you

1607
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,280
all know perceptual control theory

1608
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,319
perhaps

1609
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:19,119
so

1610
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:21,280
um missing in that loop

1611
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,880
was the whole

1612
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,520
machine learning type work of policy

1613
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,599
selection it just went from basically

1614
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,160
like this to inference and then emotion

1615
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,079
but it's not just about

1616
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,520
how you felt when you looked in the

1617
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,280
fridge it's about the multi-joint mostly

1618
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,559
sub-personal sub-experiential components

1619
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,799
and that's what actually provides the

1620
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,280
kind of broad shoulder that connects

1621
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,839
cognition across life and maybe even

1622
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,119
non-life

1623
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,680
is um gives a continuity

1624
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,079
to grounded in reduction of uncertainty

1625
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,640
conditioned on policy which is what

1626
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,200
active formalisms are about

1627
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,760
and there's a lot of awesome diagrams

1628
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,559
and pros

1629
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,480
and theory that's built up in the

1630
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,200
qualitative fields and now we have new

1631
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,440
tools and new approaches

1632
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,839
love it

1633
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,520
um

1634
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,119
there's some questions in the chat or

1635
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,880
you can perhaps present any more slides

1636
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,559
well i'll at least just tell the rest of

1637
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,960
the story in terms of what uh

1638
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,520
what we're so now we've gotten to minded

1639
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,359
animals okay complex active bodies

1640
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,880
running around after the cambrian

1641
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,359
explosion um and they're engaged in the

1642
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:35,119
sensory motor looping battling with each

1643
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,760
other for territory control etc okay

1644
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,680
then we can i'll be happy to stack that

1645
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,319
i basically say that we started off in

1646
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,000
the planaria where these reactive

1647
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,440
animals okay

1648
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,520
and then you get into real learning

1649
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,240
animals um and and i believe that the in

1650
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,000
the cambrian which are these dynamic

1651
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
feedback structures that are a lot more

1652
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,160
sophisticated and they engage in operant

1653
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,240
shaping a good

1654
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,880
uh book which is i think right here

1655
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,119
uh that i recommend uh the evolution of

1656
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:07,040
the sensitive soul um by uh ginsburg and

1657
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,839
jablanca it basically explores the

1658
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,920
evolution of that nervous system and

1659
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,760
what they call basically a flexible

1660
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,760
learning operant system that comes out

1661
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,839
of the cambrian explosion it's on

1662
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:19,760
whether or not consciousness gets a grip

1663
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,520
in that term meaning when i say

1664
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,680
consciousness i mean mind two that's the

1665
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,799
phenomenal

1666
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:27,440
that's the ex um nagel's experience of

1667
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,240
what it is be like um and basically from

1668
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,079
my vantage point you get pleasure

1669
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,160
sensory pleasure pain

1670
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,119
you know jolts as the first kind of what

1671
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,680
john and i call valence qualia okay

1672
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,920
probably are the first sets of mine too

1673
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,920
and and i'm an early mind to her which

1674
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,079
says yeah maybe even down to insects

1675
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,200
okay um but that's a huge debate uh we

1676
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,760
then climb up the structure of the brain

1677
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,480
and then get into a much more extended

1678
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,680
inner life

1679
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,960
and i certainly think by the time we

1680
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,680
have crows and other mammals and things

1681
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,160
like that you get a rich mind to inter

1682
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,400
perceptual field um

1683
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,640
and then they attract that into primates

1684
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,640
and you get you know you can defer you

1685
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,400
get real relational dynamics this was a

1686
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,920
question that came about what about

1687
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,000
relation and would talk about that um

1688
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,520
but you get relational dynamics with

1689
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,359
parenting first and then you get a

1690
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:18,799
parent in a mammal system you get a

1691
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,640
parenting attachment system where you're

1692
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,559
doing self-other modeling and our care

1693
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,559
around another in a long-term relation

1694
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,960
and the attachment system comes online

1695
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,400
you then get social animals you get

1696
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,480
competition and cooperation and you get

1697
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,520
this really rich social primate field um

1698
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,319
and then i do tomasello's work on the

1699
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,880
emergence of a real inter implicit

1700
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,200
inter-subjective we space field where

1701
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,559
there's actually this capacity for

1702
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,799
massive flexible modeling of the other

1703
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:46,559
and mind reading shared attention

1704
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:49,680
intention space this is about 500 000

1705
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,839
million years ago when we're you know

1706
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:54,960
pre-fully verbal um you know prominence

1707
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,799
running around coordinating to kill

1708
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:59,359
mammoths and like that okay um and

1709
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,520
so that it's and it's qualitative we're

1710
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,920
a unique great ape at that time uh

1711
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,160
because of our implicit group shared

1712
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,200
attention all of a sudden we can

1713
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,520
actually like work together to create a

1714
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,839
coordinated shared community felt sense

1715
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,760
of what we're doing together this is

1716
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,000
pre-linguistic and then but what it does

1717
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,079
is it creates a shared mind space for

1718
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,319
symbolic tagging okay that's what

1719
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,400
happens first and music is probably

1720
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,319
happening etc although that's a good

1721
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,319
question about when

1722
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:28,160
and so now the unified theory picks this

1723
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,880
up uh at this stage um so there's all

1724
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,839
the other great work that other

1725
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:33,440
theorists are doing and then it says

1726
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,920
well you get symbolic tagging okay

1727
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,240
antelope there and you're coordinating

1728
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,319
the group and that's all very intense

1729
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,920
requires a lot of definitely high

1730
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,440
cognitive stuff that's probably pressing

1731
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,480
the evolution of the brain in a

1732
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,480
particular way the argument basically is

1733
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,240
200 000 years ago

1734
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,839
probably and we'll see if this gets

1735
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:52,319
pushed back but certainly by 50 000

1736
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,240
years ago and this is the window here

1737
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,400
it's a fundamental shift in symbolic

1738
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,960
communication from a broken symbolic

1739
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,000
system

1740
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,119
into a symbolic syntactical system okay

1741
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,119
they're basically a chomsky and language

1742
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:07,359
acquisition device at least in the weak

1743
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,680
version of that all right that then

1744
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,520
affords the capacity to place nouns

1745
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,040
verbs and subjects and objects in a

1746
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,040
propositional statement

1747
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,000
okay

1748
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,880
this is a game changer the proposition

1749
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,960
according to unified theory why because

1750
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,440
actually a proposition then is a claim

1751
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,359
it's a propositional claim about a truth

1752
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:26,319
statement

1753
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,799
on the one hand so the antelope are over

1754
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:29,680
there

1755
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,480
okay

1756
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,720
the antelope are over there then

1757
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,880
organizes a particular truth crane that

1758
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,880
opens up the possibility for counter

1759
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,799
factual negative space

1760
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:40,799
in a radically different way

1761
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:42,480
no they're not

1762
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,440
okay those are gazelle not antelope

1763
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,760
or and what it does is it opens up the

1764
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,240
possibility no we should go hunt rabbits

1765
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,520
okay

1766
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,760
so propositional claims and the counter

1767
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,920
factual structures that they then once

1768
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,319
they take a positive affordance and then

1769
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,559
the ease with which you can then jump

1770
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,880
negative and how do we jump negative off

1771
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,839
of a proposition

1772
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:08,400
questions why what who where okay which

1773
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,039
are by the way look at one word easy

1774
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:12,319
dynamics

1775
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:13,119
okay

1776
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:14,160
why

1777
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,799
all right unbelievably tough to then

1778
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,319
answer but it's an unbelievably

1779
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:20,640
interesting on a proposition to add

1780
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,520
questions okay so the argument is this

1781
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,440
propositions quickly give rise to

1782
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,799
questions which then generates what's

1783
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:29,119
called a question answer dynamic

1784
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,160
which is the problem of justification

1785
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,039
okay justification is creating networks

1786
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:37,599
of legitimizing claims that coordinate

1787
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:38,799
the group

1788
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:40,079
all right

1789
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:41,760
and now this gives rise to then the

1790
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,480
evolution of justification systems the

1791
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,559
justification systems are the culture

1792
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:48,880
person plane of existence that evolves

1793
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,799
out of the primate layer

1794
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:52,319
and they're networked together through

1795
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:55,839
systems of symbolic justification okay

1796
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:58,000
and it makes a very clear prediction

1797
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,920
that says okay if that's the case then

1798
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,280
there's certain kinds of problems that

1799
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,440
come with propositions they're analytic

1800
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,680
problems like is it true or false

1801
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,440
alternative like what should we invest

1802
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,079
in as a group and personal like what

1803
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:12,000
should i share with the group relative

1804
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,079
to what i just keep to myself

1805
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:14,880
okay

1806
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,160
because the interesting thing about

1807
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,760
propositional knowledge is that it

1808
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,880
affords a clear window directly into the

1809
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,520
mental operations in the mind too in a

1810
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,920
way that action doesn't it's like well

1811
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,680
tell me what the hell you're thinking

1812
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:28,880
okay

1813
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,280
well that's a big goddamn problem why

1814
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,400
because you don't want everybody to know

1815
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,079
exactly what you're thinking

1816
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,160
all right so this is what's called the

1817
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,000
el evolution in the unified theory this

1818
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,400
is the first key insight happens in 1996

1819
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,160
prior to the evolution of the whole tree

1820
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,039
of knowledge it was oh my god the human

1821
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,319
ego

1822
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,200
is the mental organ of justification

1823
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,079
okay the secondary narrator on top of

1824
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,480
the felt experiential self is tasked

1825
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,640
with generating what's justifiable in

1826
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,880
terms of what you feel how do you give

1827
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,720
reasons to maintain responsibility on

1828
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,400
the field and then how do you navigate

1829
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,319
your public persona relative to your

1830
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,400
private self and filter the dynamics and

1831
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,799
relationship

1832
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:10,799
because we do that you do that anytime

1833
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:12,400
you put a little lock on your diary

1834
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,760
you're filtering what people can gain

1835
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,240
access to okay we're constantly

1836
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,680
navigating what it is that people have

1837
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,079
access to relative to their justified in

1838
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,520
place and believe me now we're a

1839
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,680
clinician all the time okay you come

1840
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,079
with me the personas out here and their

1841
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:27,760
private cells in here

1842
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,200
why because they can't justify what the

1843
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,799
hell they actually think and feel to the

1844
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:32,720
world because they'll sacrifice social

1845
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:35,280
influence okay so the dynamic of

1846
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,119
justification goes through the skin and

1847
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,720
it creates the personal analytic and

1848
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,799
social problems which then actually

1849
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:42,799
gives rise to the structure of the ego

1850
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:44,319
which is hey you got to regulate your

1851
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:45,680
experiential self which by the way is

1852
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,160
freud's insight your it animal it and

1853
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,559
your ego and then your public self and

1854
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:52,000
then internalized introduction called

1855
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,240
your superego but then rogers and other

1856
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,760
people you know your public face out

1857
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,520
here irving goffman from a micro

1858
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,280
sociological analysis there are millions

1859
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,720
of different places that talk about the

1860
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,960
persona relative to the ego relative to

1861
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:03,839
self

1862
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:06,000
and the justification problem then puts

1863
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,559
that very in clear evolutionary terms

1864
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:09,839
and what it does is by putting that

1865
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,760
puzzle of peace in you're like oh that's

1866
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,680
how a synchronized primate which was

1867
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,440
some gays and symbolic

1868
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,280
took off because the question answer

1869
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,599
dynamic exploded this new problem of

1870
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:22,480
justification and that basically hijacks

1871
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,240
the language acquisition device into or

1872
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,079
associates it with a self-conscious ego

1873
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,480
at justifier that then has to navigate

1874
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,079
the relationship to the public and the

1875
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:31,200
private

1876
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,280
okay and then groups get together and

1877
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,799
they build systems of justification

1878
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,079
which are what the belief values the

1879
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,160
coordinate of population it's like what

1880
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,599
do we believe in what do we value in how

1881
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:40,880
do we legitimize whether this guy's

1882
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,799
doing the right thing what is is an

1883
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:44,319
ought and how do we coordinate well the

1884
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:45,680
propositional networks of question

1885
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,440
answer dynamics build systems of

1886
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,799
justification

1887
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,480
and that's actually what we live in you

1888
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,760
know what we're doing right now is i'm

1889
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,280
in sharing with my system of

1890
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,720
justification

1891
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,640
okay so this thing takes off and then

1892
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,119
creates whoa this whole culture person

1893
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:02,000
space up here and evolutes it evolves it

1894
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,599
right out of the primate

1895
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:04,960
and then that's what humans are they're

1896
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,359
both primates and persons

1897
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:11,280
okay and the person space is this reason

1898
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,480
giving responsibility so so now what

1899
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,640
that means is okay is that there's a

1900
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,319
fundamental division remember there's a

1901
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:20,720
division between living animals i mean

1902
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,400
living organisms and minded animals

1903
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,160
that's a joint point now we have a joint

1904
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,559
point between the relationship between

1905
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,400
the primate and

1906
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,599
the person

1907
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:30,960
which of course we all know there's no

1908
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,480
other goddamn primates paying attention

1909
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,079
to this talk right now my dog's

1910
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:35,200
wandering around and he's heard this

1911
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,319
many different times he still doesn't

1912
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,640
get it

1913
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,760
okay

1914
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,760
so persons are able to get this you have

1915
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,760
to live at the level of justification

1916
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,680
all right why is that important to get

1917
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,359
back to the issue of psychology what is

1918
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:49,280
psychology okay

1919
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,440
many people wonder what do you mean by

1920
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,960
mental process

1921
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,400
and one of the first things i realized

1922
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,000
with the subjective pro are we talking

1923
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
about animals in general

1924
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,440
which would be virtually all active

1925
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,640
inference stuff

1926
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,640
or are we actually talking about persons

1927
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,440
with reflective capacities in a social

1928
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,280
context that justifies and reasons about

1929
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,319
what they do

1930
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,359
uh

1931
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,039
some psychologists just think in terms

1932
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,839
of persons okay other psychologists the

1933
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:16,160
behaviors go all the way down hell the

1934
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,280
watson went all the way down to the

1935
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,280
goddamn amoebas without a nervous system

1936
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,000
okay so the the line of what you refer

1937
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,640
to in mental process is very different

1938
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,000
and people have different reference

1939
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,079
descartes gives us this reason

1940
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,799
justifying mind which i now call mind

1941
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:33,359
three so mind three and the culture

1942
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,039
person plane of existence is what this

1943
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,359
conversation's about mind two is the

1944
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:39,599
felt experience of being and mind one is

1945
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:42,000
the neurocognitive mind one a inside the

1946
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,160
nervous system mine one b moving around

1947
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,680
on the outside

1948
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,920
i got my things just died here i gotta

1949
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,880
switch over hold on

1950
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,839
ooh

1951
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,839
all once he

1952
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:56,640
connects back to the auditory input

1953
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,720
then i will continue

1954
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,760
then blue

1955
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,640
do you have anything first

1956
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:05,839
yeah i have some questions so uh let's

1957
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:07,839
just make sure he's back and then then

1958
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:09,839
go for it all right i'm now back sorry

1959
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:12,799
about that continue perfect perfect um

1960
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:15,680
so i i don't remember where i pulled a

1961
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,479
slide away from but but it's kind of

1962
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,000
relevant it's one of your slides but

1963
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,920
it's relevant to the talk about the

1964
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,359
distinction between

1965
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,120
self and other and these kind of

1966
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,679
complicated dynamics that are layered

1967
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:29,198
into

1968
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:31,520
human human interaction

1969
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,158
and you know in this slide that i found

1970
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:36,719
it talks about the language of science

1971
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,000
as quantitative third person descriptive

1972
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,719
theoretical and public and also then the

1973
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,960
language of the subjective self which is

1974
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,839
described as qualitative first-person

1975
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:50,880
private um specific

1976
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,439
and value-laden and so i just was

1977
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:55,679
wondering if you have thought about

1978
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,839
second persons at all maybe you're

1979
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:00,000
familiar with the work of jay garfield

1980
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,960
so

1981
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,839
just just the relationship between like

1982
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,158
like you don't really and jay garfield

1983
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:08,799
like there's the second person

1984
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:10,238
as soon as you realize that there's a

1985
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:11,198
you

1986
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:12,000
then

1987
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,839
then you realize that there's a me and

1988
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,000
so i think that that's quite fascinating

1989
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,600
and i just explained it for people that

1990
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,000
maybe haven't heard about it but but um

1991
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,880
is there a second person role in your

1992
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,158
framework

1993
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:25,839
totally so the slide i think you're

1994
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:28,238
referring to uh hold on i'll get one of

1995
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:29,198
these

1996
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:30,450

[Music]

1998
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,640
let me reach into my exocortex

1999
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,120
yeah all of it's all cognitively

2000
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,839
offloaded into the niche

2001
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:50,080
um i think the slide you're referring to

2002
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,880
has this thing on it it does the iquad

2003
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,719
coin and then it has the tree of

2004
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,199
knowledge on the other side okay

2005
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,600
so all that that slide is saying is is

2006
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,000
that science is a particular kind of

2007
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,760
language system the thing that the

2008
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,440
primary thing i want to emphasize just

2009
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,080
in that slide is that science gives rise

2010
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,920
to a particular kind of language system

2011
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,280
and then i listed all of its components

2012
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,120
and i would basically argue that the

2013
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,400
language of

2014
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,920
science and what do i mean by that it's

2015
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,080
like how do we build public knowledge

2016
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,719
systems that describe the generalizable

2017
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,280
world what do we mean by sort of really

2018
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:28,320
inter-subjective objectivity that then

2019
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,040
affords a scientific epistemology that

2020
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,800
then creates things like the periodic

2021
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,440
table of the elements okay

2022
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,199
um and it has a particular set of

2023
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,120
qualities the main thing that i want to

2024
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,360
emphasize in that slide is if you trace

2025
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,679
the evolution of science it basically

2026
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:44,400
gets

2027
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,760
more and more

2028
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,080
it evolves so that it eliminates the

2029
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,560
unique ideographic particular historical

2030
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,440
contingent subject at least the emphasis

2031
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,640
of that

2032
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,600
and over generalizes or emphasizes the

2033
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,960
generalizable nomenthetic behavioral

2034
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,360
law vantage point so and then you can

2035
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,040
create a dialectic

2036
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,400
and and indeed the unified theory says

2037
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,920
hey there's a tree of knowledge that's

2038
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,000
your language of science and then the

2039
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
coin is actually the language of the

2040
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,120
subject

2041
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,679
okay so the coin then i got a picture of

2042
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,840
me on it and it's basically like oh this

2043
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,920
is my this represents it's actually in

2044
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,000
the shape of an h and you actually turn

2045
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,400
it to an i there's an i

2046
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,159
um and it basically stands for what's

2047
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,640
called the human identity function okay

2048
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,719
the human identity function refers to

2049
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:35,440
the unique particular subjective

2050
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,320
ideographic

2051
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,760
epistemological portal that is each one

2052
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,159
of us from our particular perspective

2053
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:44,800
that's what it represents okay which is

2054
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,840
not a scientific perspective

2055
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:48,640
okay

2056
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,199
uh so so so it captures science just

2057
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:52,880
basically factors that out it's

2058
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,480
like that's error from science spanish

2059
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,560
point okay it's our lives from our

2060
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,080
personal vantage point

2061
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:58,960
okay

2062
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,520
so now you that your question then is

2063
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,840
well do i engage in i mean what do we do

2064
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,920
about the second person that's a whole i

2065
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,199
totally

2066
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,600
in fact the garden is basically a second

2067
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,239
person wisdom collective so a second

2068
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,080
person is actually how do we create a we

2069
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,840
space okay a fundamental shared sense of

2070
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,000
being in a collective and what is a

2071
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,760
fundamentally about is actually wisdom

2072
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:22,719
is about how do we actually get

2073
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:24,719
collective intelligence together around

2074
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,800
an ethic around particular values that

2075
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,239
we can coordinate around and feel

2076
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:31,040
fulfilled and so totally it's just not

2077
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,880
position there but yeah we definitely

2078
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,560
have a second person perspective

2079
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,920
very nice

2080
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,480
i had a comment on science so um one

2081
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,239
distinction that i often think about is

2082
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,320
like science as an approach which could

2083
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,640
have happened anytime any place then

2084
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,719
there's the knowledge slash data the

2085
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:50,400
real specific data sets and then there's

2086
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,320
the real specific career and

2087
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,719
infrastructure so that just helps me

2088
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:56,800
separate the specific institutions that

2089
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,440
we know and love or don't from the data

2090
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,239
sets that are good or not from

2091
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,560
our approach which is timeless

2092
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,080
but then what's interesting about the

2093
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,800
slide it says the um is that the

2094
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,719
subjective self is the one that's

2095
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,400
specific in particular so i understand

2096
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,440
the sort of

2097
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,760
first and second person side but

2098
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,239
actually science as far as it being

2099
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:19,920
generalized and lawful

2100
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,679
the counter side is science is the

2101
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:23,120
framework by which we say well we don't

2102
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,400
prove anything we don't know that we're

2103
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,159
on the back of this animal actually we

2104
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:28,400
have to go look so science does

2105
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,159
particularize through measurement and

2106
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:31,520
observation

2107
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,920
and the laws of science are probably a

2108
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,280
little bit overblown and that's the

2109
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,440
whole joke is that people outside of

2110
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,520
scientific training don't always have a

2111
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,320
sense of what scientists do it's not

2112
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,239
alchemy usually

2113
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:46,320
and then that is a disconnect that is

2114
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,320
also historical so it's still ground

2115
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,840
that's why we need this historical

2116
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,840
approach because we have to understand

2117
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:52,719
how does

2118
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:55,040
bacon's early writings

2119
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,320
play into

2120
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,360
some lay fallacies about what science is

2121
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,120
and then won't people just think

2122
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,800
differently if they change that belief

2123
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,120
beautiful and and now i'll point out

2124
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,880
there that yeah so

2125
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,040
another key issue here is the meaning of

2126
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,719
the word empirical

2127
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:15,679
okay um so the word empirical means

2128
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,960
observation systematic observation okay

2129
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,400
but early on the people didn't

2130
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,480
differentiate between oh i'm i

2131
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,960
empirically am observing this purple can

2132
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,080
okay

2133
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,840
but when science came along and you got

2134
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,159
the primary versus secondary quality

2135
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,400
dimension that emerged with people like

2136
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,360
hume and the whole structure you had the

2137
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,640
 i experienced this is purple okay

2138
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,080
which then they were like well god

2139
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,640
that's a goddamn secondary quality which

2140
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,880
become qualia okay

2141
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,560
and then it's actually what we can

2142
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,000
really observe

2143
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
is the we can measure

2144
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,199
and create an inter-subjective objective

2145
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:54,800
intersection with

2146
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,360
and that becomes third person empiricism

2147
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,280
so the scientist is you have to get

2148
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:02,239
trained in procedures and it becomes a

2149
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,239
scientific observation if everybody

2150
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,080
trained in the procedure can see and

2151
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,400
interpret the data that you gather

2152
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,239
so science is not dependent upon a

2153
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,400
unique individual idiographic

2154
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,320
empirical perspective it's dependent

2155
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,400
upon a third person quantitative

2156
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,040
generalizable empirical perspective

2157
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,480
which is that equal to count as data you

2158
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,239
actually have to have transposed

2159
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:25,679
observers that are trained in

2160
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:27,600
interpreting and say oh yeah we all

2161
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,840
publicly agree that the way to interpret

2162
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,280
you guys look at these goddamn things

2163
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,640
coming off with a large hydrogen

2164
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,560
collider well we can get together i'll

2165
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,159
tell you what that is that's a muon

2166
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:38,400
that's wobbling in a weird way i'll look

2167
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,159
at that i don't know what goddamn muon

2168
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,679
is but actually all the experts together

2169
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:43,120
and they'll take the observation and say

2170
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,600
yep that's a muon and that's wobbling

2171
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,920
okay and that becomes an observation so

2172
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,080
it's a third-person data-driven

2173
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,840
observation that's available to those

2174
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,600
that have expertise in the procedures of

2175
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,320
interpretation

2176
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,320
great one

2177
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,120
way that that plays out i think um

2178
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,719
it makes me think about how in

2179
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:05,440
frequentism it's sort of like

2180
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,239
trial you know accept or reject kind of

2181
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:11,199
and misconceptions beyond that

2182
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,760
but with bayesian frameworks even though

2183
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,480
the rev base was back in the day

2184
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,480
the bayesian framework as it's now

2185
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,640
understood in the computational era

2186
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,679
helps us deal with probabilistic

2187
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,880
variables

2188
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,440
and variables we have uncertainty on

2189
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,679
and then also allows us which we use a

2190
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,840
ton in active is to have like an

2191
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,080
underlying process that isn't observed

2192
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,320
and then an emitted process that or an

2193
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,640
observable that is and having that as

2194
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,440
the fundamental that's signal processing

2195
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,960
general

2196
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,760
partially observable bayesian models so

2197
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,600
that's a very established computational

2198
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,320
technique and so we can just take it as

2199
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,360
our

2200
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,679
unit that it's not just the measurements

2201
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:55,199
out there in the world nor is it an

2202
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,679
unmeasurable object you say we're always

2203
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,679
going to measure the dyad

2204
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:02,480
and that is the unit of scientific

2205
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,719
modeling because that's the tools we

2206
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,640
have

2207
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,719
in unified theory it's observer behavior

2208
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:11,199
relation

2209
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:17,120
cool um okay would you like i mean

2210
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,560
there's a lot there's a lot to go there

2211
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,320
are we gonna go somewhere else but

2212
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,239
anyway there's a foundational it

2213
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:24,159
basically takes science as observer

2214
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:26,800
behavior relation and then it it

2215
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,320
actually drops it into quantum mechanics

2216
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,600
and general relativity in a particular

2217
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,840
kind of way that aligns matrix mechanics

2218
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,159
with big bang it's weird but it

2219
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:35,840
basically goes oh yeah the fundamental

2220
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,080
unit in fact this is why this is an ipod

2221
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,320
coin it's i to the fourth which creates

2222
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,159
a unit circle and actually is a

2223
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:44,560
frequency of observer behavior relation

2224
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,800
is entangled in the coin so anyway just

2225
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,880
as i heard you're saying yep nope that's

2226
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,239
exactly what it is and really what

2227
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:51,920
science fundamentally is is observer

2228
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,679
behavioral frequency relations that's

2229
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,120
what lisa this argument is so i'd love

2230
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,120
to hear that

2231
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,440
okay uh short thought i hope it's

2232
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,880
already an nft but second thought is um

2233
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,480
what are the next steps even though

2234
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,480
we're not at the end of our conversation

2235
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,400
but what are the next steps

2236
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,520
for an individual or for the field like

2237
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,880
if someone's excited about this

2238
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,080
potential

2239
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,800
and maybe they're um haven't had a

2240
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,880
university education or they have like

2241
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,920
what does an individual do to onboard to

2242
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,040
know more

2243
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:27,520
to apply or what is the broader project

2244
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,320
that you're working on

2245
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,360
all right well that's uh yeah so

2246
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,960
uh let me see if i can uh

2247
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,040
so i gotta ship my frame a little bit

2248
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,640
here so let's see what we're talking

2249
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,800
about um

2250
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,719
so there's the there's a theoretical

2251
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,199
angle on this okay so the theor there's

2252
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:49,760
a theoretical angle which to me is that

2253
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,560
we're about ready to drop into a new

2254
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,560
theoretical enlightenment

2255
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,640
okay it's really exciting i really think

2256
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,159
that there is an opportunity to address

2257
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:01,679
the enlightenment gap

2258
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:04,719
and find a way to place the sciences in

2259
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:06,880
proper relation to our knowledge and do

2260
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,480
so with consilience that's super

2261
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,520
exciting from a theory perspective okay

2262
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,640
but it turns out and and so if that was

2263
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,320
going on that's beautiful and wonderful

2264
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,640
okay but i have to pause because that's

2265
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,000
not the only thing that's actually

2266
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,159
happening here at least from my vantage

2267
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,080
point

2268
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,440
um

2269
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,040
and that's the world is happening

2270
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:31,440
okay

2271
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,120
what do i mean by that i mean like the

2272
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,679
world is like in a very interesting spot

2273
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:38,000
right now

2274
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,640
okay and is happening at a very

2275
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:44,320
very um weird level okay why is this

2276
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,800
relevant for me well i'll just say okay

2277
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:47,520
so

2278
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,880
you know i've been in the academy my

2279
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,040
whole life all right i've been i've

2280
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,480
i got i was at the university of

2281
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,480
pennsylvania worked for beck learned all

2282
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,480
that you know published its special

2283
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,600
issues blah blah trying to get the arc

2284
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,239
the institutional infrastructure to

2285
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:05,360
upgrade itself uh at least but i

2286
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,520
couldn't there was no i didn't i came at

2287
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,320
it from a two different position um and

2288
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,480
ultimately although i was inside the

2289
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,560
institution i couldn't get any

2290
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,600
leverage

2291
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,520
um and ultimately over the last four

2292
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:18,400
years

2293
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,239
things have happened so that i have

2294
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:22,080
jettisoned myself outside the i'm still

2295
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,040
full professor and i do my job okay

2296
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,199
but actually a wave has happened inside

2297
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:30,080
the institution that i feel

2298
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,639
qualitatively more alienated from over

2299
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:34,719
the last four years and that's for

2300
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:37,840
personal reasons okay and retrospective

2301
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,000
reasons in relationship to

2302
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,440
um

2303
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,800
my difficulty trying to get traction

2304
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,239
and global reasons and zeitgeist reasons

2305
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:51,120
so that now i hang out with people in

2306
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,760
that are futurists okay so my my i used

2307
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,760
to spend you know in traditional blah

2308
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,360
blah and i still do

2309
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,600
but i actually spend all my time talking

2310
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,120
with people that are in the midst of a

2311
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,639
zeitgeist

2312
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:04,800
like for example i'm involved in like

2313
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,400
metamodernism okay

2314
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:10,880
metamodernism is an emerging sensibility

2315
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,360
okay that is basically the simplest way

2316
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,400
to think about it is the thing that

2317
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,800
comes after post-modernism

2318
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,639
that looks back and resolves the

2319
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:21,280
modernist versus postmodern

2320
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,159
modern thesis post-modern antithesis

2321
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:26,880
meta-modern synthesis

2322
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,520
okay and there's a emerging sensibility

2323
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,000
in europe about this which emerges over

2324
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,560
the last decade okay

2325
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,040
and weird happens with that so like

2326
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,520
the an ethos is sort of like it's a it's

2327
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,840
seeking a post-post-modern grand meta

2328
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,440
narrative so post-modernism says there

2329
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,800
is no grandma narrative they're always

2330
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,719
dangerous and this one comes after and

2331
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:49,280
says i wrote in my book in 2011. and i

2332
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,639
was like hey the unified there is a post

2333
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:53,920
post-modern grand better narrative

2334
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,400
and then i turned this into a garden

2335
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,760
and i don't know why the hell i did that

2336
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,760
you know that's weird okay

2337
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,639
but the issue is is that when i then saw

2338
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:04,719
the artistic sensibility of

2339
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:08,080
metamodernism it's called sincere irony

2340
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,320
okay sincere in the sense it's authentic

2341
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,239
and true irony in a sense it's a

2342
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:14,560
critique and twisted well that's what

2343
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,639
that is this is unbelievably sincerity

2344
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:18,960
and it's a cartoon and it's twisted and

2345
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,960
it's both science and religion and it's

2346
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,199
a joke and it's serious and it's all

2347
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:25,199
that i had no idea that the meta-modern

2348
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:28,320
sensibility had a sincere ironic

2349
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,199
flavor i was called to do this okay oh

2350
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:33,760
i'm connecting to people now the

2351
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,520
experience that i have is like the the i

2352
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,639
don't know if you saw the close

2353
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:38,639
encounters are the third kind

2354
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:40,320
all right close encounters occurred kind

2355
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,239
of like 10 000 people in the world sort

2356
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:44,080
of wake up and they get this image of

2357
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,679
devil's mountain all right and he gets

2358
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:47,840
his callings crazy calling like oh my

2359
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,520
god oh my god and then everybody

2360
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,120
migrates to it and then blow the whole

2361
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:54,000
that's where the aliens show up okay

2362
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
well i'm telling you i feel like there's

2363
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,239
a calling that's happening for in the

2364
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:00,480
process of a particular serious

2365
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,480
evolution we're in a serious

2366
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,199
evolutionary flux okay

2367
01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:07,199
and and the tree of knowledge actually

2368
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:09,520
clarifies exactly why we would be

2369
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,520
remember each one of those life mind

2370
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,120
culture what does it say each one of

2371
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,520
those is an information processing

2372
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:19,960
and communication network system

2373
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:22,639
that yolks stuff together at a higher

2374
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:25,040
order

2375
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,480
huh

2376
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,440
okay so cells did that and then animals

2377
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,920
did that and then language did that

2378
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,679
is it any possible that there could be

2379
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:35,679
an information processing network

2380
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:37,840
communication system that is emerging at

2381
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,159
a higher order

2382
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:41,520
well you actually do that you look back

2383
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:42,320
and you're like oh my god that's a

2384
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,040
goddamn 20th century we laid down the

2385
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,880
internet

2386
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,480
and we built artificial intelligence

2387
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,719
systems that are intersecting with it

2388
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:51,840
okay

2389
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,760
so from a tree of knowledge perspective

2390
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,920
we're actually in the midst of the fifth

2391
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,400
joint point on this century this century

2392
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,520
is the fifth joint brain when you're

2393
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,960
traveling through the culture person

2394
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,120
plane of existence into the potential

2395
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,920
digital it's a whole new potential

2396
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,960
metaverse of complexification

2397
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,040
okay if you see the world through that

2398
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,360
particular ends then you're like whoa

2399
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,440
now we can actually track the evolution

2400
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,120
of complexification across all these

2401
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,880
different frequencies levels with at

2402
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,440
least intuitive comprehensibility and

2403
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,960
you can then see well we're

2404
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,440
actually in the midst of a flux point

2405
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,040
as we have built all of these different

2406
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,920
technologies that transcending the old

2407
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,679
infrastructures for institutional

2408
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:33,920
control and regulation sense making and

2409
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,440
we're all going insane because this is

2410
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,199
opening up all sorts of possibilities

2411
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:38,320
but it's also threatening the

2412
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,920
fundamental foundation of how we operate

2413
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,000
and then the question is can we upgrade

2414
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,560
our wisdom to navigate the evolution of

2415
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,360
technology and the planet and do so in a

2416
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,440
way that stabilizes

2417
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:52,880
or is there going to be too much goddamn

2418
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,480
chaos and flux the system's going to be

2419
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,239
thinly stacked everybody gets

2420
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:57,840
defensive and insane because of the new

2421
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:01,440
thing and the goddamn thing plummets

2422
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,839
blue buy sell

2423
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,520
yeah intense i mean i don't know

2424
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,320
i'm lost in the in the artificial

2425
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,639
intelligence and cognitive offloading

2426
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:21,040
and niche modification i think i i

2427
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,440
wonder about what you feel like the role

2428
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,239
is

2429
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,560
since you brought up the internet um and

2430
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,159
artificial intelligence like what do you

2431
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:30,960
feel like the role is of um niche

2432
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,120
modification in the transmission of

2433
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,719
culture or do you feel that culture is

2434
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:36,880
something that has to then be

2435
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,480
transmitted directly like is that a

2436
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,719
person to person a learned behavior or

2437
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,639
can we modify the niche

2438
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:45,280
and transmit it in that way

2439
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,639
well so

2440
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:48,560
let's to be clear about some definitions

2441
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,040
so in the true knowledge it's capital c

2442
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,199
culture okay then there's lower c

2443
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,840
culture but capital c culture is the

2444
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,840
technical term for the systems of

2445
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,520
justification

2446
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,000
the propositional networks at various

2447
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,280
levels that legitimize is an ought in

2448
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,840
inside groups or outside of them so if

2449
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,520
you're inside a culture you have a

2450
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,360
propositional network of legitimizing is

2451
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,360
an art that can be coordinated with

2452
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:16,320
yourself at the ego level diatically

2453
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,480
or move on up the stack so if you take

2454
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,800
act inference lab and you create a

2455
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,400
culture on it it will be networked

2456
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,480
around a system of justification that

2457
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,400
legitimizes what it is that you're doing

2458
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,239
in a particular niche and that creates

2459
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:30,719
the act inference culture

2460
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:32,880
capital city propositional network

2461
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,400
there's little sea culture which is

2462
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,560
basically the behavioral investment

2463
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,239
patterns other animals have little seed

2464
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,800
culture okay that then afford the

2465
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,280
capacity to adjust into niches and then

2466
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,199
feed back on them you know animals learn

2467
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:47,280
how to work on washed potatoes no

2468
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,760
monkeys will do that all right um and

2469
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,120
you can then and of course we're

2470
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,880
unbelievably flexible in our behavioral

2471
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,960
repertoires all right

2472
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,040
so now the fundamental issue is that we

2473
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,840
are then uh from a macroscopic level

2474
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,040
what are the sys what are the

2475
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,040
large-scale systems of justification

2476
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,480
that are operating

2477
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,639
to coordinate is an awe

2478
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:09,360
and the answer is not much because of

2479
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,120
the chaos in the globe the globe has

2480
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,880
afforded us to get together but our

2481
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,040
knowledge systems are not up to the task

2482
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,560
of coordinating we know where to learn

2483
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,239
it this is the metaverse i mean what the

2484
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:20,639
hell is this thing okay and so we're

2485
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,280
trying to we're groping to build

2486
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,199
justification systems that can

2487
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:28,320
effectively hold and cultivate all the

2488
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,159
niches that actually then need to grow

2489
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:32,880
into that afford individual variation

2490
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,199
and new growth and blah blah and at the

2491
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:36,400
same time

2492
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,880
do so in a way that you know well makes

2493
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,760
this transition or at least affords the

2494
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,520
emergence of this whole new way of

2495
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,600
relating the digital okay that can

2496
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,120
collapse space and time and have us talk

2497
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,960
to each other at the exact same time

2498
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,440
which is totally weird right um

2499
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,400
so

2500
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,400
i guess my basic point is there's

2501
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,760
multi-level

2502
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:56,719
um

2503
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:00,080
operations all the time okay uh that are

2504
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,920
down more trans-determinative meaning

2505
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,600
there's everything is sort of happening

2506
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,480
across the synaptic diachromatic stack

2507
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,960
okay well i'm not a rigid determinist by

2508
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,960
any stretch um

2509
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,760
but anyway then our i see us as having a

2510
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,600
moment of conscious evolution like the

2511
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,880
issue fundamentally for us um at a broad

2512
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:21,360
level is to wake up to the situation we

2513
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:22,880
find ourselves in

2514
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,440
okay and upgrade our operating system to

2515
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,600
be up to the task upgrading our system

2516
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,280
of justification

2517
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,280
to gain knowledge and socialization so

2518
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,960
we can be effectively oriented toward

2519
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,400
wisdom that's what the fundamental

2520
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:37,360
garden is basically there is a way um

2521
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:39,840
that we can then and then if we solve

2522
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,040
some of the old problems that have

2523
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,719
prevented this upgrade from happening so

2524
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:44,639
that we can see the path to the upgrade

2525
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:46,719
then a map of cognitive architectural

2526
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:48,480
map from the sort of the intellectual

2527
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,560
stream will happen if that's in good

2528
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,480
contact with people that are realizing

2529
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,320
that the system is sick right now and

2530
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,719
want a community upgrade then the

2531
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:58,480
intellectual solution can feed the

2532
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,560
community upgrade they can metabolize it

2533
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,800
and get it to normal people living their

2534
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,960
lives and we can change the contingency

2535
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,360
infrastructure nation state capital

2536
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:10,080
labor relations resource control stuff

2537
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,800
and hopefully then evolve so to me the

2538
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,639
issue is very flux

2539
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:16,400
very bottom up top down

2540
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,679
lots of different things will influence

2541
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:19,199
at the same time

2542
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:21,120
my goal is really there's a meaning in

2543
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,520
mental health crisis that's one aspect

2544
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,440
of the dynamic we face

2545
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,960
that's what the unifi you talk

2546
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,480
fundamentally then it's oriented towards

2547
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,560
so my life mission is we can do a lot

2548
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,880
better in meaning making and mental

2549
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,199
health than we currently are

2550
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:37,679
there are ways to understand knowledge

2551
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:40,560
and wisdom that can fundamentally shift

2552
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,080
and rotate the way we think about

2553
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,320
ourselves so we can in fact i'm

2554
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,080
searching for a coherent naturalistic

2555
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:48,320
ontology that can revitalize the human

2556
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,800
soul and spirit in the 21st century

2557
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,800
that's essentially what my the mission

2558
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,040
is and utah affords a particular

2559
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,199
sense-making structure to do that and if

2560
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:58,320
everyone's operating in that kind of

2561
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,080
sense-making structure from both the

2562
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,960
bottom and the top the whole coordinated

2563
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,560
system of justification would be

2564
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:06,560
different and the consequences of many

2565
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,520
many things would be different

2566
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,719
thanks for sharing that

2567
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:15,040
just to connect it to two or a few

2568
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,639
active ideas

2569
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:19,600
policy selection which is core

2570
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,639
is

2571
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,719
based upon the partitioning but always

2572
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:25,760
the joint consideration of epistemic

2573
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,000
value knowledge oriented value or

2574
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,440
intrinsic motivation and pragmatic value

2575
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:32,800
utility

2576
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:35,920
external motivation so we need to

2577
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,000
learn more you know we got to take a few

2578
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,320
steps back to go the easier way to the

2579
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,840
mountaintop but also we need to clear

2580
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,560
the clouds to see where we could go and

2581
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:47,040
communicate how we could go so that's

2582
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:50,880
why planning as inference is a useful

2583
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,560
framework because it's not enough to

2584
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,560
just have preferences preferences are a

2585
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,400
core part of our models we want to be

2586
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,400
like warm and secure

2587
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:01,600
at each level of the maslow's hierarchy

2588
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:05,040
but the other side that in activism kind

2589
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,080
of slapped back into the world

2590
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,840
we have to have a plan

2591
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,920
and it has to be pragmatic

2592
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:12,639
so

2593
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:14,320
just beautiful very

2594
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,440
similar

2595
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:16,719
um

2596
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:18,960
it's funny because

2597
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,840
drawing more from the cybernetics

2598
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:22,639
and

2599
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:24,639
dynamic systems and complex systems

2600
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:26,159
modeling side

2601
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:28,480
the experience

2602
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,159
that's the part that's oh that's

2603
01:31:30,159 --> 01:31:32,080
unsupported or you'll never be able to

2604
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,239
make those claims or that's you know

2605
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,560
that's the pl gangplank

2606
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,880
versus the kernel which is seen as to be

2607
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,920
the math but then the real relational

2608
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,199
insight

2609
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:45,040
shows that it's truly

2610
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:46,880
a bi-directional freeway like everyone's

2611
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,159
going home

2612
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:51,840
or away because you really can wrap

2613
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,159
a lot of the technical parts within a

2614
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:56,560
broader picture

2615
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:59,840
that isn't formal

2616
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,880
amen brother

2617
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:05,760
so just a quick question uh related to

2618
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,239
both the mental health crisis and to

2619
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:10,159
culture with the capital c

2620
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:11,520
um which

2621
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,400
i don't know

2622
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,639
is in that kind of definition like

2623
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:17,040
something i'm equating to like a moral

2624
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,440
system or a value system is that is that

2625
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,600
appropriate yeah oh sure yeah it's a

2626
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,120
it's a belief value network of

2627
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:25,920
propositions that afford a group to be

2628
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,400
able to state explicitly what is an awe

2629
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,320
and negotiate from there

2630
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,639
so what do you think um

2631
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:34,320
or do you think that there is a

2632
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,159
relationship between

2633
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:38,400
like the fact that you know in western

2634
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,960
society at least in the states like many

2635
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:43,840
of us are just spiritually bankrupt

2636
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,600
and so like do you think that there is a

2637
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,360
connection is that a possible

2638
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,920
fundamental reason for the mental health

2639
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,000
crisis that that we're facing now do you

2640
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,159
think that those are linked exactly no

2641
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:56,000
directly 100

2642
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,400
yeah no no we we we've we're operating

2643
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,639
off of a very sick system

2644
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:03,600
of justification and and um it's

2645
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,600
basically my friend zack stein puts it

2646
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,440
this way um or at least i'll draw from

2647
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,880
him and i'll put it in my own basic

2648
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,040
context so what happens with the

2649
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,639
modernity which is basically

2650
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:14,639
enlightenment capital labor relations uh

2651
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:16,560
democrat and then the evolution and what

2652
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,159
modernity does to the traditional

2653
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:19,360
knowledge systems and the oral

2654
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,199
indigenous knowledge systems prior to

2655
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:24,000
that okay is it basically shifts the

2656
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,280
structure into a skill development um

2657
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,840
self-interested control model okay

2658
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,360
basically so now the values of

2659
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,840
justification that evolve off of the

2660
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:37,280
modernity are not spiritual insolent but

2661
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,280
ultimately reductive physical

2662
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,840
self-interested control mechanistic

2663
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:45,040
kinds of instrumental ways of being okay

2664
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,960
which is an important way of being no

2665
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:50,639
doubt um but it's a doing problem okay

2666
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:52,239
which is different than eric from we

2667
01:33:52,239 --> 01:33:54,320
talk about as a being problem

2668
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,000
all right let me give you an example

2669
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,600
which i stumbled into through the

2670
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,840
unified theory to explain this okay so

2671
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,360
the fourth branch back there is this

2672
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,600
thing called the influence matrix all

2673
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,440
right and what it does is it basically

2674
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:07,120
combines attachment theory and the

2675
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:09,520
interpersonal circumplex uh to give a

2676
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,760
model of the process dimensions that we

2677
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,639
track in our dyadic relational world

2678
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:16,480
okay meaning the self-other world and

2679
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,000
then we wander around with internal

2680
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
working models in relationship to it

2681
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,040
okay

2682
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,120
so the the core line in the influence

2683
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,520
matrix i originally called uh the social

2684
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:26,960
influence line that's why it's called

2685
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,880
the influence matrix and it said that we

2686
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,360
had high social influence or low social

2687
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,600
influence okay and influence here was

2688
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,639
defined in pretty instrumental terms

2689
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:38,320
the instrumental terms were the capacity

2690
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,679
to influence others in accordance with

2691
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:41,760
your interests or the reverse the

2692
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:44,400
absence of that so there's a resource

2693
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,320
in conception of influence and it's the

2694
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,600
capacity and that's becomes the

2695
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,679
fundament and from a pure

2696
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:51,760
kind of a standard evolutionary

2697
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,080
mechanistic modernist kind of view this

2698
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:56,239
capacity to influence the world is where

2699
01:34:56,239 --> 01:34:58,719
rubber meets the road okay

2700
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:01,679
but over time that thing evolved and it

2701
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:04,159
became the relational value and social

2702
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:06,400
influence line

2703
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,440
okay

2704
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,280
whereby what we're actually tracking is

2705
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,679
both our capacity to move other people

2706
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:13,679
instrumentally and the extent to which

2707
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:16,080
we're known and valued by important

2708
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,840
others

2709
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,639
okay and that is our heart our heart is

2710
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:22,960
both hey can we actually move people

2711
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:23,920
around

2712
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,719
and be am i genuinely known and valued

2713
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:30,080
by important others for my essence

2714
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,000
okay and what this emerges in my

2715
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,960
clinical work okay is a i work some with

2716
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,960
some people who had no social influence

2717
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,280
and no relational value homeless people

2718
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,960
who are brutalized by all aspects of

2719
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,719
life and they're just miserable

2720
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:43,440
okay

2721
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,440
but i then met with a number of people

2722
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,280
of course this will come as no surprise

2723
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:50,080
who actually had high social influence

2724
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:53,119
who were completely empty

2725
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:54,800
they manipulated and controlled other

2726
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,800
people but they didn't they had they

2727
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,199
stacked themselves up with high resumes

2728
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:01,360
but then nobody liked them they could be

2729
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:04,159
 bosses and control people and

2730
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:06,159
had money

2731
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:08,400
okay so they had instrumental influence

2732
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,639
but and of course then if the instrument

2733
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:12,639
just changes you now have to spend all

2734
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:13,600
your time especially if you're going to

2735
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,199
do it through control to gain influence

2736
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:16,400
through power

2737
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,080
and now that's a very vulnerable spot

2738
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,920
you lose access to control and you're

2739
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,040
jettisoned

2740
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:22,560
okay

2741
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,080
and then there are other people even who

2742
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:26,080
were actually valued by other people but

2743
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,000
they put on a face their persona is what

2744
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,800
they felt was value they weren't known

2745
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,719
okay and these people also felt very

2746
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:34,239
anxious because they could be discovered

2747
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:36,080
for who they were

2748
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,800
the core heart placement of security is

2749
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,800
to have social influence and be known in

2750
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,679
value for your essence

2751
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:47,280
okay hunter-gatherers get this

2752
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:49,679
we because of our instrumentality in the

2753
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,440
way we decide to control then we create

2754
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,679
economic labor relations we basically

2755
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:56,400
turn everything into an influence game

2756
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:59,280
and we lose relational value

2757
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,520
okay we don't know that actually that's

2758
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:03,760
really what i mean uh you know john

2759
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,480
watson basically decided that the reason

2760
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,560
kids wanted hugs was because it was

2761
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,159
paired with food i mean that's how

2762
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:12,320
insane his model of humanity was and by

2763
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,159
the way two of his three kids killed

2764
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:15,199
themselves

2765
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:18,400
that's john watson behaviors okay so our

2766
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,880
idea of self-interested mechanistic

2767
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,840
control and applying the clockwork way

2768
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,760
in which power force mass and

2769
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,840
acceleration actually work as if really

2770
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,840
that's the underlying causation of our

2771
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,639
true essence actually kills our soul

2772
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:34,639
because it turns it into instrumentality

2773
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:36,880
and fails to attend to the genuine

2774
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:39,679
beingness and the value of that we have

2775
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:42,159
to revitalize that and we know it when

2776
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:45,040
we feel it okay but our justification

2777
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,639
systems

2778
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:48,800
meaning our academic hard-nosed

2779
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,560
tough-minded thing was basically well

2780
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,000
when it really comes down to it you're

2781
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
basically just a bunch of molecules i

2782
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,800
mean that was the message okay and we

2783
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,480
need to change that message people

2784
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,960
digested that message people lost the

2785
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,040
clarity about what a human soul and

2786
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:04,560
spirit is from a naturalistic

2787
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,040
perspective we can revitalize that get

2788
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:09,040
clear about it point them to it and if

2789
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,360
we build systems of justification that

2790
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:13,280
then organize institutions like

2791
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:16,080
education politics national relations et

2792
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,560
cetera the whole goddamn change equation

2793
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:19,760
changes at least according to this

2794
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,239
perspective

2795
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,159
very nice

2796
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:26,080
so i it just brings me to another

2797
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,480
question that i had unless daniel you

2798
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,800
have something that you wanna about blue

2799
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,480
with the last question and then we'll

2800
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:35,280
have a closing thought so thanks a lot

2801
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,840
greg this is really a cool dialogue so

2802
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:40,080
blue last question and then we'll each

2803
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,760
give a last thought

2804
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,400
so um just one final question is

2805
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,800
speaking of you know relational

2806
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:49,199
interactions and you know if the

2807
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:51,679
relational nature isn't food and it

2808
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:53,440
isn't like we're not billiard balls

2809
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,679
we're existing in you know a field

2810
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:59,119
essentially like what is the relational

2811
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:02,239
language like how can we best

2812
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:04,239
relate to one another

2813
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:06,719
relate to ourselves like how do we speak

2814
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:09,040
that dialogue beautiful

2815
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:12,239
um well so i built this thing called map

2816
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:14,800
of mind to just defer metaphysics of the

2817
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,639
mental domains and there are five

2818
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:19,119
domains that are very obvious okay so

2819
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:22,159
one is mind1b that's

2820
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:24,400
okay mind1a that's what my nervous

2821
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:27,280
system is doing okay mine two that's the

2822
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,520
 i can see but you can't

2823
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,719
mine three a is what i talk to myself

2824
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:34,320
okay i was just doing that

2825
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:37,920
mind3b is now me talking out here okay

2826
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,800
so and those are all easy any behavioral

2827
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,320
no matter how empirical they are you can

2828
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,000
now have a map that says oh these are

2829
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,239
actually the meanings of referent of

2830
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:48,800
mind and notice there are five of them

2831
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,320
and we use the word mind and actually

2832
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:51,600
there are five different reference here

2833
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:52,719
we need to get very clear because

2834
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:54,239
they're different epistemological and

2835
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:56,800
ontological reference points okay

2836
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,920
well

2837
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,760
here's one that um gets right to your

2838
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,040
point okay

2839
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:03,199
i think and i think michael tomasello's

2840
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:05,440
work and i think anybody that really

2841
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,199
falls in love

2842
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:10,560
and feels is mine to be

2843
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:11,440
okay

2844
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,760
the inter-subjective non-verbal

2845
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:17,040
intersubjective space of tracking one

2846
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:20,080
another and participating in the

2847
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:23,040
attachment relational dance of being

2848
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,960
it's seeing the other person through the

2849
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,600
eyes tracking where their eyes are and

2850
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,320
essentially seeing their heart their

2851
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,480
felt experience of being and being part

2852
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,000
of that and then being in dance with

2853
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
that and if anybody's ever fallen in

2854
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,440
love with somebody

2855
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,360
okay and then you fall into that and

2856
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,679
then all of a sudden you are that field

2857
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:44,239
that felt experience of being

2858
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:46,480
you know joins together in a particular

2859
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,480
way and i actually think there will we

2860
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,560
can develop you know genuine

2861
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,600
metaphysical claims about mind to be

2862
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:55,199
space which is an implicit inner

2863
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:57,199
subjective space i think tonicello's

2864
01:40:57,199 --> 01:40:59,760
work on shared attention and intention i

2865
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,360
think many different things domain in

2866
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,280
relationship to that and it basically is

2867
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:05,679
a relation a pre-verbal primate

2868
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:07,840
relational field that we are actually

2869
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:11,040
really attuned to and i think that that

2870
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,960
informs us a way to think about how we

2871
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:15,119
sync up with each other relationally i

2872
01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:16,719
think we should shine a light on that

2873
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:18,080
because i think we're relationally

2874
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:20,400
deprived and i think that many things

2875
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,920
like social media basically break that

2876
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:25,600
completely relative to what it is

2877
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,520
designed to track and so you're seeing a

2878
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,600
mental health crisis in adolescence they

2879
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,199
don't have any mind to be connection

2880
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:33,040
everything is texting and likes

2881
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:34,800
and you know jolting and everything else

2882
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,719
and the whole sense of who i am and who

2883
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:38,159
you are i mean you go back to hunter

2884
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:41,040
gatherers you lived in a family forever

2885
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,800
and they saw all of this it was real

2886
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:43,600
world

2887
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,480
action

2888
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,159
i don't know and i think that's not what

2889
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:47,760
the heart needs and some that we got to

2890
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,320
get we got to figure out a way uh to

2891
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,920
cultivate that or else we're going to be

2892
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:54,080
empty and so yeah let's shine a light on

2893
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:58,080
that mind to be relational world

2894
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:02,400
it's either going to be 2b or not to be

2895
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,880
brilliant thank you

2896
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:06,800
touche or whatever really at least love

2897
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:07,760
it

2898
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,840
i'll give a last comment or blue do you

2899
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,920
want to go first and then to greg for

2900
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,040
the final

2901
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:14,719
um i think that this was you know

2902
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:16,560
especially the last remark was just very

2903

beautiful and very poignant um so thanks

2904

first off if anyone wants to get

2909
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:31,040
involved in active lab hopefully even in

2910
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:32,480
the future if you're watching this we're

2911
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,280
still going to be there to help scaffold

2912
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:38,400
and um yeah greg if you or any

2913
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,159
colleagues or anyone else ever wants to

2914
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:42,000
get involved or do another discussion or

2915
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,679
anything else this was really

2916
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:45,760
a great convo

2917
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,679
beautiful well thank you so much it's a

2918
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:49,360
really honor to be here i really enjoyed

2919
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:52,000
it um i'm interested in us cultivating

2920
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,560
wisdom energy that's that's one way of

2921
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,960
summarizing what the project is here and

2922
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,560
uh for folks that you asked like what

2923
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,159
can we do

2924
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:02,480
ultimately yes look out have some

2925
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:05,360
concern look around at your local garden

2926
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:06,960
and try to cultivate wisdom energy in

2927
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,560
your local garden with your heart

2928
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:10,239
yourself and the other people that you

2929
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:12,560
love in the world and we do that enough

2930
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:15,360
when we might be all right

2931
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,119
and we have the ontology working group

2932
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:18,400
in the lab

2933
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,320
for when that's not all right right well

2934
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,719
this and i and as a theorist that's

2935
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:24,480
absolutely essential the ontology the

2936
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:26,800
failure of ontology enlightenment gap is

2937
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,719
part of why we're in the mess if

2938
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:30,320
we can get this ontology right we can

2939
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,719
get on the right path 100

2940
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:35,360
thank you greg talk to you later see you

2941
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:39,440
blue thank you brilliant take care okay
