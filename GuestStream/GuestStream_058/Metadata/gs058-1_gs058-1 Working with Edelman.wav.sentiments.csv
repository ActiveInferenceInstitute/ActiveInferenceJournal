8010	9520	A	0.9111373424530029	Hello and welcome, everybody.
10130	14078	A	0.9141311645507812	It is September 19, 2023.
14244	26870	A	0.8628681898117065	We're here at the active inference Institute in guest stream 58.1, and today the session will be around the experiences of those who have worked with Gerald Edelman.
27370	42700	A	0.6870541572570801	Edelman lived from 1929 to 2014, and as hopefully this conversation can explore and unpack a little bit, worked in various areas related to the brain, body, and mind.
43150	59726	A	0.8978033661842346	So without further ado, I will have our guests introduce themselves, give a little bit of a background on how they came to be working with Professor Edelman, and then we have several prepared questions and several other questions.
59828	65380	A	0.9412079453468323	So thank you all for joining, and perhaps, Andrew, if you'd like to begin.
66710	69950	B	0.8079761266708374	All right, so I'll just start a little bit with my background.
70030	82370	B	0.9295336604118347	I did my PhD at University of Minnesota, and then I did my postdoc at Hopkins with Apostles Georgopoulos and Vernon Macassel.
82970	93610	B	0.7890325784683228	And then I got a job in Phoenix working in a small neuroscience institute or neuroscience department at a hospital.
94030	97100	B	0.8490347862243652	And I worked there for six or seven years.
97550	113810	B	0.629625141620636	And my interest was working with non human primates with monkeys and studying how they reached for different objects and drew objects and then looked at the activity in primary motor cortex neurons.
114470	135350	B	0.7925087809562683	And we carried out different kinds of analysis based on the directionality of the neurons in motor cortex built populations and were able to actually look at these neural signals and see how they corresponded in a pretty exact way to the way the animals are moved in time and space.
135500	137110	B	0.7337367534637451	In other words, trajectories.
137710	157946	B	0.970666766166687	And after working there six or seven years, I was invited to come and look at this new institute that Gerald Edelman was establishing in San Diego in La Jolla and met a bunch of super interesting people like Guilio Tononi and Olof Sporns.
158138	166100	B	0.9415743947029114	And really, their deep intellect and curiosity and creativity has convinced me to move to.
170070	172290	B	0.8316429853439331	I ended up moving there.
172360	188570	B	0.9504203796386719	And so Edelman was able to build this gorgeous research facility on the Tory Pines cliffs, basically, and it was a magnificent architecture.
188990	202374	B	0.8857981562614441	And he recruited a number of people besides sparns and Tononi, and so he divided the group into theorists and experimentalists.
202422	211818	B	0.5222229361534119	And I was an experimentalist, but we would have lunch every day together as a group and discuss different topics.
211994	227378	B	0.5025540590286255	And I was really exposed to a whole new way of thinking about neuroscience in terms of sort of the cognitive aspects of it, which I still have difficulty with, to tell you personally, because I don't even know how you define cognition.
227554	234760	B	0.5270186066627502	And I'm not sure that anybody really can, or as Vernon Machasto would say, I don't know the answer to that, nor does anybody else.
235610	238540	B	0.6518797278404236	Maybe Karl would take issue with that.
239230	254846	B	0.9792349338531494	But anyway, the coolest thing about it was being really exposed to a lot of creative thinking and deep intellectual endeavors, and I've really never regretted the seven or eight years I spent there.
254948	272290	B	0.8447418808937073	I think it really helped change the way my career went from being sort of a motor control strict, sort of very careful scientist to using my imagination a lot more than I would have otherwise.
273350	275060	B	0.7172985076904297	So I'll leave it at that.
278040	278790	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
279480	289004	C	0.7093166708946228	Cheng Ming okay, yeah, I can speak about my journey with Dr.
289042	289800	C	0.6864174008369446	Edelman.
289960	292424	C	0.891139805316925	So I was originally from Taiwan.
292472	297644	C	0.8632313013076782	I graduated with a medical degree in Taiwan university in 78.
297762	300744	C	0.8764000535011292	But I was very interested in doing basic science.
300872	309948	C	0.8701778054237366	So I applied a PhD program and got into Rock Federal University and that started to search for a laboratory.
310044	312000	C	0.7295747399330139	And certainly Dr.
312070	324352	C	0.9331943392753601	Ederman is very powerful intellectual capacity building in the building it was on 9th floor of the Bronx laboratory.
324416	325504	C	0.9733215570449829	I was very impressed.
325552	328360	C	0.8138424158096313	So I joined the laboratory.
329180	342680	C	0.9279636144638062	So since 78 to 83 I was a PhD student and I was working on the topic called neural cell adhesion molecule.
342840	347688	C	0.5625293254852295	So at that time Edelman already got his Nobel prize for immunoglobulin.
347784	356364	C	0.6810696721076965	But he would be usually elegant way would say I solved molecular recognition.
356492	361676	C	0.497454434633255	So he said I don't want to stay in immunology to collect more awards.
361788	365248	C	0.8199842572212219	He said I will work out cell recognition.
365424	373780	C	0.8644463419914246	So in his mind how cell recognition work is through a group of adhesion molecular interaction.
374120	383068	C	0.9105571508407593	So that's how he started to work on the cell adhesion molecule and duty's house actually work out the chicken cell adhesion molecular.
383184	392480	C	0.8780966997146606	So when I joined the laboratory, my PhD things was work out the first mammalian cell adhesion molecule.
392660	406000	C	0.9010247588157654	And in addition to NCAM, though, I supposed to work out on these adhesion molecule mediating the Neurolog cell recognition as he said he would say.
406150	416388	C	0.554832935333252	I asked him also after all what would be my PhD thesis and he would say ming, when I start to write a poem, I don't know how it's going to end.
416554	419812	C	0.7366952300071716	That's the way he would put his language there.
419946	428808	C	0.7922983765602112	So he just figured out retinal tectoprojection I'm hardworking student so I would work out on that.
428974	445592	C	0.8531123995780945	And as you know, these days our so called systems biology approach, right, is these transcriptome single cell RNA sequencing to identify a non biased way to identify molecules involved.
445736	452160	C	0.8946064114570618	At that time the so called systems biology approach was making monoclonal antibodies.
452820	467968	C	0.8490721583366394	So I would be there taking out the brain and the retina and the tectum and produce I produce 18 batch of the monochromatic antibody against these neuronal cell membranes.
468064	478200	C	0.6208678483963013	So I certainly have identified a lot of adhesion molecule but none of them really show a very distinct pattern these days.
478270	487720	C	0.84956955909729	I think the field using the transcription factors was able to identify some patterns but at that later it's kind of all altogether.
488540	499820	C	0.5183767080307007	But I remember that actually anyway, I didn't really figure out retinol technical projection but that's enough for me to graduate.
500160	510316	C	0.9126080870628357	But at that time I also still remember how I actually had a great impact on my professional career.
510428	517120	C	0.8951112031936646	So I was cutting chicken spinal cord cross section to mapping these cell adhesion molecules.
517720	527700	C	0.9490665197372437	So I have some feather chicken feather hanging outside there, and they stand with this NCAM with the most beautiful, exquisite pattern.
529420	538484	C	0.8932223320007324	Later work on the feather as my major research model, kind of as a rosetta song to understand the language of morphogenesis.
538612	541192	C	0.6965482234954834	But there I remember how I started that.
541246	544056	C	0.8378819823265076	You have these feather, they form these branches.
544168	547320	C	0.8822073340415955	So these branches are actually originally formed cells.
547400	549420	C	0.5566712617874146	Then they die to become space.
549570	553048	C	0.7655079960823059	But before they die, they actually light up with NCM.
553144	557504	C	0.9482101202011108	Light up with NCM with the most exquisite pattern there.
557702	561260	C	0.8441486954689026	So you kind of say, okay, you're going to carve out this region.
561340	567472	C	0.5658349990844727	You light up with NCM, you light up with sonic, and then other signal coming to say you die.
567536	570240	C	0.7024945020675659	But before they die, they light up that pattern.
570320	572656	C	0.9649879932403564	So the feather pattern is very exquisite.
572768	576700	C	0.8247590661048889	Radio symmetry, bilateral symmetry, bilateral symmetry.
576800	581400	C	0.9511984586715698	So Adam was very impressed by those findings.
585260	593964	C	0.9404370188713074	I appreciate he actually encouraged that when he sees something, he appreciates he encouraged it.
594002	597548	C	0.5882525444030762	He didn't say, oh, you're supposed to work on the brain or whatever.
597634	598828	C	0.7173094749450684	He actually like it.
598914	611516	C	0.6388282775878906	And subsequently he also developed this idea of topobiology, which he would acknowledge to say it's sort of based on the very exquisite pattern we found in the feather.
611628	613804	C	0.7065731287002563	But of course he developed it further.
613932	621424	C	0.554242730140686	But some other time he would say, if this is not in feather, I am adamant I'm going to get another Nobel Prize.
621552	622804	C	0.9175038933753967	So I like it.
622842	625136	C	0.6218734383583069	Let him encourage that direction.
625248	635048	C	0.532939612865448	So later when I became independent, I sort of say, okay, brain is wonderful, but it's all like being curved inside.
635134	638324	C	0.8770221471786499	I don't figure it out, but I'm not that smart.
638372	642008	C	0.7719073295593262	But I might be able to figure out feather pattern formation.
642184	645180	C	0.8626255393028259	So I have a reasonable, successful career.
645520	657708	C	0.9022390246391296	Figure out the able debo of the feather, but as I said, not just feather itself, but use feather as a rosetta stone to figure out morphogenesis.
657884	665010	C	0.8420749306678772	And that sort of I think I appreciate that he's encouraged on that.
665480	672548	C	0.8664186596870422	Also, as you know, the stem cell biology comes along and the feather in a bird baby chicken is one way.
672634	680492	C	0.8465714454650879	Adult chicken, male, female, all looks differently, but they are all from the same group of the stem cell that my lab have stemon straight.
680576	696780	C	0.884728193283081	So it is the so called stem cell niche would be modulated by sex hormone, by age, by season, by temperature, and let them help you produce different feather forms to adapt to the environment.
697760	703260	C	0.9441700577735901	I think I enjoy my research career and it was obviously have his impact.
703340	721716	C	0.8505237102508545	And I think he's intellectually brilliant and always encouraged going after fundamental principles, saying that if you're going to work on a question, ask most profound questions and approach with the most available technology, current technology of the day.
721818	724996	C	0.720255970954895	Don't waste your time on small questions.
725178	731850	C	0.7679632902145386	And I think I have taken those in so I can stay up to here and we can discuss more later.
733740	734488	A	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
734574	735112	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
735246	737352	A	0.5669911503791809	Karl hi.
737406	746300	D	0.5245283246040344	So my name is Karl Friston, and like my two colleagues, I found my stay with Jerry Edelman both foundational and very, very formative.
747040	751820	D	0.5509012341499329	I was quite early in my research career when I joined the neuroscience Institute.
752580	755900	D	0.8212862610816956	Having trained as a psychiatrist, I got into brain imaging.
756060	776792	D	0.8204560279846191	And at the inception of brain imaging, people were for the first time discovering principles of functional brain organization, such as the principle of functional segregation and subsequently principles of integration, how segregated specialized parts of the brain communicate or are coordinated or are integrated together.
776926	788180	D	0.9098379015922546	And one of the key theoreticians and neuroanatomists that authored this particular interpretation and deployment of neuroimaging was Semir Zeki.
788260	789608	D	0.6853659749031067	And semir zeki.
789704	813040	D	0.6625141501426697	For those of you who don't know, he's still very active, one of the architects of neuroaesthetics in his late retirement now, but he was friendly with Jerry Edelman, and Semi was famed for understanding the computational anatomy of early visual cortex and visual cortical hierarchies.
814120	818180	D	0.8193395733833313	And I repeat, the principles of functional specialization and integration.
819000	839390	D	0.8519917130470276	So after a couple of years at the inception of human brain mapping, using positron emission tomography and establishing, for example, the color center in a particular part of the visual cortex, I was effectively sent to New York.
840080	848924	D	0.94520103931427	So my period of engagement was a fellowship between about 1990 and 1992 93.
849042	865484	D	0.9057003259658813	So this slightly predates Andy, and it covered the translocation of the Neurosciences Institute from the Rockefeller University to La Jolla and under the auspices of the script.
865532	887188	D	0.5961095690727234	So I spent half my fellowship at the Rockefeller and then subsequently watched the building of the magnificent neuroscientist Institute on North Tory Pines Road that Andy referred to with the auditorium, if I remember, designed by imported experts in audition and music and sound engineering from Sweden.
887364	889470	D	0.9768979549407959	It was really an amazing place.
889920	909024	D	0.8397427797317505	I do remember a couple of lunches before I returned to the UK to pursue my career in imaging neuroscience under the auspices of the welcome Trust, but only a couple because we were sort of in rented accommodation from the script on the other side of the road.
909142	919860	D	0.9234853982925415	But it was an awe inspiring bit of architecture, both intellectually and practically in terms of the early days of the Neuroscience Institute.
920360	930292	D	0.5374850034713745	So I was sent there basically because Sami Zecki thought it would be good for me to go and work with Jerry Adelman retrospectively.
930356	931464	D	0.9224072694778442	I now appreciate that.
931502	947390	D	0.8558924794197083	I was sent there to replace a gentleman called Reed Montague, who had been tasked with on the pure theory side, as opposed to the celadesian molecule and the wet lab side of Edelman's research.
948160	964512	D	0.9047014713287354	On the pure theory side, the point of my arrival, and to a certain extent at the point of Reed's brief exposure to the neuroscientist institute, the theory of neuronal group selection was becoming consolidated.
964656	989756	D	0.5912986397743225	And in particular, what drove the selection of neuronal groups, neuro ensembles, cell assemblies, however you want to describe them, and given Edelman's polchamp for incredibly incisive and straightforward but very creative biological thinking.
989858	1022272	D	0.8650873899459839	He thought, well, it's obviously some kind of natural selection and therefore there must be the homologue of adaptive fitness that is underwriting the scaffolding and the dynamic structuring of connectivity or connections that were definitive of in the spirit of functional specialization, segregation, but also the mediator of functional integration of these neuronal groups.
1022416	1026230	D	0.8740699291229248	So this became known generically as value.
1026620	1039280	D	0.8345259428024292	So Reed was working on value dependent learning the plasticity and the principles that underwrite which synaptic connections have the right kind of adaptive fitness in their mileage.
1039300	1051588	D	0.8324663043022156	In that context that enabled them to persist and other connections went away and became or contributed to the sparse coupling of neural networks.
1051784	1059840	D	0.6600789427757263	And then Reed, and we can talk about the glorious stories about the departure of Reed.
1060260	1075664	D	0.8439827561378479	Reed actually ended up in a rather circuitous way with Terry Sejnowski at the Salk subsequently, then hooked up with people like Peter Diane and Wolfram Schultz, who at that time was in Zurich.
1075792	1085304	D	0.526417076587677	And of course the story that emerged from that was the reward prediction error story that actually, ironically, Reed did not.
1085342	1091148	D	0.8527169227600098	But a number of Wolfram eventually got the brain prize for some decade or so later.
1091314	1095176	D	0.8766878843307495	But the inception of that story was actually at the Rockefeller.
1095368	1122816	D	0.8831802606582642	And it was basically an attempt by, I think, Reed to formalize the principles that must be in play to make the theory of neural group selection under what was an important dynamic from Edelman's point of view, which is this notion of reentrant dynamics.
1122848	1140620	D	0.6623764634132385	So very, very early on he had identified the fundamental importance of recurrent connectivity and reentry as very formative in the emergence of these structured groups and the associated functional specialization.
1141840	1165564	D	0.7206937074661255	Just open brackets, just to point out that you could claim that certainly his early conversations with people at that time sort of preempted stuff in computational neuroscience that we now take as for granted, not really realizing where it came from, but certainly his work with Vernon Mancast.
1165612	1168116	D	0.7101454734802246	I'm sure Andy will be able to speak to this later on.
1168138	1175552	D	0.8864872455596924	On the importance of reentry and dynamics and oscillations in the formation of these groups and sort of cortical.
1175616	1176848	D	0.6799010038375854	Columns and the like.
1176954	1187800	D	0.644871175289154	That was sort of, I think, the monographs that they not the monographs, but the papers and the articles they wrote at that time I think were quite visionary.
1188380	1197816	D	0.6135315299034119	Steven Grossberg was also hanging around a few years earlier, and I think you could probably claim that between the two of them, they invented computational neuroscience.
1197928	1220672	D	0.8882932662963867	Certainly know New York, Boston, sort of East Coast kind of style of computational neuroscience, closely involved with something called the Neuroscience Research Foundation, so that they, as I understand it and again, Andy may want to correct me here, but this was like the forerunner of the Society for Neuroscience.
1220736	1222052	D	0.7966581583023071	It was a group of people.
1222186	1242872	D	0.680900514125824	People, and perhaps Max Cowan is the name that comes to mind, people who actually invented words like neuroscience, which wasn't a thing, certainly when I was applying to my undergraduate studies and trying to create institutions, academic institutions, that would endorse this notion of neuroscience.
1242936	1246072	D	0.7841030359268188	And the Neuroscience Research Foundation was like the old guard.
1246216	1254940	D	0.6755279898643494	And then the Young Turks came along and reacted against the old Guard, the Neuroscience Research Foundation, to form the Society for Neuroscience.
1255020	1257296	D	0.7997646927833557	And then we all know the story since that time.
1257318	1261120	D	0.7617414593696594	It's one of the biggest societies in academia.
1261860	1281336	D	0.6198551654815674	So just making the point that Aidelman and his colleagues and vicarious colleagues, a lot of people, oliver Sacks being one, ernst Mer being another of his favorite sort of characters to talk to, all of whom would come and visit, and we were privileged just to listen in.
1281358	1301816	D	0.7002653479576111	And conversations in this very formative time where some of the sort of, I think, conceptual pillars of the way that we understand neuroscience in the 21st century were first articulated, probably not using quite the same words that we use nowadays.
1301848	1311724	D	0.5532740354537964	So no one talks about reentry anymore, so about recurrent neural networks or sort of feed forward and feedback and the like, but the same underlying dynamics.
1311772	1313312	D	0.5066933631896973	And maths, I think, is absolutely there.
1313366	1319700	D	0.8402144908905029	Anyway, I was brought in to replace Reed Montague, so that was my little contribution.
1320520	1335476	D	0.5330414772033691	Whilst we were in the Rockefeller, I made the mistake of thinking that the right way to do this was to actually write down equations and try and sort of naturalize it in terms of mathematics.
1335588	1337604	D	0.8102265000343323	Edelman was a great biological thinker.
1337652	1342372	D	0.7420037984848022	He was not a very good mathematical thinker, so there was a bit of a clash there.
1342446	1352130	D	0.896416962146759	So I remember one meeting very early on when it was being decided what I was going to be doing.
1353060	1358192	D	0.8408119082450867	Perhaps it's useful just to say the context in which those early meetings took place.
1358326	1362140	D	0.9073830842971802	So Andy has already mentioned Guilio Tononi and Olaf spawns.
1362220	1369140	D	0.8005138039588928	They were two key people, edelman's young men who already in sight, you.
1369290	1375060	D	0.7748481035232544	And then I replaced Reed, and they were working really purely on theory.
1375480	1386564	D	0.8344439268112183	And that theory was tested in the context of a forerunner of supercomputing, a hypercube that was driving, in my day, little robots.
1386612	1406640	D	0.6079884767532349	So, again, Edelman was doing neurobotics in the 1980s in exactly the same way that people now in developmental neurobotics are still addressing exactly the same questions, probably with the same kind of computer infrastructure that obviously upgraded.
1407700	1427220	D	0.5471718311309814	So we were sitting around and Edelman was called out to take a phone call from Germany, and there was a look of horror on people's faces because I'd suggested a relationship between value dependent learning and the riskola Wagner rule from behavioral psychology.
1427880	1433112	D	0.7895988821983337	And as soon as you mention an equation or a formula, that set Edelman off.
1433166	1437450	D	0.6159307360649109	And I didn't know that, so I didn't know I pushed the wrong button.
1437820	1442056	D	0.5942273139953613	So when Edelman came back in, I was effectively rusticated.
1442168	1458848	D	0.6137980818748474	I was prevented from doing any work for three months and for every day, afternoon and morning I had to sit in the Rockefeller library and read purely biological great texts, and I ended up having to.
1458934	1462844	D	0.8886847496032715	The last one was The Growth of Biological Thought by Ernst Mayer.
1462892	1473910	D	0.5989483594894409	I had to read from page to page, and when I did so, I had become sufficiently sanitized to be allowed back into the workplace to actually do some work anyway.
1474280	1477108	D	0.7718414068222046	So that was our contribution.
1477284	1495528	D	0.8386622071266174	And then when we moved to the whole parade of 16 Wheeler traxxas, translocating all the kit and all the paperwork to La Jolla, and then relocating out there, settling down, I brought that work to closure.
1495624	1518784	D	0.579093337059021	And interesting, that was at the point when Giulio well, Olaf, I remember him saying what he wants is basically to understand and simulate the brain in a way that draws explanatory power from the architecture of the connectivity.
1518912	1528776	D	0.7417605519294739	Basically, we say he wants to establish connectomics as a discipline, and of course, ten years later, he's Mr.
1528878	1530196	D	0.6991616487503052	Connectomics.
1530388	1558080	D	0.8699576258659363	Julio at that point was inventing integrated information theory with a particular focus on information, theoretical formulations of complexity, and what special, if you like, counterintuitive behaviors, do you get from these biologically configured connectors when you put dynamics on structure and trying to quantify that in a way that ultimately transpired to be measures like phi in IIT.
1558820	1568036	D	0.7049176692962646	So that was a fun time as the mathematician, closet mathematician, because I wasn't allowed to say anything about the maths at the time.
1568218	1569364	D	0.9654834866523743	I enjoyed that bit.
1569402	1582148	D	0.7456290125846863	And so looking being in at the, if you like, ground zero at the inception of all these aspirations, which eventually led to very fruitful careers.
1582244	1587400	D	0.7738631367683411	And then I went back to the UK.
1587740	1595710	D	0.6459919214248657	Just had fond memories and non fond memories, but both of a nostalgic sort since that time.
1598080	1598830	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
1599360	1600712	A	0.8842300176620483	Great tales.
1600776	1603416	A	0.9188916683197021	Changming or Andrew, anything you want to add?
1603458	1605490	A	0.8635913729667664	Or I can go to one of the questions.
1606180	1614196	B	0.5423597097396851	Well, just to expound a little bit on what Karl was saying, I don't know if you can see this book.
1614298	1631960	B	0.9121202230453491	Okay, so this was something that came out of the neuroscience research program that was sort of the old boys club that Francis Schmidt started at MIT and later was the basis for the neurosciences Institute.
1632300	1635716	B	0.8234863877296448	And what this was was sort of the who's who in neuroscience.
1635828	1639964	B	0.8228248357772827	So, again, if you look at this book, it says, edited by Francis O.
1640002	1640472	B	0.7697612643241882	Schmidt.
1640536	1642510	B	0.6626399755477905	So he was the guy that started that.
1645120	1651870	B	0.7746643424034119	This persisted even throughout the 2000s.
1654340	1663244	B	0.9181504249572754	Once or twice a year at the neurosciences Institute, they would organize one of these meetings, and it would be a who's who of neuroscience.
1663372	1672404	B	0.6170674562454224	So all the Nobel laureates in neuroscience, all the big names, would come for a four or five day meeting and talk about their research.
1672522	1679464	B	0.6572020053863525	And as a member of the neurosciences Institute, I got to sit in and meet these people.
1679662	1689948	B	0.8110072612762451	And it was phenomenal, especially with my background, because I was sort of not on the mainstream of neuroscience at that point.
1690114	1693416	B	0.9586998224258423	And that was really fascinating.
1693528	1702380	B	0.5081709027290344	So you got to meet people like Wolf Schultz and all the big names that were there, francis Crick.
1705540	1711964	B	0.767230212688446	But what I want to go back to is this original book by Edelman and Mac Castle called The Mindful Brain.
1712092	1724736	B	0.8585959076881409	This is sort of like one of the bibles of early creative thinking about brain function, and it presaged the idea of distributed systems.
1724768	1728650	B	0.8070583939552307	This was sort of the thing that Vernon Moncasso was very much into.
1729660	1744248	B	0.7202703952789307	And so to this day, the way most people think about brain function is boxes, where each part of the brain is confined to a box, and then there are arrows pointed to other boxes.
1744424	1747880	B	0.5702849626541138	And so we get this idea that there's a circuitry.
1747960	1764710	B	0.7760528326034546	So you often hear neuroscientists talk about circuits, and that kind of comes from the idea that you have these boxes and you have arrows and you have plus and minus signs with the arrows, and then somehow the pluses and minuses add up and tell you what's going to happen at the next box.
1765880	1774612	B	0.801882803440094	And that is nice because you can kind of simplify things and talk about causality in very concrete terms.
1774666	1784808	B	0.4275132119655609	And it's great if you're an engineer, because you can write transfer functions about defining how you get an output from an input, but that's not the way the brain works.
1784974	1809040	B	0.8550037145614624	And I think Kyle can attest to the early days of MRI studies where everybody was doing pseudocolored representations of these different areas to see which area would light up a particular task, as if each area had a specific job and could be assigned to a specific task.
1811140	1837850	B	0.6189740896224976	Neuroscience in general is still suffering from that point of view, and it's only become a little bit more clear as computational science has matured in the last five or ten years, especially with the adaptation of artificial neural networks to the mainstream, that we can start to explore more biological meaningful ways of brain function.
1838460	1861090	B	0.8738167881965637	And Vernon Macassill recognized that as sort of the I would say the founder of systems neuroscience, modern systems neuroscience, and Edelman talked about that a little know, there's group theory and some of the things that OLEF has started.
1862740	1885060	B	0.6056203246116638	With graph theory still sort of based on strict anatomical you know, if you read like Olaf's latest review, where the field is starting to progress away from that constraint of anatomical connectivity, we're starting to get more toward the idea of truly distributed systems.
1885220	1887508	B	0.9889147877693176	And to me, that's super exciting.
1887604	1906092	B	0.6469835638999939	But you can look back to this book from the see that the seed was planted way back then and see how almost 50 years later, now, it's finally starting to evolve into something that's becoming more mainstream.
1906236	1921140	B	0.7298637628555298	And if you sort of look at the evolution of neuroscience, I think if you project ahead to the next ten or 20 years, this is going to be really the fundamental change in the way we think about neural function.
1921290	1930260	B	0.9828221201896667	And I'm super excited about that and you look and sort of back in history to see how that's evolved.
1930420	1937130	B	0.8711557388305664	And I don't know, I think there's something very attractive about thinking about things that way.
1939040	1939452	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
1939506	1949150	C	0.5585189461708069	Okay, I'll add something, I think, talking about Edema's, the brilliance about seeing things through.
1949920	1950524	C	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
1950562	1959410	C	0.6739136576652527	In the neurobiology field, you people still sort of think the neuro Darwinism idea is still there, right?
1960500	1970176	C	0.8700604438781738	So that was the time when I was with him in Rockefeller University he would talk things like know Darwinism for evolution species.
1970288	1975088	C	0.8153464794158936	And he saw that in immunoglobulin chronos selection.
1975184	1979290	C	0.8553357720375061	So he applied to this neurodarwinism idea.
1979660	1990940	C	0.8354585766792297	But I have to say, subsequently, actually, my career is mainly in university, Southern California and working on this morphogenesis tissue patent formation.
1991360	1996376	C	0.908638596534729	And in our field, sort of more bench work aspect of Edelman.
1996488	2008300	C	0.8472540974617004	This direction, not the neurobiology direction, but in the field, there were people originally more talking about the stem cells are predetermined and then they go this lineage.
2008380	2009996	C	0.8346271514892578	They go this lineage.
2010188	2012688	C	0.6244280934333801	But we using the skin as a model.
2012774	2017888	C	0.824572741985321	Actually, I start to write these things kind of a Darwinism within the skin.
2017984	2022992	C	0.745498776435852	I mean, basically it's that there is no preset forever stem cells.
2023056	2028772	C	0.7046891450881958	If you wipe out these stem cells, other cells are waiting there to take over the space.
2028906	2036772	C	0.6867120862007141	So there is even during development and during regeneration to make the tissue patterning process robust.
2036916	2049068	C	0.8025687336921692	There is a small so called Darwinism competition going on in there and that is sort of also influencing our work in morphogenesis these days.
2049154	2056050	C	0.8822659850120544	And I think that's kind of the impact of him on this aspect as well.
2059550	2060300	C	0.7093686461448669	Wow.
2060990	2061658	A	0.4896697998046875	All right.
2061744	2063114	A	0.7614481449127197	I'll read a question.
2063232	2065170	A	0.9148477911949158	This was from Dave Douglas.
2065350	2080100	A	0.6374207735061646	Dave wrote, we know that Professor Edelman used deep analogies in exploring new subjects as in his leveraging his knowledge of immunology and organismal development to probe conceptualization and learning.
2080470	2085506	A	0.8607611656188965	Did he ever work specifically on metaphor and analogy as such?
2085688	2095990	A	0.8476739525794983	For example, did he leverage his experience of music and poetry to dig out scientific facts while separating fertile from sterile analogies?
2100490	2104060	A	0.8635157346725464	An answer or just what that makes you think of?
2107470	2113078	D	0.5858820676803589	It makes me think of something which Edelman used to call me, which I am an intellectual thug.
2113174	2117774	D	0.8177430629730225	So I'm sure that there's a great answer to that.
2117812	2118830	D	0.5441713929176331	Excellent question.
2118980	2122906	D	0.8325416445732117	And it does speak to Edelman's skills and interests.
2122938	2140100	D	0.8154194355010986	As a violinist, I do remember that BBC Horizon came to do a profile on him and his ideas and it was prefaced with, I think, shots of him playing the violin to concert standard.
2140490	2151106	D	0.5776218771934509	But I have absolutely no idea whether he used that sort of part of his life to take things beyond metaphor.
2151138	2159980	D	0.6262736320495605	So as an intellectual thug, I'm going to hand over to my two colleagues to see whether they can give a more elegant answer.
2167530	2171130	A	0.8311014771461487	Or anything in that area of the arts.
2171550	2174410	A	0.6714726090431213	And you brought up poetry.
2175710	2178890	A	0.8829931616783142	Anything in the arts and sciences?
2181890	2193950	C	0.6635776162147522	Well, I'm no brain biologist, but just to say that from my side of the interaction, he really tried to merge science and art.
2194100	2198100	C	0.5007950067520142	He would think a real science would be beautiful.
2198950	2201202	C	0.7022418975830078	And that's the way I think when I learn.
2201256	2211554	C	0.7043348550796509	As I mentioned, when I say, oh, I was expecting a more clear cut CC's idea, but he would say Ming is like writing a poetry.
2211602	2215320	C	0.6646038293838501	He said, When I start, I don't know where it's going to end.
2216010	2221926	C	0.7461127042770386	It's like some artists when you ask them how do you create this painting?
2222038	2233738	C	0.6022623181343079	I try to ask this question to some of my friends who are artists and they say they do not have a clear blueprint of how that painting would looks like.
2233824	2243258	C	0.7954013347625732	They have an idea, it's kind of floating in the sky and they try to grab it down, so they paint on the way and try to make it into a painting.
2243354	2249922	C	0.6845635771751404	Or I have a friend who are poets, I ask them this, they say they grab the word to make them coming down.
2250056	2256100	C	0.6999355554580688	And I kind of feel adamant sort of treat the scientific idea like that.
2257370	2265080	C	0.6741817593574524	This is my superficial interaction, just some experience.
2266730	2270202	B	0.5807368755340576	I don't have a direct reply to that.
2270256	2279654	B	0.5438348054885864	But in general, I think there's the idea of creativity that he brought to the forefront.
2279782	2290670	B	0.801112711429596	And then also with that creativity, you have to have a certain amount of courage to move out of the sort of mainstream, right?
2290740	2296420	B	0.6468547582626343	So if you have an idea and you have to have a certain amount of courage to put that forward.
2298950	2299314	C	0.5541274547576904	If.
2299352	2302270	B	0.7650474905967712	That idea is creative and out of the ordinary.
2302430	2310760	B	0.589573085308075	And I think artists and sort of really great scientists have that in common.
2313370	2322490	A	0.6562259197235107	Maybe to that nexus of creativity and career development and courage for you or just in the environment.
2322910	2330140	A	0.8802922964096069	How did his mentoring help bring out these threads in people?
2332130	2333870	A	0.5377376675605774	For better and for worse?
2334210	2336318	B	0.8423669934272766	I think Karl could attest to that.
2336404	2341950	B	0.7912459373474121	I have a hard time viewing Edelman as a feel good mentor.
2343490	2346242	B	0.8046391606330872	I think he would throw ideas out there.
2346296	2353460	B	0.9351916313171387	He could be pretty aggressive and I would say frightening to young people.
2354790	2363190	B	0.6883888840675354	So I wouldn't cast Edelman's behavior as sort of the typical mentor.
2364490	2376970	B	0.8747130036354065	But again, I think the environment that he created was someplace that was really special and reflected that kind of courageous creativity.
2378350	2380394	B	0.9626856446266174	And I really appreciate that.
2380432	2381020	B	0.5223946571350098	Now.
2383330	2390362	D	0.9594956040382385	Just to endorse that notion of courageous creativity, I think it's a really nice observation.
2390506	2405026	D	0.7912579774856567	I've often reflected on whether let's take for example, Julio and Olaf, and I think you could probably apply it to me and Andy and a number of other people as well.
2405048	2419990	D	0.7643791437149048	But if we just take Julio and Olaf, who've both become world leaders, thought leaders in their own particular field, having brought something new to the table, and in some instances in more than one area.
2420060	2432846	D	0.9153375029563904	So Julia TENone, in terms of sleep research and synaptic Homeostasis in terms of his work in consciousness studies, integrated information theory, olaf in.
2432868	2437920	D	0.7151280641555786	Terms of structural function and mean.
2438450	2442880	D	0.5694579482078552	Is it that Edelman had a good eye for bright young men?
2443410	2446510	D	0.7153273224830627	Or is it that bright young men learned how to do this?
2446580	2462774	D	0.6981788873672485	That this was the way to be courageous and to say it's an adversarial in that courage to be creative and to pursue what you have created in a slightly adversarial or at least sort of defensive way, I don't know.
2462812	2479130	D	0.7887049317359924	But what I do know is there was certainly a culture that was established that would allow those kinds of skills to be developed and is referred to them slightly obliquely.
2480590	2486282	D	0.8077234029769897	It was a dark culture and it has to be said, it was a very homophilic culture.
2486346	2488714	D	0.825238823890686	There were no women allowed in this culture.
2488842	2506370	D	0.5528138875961304	So in my time, the culture was really one man and adoring young men and you had to repeatedly affirm that adoration.
2506730	2515058	D	0.9795652627944946	And part of that was really useful and really enjoyable and has already mentioned the lunches.
2515234	2519174	D	0.6988433599472046	Exactly the same regime characterized my stay.
2519212	2530678	D	0.8229939937591553	There was a rigorous routine where all the young men would go off to the New York cafe, would have onion rings and burgers and Aileman would wax lyrical.
2530774	2545306	D	0.6351579427719116	And perhaps this is not art and creativity, but he was artistic in his joke telling, so he'd always have a new joke every lunchtime in a New York diner.
2545498	2550322	D	0.7286610007286072	And that was a routine and it was just pure theatre, day after day after day.
2550376	2553150	D	0.6803554892539978	Incredible energy, but it was theater.
2553230	2564370	D	0.737966775894165	The young men were the audience and we basically, I think, were dancing to his orchestration.
2564450	2567510	D	0.8393923044204712	He was the conductor and he was the director.
2570490	2587678	D	0.6775773167610168	It's possible that that culture did actually instill in all of us, and particularly Olaf and Julio, the notion that to make it to make a difference and to be true to one's convictions, you really have to sort of fight for and autonomously pursue what you want to do.
2587764	2600930	D	0.6153584718704224	And it is interesting that the style in which both Julia and Olaf have pursued their scientific ideology and ideas and creativity is very much slightly lonesome.
2601910	2617222	D	0.8273829221725464	With the exception of Julia's work in the molecular biology of sleep, the theoretical contributions are very sort of associated with them personally, to a certain extent, with me.
2617276	2629446	D	0.8660828471183777	And what one could argue is the mathematical version of value dependent learning, which would be the free energy principle.
2629558	2638830	D	0.542523980140686	All of these things have the same flavor as neural Darwinism, or as some people used to call it, neuralmanism.
2639890	2660422	D	0.652682900428772	So I often ask that question was this the skill of Edelman in choosing people who are going to make a difference or did he basically provide a culture in which it gave people the tools or the motivation or the confidence that you can make a difference because you saw him make a difference?
2660556	2661560	D	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
2663690	2666566	C	0.7228857278823853	I think both of you actually said something.
2666668	2667910	C	0.7294459342956543	I shared the experience.
2668060	2671662	C	0.7349951267242432	Definitely he set up a right environment.
2671826	2675702	C	0.7377731800079346	But just like when we do stem cell, stem cell and its niche.
2675766	2676982	C	0.800957202911377	You need the interaction.
2677046	2682246	C	0.7767427563667297	You need a conversation between epiphelia and the methanchyma cells or in the brain.
2682278	2687098	C	0.8920534253120422	I heard it's more like interaction between neuronal cells and gulia cells.
2687194	2697758	C	0.6974719166755676	So a successful interaction would lead, whatever the process, to move forward, but not every process would be successful.
2697854	2705950	C	0.8830174207687378	So, as said, I also like the way Karl mentioned about Edelman is the conductor.
2706030	2708818	C	0.8915116786956787	He actually said that in our meeting at the time.
2708904	2711570	C	0.8606863617897034	He said, Edelman, I'm the conductor.
2712390	2718358	C	0.8392918705940247	You guys is my symphony, prayers, and you pray together.
2718444	2720300	C	0.8485308289527893	You can make a good music.
2721630	2729180	C	0.4957435727119446	But it's also true not every interaction works, because I was with him for almost eight years or so.
2729710	2732006	C	0.6153271198272705	Not every person work, let's put it that way.
2732048	2733120	C	0.5585741400718689	That is a fact.
2733490	2735694	C	0.6763787269592285	So some work, some don't, right?
2735732	2738398	C	0.5408743619918823	So I think people are given that opportunity.
2738564	2742990	C	0.9605281352996826	And as Andrew said, it's a good, outstanding environment.
2743410	2762390	C	0.9324187636375427	So you pick up the idea from Edelman, you develop yourself and some of them, or you can call it Edmund, then we success in a certain way or not, but I think it's an exciting environment.
2762810	2765814	C	0.7754450440406799	I would put it that way.
2766012	2767030	C	0.6850520968437195	It's both.
2767180	2769000	C	0.8113633990287781	He inspires you.
2769450	2775580	C	0.8101924061775208	He gives you a sort of exciting environment to evolve, but not everyone.
2776430	2779094	C	0.5983836054801941	He can choose everyone to be successful.
2779142	2780474	C	0.5747472643852234	No, it's not like that.
2780592	2789374	C	0.805016815662384	But he did give you that opportunity to be successful and to pick up something, and he also give you that courage to do it.
2789412	2805166	C	0.684111475944519	As I mentioned, people would normally think using the feather as a model is kind of very high risk, but he has that encouragement, and I do that, and I feel I really using Federal as a Rosetta Stone.
2805198	2810214	C	0.6261491775512695	I have learned something for the Morphogenesis patent formation field.
2810332	2810758	C	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
2810844	2813160	C	0.9243382215499878	So I appreciate him for that.
2817480	2818032	B	0.6135208606719971	Andrew.
2818096	2819670	A	0.8250488042831421	Or I can ask another question.
2821820	2824810	B	0.7518035173416138	I really don't have anything to add right now.
2826380	2827610	A	0.7900339365005493	Thank you, though.
2828140	2830250	A	0.9727526307106018	It's really amazing.
2831900	2840972	A	0.5648176670074463	It's such a different world, and the environment of learning and of carrying out science is so different.
2841106	2853168	A	0.7874529361724854	So, personally, I really appreciate just even a window into settings that are elsewhere and in a different time.
2853334	2856800	A	0.9752987623214722	So thank you for all of this.
2856870	2860420	A	0.8889920115470886	All right, I'll ask another question from Dave.
2862760	2872724	A	0.5589749217033386	Professor Edelman was reputed to be skeptical about the risk of abusing mathematical or computer models in creating theories of neural functioning, cognition, and consciousness.
2872852	2878200	A	0.6494707465171814	Some reviewers went so far as to mock him in print for using computers as research tools.
2878700	2888600	A	0.8126689791679382	But he worked with Tanini on the foundations of integrated information theory, an extremely math heavy theory that sometimes explained using computing imagery.
2888760	2896488	A	0.9001542925834656	Did Edelman change his attitude towards the role of math or of computing paradigms in thinking about the mind?
2896674	2905520	A	0.73806232213974	Or did he simply start trusting his colleagues to think computationally without falling into rabbit holes dug by von Neumann and Turing?
2910640	2923520	A	0.8598724007606506	Or how did you see the role of math and computers in Edelman's thinking and research develop over a period where they were also undergoing such rapid developments more broadly.
2924340	2931540	B	0.7082692980766296	So I'm pretty sure that Edelman respected mathematics and computational approaches to neuroscience.
2933320	2938148	B	0.5124972462654114	There certainly were a lot of theory fellows that were computationally savvy.
2938324	2954152	B	0.8665847778320312	While I was at the so, for instance, Karl mentioned these robots that were used to sort of explore and learn, sort of the beginning, I guess, of embodied cognition.
2954216	2964784	B	0.8556294441223145	Karl, you would say, where they explore the environment and learn, and then from that learning, they build internal say.
2964822	2979780	B	0.7453534007072449	And that was Olaf's ballywig, I would say that was highly computational and certainly a major thrust in edelman's emphasis in what he wanted to do at the institute.
2980200	2988744	B	0.8934339880943298	And there were a number of other things, I think, the integrated part that Julio did.
2988782	3012560	B	0.8559399843215942	I think that was almost all Julio's work, along with some of the other computational you know, I think Edelman wanted to be part of that, but that really, I think, was mostly, I think, you know, as part of the culture, edelman managed to get his name on Julio's paper.
3012630	3020610	B	0.6385002732276917	We used to laugh about that quite a bit, but again, I would say that was 99% Julio's work.
3023300	3029030	D	0.5124504566192627	Yeah, I can concur, because I was there when the work was actually done.
3030360	3046532	D	0.7323699593544006	There was a sort of period I can't remember there was some hypothesis that pertained to a core, a dynamical core, as sort of oppression are necessary for some kind of consciousness.
3046596	3068364	D	0.7293094396591187	And I think Ehlmann was comfortable with this sort of intuitive notion of a dynamic core, but when it became articulated in terms of information theory, I think even if he didn't say so out loud, he would have responded as he responded to me, with, oh, you've got mathematosis.
3068492	3084928	D	0.49541550874710083	So this is another of his ways of dealing with people who had a tendency to over mathematicalize and oversimplify, as a physicist would, reducing a horse to a point and then writing down differential equations.
3085024	3086836	D	0.8161207437515259	He was very allergic to that.
3087018	3091812	D	0.8213418126106262	He didn't like that and would call that an instance of mathematosis.
3091956	3100860	D	0.8030571341514587	I think that's very distinct, though, from what Andy was just talking about, which is the commitment to physically realized embodied computation.
3101840	3110412	D	0.5299883484840393	And I think it's a really well observed point that this was embodied cognition circa 1980, 1990.
3110546	3119384	D	0.5336480140686035	So he was quite visionary in, I think, sort of testing out ideas in physical in realized systems.
3119512	3121036	D	0.5491865277290344	You couldn't just hand wave with maths.
3121068	3122544	D	0.7352465391159058	You had to show it worked.
3122662	3126236	D	0.8303894400596619	This idea worked in a real setting.
3126268	3142868	D	0.564492404460907	And at that time, they were the Darwin series to the extent that I, for example, had to spend six months learning to paralyze C in order to program the robot.
3143044	3147972	D	0.6195501685142517	So it wasn't he was frightened of new technology or computer science.
3148116	3151150	D	0.5915368795394897	I think he didn't like trivializing things.
3152400	3168496	D	0.6190991401672363	All a physicist with mathematics, but you would certainly be fully committed to the notion that computation is at the heart of the kind of dynamics that he wanted to understand.
3168678	3174804	D	0.8241817951202393	And underwrote theory and indeed, I think that the theory of neural group selection speaks to that.
3174842	3180740	D	0.675409734249115	He wanted to see it realized in a robot.
3181880	3183684	D	0.6870739459991455	But I think Andy's absolutely right.
3183722	3193800	D	0.8145050406455994	At the point when Julia sort of just basically went straight from the axioms to consciousness and phi with equations.
3194140	3202250	D	0.863066554069519	I think that was the time that Julia had to leave the family, basically, and Julie did so.
3204140	3218720	B	0.5634139180183411	Sort of extrapolated that a little bit think, you know, when I read Edelman's books and some of his papers, I don't understand his, you know, his phrases and his descriptions.
3219060	3220832	B	0.9480769038200378	A lot of things don't make sense.
3220966	3227920	B	0.5006493926048279	If he had written those out or someone had written those out as equations that's the nice thing about equations.
3228000	3232596	B	0.6670153141021729	Once you see the equation, you don't have to worry about the words so much.
3232778	3234484	B	0.536070704460144	Things become pretty clear.
3234682	3252568	B	0.566401481628418	And I think, looking back, if he had been able to do that, I think his ideas, first of all, would have been crystallized in his own mind better and second of all, would have been able to be others would have understood them more clearly.
3252744	3258748	B	0.9309771656990051	And I think that's really important for me.
3258914	3261870	B	0.8694247603416443	Maybe with an engineering background or something.
3262580	3273488	B	0.5050627589225769	If you have a model or if you have an idea, if you can write that out explicitly with an equation, it really clarifies things, it crystallizes things.
3273574	3282452	B	0.6382195353507996	And that was the thing that I liked about Julio's work because again, this word of know, it's like nobody knows what that really means.
3282586	3304124	B	0.7864721417427063	But at least Julio had a form of equations, right, where he was talking about information theory and the know, you could have a cluster where information was internal versus the external information and say, that okay, if you have to have consciousness, here it is.
3304162	3308280	B	0.8268159031867981	And he could describe that with a concrete equation.
3308440	3310364	B	0.8642550110816956	I mean, that's a step forward.
3310562	3322576	B	0.7398979067802429	And again, I always say as someone that records neurons in the brain all the time, if I wanted to find consciousness, how would I know it if I found it, right?
3322678	3325124	B	0.5695298314094543	I mean, if I had an equation, maybe I could do it.
3325162	3329152	B	0.8456725478172302	But just the way it's defined right now, who knows?
3329216	3330644	B	0.750394880771637	I could have already discovered it.
3330682	3331670	B	0.6466006636619568	I wouldn't know.
3332200	3337480	B	0.899592936038971	So I think that's an interesting point.
3337550	3349896	D	0.5781267881393433	Anyway, I can't resist his following up on that because especially evident for me in the remembered present this notion that his words don't actually make any sense.
3350078	3364664	D	0.6472813487052917	I think that's pure poetry and pure brilliance because what I tend to find myself doing is reading the meaning into his ambiguous sentences and finding all sorts of meanings which wouldn't have occurred to me otherwise.
3364712	3366096	D	0.8080648183822632	I think that's part of his art.
3366198	3386068	D	0.5288847088813782	I suspect that he would have been terrified if somebody had actually come along and tried to time down to a clear formal, naturalized mathematical formalism because he wouldn't have had that sort of biotic expressiveness and ambiguity that, of course, is at the heart of his evolutionary thinking.
3386154	3393956	D	0.6678842902183533	But I think it's great that you, Andy, are able to say you don't understand what he wrote, because I look at some of his sentences.
3394068	3396248	D	0.7816118001937866	What on earth is he trying to say here?
3396334	3408648	D	0.8201779127120972	And of course, but the exercise of trying to make sense of Edelman itself brings to the table some really interesting sort of associations and ideas.
3408744	3424880	D	0.7171435356140137	I'm wondering whether that was part of the secret of his success, is that he resisted the temptation to be crystal clear and just left that mystical, magical ambiguity hanging in the air for people like you and me to worry about and try to resolve.
3425560	3429616	B	0.5958669781684875	I suppose he's given that privilege after winning a Nobel Prize.
3429808	3434580	B	0.7226181626319885	I think some of us mere mortals wouldn't be afforded that luxury.
3439490	3441362	A	0.8155601620674133	All right, I'll read a few more questions.
3441416	3442402	A	0.5436630845069885	We can have a few more things.
3442456	3444434	A	0.8010625243186951	So, small questions.
3444632	3451686	A	0.9295486807823181	In the book Topobiology Changming, did you draw the feathers, or is that your work?
3451868	3453574	C	0.7444446086883545	The feather is my work, yeah.
3453612	3455160	C	0.798636794090271	It's based on my work.
3456170	3456920	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
3459370	3478026	A	0.9029362201690674	Well, how do we take things forward in science and in our work here in this level of the fractal with this amazing story and history with Edelman?
3478218	3484410	A	0.8739275932312012	But how do we take our historical and our mentoring context?
3484490	3487294	A	0.7513090372085571	Like, how do you carry that forward?
3487412	3489300	A	0.8555260300636292	Is it something you think about?
3494300	3500680	D	0.8723077178001404	I personally do, and I congratulate myself every day on not being like Edelman when it comes to mentoring.
3505680	3506670	A	0.7630354762077332	How so?
3508560	3515256	D	0.6883983612060547	I'm not going to answer the how so question, but you could read between the lines whether that's the right thing to do or not.
3515298	3516210	D	0.5666733384132385	I don't know.
3516660	3518930	D	0.6324673891067505	I don't think you could be Edelman now.
3519700	3521760	D	0.7914680242538452	In 21st century.
3524900	3530284	D	0.8317840695381165	We'd be too close to all the culture wars, I think, to even entertain that style anymore.
3530412	3532544	D	0.8902164101600647	And I suspect that's quite a good thing.
3532662	3541364	D	0.9362338781356812	Although pressure makes diamonds, and as Andy says, it was an exciting both my colleagues have said it's an exciting, informative time.
3541402	3542664	D	0.6739234924316406	It was a pressure time.
3542782	3552040	D	0.6536120176315308	It was a dark time for me in terms of the dynamics, the systemic, the personal interactions.
3552700	3556120	D	0.6995658874511719	But because it was pressured, it made diamonds.
3556280	3568056	D	0.4739779233932495	And so we may be throwing away the opportunity to make academic diamonds and be truly creative in terms of making things that endure like diamonds by not having that style of mentorship.
3568168	3574880	D	0.5510274767875671	But I don't think it will be even legal nowadays, to be quite honest, to run a lab like Edelman ran.
3579800	3591960	B	0.705435574054718	So, again, I think that over the years, neuroscience, I don't know about the rest of science, but it's almost become sort of industrialized.
3592400	3602604	B	0.8599316477775574	So there's a method as a young person, when you finally get your own job, you have to set out.
3602642	3607644	B	0.787864625453949	And if you're at a university environment, there's certain boxes you have to check off.
3607682	3614960	B	0.7595866918563843	You have to get a grant, you have to get a certain number of papers, you have to get something in science or Nature in order to get promoted.
3615460	3632176	B	0.889121413230896	There's these steps and I think young people are so focused on moving through those steps at the point in their career where they're going to be the most creative and their minds are the most flexible and they can be the most productive.
3632368	3646668	B	0.7962044477462769	And I see that as a shame, actually, that they're not given this opportunity to be a little freer in the way they accomplish things.
3646834	3653752	B	0.6009823679924011	And then when they do accomplish some modicum of success, they rely on their past behavior.
3653816	3663536	B	0.5628848075866699	So instead of saying, okay, I had to go through that in order to get tenure, now that I have tenure, I'm free and I can do something that I really want to do.
3663718	3667400	B	0.8301355838775635	That really doesn't happen because people get stuck in a rut.
3667500	3673648	B	0.6609320044517517	And I see that as really holding back progress in neuroscience.
3673744	3678240	B	0.9570280313491821	And that was kind of the cool thing about the Neuroscience Institute.
3678400	3682316	B	0.4894634187221527	For better or worse, we weren't allowed to go out and get our own grants.
3682368	3684740	B	0.5828614830970764	We had to rely on internal funds.
3684900	3689812	B	0.6286022067070007	But as a result, the only person we had to convince was Edelman in order to get funded.
3689956	3695340	B	0.7266513109207153	And to a certain extent, that allowed us to do things that were really creative.
3696720	3702620	B	0.7713578939437866	In hindsight, I think that was a mistake, because financially, that was doom for the Institute.
3703040	3706708	B	0.579214334487915	There could have been a hybrid approach that would have been more productive.
3706904	3721190	B	0.6778149604797363	But then again, as Karl was saying, the investigators would have had to have more freedom to do that, and that was not exactly in the culture, although I think I was an outlier because I maintained a separate lab.
3722600	3729510	B	0.9307739734649658	So I was somewhat inoculated from that, and that made it a lot more pleasant for me.
3730460	3746700	B	0.5164496898651123	But again, I see that in current neuroscience, it would be nice if people were willing to take more chances and be a little more creative instead of hoeing to the status quo.
3748400	3753550	B	0.7643517851829529	That would be, I think, what we need in order to move forward.
3757320	3782044	C	0.8356667757034302	Yeah, no, I think that in terms of the mentorship that Karl was talking about, I mean, certainly I have seen people do very well, but I also have the opportunity, sort of when I moved to University Southern California, to have some interaction with Dr.
3782082	3783224	C	0.8164698481559753	Simo Benter.
3783352	3786124	C	0.7892209887504578	And some of you probably know him.
3786162	3799040	C	0.8849742412567139	I mean, you would see actually he is also very successful, but when he came out, he would always have his students surrounding him very kindly.
3799380	3806840	C	0.842994749546051	I think that Edelman is brilliant, but it's kind of the sun is too bright.
3807020	3813620	C	0.7788544297218323	Sometimes people have to be distilled into the, as you say, academic diamond.
3814280	3815348	C	0.9033102989196777	That's interesting.
3815514	3824020	C	0.513275146484375	So we also have seen some people didn't get along with him well, but still, I think there are many impact.
3824180	3828360	C	0.6006460189819336	He certainly have encouraged many people go different directions.
3828700	3835220	C	0.8049222230911255	And in terms of the academic the academic future right.
3835310	3857856	C	0.7819123864173889	I think you two are more talking about the neurobiology side, but on the morphogenesis side, I would also say he always emphasized the patterns thinking that pattern is kind of the way nature either biology, non biology, they leave some clue for us to figure out.
3857958	3866816	C	0.9246464371681213	And when I was there, I remember every time he talked about the visual columns tolson we saw they have worked out, he got very excited.
3866928	3875400	C	0.8687878251075745	And in fact, I have one of my peer at that time was working on the visual columns of the cat.
3875550	3881316	C	0.5983787178993225	But I think that paper that work never really go out to be published.
3881428	3892216	C	0.8219654560089111	But anyway, on the more practical things, I work on the tissue patterns and I feel that you mentioned about the top of biology.
3892408	3907780	C	0.5748029947280884	And again, I think he coined the term, and I think the term I think it means a lot because eventually my career was trying to figure out these signaling molecules.
3908120	3912352	C	0.6229713559150696	Because at that time, people only talk about signaling molecule.
3912416	3913830	C	0.6499455571174622	Very important.
3914360	3925684	C	0.8876523971557617	But the idea of topobiology is that you even position these simply by positioning these signaling centers in a different topology.
3925812	3942248	C	0.8902381062507629	You can actually have a lot of consequence from there and the signaling center can also have a different lifetime, the strength and the duration and the range they can influence.
3942344	3964448	C	0.6973584294319153	So by modulating he like these terms to modulating these signaling center, you can create a lot of regional differences and up to now, as I say from my own take bird, you look at it right feather here, downing feather here, the beautiful crown feather here, tail feather.
3964544	3966800	C	0.6859672665596008	But these are all from the same genome.
3966880	3989660	C	0.840849757194519	So it actually is through the positioning of these different signaling center in a different way, and you basically have the same ingredient, but you can play with them by topologically, temporal, and especially arrange them and to create a quite complex pattern.
3990720	4008112	C	0.8782614469528198	I feel that in the tissue patterning Morphogenesis side, I feel that his vision is great, and I think we still try to work out more about how these patterns are positioned.
4008256	4015860	C	0.6479416489601135	But I think that's sort of the direction in a more visualized purple biology aspect we can appreciate.
4018520	4019184	A	0.9184247851371765	Awesome.
4019322	4025400	A	0.9016305804252625	Well, perhaps if each of you would like to give any closing thoughts.
4031370	4048394	D	0.6743932962417603	Yes, to echo those last sentiments, I think everything that Adelman said or tried to say, depending whether you could understand him, I think he's absolutely right.
4048512	4053178	D	0.6025285124778748	And we are slowly discovering the truths we've just heard about top ofology and the importance of patterns.
4053194	4057886	D	0.612799346446991	And of course, if you speak to somebody like Mike Levin, he'd be talking about exactly the same thing.
4057908	4061214	D	0.8492168188095093	He'd use words like basal cognition and pattern formation.
4061262	4070142	D	0.862299382686615	But I think that we're talking about the same principles of biological self organization and edelman.
4070286	4078134	D	0.7423673272132874	I didn't know about turbobiology, but I do know there are other fundamental ideas that he just incidental to him.
4078172	4079014	D	0.6254222393035889	I am absolutely sure.
4079052	4087706	D	0.5066845417022705	I think notions of degeneracy in the neurosciences and psychology, the notion of many to one structure, function mappings, for example.
4087808	4105034	D	0.5377427935600281	These are fundamental ideas which now are taken almost for granted in my world, but you sort of forget how much he actually contributed or at least laid the seeds for, and sometimes very explicitly so, it should be acknowledged.
4105082	4112400	D	0.7712852358818054	Although he was, as Mark Rakel put it, in his typically gentlemanly fashion, edelman was a very complicated man.
4113010	4125910	D	0.9210201501846313	He was also very brilliant and is responsible, I think, for a lot of the direction of travel and the intellectual growth, certainly of my intellectual growth, but I would say also many aspects of our academic communities.
4128330	4129474	A	0.9096635580062866	Thank you, Karl.
4129602	4135880	A	0.8391262888908386	Perhaps Andrew oh, unmute and then please continue.
4139670	4164398	B	0.8957135081291199	So I would know if there's anyone listening out there, there's something to be said about maybe looking back in the ancient literature that goes back quite a bit and maybe seeing how some of these things came about and trying to put it together and see that there's this iteration that constantly takes place.
4164484	4178978	B	0.7767425179481506	People rediscover the same thing that's been discovered multiple times and try to see how there is a status quo in the way science works.
4179064	4186466	B	0.7986786961555481	And then there's these outliers where there's sort of creative bubbles that come to fore.
4186648	4206460	B	0.679593026638031	And I think it's interesting to think of Edelman and the things he did and the people that were associated with him in terms of sort of these disruptive, they call it disruptions and how those disruptions may have consequence many years later.
4207230	4209820	B	0.9234932065010071	It's kind of interesting if you take the long view.
4210510	4234050	B	0.7222463488578796	So I think it's maybe worthwhile thinking about this once in a while and for young people out there to be encouraged to think out of the normal way of doing things once in a while, try to foster your creativity and have the courage to go after some of those ideas.
4234470	4238280	B	0.7557125687599182	I think that's a take home message for me anyway.
4241270	4254226	C	0.7860588431358337	Yeah, I would say I always like all sort of influenced by his idea, saying that we should study the important question that have a general meaning.
4254338	4258114	C	0.7728304862976074	So I think that kind of ideas he said that, look at the big pictures.
4258162	4261378	C	0.7175306677818298	I remember when I was there, he talked like that, the big pictures.
4261474	4275710	C	0.8116690516471863	So that is where when he thinking about the Darwinism, he would say it's not only for the species evolution, for the immunoglobulin chronos selection, he would push it to the brain theory.
4276050	4279050	C	0.8677926659584045	And for me, I work on the morphogenesis.
4279130	4284846	C	0.8697646856307983	I actually would come to realize that is also what happened at the tissue level.
4284948	4290590	C	0.8140531778335571	These cells are competing with each other to form that patterns and then pattern is selected.
4290670	4295010	C	0.6040536761283875	When there is a functional advantage, it will be stabilized.
4295830	4304118	C	0.6905307769775391	I think the idea of saying if we're going to do science, we ask big questions, ask for the generalization, I appreciate that.
4304204	4307494	C	0.7852104902267456	And certainly he is like how you want to call it, right?
4307532	4308578	C	0.5979627370834351	A huge elephant.
4308674	4314860	C	0.8753820061683655	So we all touch him through different side and have a different take on that.
4315870	4322330	C	0.6783469915390015	In terms of the young scientist, I also remember he likes the Chinese proverb I cited to him.
4322480	4329470	C	0.8068475127220154	That is to say, if you want to get Tiger's son, you must get into Tiger's cave.
4330770	4332400	C	0.7128397226333618	So with three did.
4335490	4336574	A	0.9195932745933533	Thank you all.
4336692	4338202	A	0.974007248878479	That's a great note.
4338266	4341178	A	0.967228353023529	Really appreciate this conversation.
4341354	4343662	A	0.49843019247055054	And again, thanks.
4343716	4344960	A	0.7275897264480591	Until next time.
4345410	4346206	C	0.584351658821106	Okay.
4346388	4347086	C	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
4347188	4347754	C	0.5137446522712708	Bye.
4347882	4349360	C	0.9585833549499512	Nice meeting you all.
4349850	4350434	D	0.4864290952682495	Bye bye.
4350482	4351240	D	0.8529649376869202	Thank you.
4351610	4351890	C	0.5137446522712708	Bye.
