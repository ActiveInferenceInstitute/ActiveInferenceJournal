8010	65380	00:08	Today the session will be around the experiences of those who have worked with Gerald Edelman. Edelman lived from 1929 to 2014 and worked in various areas related to the brain, body, and mind. We have several prepared questions and several other questions.	Session will focus on experiences of those who have worked with Gerald Edelman	Gerald Edelman: The Inference Institute
66710	278790	01:06	The scientist worked in a neuroscience institute in Phoenix for six or seven years. He was invited to look at a new institute in San Diego by Gerald Edelman. The institute exposed him to a whole new way of thinking about neuroscience. He says it changed his career from being a very careful scientist to using his imagination.	I did my PhD at University of Minnesota and then did postdoc at Hopkins	Getting it out there: The neuroscience of movement
279480	735112	04:39	Cheng Ming was originally from Taiwan. Was working on the topic called neural cell adhesion molecule. Later work on the feather as his major research model. Developed idea of topobiology.	Cheng Ming worked with Dr. Edelman on neural cell adhesion molecule	Cheng Ming on the Edelman Prize
735246	1605490	12:15	Karl Friston found his stay with Jerry Edelman both foundational and very, very formative. At the inception of brain imaging, people were for the first time discovering principles of functional brain organization. Edelman's theory of neuronal group selection was becoming consolidated.	Karl Friston spent half his fellowship at the Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute	Karl Friston on Jerry Edelman and the neuroscience Institute
1606180	2056050	26:46	Karl: An original book by Edelman and Mac Castle called The Mindful Brain presaged the idea of distributed systems. The way most people think about brain function is boxes, where each part of the brain is confined to a box. In the next ten or 20 years, this is going to be the fundamental change in the way we think about neural function.	Karl: The Mindful Brain foreshadowed the idea of distributed systems	Adam Levine: The Mindful Brain
2059550	2697758	34:19	Edelman really tried to merge science and art. He would think a real science would be beautiful. His environment reflected that kind of courageous creativity. How did his mentoring help bring out these threads in people? For better and for worse?	Did Professor Edelman use metaphor to dig out scientific facts	Martha Edelman on Courage
2697854	2813160	44:57	Edelman gives you an exciting environment to evolve, but not everyone. Not every interaction works, because I was with him for almost eight years or so. Some work, some don't, right? And as Andrew said, it's a good, outstanding environment.	Karl: Edelman gives you an opportunity to be successful, but not everyone	Bob Edelman on Marian Edelman
2817480	2856800	46:57	Andrew. It's such a different world, and the environment of learning and of carrying out science is so different. I really appreciate just even a window into settings that are elsewhere and in a different time. So thank you for all of this.	Andrew. I really don't have anything to add right now. Thank you, though. It's really amazing	A taste of science in the 1980s
2856870	3442402	47:36	Edelman was reputed to be skeptical about the risk of abusing mathematical or computer models in creating theories of neural functioning, cognition, and consciousness. He worked with Tanini on the foundations of integrated information theory. How did you see the role of math and computers in Edelman's thinking and research develop?	Professor Edelman was skeptical of using computers in theories of consciousness	Andy Edelman on Computational Thinking in Neuroscience
3442456	4015860	57:22	I congratulate myself every day on not being like Edelman when it comes to mentoring. I don't think you could be Edelman now. We'd be too close to all the culture wars, I think, to even entertain that style anymore. In current neuroscience, it would be nice if people were willing to take more chances.	How do we take historical and our mentoring context forward in neuroscience	The history of mentoring in neuroscience
4018520	4332400	1:06:58	Karl: We are slowly discovering the truths we've just heard about top ofology and the importance of patterns. Andrew: Edelman is responsible for a lot of the direction of travel and the intellectual growth. Karl: For young people out there to be encouraged to think out of the normal way of doing things.	Karl: I think everything that Adelman said or tried to say is correct	A Few Thoughts on Maurice Edelman's Death
4335490	4351890	1:12:15	Thank you all. Really appreciate this conversation. And again, thanks. Until next time. Bye bye.	Thank you all. Really appreciate this conversation	Amen to That
