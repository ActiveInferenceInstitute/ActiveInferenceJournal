8010	65380	A	0.939419495798319	Hello and welcome, everybody. It is September 19, 2023. We're here at the active inference Institute in guest stream 58.1, and today the session will be around the experiences of those who have worked with Gerald Edelman. Edelman lived from 1929 to 2014, and as hopefully this conversation can explore and unpack a little bit, worked in various areas related to the brain, body, and mind. So without further ado, I will have our guests introduce themselves, give a little bit of a background on how they came to be working with Professor Edelman, and then we have several prepared questions and several other questions. So thank you all for joining, and perhaps, Andrew, if you'd like to begin.
66710	275060	B	0.9390337441860462	All right, so I'll just start a little bit with my background. I did my PhD at University of Minnesota, and then I did my postdoc at Hopkins with Apostles Georgopoulos and Vernon Macassel. And then I got a job in Phoenix working in a small neuroscience institute or neuroscience department at a hospital. And I worked there for six or seven years. And my interest was working with non human primates with monkeys and studying how they reached for different objects and drew objects and then looked at the activity in primary motor cortex neurons. And we carried out different kinds of analysis based on the directionality of the neurons in motor cortex built populations and were able to actually look at these neural signals and see how they corresponded in a pretty exact way to the way the animals are moved in time and space. In other words, trajectories. And after working there six or seven years, I was invited to come and look at this new institute that Gerald Edelman was establishing in San Diego in La Jolla and met a bunch of super interesting people like Guilio Tononi and Olof Sporns. And really, their deep intellect and curiosity and creativity has convinced me to move to. I ended up moving there. And so Edelman was able to build this gorgeous research facility on the Tory Pines cliffs, basically, and it was a magnificent architecture. And he recruited a number of people besides sparns and Tononi, and so he divided the group into theorists and experimentalists. And I was an experimentalist, but we would have lunch every day together as a group and discuss different topics. And I was really exposed to a whole new way of thinking about neuroscience in terms of sort of the cognitive aspects of it, which I still have difficulty with, to tell you personally, because I don't even know how you define cognition. And I'm not sure that anybody really can, or as Vernon Machasto would say, I don't know the answer to that, nor does anybody else. Maybe Karl would take issue with that. But anyway, the coolest thing about it was being really exposed to a lot of creative thinking and deep intellectual endeavors, and I've really never regretted the seven or eight years I spent there. I think it really helped change the way my career went from being sort of a motor control strict, sort of very careful scientist to using my imagination a lot more than I would have otherwise. So I'll leave it at that.
278040	278790	A	0.9922	Awesome.
279480	731850	C	0.909847969387756	Cheng Ming okay, yeah, I can speak about my journey with Dr. Edelman. So I was originally from Taiwan. I graduated with a medical degree in Taiwan university in 78. But I was very interested in doing basic science. So I applied a PhD program and got into Rock Federal University and that started to search for a laboratory. And certainly Dr. Ederman is very powerful intellectual capacity building in the building it was on 9th floor of the Bronx laboratory. I was very impressed. So I joined the laboratory. So since 78 to 83 I was a PhD student and I was working on the topic called neural cell adhesion molecule. So at that time Edelman already got his Nobel prize for immunoglobulin. But he would be usually elegant way would say I solved molecular recognition. So he said I don't want to stay in immunology to collect more awards. He said I will work out cell recognition. So in his mind how cell recognition work is through a group of adhesion molecular interaction. So that's how he started to work on the cell adhesion molecule and duty's house actually work out the chicken cell adhesion molecular. So when I joined the laboratory, my PhD things was work out the first mammalian cell adhesion molecule. And in addition to NCAM, though, I supposed to work out on these adhesion molecule mediating the Neurolog cell recognition as he said he would say. I asked him also after all what would be my PhD thesis and he would say ming, when I start to write a poem, I don't know how it's going to end. That's the way he would put his language there. So he just figured out retinal tectoprojection I'm hardworking student so I would work out on that. And as you know, these days our so called systems biology approach, right, is these transcriptome single cell RNA sequencing to identify a non biased way to identify molecules involved. At that time the so called systems biology approach was making monoclonal antibodies. So I would be there taking out the brain and the retina and the tectum and produce I produce 18 batch of the monochromatic antibody against these neuronal cell membranes. So I certainly have identified a lot of adhesion molecule but none of them really show a very distinct pattern these days. I think the field using the transcription factors was able to identify some patterns but at that later it's kind of all altogether. But I remember that actually anyway, I didn't really figure out retinol technical projection but that's enough for me to graduate. But at that time I also still remember how I actually had a great impact on my professional career. So I was cutting chicken spinal cord cross section to mapping these cell adhesion molecules. So I have some feather chicken feather hanging outside there, and they stand with this NCAM with the most beautiful, exquisite pattern. Later work on the feather as my major research model, kind of as a rosetta song to understand the language of morphogenesis. But there I remember how I started that. You have these feather, they form these branches. So these branches are actually originally formed cells. Then they die to become space. But before they die, they actually light up with NCM. Light up with NCM with the most exquisite pattern there. So you kind of say, okay, you're going to carve out this region. You light up with NCM, you light up with sonic, and then other signal coming to say you die. But before they die, they light up that pattern. So the feather pattern is very exquisite. Radio symmetry, bilateral symmetry, bilateral symmetry. So Adam was very impressed by those findings. I appreciate he actually encouraged that when he sees something, he appreciates he encouraged it. He didn't say, oh, you're supposed to work on the brain or whatever. He actually like it. And subsequently he also developed this idea of topobiology, which he would acknowledge to say it's sort of based on the very exquisite pattern we found in the feather. But of course he developed it further. But some other time he would say, if this is not in feather, I am adamant I'm going to get another Nobel Prize. So I like it. Let him encourage that direction. So later when I became independent, I sort of say, okay, brain is wonderful, but it's all like being curved inside. I don't figure it out, but I'm not that smart. But I might be able to figure out feather pattern formation. So I have a reasonable, successful career. Figure out the able debo of the feather, but as I said, not just feather itself, but use feather as a rosetta stone to figure out morphogenesis. And that sort of I think I appreciate that he's encouraged on that. Also, as you know, the stem cell biology comes along and the feather in a bird baby chicken is one way. Adult chicken, male, female, all looks differently, but they are all from the same group of the stem cell that my lab have stemon straight. So it is the so called stem cell niche would be modulated by sex hormone, by age, by season, by temperature, and let them help you produce different feather forms to adapt to the environment. I think I enjoy my research career and it was obviously have his impact. And I think he's intellectually brilliant and always encouraged going after fundamental principles, saying that if you're going to work on a question, ask most profound questions and approach with the most available technology, current technology of the day. Don't waste your time on small questions. And I think I have taken those in so I can stay up to here and we can discuss more later.
733740	737352	A	0.9287240000000001	Thank you. Awesome. Karl hi.
737406	1595710	D	0.927177766830873	So my name is Karl Friston, and like my two colleagues, I found my stay with Jerry Edelman both foundational and very, very formative. I was quite early in my research career when I joined the neuroscience Institute. Having trained as a psychiatrist, I got into brain imaging. And at the inception of brain imaging, people were for the first time discovering principles of functional brain organization, such as the principle of functional segregation and subsequently principles of integration, how segregated specialized parts of the brain communicate or are coordinated or are integrated together. And one of the key theoreticians and neuroanatomists that authored this particular interpretation and deployment of neuroimaging was Semir Zeki. And semir zeki. For those of you who don't know, he's still very active, one of the architects of neuroaesthetics in his late retirement now, but he was friendly with Jerry Edelman, and Semi was famed for understanding the computational anatomy of early visual cortex and visual cortical hierarchies. And I repeat, the principles of functional specialization and integration. So after a couple of years at the inception of human brain mapping, using positron emission tomography and establishing, for example, the color center in a particular part of the visual cortex, I was effectively sent to New York. So my period of engagement was a fellowship between about 1990 and 1992 93. So this slightly predates Andy, and it covered the translocation of the Neurosciences Institute from the Rockefeller University to La Jolla and under the auspices of the script. So I spent half my fellowship at the Rockefeller and then subsequently watched the building of the magnificent neuroscientist Institute on North Tory Pines Road that Andy referred to with the auditorium, if I remember, designed by imported experts in audition and music and sound engineering from Sweden. It was really an amazing place. I do remember a couple of lunches before I returned to the UK to pursue my career in imaging neuroscience under the auspices of the welcome Trust, but only a couple because we were sort of in rented accommodation from the script on the other side of the road. But it was an awe inspiring bit of architecture, both intellectually and practically in terms of the early days of the Neuroscience Institute. So I was sent there basically because Sami Zecki thought it would be good for me to go and work with Jerry Adelman retrospectively. I now appreciate that. I was sent there to replace a gentleman called Reed Montague, who had been tasked with on the pure theory side, as opposed to the celadesian molecule and the wet lab side of Edelman's research. On the pure theory side, the point of my arrival, and to a certain extent at the point of Reed's brief exposure to the neuroscientist institute, the theory of neuronal group selection was becoming consolidated. And in particular, what drove the selection of neuronal groups, neuro ensembles, cell assemblies, however you want to describe them, and given Edelman's polchamp for incredibly incisive and straightforward but very creative biological thinking. He thought, well, it's obviously some kind of natural selection and therefore there must be the homologue of adaptive fitness that is underwriting the scaffolding and the dynamic structuring of connectivity or connections that were definitive of in the spirit of functional specialization, segregation, but also the mediator of functional integration of these neuronal groups. So this became known generically as value. So Reed was working on value dependent learning the plasticity and the principles that underwrite which synaptic connections have the right kind of adaptive fitness in their mileage. In that context that enabled them to persist and other connections went away and became or contributed to the sparse coupling of neural networks. And then Reed, and we can talk about the glorious stories about the departure of Reed. Reed actually ended up in a rather circuitous way with Terry Sejnowski at the Salk subsequently, then hooked up with people like Peter Diane and Wolfram Schultz, who at that time was in Zurich. And of course the story that emerged from that was the reward prediction error story that actually, ironically, Reed did not. But a number of Wolfram eventually got the brain prize for some decade or so later. But the inception of that story was actually at the Rockefeller. And it was basically an attempt by, I think, Reed to formalize the principles that must be in play to make the theory of neural group selection under what was an important dynamic from Edelman's point of view, which is this notion of reentrant dynamics. So very, very early on he had identified the fundamental importance of recurrent connectivity and reentry as very formative in the emergence of these structured groups and the associated functional specialization. Just open brackets, just to point out that you could claim that certainly his early conversations with people at that time sort of preempted stuff in computational neuroscience that we now take as for granted, not really realizing where it came from, but certainly his work with Vernon Mancast. I'm sure Andy will be able to speak to this later on. On the importance of reentry and dynamics and oscillations in the formation of these groups and sort of cortical. Columns and the like. That was sort of, I think, the monographs that they not the monographs, but the papers and the articles they wrote at that time I think were quite visionary. Steven Grossberg was also hanging around a few years earlier, and I think you could probably claim that between the two of them, they invented computational neuroscience. Certainly know New York, Boston, sort of East Coast kind of style of computational neuroscience, closely involved with something called the Neuroscience Research Foundation, so that they, as I understand it and again, Andy may want to correct me here, but this was like the forerunner of the Society for Neuroscience. It was a group of people. People, and perhaps Max Cowan is the name that comes to mind, people who actually invented words like neuroscience, which wasn't a thing, certainly when I was applying to my undergraduate studies and trying to create institutions, academic institutions, that would endorse this notion of neuroscience. And the Neuroscience Research Foundation was like the old guard. And then the Young Turks came along and reacted against the old Guard, the Neuroscience Research Foundation, to form the Society for Neuroscience. And then we all know the story since that time. It's one of the biggest societies in academia. So just making the point that Aidelman and his colleagues and vicarious colleagues, a lot of people, oliver Sacks being one, ernst Mer being another of his favorite sort of characters to talk to, all of whom would come and visit, and we were privileged just to listen in. And conversations in this very formative time where some of the sort of, I think, conceptual pillars of the way that we understand neuroscience in the 21st century were first articulated, probably not using quite the same words that we use nowadays. So no one talks about reentry anymore, so about recurrent neural networks or sort of feed forward and feedback and the like, but the same underlying dynamics. And maths, I think, is absolutely there. Anyway, I was brought in to replace Reed Montague, so that was my little contribution. Whilst we were in the Rockefeller, I made the mistake of thinking that the right way to do this was to actually write down equations and try and sort of naturalize it in terms of mathematics. Edelman was a great biological thinker. He was not a very good mathematical thinker, so there was a bit of a clash there. So I remember one meeting very early on when it was being decided what I was going to be doing. Perhaps it's useful just to say the context in which those early meetings took place. So Andy has already mentioned Guilio Tononi and Olaf spawns. They were two key people, edelman's young men who already in sight, you. And then I replaced Reed, and they were working really purely on theory. And that theory was tested in the context of a forerunner of supercomputing, a hypercube that was driving, in my day, little robots. So, again, Edelman was doing neurobotics in the 1980s in exactly the same way that people now in developmental neurobotics are still addressing exactly the same questions, probably with the same kind of computer infrastructure that obviously upgraded. So we were sitting around and Edelman was called out to take a phone call from Germany, and there was a look of horror on people's faces because I'd suggested a relationship between value dependent learning and the riskola Wagner rule from behavioral psychology. And as soon as you mention an equation or a formula, that set Edelman off. And I didn't know that, so I didn't know I pushed the wrong button. So when Edelman came back in, I was effectively rusticated. I was prevented from doing any work for three months and for every day, afternoon and morning I had to sit in the Rockefeller library and read purely biological great texts, and I ended up having to. The last one was The Growth of Biological Thought by Ernst Mayer. I had to read from page to page, and when I did so, I had become sufficiently sanitized to be allowed back into the workplace to actually do some work anyway. So that was our contribution. And then when we moved to the whole parade of 16 Wheeler traxxas, translocating all the kit and all the paperwork to La Jolla, and then relocating out there, settling down, I brought that work to closure. And interesting, that was at the point when Giulio well, Olaf, I remember him saying what he wants is basically to understand and simulate the brain in a way that draws explanatory power from the architecture of the connectivity. Basically, we say he wants to establish connectomics as a discipline, and of course, ten years later, he's Mr. Connectomics. Julio at that point was inventing integrated information theory with a particular focus on information, theoretical formulations of complexity, and what special, if you like, counterintuitive behaviors, do you get from these biologically configured connectors when you put dynamics on structure and trying to quantify that in a way that ultimately transpired to be measures like phi in IIT. So that was a fun time as the mathematician, closet mathematician, because I wasn't allowed to say anything about the maths at the time. I enjoyed that bit. And so looking being in at the, if you like, ground zero at the inception of all these aspirations, which eventually led to very fruitful careers. And then I went back to the UK. Just had fond memories and non fond memories, but both of a nostalgic sort since that time.
1598080	1605490	A	0.9622735	Awesome. Great tales. Changming or Andrew, anything you want to add? Or I can go to one of the questions.
1606180	1937130	B	0.9469673150684944	Well, just to expound a little bit on what Karl was saying, I don't know if you can see this book. Okay, so this was something that came out of the neuroscience research program that was sort of the old boys club that Francis Schmidt started at MIT and later was the basis for the neurosciences Institute. And what this was was sort of the who's who in neuroscience. So, again, if you look at this book, it says, edited by Francis O. Schmidt. So he was the guy that started that. This persisted even throughout the 2000s. Once or twice a year at the neurosciences Institute, they would organize one of these meetings, and it would be a who's who of neuroscience. So all the Nobel laureates in neuroscience, all the big names, would come for a four or five day meeting and talk about their research. And as a member of the neurosciences Institute, I got to sit in and meet these people. And it was phenomenal, especially with my background, because I was sort of not on the mainstream of neuroscience at that point. And that was really fascinating. So you got to meet people like Wolf Schultz and all the big names that were there, francis Crick. But what I want to go back to is this original book by Edelman and Mac Castle called The Mindful Brain. This is sort of like one of the bibles of early creative thinking about brain function, and it presaged the idea of distributed systems. This was sort of the thing that Vernon Moncasso was very much into. And so to this day, the way most people think about brain function is boxes, where each part of the brain is confined to a box, and then there are arrows pointed to other boxes. And so we get this idea that there's a circuitry. So you often hear neuroscientists talk about circuits, and that kind of comes from the idea that you have these boxes and you have arrows and you have plus and minus signs with the arrows, and then somehow the pluses and minuses add up and tell you what's going to happen at the next box. And that is nice because you can kind of simplify things and talk about causality in very concrete terms. And it's great if you're an engineer, because you can write transfer functions about defining how you get an output from an input, but that's not the way the brain works. And I think Kyle can attest to the early days of MRI studies where everybody was doing pseudocolored representations of these different areas to see which area would light up a particular task, as if each area had a specific job and could be assigned to a specific task. Neuroscience in general is still suffering from that point of view, and it's only become a little bit more clear as computational science has matured in the last five or ten years, especially with the adaptation of artificial neural networks to the mainstream, that we can start to explore more biological meaningful ways of brain function. And Vernon Macassill recognized that as sort of the I would say the founder of systems neuroscience, modern systems neuroscience, and Edelman talked about that a little know, there's group theory and some of the things that OLEF has started. With graph theory still sort of based on strict anatomical you know, if you read like Olaf's latest review, where the field is starting to progress away from that constraint of anatomical connectivity, we're starting to get more toward the idea of truly distributed systems. And to me, that's super exciting. But you can look back to this book from the see that the seed was planted way back then and see how almost 50 years later, now, it's finally starting to evolve into something that's becoming more mainstream. And if you sort of look at the evolution of neuroscience, I think if you project ahead to the next ten or 20 years, this is going to be really the fundamental change in the way we think about neural function. And I'm super excited about that and you look and sort of back in history to see how that's evolved. And I don't know, I think there's something very attractive about thinking about things that way.
1939040	2060300	C	0.9091756799999998	Yeah. Okay, I'll add something, I think, talking about Edema's, the brilliance about seeing things through. I don't know. In the neurobiology field, you people still sort of think the neuro Darwinism idea is still there, right? So that was the time when I was with him in Rockefeller University he would talk things like know Darwinism for evolution species. And he saw that in immunoglobulin chronos selection. So he applied to this neurodarwinism idea. But I have to say, subsequently, actually, my career is mainly in university, Southern California and working on this morphogenesis tissue patent formation. And in our field, sort of more bench work aspect of Edelman. This direction, not the neurobiology direction, but in the field, there were people originally more talking about the stem cells are predetermined and then they go this lineage. They go this lineage. But we using the skin as a model. Actually, I start to write these things kind of a Darwinism within the skin. I mean, basically it's that there is no preset forever stem cells. If you wipe out these stem cells, other cells are waiting there to take over the space. So there is even during development and during regeneration to make the tissue patterning process robust. There is a small so called Darwinism competition going on in there and that is sort of also influencing our work in morphogenesis these days. And I think that's kind of the impact of him on this aspect as well. Wow.
2060990	2104060	A	0.9514833333333328	All right. I'll read a question. This was from Dave Douglas. Dave wrote, we know that Professor Edelman used deep analogies in exploring new subjects as in his leveraging his knowledge of immunology and organismal development to probe conceptualization and learning. Did he ever work specifically on metaphor and analogy as such? For example, did he leverage his experience of music and poetry to dig out scientific facts while separating fertile from sterile analogies? An answer or just what that makes you think of?
2107470	2159980	D	0.950624201680672	It makes me think of something which Edelman used to call me, which I am an intellectual thug. So I'm sure that there's a great answer to that. Excellent question. And it does speak to Edelman's skills and interests. As a violinist, I do remember that BBC Horizon came to do a profile on him and his ideas and it was prefaced with, I think, shots of him playing the violin to concert standard. But I have absolutely no idea whether he used that sort of part of his life to take things beyond metaphor. So as an intellectual thug, I'm going to hand over to my two colleagues to see whether they can give a more elegant answer.
2167530	2178890	A	0.9604542105263157	Or anything in that area of the arts. And you brought up poetry. Anything in the arts and sciences?
2181890	2265080	C	0.931924187192118	Well, I'm no brain biologist, but just to say that from my side of the interaction, he really tried to merge science and art. He would think a real science would be beautiful. And that's the way I think when I learn. As I mentioned, when I say, oh, I was expecting a more clear cut CC's idea, but he would say Ming is like writing a poetry. He said, When I start, I don't know where it's going to end. It's like some artists when you ask them how do you create this painting? I try to ask this question to some of my friends who are artists and they say they do not have a clear blueprint of how that painting would looks like. They have an idea, it's kind of floating in the sky and they try to grab it down, so they paint on the way and try to make it into a painting. Or I have a friend who are poets, I ask them this, they say they grab the word to make them coming down. And I kind of feel adamant sort of treat the scientific idea like that. This is my superficial interaction, just some experience.
2266730	2296420	B	0.9441514705882355	I don't have a direct reply to that. But in general, I think there's the idea of creativity that he brought to the forefront. And then also with that creativity, you have to have a certain amount of courage to move out of the sort of mainstream, right? So if you have an idea and you have to have a certain amount of courage to put that forward.
2298950	2299314	C	0.76489	If.
2299352	2310760	B	0.8945326086956521	That idea is creative and out of the ordinary. And I think artists and sort of really great scientists have that in common.
2313370	2333870	A	0.9222285294117647	Maybe to that nexus of creativity and career development and courage for you or just in the environment. How did his mentoring help bring out these threads in people? For better and for worse?
2334210	2381020	B	0.9453365	I think Karl could attest to that. I have a hard time viewing Edelman as a feel good mentor. I think he would throw ideas out there. He could be pretty aggressive and I would say frightening to young people. So I wouldn't cast Edelman's behavior as sort of the typical mentor. But again, I think the environment that he created was someplace that was really special and reflected that kind of courageous creativity. And I really appreciate that. Now.
2383330	2661560	D	0.9407607470288623	Just to endorse that notion of courageous creativity, I think it's a really nice observation. I've often reflected on whether let's take for example, Julio and Olaf, and I think you could probably apply it to me and Andy and a number of other people as well. But if we just take Julio and Olaf, who've both become world leaders, thought leaders in their own particular field, having brought something new to the table, and in some instances in more than one area. So Julia TENone, in terms of sleep research and synaptic Homeostasis in terms of his work in consciousness studies, integrated information theory, olaf in. Terms of structural function and mean. Is it that Edelman had a good eye for bright young men? Or is it that bright young men learned how to do this? That this was the way to be courageous and to say it's an adversarial in that courage to be creative and to pursue what you have created in a slightly adversarial or at least sort of defensive way, I don't know. But what I do know is there was certainly a culture that was established that would allow those kinds of skills to be developed and is referred to them slightly obliquely. It was a dark culture and it has to be said, it was a very homophilic culture. There were no women allowed in this culture. So in my time, the culture was really one man and adoring young men and you had to repeatedly affirm that adoration. And part of that was really useful and really enjoyable and has already mentioned the lunches. Exactly the same regime characterized my stay. There was a rigorous routine where all the young men would go off to the New York cafe, would have onion rings and burgers and Aileman would wax lyrical. And perhaps this is not art and creativity, but he was artistic in his joke telling, so he'd always have a new joke every lunchtime in a New York diner. And that was a routine and it was just pure theatre, day after day after day. Incredible energy, but it was theater. The young men were the audience and we basically, I think, were dancing to his orchestration. He was the conductor and he was the director. It's possible that that culture did actually instill in all of us, and particularly Olaf and Julio, the notion that to make it to make a difference and to be true to one's convictions, you really have to sort of fight for and autonomously pursue what you want to do. And it is interesting that the style in which both Julia and Olaf have pursued their scientific ideology and ideas and creativity is very much slightly lonesome. With the exception of Julia's work in the molecular biology of sleep, the theoretical contributions are very sort of associated with them personally, to a certain extent, with me. And what one could argue is the mathematical version of value dependent learning, which would be the free energy principle. All of these things have the same flavor as neural Darwinism, or as some people used to call it, neuralmanism. So I often ask that question was this the skill of Edelman in choosing people who are going to make a difference or did he basically provide a culture in which it gave people the tools or the motivation or the confidence that you can make a difference because you saw him make a difference? I don't know.
2663690	2813160	C	0.9113127002967356	I think both of you actually said something. I shared the experience. Definitely he set up a right environment. But just like when we do stem cell, stem cell and its niche. You need the interaction. You need a conversation between epiphelia and the methanchyma cells or in the brain. I heard it's more like interaction between neuronal cells and gulia cells. So a successful interaction would lead, whatever the process, to move forward, but not every process would be successful. So, as said, I also like the way Karl mentioned about Edelman is the conductor. He actually said that in our meeting at the time. He said, Edelman, I'm the conductor. You guys is my symphony, prayers, and you pray together. You can make a good music. But it's also true not every interaction works, because I was with him for almost eight years or so. Not every person work, let's put it that way. That is a fact. So some work, some don't, right? So I think people are given that opportunity. And as Andrew said, it's a good, outstanding environment. So you pick up the idea from Edelman, you develop yourself and some of them, or you can call it Edmund, then we success in a certain way or not, but I think it's an exciting environment. I would put it that way. It's both. He inspires you. He gives you a sort of exciting environment to evolve, but not everyone. He can choose everyone to be successful. No, it's not like that. But he did give you that opportunity to be successful and to pick up something, and he also give you that courage to do it. As I mentioned, people would normally think using the feather as a model is kind of very high risk, but he has that encouragement, and I do that, and I feel I really using Federal as a Rosetta Stone. I have learned something for the Morphogenesis patent formation field. Yeah. So I appreciate him for that.

2818096	2819670	A	0.998825	Or I can ask another question.
2821820	2824810	B	0.9997344444444445	I really don't have anything to add right now.
2826380	2923520	A	0.9596791752577318	Thank you, though. It's really amazing. It's such a different world, and the environment of learning and of carrying out science is so different. So, personally, I really appreciate just even a window into settings that are elsewhere and in a different time. So thank you for all of this. All right, I'll ask another question from Dave. Professor Edelman was reputed to be skeptical about the risk of abusing mathematical or computer models in creating theories of neural functioning, cognition, and consciousness. Some reviewers went so far as to mock him in print for using computers as research tools. But he worked with Tanini on the foundations of integrated information theory, an extremely math heavy theory that sometimes explained using computing imagery. Did Edelman change his attitude towards the role of math or of computing paradigms in thinking about the mind? Or did he simply start trusting his colleagues to think computationally without falling into rabbit holes dug by von Neumann and Turing? Or how did you see the role of math and computers in Edelman's thinking and research develop over a period where they were also undergoing such rapid developments more broadly.
2924340	3020610	B	0.9531451052631575	So I'm pretty sure that Edelman respected mathematics and computational approaches to neuroscience. There certainly were a lot of theory fellows that were computationally savvy. While I was at the so, for instance, Karl mentioned these robots that were used to sort of explore and learn, sort of the beginning, I guess, of embodied cognition. Karl, you would say, where they explore the environment and learn, and then from that learning, they build internal say. And that was Olaf's ballywig, I would say that was highly computational and certainly a major thrust in edelman's emphasis in what he wanted to do at the institute. And there were a number of other things, I think, the integrated part that Julio did. I think that was almost all Julio's work, along with some of the other computational you know, I think Edelman wanted to be part of that, but that really, I think, was mostly, I think, you know, as part of the culture, edelman managed to get his name on Julio's paper. We used to laugh about that quite a bit, but again, I would say that was 99% Julio's work.
3023300	3202250	D	0.947549497354497	Yeah, I can concur, because I was there when the work was actually done. There was a sort of period I can't remember there was some hypothesis that pertained to a core, a dynamical core, as sort of oppression are necessary for some kind of consciousness. And I think Ehlmann was comfortable with this sort of intuitive notion of a dynamic core, but when it became articulated in terms of information theory, I think even if he didn't say so out loud, he would have responded as he responded to me, with, oh, you've got mathematosis. So this is another of his ways of dealing with people who had a tendency to over mathematicalize and oversimplify, as a physicist would, reducing a horse to a point and then writing down differential equations. He was very allergic to that. He didn't like that and would call that an instance of mathematosis. I think that's very distinct, though, from what Andy was just talking about, which is the commitment to physically realized embodied computation. And I think it's a really well observed point that this was embodied cognition circa 1980, 1990. So he was quite visionary in, I think, sort of testing out ideas in physical in realized systems. You couldn't just hand wave with maths. You had to show it worked. This idea worked in a real setting. And at that time, they were the Darwin series to the extent that I, for example, had to spend six months learning to paralyze C in order to program the robot. So it wasn't he was frightened of new technology or computer science. I think he didn't like trivializing things. All a physicist with mathematics, but you would certainly be fully committed to the notion that computation is at the heart of the kind of dynamics that he wanted to understand. And underwrote theory and indeed, I think that the theory of neural group selection speaks to that. He wanted to see it realized in a robot. But I think Andy's absolutely right. At the point when Julia sort of just basically went straight from the axioms to consciousness and phi with equations. I think that was the time that Julia had to leave the family, basically, and Julie did so.
3204140	3337480	B	0.9606628881987574	Sort of extrapolated that a little bit think, you know, when I read Edelman's books and some of his papers, I don't understand his, you know, his phrases and his descriptions. A lot of things don't make sense. If he had written those out or someone had written those out as equations that's the nice thing about equations. Once you see the equation, you don't have to worry about the words so much. Things become pretty clear. And I think, looking back, if he had been able to do that, I think his ideas, first of all, would have been crystallized in his own mind better and second of all, would have been able to be others would have understood them more clearly. And I think that's really important for me. Maybe with an engineering background or something. If you have a model or if you have an idea, if you can write that out explicitly with an equation, it really clarifies things, it crystallizes things. And that was the thing that I liked about Julio's work because again, this word of know, it's like nobody knows what that really means. But at least Julio had a form of equations, right, where he was talking about information theory and the know, you could have a cluster where information was internal versus the external information and say, that okay, if you have to have consciousness, here it is. And he could describe that with a concrete equation. I mean, that's a step forward. And again, I always say as someone that records neurons in the brain all the time, if I wanted to find consciousness, how would I know it if I found it, right? I mean, if I had an equation, maybe I could do it. But just the way it's defined right now, who knows? I could have already discovered it. I wouldn't know. So I think that's an interesting point.
3337550	3424880	D	0.9466207456140339	Anyway, I can't resist his following up on that because especially evident for me in the remembered present this notion that his words don't actually make any sense. I think that's pure poetry and pure brilliance because what I tend to find myself doing is reading the meaning into his ambiguous sentences and finding all sorts of meanings which wouldn't have occurred to me otherwise. I think that's part of his art. I suspect that he would have been terrified if somebody had actually come along and tried to time down to a clear formal, naturalized mathematical formalism because he wouldn't have had that sort of biotic expressiveness and ambiguity that, of course, is at the heart of his evolutionary thinking. But I think it's great that you, Andy, are able to say you don't understand what he wrote, because I look at some of his sentences. What on earth is he trying to say here? And of course, but the exercise of trying to make sense of Edelman itself brings to the table some really interesting sort of associations and ideas. I'm wondering whether that was part of the secret of his success, is that he resisted the temptation to be crystal clear and just left that mystical, magical ambiguity hanging in the air for people like you and me to worry about and try to resolve.
3425560	3434580	B	0.9366517391304346	I suppose he's given that privilege after winning a Nobel Prize. I think some of us mere mortals wouldn't be afforded that luxury.
3439490	3451686	A	0.9601433333333336	All right, I'll read a few more questions. We can have a few more things. So, small questions. In the book Topobiology Changming, did you draw the feathers, or is that your work?
3451868	3455160	C	0.9388381818181819	The feather is my work, yeah. It's based on my work.
3456170	3489300	A	0.9699467924528302	Awesome. Well, how do we take things forward in science and in our work here in this level of the fractal with this amazing story and history with Edelman? But how do we take our historical and our mentoring context? Like, how do you carry that forward? Is it something you think about?
3494300	3500680	D	0.9569821052631579	I personally do, and I congratulate myself every day on not being like Edelman when it comes to mentoring.
3505680	3506670	A	0.76214	How so?
3508560	3574880	D	0.941698823529412	I'm not going to answer the how so question, but you could read between the lines whether that's the right thing to do or not. I don't know. I don't think you could be Edelman now. In 21st century. We'd be too close to all the culture wars, I think, to even entertain that style anymore. And I suspect that's quite a good thing. Although pressure makes diamonds, and as Andy says, it was an exciting both my colleagues have said it's an exciting, informative time. It was a pressure time. It was a dark time for me in terms of the dynamics, the systemic, the personal interactions. But because it was pressured, it made diamonds. And so we may be throwing away the opportunity to make academic diamonds and be truly creative in terms of making things that endure like diamonds by not having that style of mentorship. But I don't think it will be even legal nowadays, to be quite honest, to run a lab like Edelman ran.
3579800	3753550	B	0.9572677102803737	So, again, I think that over the years, neuroscience, I don't know about the rest of science, but it's almost become sort of industrialized. So there's a method as a young person, when you finally get your own job, you have to set out. And if you're at a university environment, there's certain boxes you have to check off. You have to get a grant, you have to get a certain number of papers, you have to get something in science or Nature in order to get promoted. There's these steps and I think young people are so focused on moving through those steps at the point in their career where they're going to be the most creative and their minds are the most flexible and they can be the most productive. And I see that as a shame, actually, that they're not given this opportunity to be a little freer in the way they accomplish things. And then when they do accomplish some modicum of success, they rely on their past behavior. So instead of saying, okay, I had to go through that in order to get tenure, now that I have tenure, I'm free and I can do something that I really want to do. That really doesn't happen because people get stuck in a rut. And I see that as really holding back progress in neuroscience. And that was kind of the cool thing about the Neuroscience Institute. For better or worse, we weren't allowed to go out and get our own grants. We had to rely on internal funds. But as a result, the only person we had to convince was Edelman in order to get funded. And to a certain extent, that allowed us to do things that were really creative. In hindsight, I think that was a mistake, because financially, that was doom for the Institute. There could have been a hybrid approach that would have been more productive. But then again, as Karl was saying, the investigators would have had to have more freedom to do that, and that was not exactly in the culture, although I think I was an outlier because I maintained a separate lab. So I was somewhat inoculated from that, and that made it a lot more pleasant for me. But again, I see that in current neuroscience, it would be nice if people were willing to take more chances and be a little more creative instead of hoeing to the status quo. That would be, I think, what we need in order to move forward.
3757320	4015860	C	0.9146946401515152	Yeah, no, I think that in terms of the mentorship that Karl was talking about, I mean, certainly I have seen people do very well, but I also have the opportunity, sort of when I moved to University Southern California, to have some interaction with Dr. Simo Benter. And some of you probably know him. I mean, you would see actually he is also very successful, but when he came out, he would always have his students surrounding him very kindly. I think that Edelman is brilliant, but it's kind of the sun is too bright. Sometimes people have to be distilled into the, as you say, academic diamond. That's interesting. So we also have seen some people didn't get along with him well, but still, I think there are many impact. He certainly have encouraged many people go different directions. And in terms of the academic the academic future right. I think you two are more talking about the neurobiology side, but on the morphogenesis side, I would also say he always emphasized the patterns thinking that pattern is kind of the way nature either biology, non biology, they leave some clue for us to figure out. And when I was there, I remember every time he talked about the visual columns tolson we saw they have worked out, he got very excited. And in fact, I have one of my peer at that time was working on the visual columns of the cat. But I think that paper that work never really go out to be published. But anyway, on the more practical things, I work on the tissue patterns and I feel that you mentioned about the top of biology. And again, I think he coined the term, and I think the term I think it means a lot because eventually my career was trying to figure out these signaling molecules. Because at that time, people only talk about signaling molecule. Very important. But the idea of topobiology is that you even position these simply by positioning these signaling centers in a different topology. You can actually have a lot of consequence from there and the signaling center can also have a different lifetime, the strength and the duration and the range they can influence. So by modulating he like these terms to modulating these signaling center, you can create a lot of regional differences and up to now, as I say from my own take bird, you look at it right feather here, downing feather here, the beautiful crown feather here, tail feather. But these are all from the same genome. So it actually is through the positioning of these different signaling center in a different way, and you basically have the same ingredient, but you can play with them by topologically, temporal, and especially arrange them and to create a quite complex pattern. I feel that in the tissue patterning Morphogenesis side, I feel that his vision is great, and I think we still try to work out more about how these patterns are positioned. But I think that's sort of the direction in a more visualized purple biology aspect we can appreciate.
4018520	4025400	A	0.92243	Awesome. Well, perhaps if each of you would like to give any closing thoughts.
4031370	4125910	D	0.9526942857142857	Yes, to echo those last sentiments, I think everything that Adelman said or tried to say, depending whether you could understand him, I think he's absolutely right. And we are slowly discovering the truths we've just heard about top ofology and the importance of patterns. And of course, if you speak to somebody like Mike Levin, he'd be talking about exactly the same thing. He'd use words like basal cognition and pattern formation. But I think that we're talking about the same principles of biological self organization and edelman. I didn't know about turbobiology, but I do know there are other fundamental ideas that he just incidental to him. I am absolutely sure. I think notions of degeneracy in the neurosciences and psychology, the notion of many to one structure, function mappings, for example. These are fundamental ideas which now are taken almost for granted in my world, but you sort of forget how much he actually contributed or at least laid the seeds for, and sometimes very explicitly so, it should be acknowledged. Although he was, as Mark Rakel put it, in his typically gentlemanly fashion, edelman was a very complicated man. He was also very brilliant and is responsible, I think, for a lot of the direction of travel and the intellectual growth, certainly of my intellectual growth, but I would say also many aspects of our academic communities.
4128330	4135880	A	0.8977754545454547	Thank you, Karl. Perhaps Andrew oh, unmute and then please continue.
4139670	4238280	B	0.9422380476190475	So I would know if there's anyone listening out there, there's something to be said about maybe looking back in the ancient literature that goes back quite a bit and maybe seeing how some of these things came about and trying to put it together and see that there's this iteration that constantly takes place. People rediscover the same thing that's been discovered multiple times and try to see how there is a status quo in the way science works. And then there's these outliers where there's sort of creative bubbles that come to fore. And I think it's interesting to think of Edelman and the things he did and the people that were associated with him in terms of sort of these disruptive, they call it disruptions and how those disruptions may have consequence many years later. It's kind of interesting if you take the long view. So I think it's maybe worthwhile thinking about this once in a while and for young people out there to be encouraged to think out of the normal way of doing things once in a while, try to foster your creativity and have the courage to go after some of those ideas. I think that's a take home message for me anyway.
4241270	4332400	C	0.9263645851528378	Yeah, I would say I always like all sort of influenced by his idea, saying that we should study the important question that have a general meaning. So I think that kind of ideas he said that, look at the big pictures. I remember when I was there, he talked like that, the big pictures. So that is where when he thinking about the Darwinism, he would say it's not only for the species evolution, for the immunoglobulin chronos selection, he would push it to the brain theory. And for me, I work on the morphogenesis. I actually would come to realize that is also what happened at the tissue level. These cells are competing with each other to form that patterns and then pattern is selected. When there is a functional advantage, it will be stabilized. I think the idea of saying if we're going to do science, we ask big questions, ask for the generalization, I appreciate that. And certainly he is like how you want to call it, right? A huge elephant. So we all touch him through different side and have a different take on that. In terms of the young scientist, I also remember he likes the Chinese proverb I cited to him. That is to say, if you want to get Tiger's son, you must get into Tiger's cave. So with three did.
4335490	4344960	A	0.9773982352941177	Thank you all. That's a great note. Really appreciate this conversation. And again, thanks. Until next time.
4345410	4349360	C	0.92479375	Okay. Thank you. Bye. Nice meeting you all.
4349850	4351890	D	0.8827260000000001	Bye bye. Thank you. Bye.
