8010	9520	1	A	0.94406	Hello and welcome, everybody.
10130	14078	2	A	0.64197	It is September 19, 2023.
14244	26870	3	A	0.99954	We're here at the active inference Institute in guest stream 58.1, and today the session will be around the experiences of those who have worked with Gerald Edelman.
27370	42700	4	A	0.99751	Edelman lived from 1929 to 2014, and as hopefully this conversation can explore and unpack a little bit, worked in various areas related to the brain, body, and mind.
43150	59726	5	A	0.99777	So without further ado, I will have our guests introduce themselves, give a little bit of a background on how they came to be working with Professor Edelman, and then we have several prepared questions and several other questions.
59828	65380	6	A	0.97503	So thank you all for joining, and perhaps, Andrew, if you'd like to begin.
66710	69950	7	B	0.91975	All right, so I'll just start a little bit with my background.
70030	82370	8	B	0.99	I did my PhD at University of Minnesota, and then I did my postdoc at Hopkins with Apostles Georgopoulos and Vernon Macassel.
82970	93610	9	B	0.99	And then I got a job in Phoenix working in a small neuroscience institute or neuroscience department at a hospital.
94030	97100	10	B	0.99	And I worked there for six or seven years.
97550	113810	11	B	0.99	And my interest was working with non human primates with monkeys and studying how they reached for different objects and drew objects and then looked at the activity in primary motor cortex neurons.
114470	135350	12	B	1	And we carried out different kinds of analysis based on the directionality of the neurons in motor cortex built populations and were able to actually look at these neural signals and see how they corresponded in a pretty exact way to the way the animals are moved in time and space.
135500	137110	13	B	0.99783	In other words, trajectories.
137710	157946	14	B	0.76	And after working there six or seven years, I was invited to come and look at this new institute that Gerald Edelman was establishing in San Diego in La Jolla and met a bunch of super interesting people like Guilio Tononi and Olof Sporns.
158138	166100	15	B	0.93	And really, their deep intellect and curiosity and creativity has convinced me to move to.
170070	172290	16	B	0.73	I ended up moving there.
172360	188570	17	B	0.94	And so Edelman was able to build this gorgeous research facility on the Tory Pines cliffs, basically, and it was a magnificent architecture.
188990	202374	18	B	0.98	And he recruited a number of people besides sparns and Tononi, and so he divided the group into theorists and experimentalists.
202422	211818	19	B	0.99	And I was an experimentalist, but we would have lunch every day together as a group and discuss different topics.
211994	227378	20	B	0.99	And I was really exposed to a whole new way of thinking about neuroscience in terms of sort of the cognitive aspects of it, which I still have difficulty with, to tell you personally, because I don't even know how you define cognition.
227554	234760	21	B	0.99	And I'm not sure that anybody really can, or as Vernon Machasto would say, I don't know the answer to that, nor does anybody else.
235610	238540	22	B	0.99973	Maybe Karl would take issue with that.
239230	254846	23	B	0.99995	But anyway, the coolest thing about it was being really exposed to a lot of creative thinking and deep intellectual endeavors, and I've really never regretted the seven or eight years I spent there.
254948	272290	24	B	1	I think it really helped change the way my career went from being sort of a motor control strict, sort of very careful scientist to using my imagination a lot more than I would have otherwise.
273350	275060	25	B	0.99293	So I'll leave it at that.
278040	278790	26	A	0.9922	Awesome. Cheng-Ming?
279480	289004	27	C	0.84206	 okay, yeah, I can speak about my journey with Dr.
289042	289800	28	C	0.44507	Edelman.
289960	292424	29	C	0.99984	So I was originally from Taiwan.
292472	297644	30	C	1	I graduated with a medical degree in Taiwan university in 78.
297762	300744	31	C	0.99997	But I was very interested in doing basic science.
300872	309948	32	C	0.99997	So I applied a PhD program and got into Rock Federal University and that started to search for a laboratory.
310044	312000	33	C	0.94	And certainly Dr.
312070	324352	34	C	0.30542	Ederman is very powerful intellectual capacity building in the building it was on 9th floor of the Bronx laboratory.
324416	325504	35	C	1	I was very impressed.
325552	328360	36	C	0.56214	So I joined the laboratory.
329180	342680	37	C	0.99897	So since 78 to 83 I was a PhD student and I was working on the topic called neural cell adhesion molecule.
342840	347688	38	C	0.97841	So at that time Edelman already got his Nobel prize for immunoglobulin.
347784	356364	39	C	0.99936	But he would be usually elegant way would say I solved molecular recognition.
356492	361676	40	C	0.99992	So he said I don't want to stay in immunology to collect more awards.
361788	365248	41	C	0.78636	He said I will work out cell recognition.
365424	373780	42	C	0.99029	So in his mind how cell recognition work is through a group of adhesion molecular interaction.
374120	383068	43	C	0.9916	So that's how he started to work on the cell adhesion molecule and duty's house actually work out the chicken cell adhesion molecular.
383184	392480	44	C	0.99081	So when I joined the laboratory, my PhD things was work out the first mammalian cell adhesion molecule.
392660	406000	45	C	0.99	And in addition to NCAM, though, I supposed to work out on these adhesion molecule mediating the Neurolog cell recognition as he said he would say.
406150	416388	46	C	1	I asked him also after all what would be my PhD thesis and he would say ming, when I start to write a poem, I don't know how it's going to end.
416554	419812	47	C	0.98471	That's the way he would put his language there.
419946	428808	48	C	0.99968	So he just figured out retinal tectoprojection I'm hardworking student so I would work out on that.
428974	445592	49	C	1	And as you know, these days our so called systems biology approach, right, is these transcriptome single cell RNA sequencing to identify a non biased way to identify molecules involved.
445736	452160	50	C	0.66	At that time the so called systems biology approach was making monoclonal antibodies.
452820	467968	51	C	0.99983	So I would be there taking out the brain and the retina and the tectum and produce I produce 18 batch of the monochromatic antibody against these neuronal cell membranes.
468064	478200	52	C	0.99993	So I certainly have identified a lot of adhesion molecule but none of them really show a very distinct pattern these days.
478270	487720	53	C	0.95	I think the field using the transcription factors was able to identify some patterns but at that later it's kind of all altogether.
488540	499820	54	C	0.80864	But I remember that actually anyway, I didn't really figure out retinol technical projection but that's enough for me to graduate.
500160	510316	55	C	0.99913	But at that time I also still remember how I actually had a great impact on my professional career.
510428	517120	56	C	0.99956	So I was cutting chicken spinal cord cross section to mapping these cell adhesion molecules.
517720	527700	57	C	0.9988	So I have some feather chicken feather hanging outside there, and they stand with this NCAM with the most beautiful, exquisite pattern.
529420	538484	58	C	0.97945	Later work on the feather as my major research model, kind of as a rosetta song to understand the language of morphogenesis.
538612	541192	59	C	0.99988	But there I remember how I started that.
541246	544056	60	C	0.99974	You have these feather, they form these branches.
544168	547320	61	C	0.99932	So these branches are actually originally formed cells.
547400	549420	62	C	0.99107	Then they die to become space.
549570	553048	63	C	0.99992	But before they die, they actually light up with NCM.
553144	557504	64	C	0.99682	Light up with NCM with the most exquisite pattern there.
557702	561260	65	C	0.99935	So you kind of say, okay, you're going to carve out this region.
561340	567472	66	C	0.99949	You light up with NCM, you light up with sonic, and then other signal coming to say you die.
567536	570240	67	C	0.99937	But before they die, they light up that pattern.
570320	572656	68	C	0.99823	So the feather pattern is very exquisite.
572768	576700	69	C	0.83668	Radio symmetry, bilateral symmetry, bilateral symmetry.
576800	581400	70	C	0.91916	So Adam was very impressed by those findings.
585260	593964	71	C	1	I appreciate he actually encouraged that when he sees something, he appreciates he encouraged it.
594002	597548	72	C	0.99998	He didn't say, oh, you're supposed to work on the brain or whatever.
597634	598828	73	C	0.99997	He actually like it.
598914	611516	74	C	1	And subsequently he also developed this idea of topobiology, which he would acknowledge to say it's sort of based on the very exquisite pattern we found in the feather.
611628	613804	75	C	0.99868	But of course he developed it further.
613932	621424	76	C	0.99768	But some other time he would say, if this is not in feather, I am adamant I'm going to get another Nobel Prize.
621552	622804	77	C	0.99801	So I like it.
622842	625136	78	C	0.95657	Let him encourage that direction.
625248	635048	79	C	0.98849	So later when I became independent, I sort of say, okay, brain is wonderful, but it's all like being curved inside.
635134	638324	80	C	0.71	I don't figure it out, but I'm not that smart.
638372	642008	81	C	0.99999	But I might be able to figure out feather pattern formation.
642184	645180	82	C	0.99808	So I have a reasonable, successful career.
645520	657708	83	C	0.98805	Figure out the able debo of the feather, but as I said, not just feather itself, but use feather as a rosetta stone to figure out morphogenesis.
657884	665010	84	C	1	And that sort of I think I appreciate that he's encouraged on that.
665480	672548	85	C	0.99872	Also, as you know, the stem cell biology comes along and the feather in a bird baby chicken is one way.
672634	680492	86	C	0.87782	Adult chicken, male, female, all looks differently, but they are all from the same group of the stem cell that my lab have stemon straight.
680576	696780	87	C	0.99985	So it is the so called stem cell niche would be modulated by sex hormone, by age, by season, by temperature, and let them help you produce different feather forms to adapt to the environment.
697760	703260	88	C	1	I think I enjoy my research career and it was obviously have his impact.
703340	721716	89	C	1	And I think he's intellectually brilliant and always encouraged going after fundamental principles, saying that if you're going to work on a question, ask most profound questions and approach with the most available technology, current technology of the day.
721818	724996	90	C	0.98061	Don't waste your time on small questions.
725178	731850	91	C	0.99	And I think I have taken those in so I can stay up to here and we can discuss more later.
733740	734488	92	A	0.99988	Thank you.
734574	735112	93	A	0.99963	Awesome.
735246	737352	94	A	0.99412	Karl?
737406	746300	95	D	0.99683	Hi! So my name is Karl Friston, and like my two colleagues, I found my stay with Jerry Edelman both foundational and very, very formative.
747040	751820	96	D	0.96	I was quite early in my research career when I joined the neuroscience Institute.
752580	755900	97	D	0.99999	Having trained as a psychiatrist, I got into brain imaging.
756060	776792	98	D	1	And at the inception of brain imaging, people were for the first time discovering principles of functional brain organization, such as the principle of functional segregation and subsequently principles of integration, how segregated specialized parts of the brain communicate or are coordinated or are integrated together.
776926	788180	99	D	0.87	And one of the key theoreticians and neuroanatomists that authored this particular interpretation and deployment of neuroimaging was Semir Zeki.
788260	789608	100	D	0.97	And semir zeki.
789704	813040	101	D	0.97454	For those of you who don't know, he's still very active, one of the architects of neuroaesthetics in his late retirement now, but he was friendly with Jerry Edelman, and Semi was famed for understanding the computational anatomy of early visual cortex and visual cortical hierarchies.
814120	818180	102	D	1	And I repeat, the principles of functional specialization and integration.
819000	839390	103	D	0.99847	So after a couple of years at the inception of human brain mapping, using positron emission tomography and establishing, for example, the color center in a particular part of the visual cortex, I was effectively sent to New York.
840080	848924	104	D	0.99983	So my period of engagement was a fellowship between about 1990 and 1992 93.
849042	865484	105	D	0.99996	So this slightly predates Andy, and it covered the translocation of the Neurosciences Institute from the Rockefeller University to La Jolla and under the auspices of the script.
865532	887188	106	D	0.97557	So I spent half my fellowship at the Rockefeller and then subsequently watched the building of the magnificent neuroscientist Institute on North Tory Pines Road that Andy referred to with the auditorium, if I remember, designed by imported experts in audition and music and sound engineering from Sweden.
887364	889470	107	D	0.99675	It was really an amazing place.
889920	909024	108	D	1	I do remember a couple of lunches before I returned to the UK to pursue my career in imaging neuroscience under the auspices of the welcome Trust, but only a couple because we were sort of in rented accommodation from the script on the other side of the road.
909142	919860	109	D	0.99911	But it was an awe inspiring bit of architecture, both intellectually and practically in terms of the early days of the Neuroscience Institute.
920360	930292	110	D	0.89543	So I was sent there basically because Sami Zecki thought it would be good for me to go and work with Jerry Adelman retrospectively.
930356	931464	111	D	1	I now appreciate that.
931502	947390	112	D	1	I was sent there to replace a gentleman called Reed Montague, who had been tasked with on the pure theory side, as opposed to the celadesian molecule and the wet lab side of Edelman's research.
948160	964512	113	D	0.99957	On the pure theory side, the point of my arrival, and to a certain extent at the point of Reed's brief exposure to the neuroscientist institute, the theory of neuronal group selection was becoming consolidated.
964656	989756	114	D	0.99	And in particular, what drove the selection of neuronal groups, neuro ensembles, cell assemblies, however you want to describe them, and given Edelman's polchamp for incredibly incisive and straightforward but very creative biological thinking.
989858	1022272	115	D	0.9999	He thought, well, it's obviously some kind of natural selection and therefore there must be the homologue of adaptive fitness that is underwriting the scaffolding and the dynamic structuring of connectivity or connections that were definitive of in the spirit of functional specialization, segregation, but also the mediator of functional integration of these neuronal groups.
1022416	1026230	116	D	0.97594	So this became known generically as value.
1026620	1039280	117	D	0.98458	So Reed was working on value dependent learning the plasticity and the principles that underwrite which synaptic connections have the right kind of adaptive fitness in their mileage.
1039300	1051588	118	D	0.99996	In that context that enabled them to persist and other connections went away and became or contributed to the sparse coupling of neural networks.
1051784	1059840	119	D	0.96	And then Reed, and we can talk about the glorious stories about the departure of Reed.
1060260	1075664	120	D	0.54693	Reed actually ended up in a rather circuitous way with Terry Sejnowski at the Salk subsequently, then hooked up with people like Peter Diane and Wolfram Schultz, who at that time was in Zurich.
1075792	1085304	121	D	1	And of course the story that emerged from that was the reward prediction error story that actually, ironically, Reed did not.
1085342	1091148	122	D	0.96425	But a number of Wolfram eventually got the brain prize for some decade or so later.
1091314	1095176	123	D	0.99828	But the inception of that story was actually at the Rockefeller.
1095368	1122816	124	D	0.99	And it was basically an attempt by, I think, Reed to formalize the principles that must be in play to make the theory of neural group selection under what was an important dynamic from Edelman's point of view, which is this notion of reentrant dynamics.
1122848	1140620	125	D	0.89863	So very, very early on he had identified the fundamental importance of recurrent connectivity and reentry as very formative in the emergence of these structured groups and the associated functional specialization.
1141840	1165564	126	D	0.87687	Just open brackets, just to point out that you could claim that certainly his early conversations with people at that time sort of preempted stuff in computational neuroscience that we now take as for granted, not really realizing where it came from, but certainly his work with Vernon Mancast.
1165612	1168116	127	D	0.96398	I'm sure Andy will be able to speak to this later on.
1168138	1175552	128	D	0.67839	On the importance of reentry and dynamics and oscillations in the formation of these groups and sort of cortical.
1175616	1176848	129	D	0.46089	Columns and the like.
1176954	1187800	130	D	0.92475	That was sort of, I think, the monographs that they not the monographs, but the papers and the articles they wrote at that time I think were quite visionary.
1188380	1197816	131	D	0.54889	Steven Grossberg was also hanging around a few years earlier, and I think you could probably claim that between the two of them, they invented computational neuroscience.
1197928	1220672	132	D	0.99713	Certainly know New York, Boston, sort of East Coast kind of style of computational neuroscience, closely involved with something called the Neuroscience Research Foundation, so that they, as I understand it and again, Andy may want to correct me here, but this was like the forerunner of the Society for Neuroscience.
1220736	1222052	133	D	0.99724	It was a group of people.
1222186	1242872	134	D	0.64198	People, and perhaps Max Cowan is the name that comes to mind, people who actually invented words like neuroscience, which wasn't a thing, certainly when I was applying to my undergraduate studies and trying to create institutions, academic institutions, that would endorse this notion of neuroscience.
1242936	1246072	135	D	0.99	And the Neuroscience Research Foundation was like the old guard.
1246216	1254940	136	D	1	And then the Young Turks came along and reacted against the old Guard, the Neuroscience Research Foundation, to form the Society for Neuroscience.
1255020	1257296	137	D	1	And then we all know the story since that time.
1257318	1261120	138	D	0.92964	It's one of the biggest societies in academia.
1261860	1281336	139	D	0.94107	So just making the point that Aidelman and his colleagues and vicarious colleagues, a lot of people, oliver Sacks being one, ernst Mer being another of his favorite sort of characters to talk to, all of whom would come and visit, and we were privileged just to listen in.
1281358	1301816	140	D	0.87	And conversations in this very formative time where some of the sort of, I think, conceptual pillars of the way that we understand neuroscience in the 21st century were first articulated, probably not using quite the same words that we use nowadays.
1301848	1311724	141	D	0.97552	So no one talks about reentry anymore, so about recurrent neural networks or sort of feed forward and feedback and the like, but the same underlying dynamics.
1311772	1313312	142	D	0.86	And maths, I think, is absolutely there.
1313366	1319700	143	D	0.98979	Anyway, I was brought in to replace Reed Montague, so that was my little contribution.
1320520	1335476	144	D	0.63842	Whilst we were in the Rockefeller, I made the mistake of thinking that the right way to do this was to actually write down equations and try and sort of naturalize it in terms of mathematics.
1335588	1337604	145	D	0.60286	Edelman was a great biological thinker.
1337652	1342372	146	D	0.99995	He was not a very good mathematical thinker, so there was a bit of a clash there.
1342446	1352130	147	D	0.55434	So I remember one meeting very early on when it was being decided what I was going to be doing.
1353060	1358192	148	D	0.99816	Perhaps it's useful just to say the context in which those early meetings took place.
1358326	1362140	149	D	0.98478	So Andy has already mentioned Guilio Tononi and Olaf spawns.
1362220	1369140	150	D	0.99456	They were two key people, edelman's young men who already in sight, you.
1369290	1375060	151	D	1	And then I replaced Reed, and they were working really purely on theory.
1375480	1386564	152	D	0.93	And that theory was tested in the context of a forerunner of supercomputing, a hypercube that was driving, in my day, little robots.
1386612	1406640	153	D	0.99926	So, again, Edelman was doing neurobotics in the 1980s in exactly the same way that people now in developmental neurobotics are still addressing exactly the same questions, probably with the same kind of computer infrastructure that obviously upgraded.
1407700	1427220	154	D	0.96757	So we were sitting around and Edelman was called out to take a phone call from Germany, and there was a look of horror on people's faces because I'd suggested a relationship between value dependent learning and the riskola Wagner rule from behavioral psychology.
1427880	1433112	155	D	0.97	And as soon as you mention an equation or a formula, that set Edelman off.
1433166	1437450	156	D	0.97	And I didn't know that, so I didn't know I pushed the wrong button.
1437820	1442056	157	D	0.95354	So when Edelman came back in, I was effectively rusticated.
1442168	1458848	158	D	1	I was prevented from doing any work for three months and for every day, afternoon and morning I had to sit in the Rockefeller library and read purely biological great texts, and I ended up having to.
1458934	1462844	159	D	1	The last one was The Growth of Biological Thought by Ernst Mayer.
1462892	1473910	160	D	1	I had to read from page to page, and when I did so, I had become sufficiently sanitized to be allowed back into the workplace to actually do some work anyway.
1474280	1477108	161	D	0.9984	So that was our contribution.
1477284	1495528	162	D	1	And then when we moved to the whole parade of 16 Wheeler traxxas, translocating all the kit and all the paperwork to La Jolla, and then relocating out there, settling down, I brought that work to closure.
1495624	1518784	163	D	0.98	And interesting, that was at the point when Giulio well, Olaf, I remember him saying what he wants is basically to understand and simulate the brain in a way that draws explanatory power from the architecture of the connectivity.
1518912	1528776	164	D	0.99739	Basically, we say he wants to establish connectomics as a discipline, and of course, ten years later, he's Mr.
1528878	1530196	165	D	0.47369	Connectomics.
1530388	1558080	166	D	0.69203	Julio at that point was inventing integrated information theory with a particular focus on information, theoretical formulations of complexity, and what special, if you like, counterintuitive behaviors, do you get from these biologically configured connectors when you put dynamics on structure and trying to quantify that in a way that ultimately transpired to be measures like phi in IIT.
1558820	1568036	167	D	0.99779	So that was a fun time as the mathematician, closet mathematician, because I wasn't allowed to say anything about the maths at the time.
1568218	1569364	168	D	1	I enjoyed that bit.
1569402	1582148	169	D	0.98	And so looking being in at the, if you like, ground zero at the inception of all these aspirations, which eventually led to very fruitful careers.
1582244	1587400	170	D	0.97	And then I went back to the UK.
1587740	1595710	171	D	0.99898	Just had fond memories and non fond memories, but both of a nostalgic sort since that time.
1598080	1598830	172	A	0.99316	Awesome.
1599360	1600712	173	A	0.99905	Great tales.
1600776	1603416	174	A	0.68873	Changming or Andrew, anything you want to add?
1603458	1605490	175	A	0.99992	Or I can go to one of the questions.
1606180	1614196	176	B	0.96711	Well, just to expound a little bit on what Karl was saying, I don't know if you can see this book.
1614298	1631960	177	B	0.64611	Okay, so this was something that came out of the neuroscience research program that was sort of the old boys club that Francis Schmidt started at MIT and later was the basis for the neurosciences Institute.
1632300	1635716	178	B	1	And what this was was sort of the who's who in neuroscience.
1635828	1639964	179	B	0.99846	So, again, if you look at this book, it says, edited by Francis O.
1640002	1640472	180	B	0.87941	Schmidt.
1640536	1642510	181	B	0.99991	So he was the guy that started that.
1645120	1651870	182	B	0.99972	This persisted even throughout the 2000s.
1654340	1663244	183	B	0.99997	Once or twice a year at the neurosciences Institute, they would organize one of these meetings, and it would be a who's who of neuroscience.
1663372	1672404	184	B	0.91122	So all the Nobel laureates in neuroscience, all the big names, would come for a four or five day meeting and talk about their research.
1672522	1679464	185	B	0.98	And as a member of the neurosciences Institute, I got to sit in and meet these people.
1679662	1689948	186	B	0.98	And it was phenomenal, especially with my background, because I was sort of not on the mainstream of neuroscience at that point.
1690114	1693416	187	B	0.96	And that was really fascinating.
1693528	1702380	188	B	0.98228	So you got to meet people like Wolf Schultz and all the big names that were there, francis Crick.
1705540	1711964	189	B	0.70092	But what I want to go back to is this original book by Edelman and Mac Castle called The Mindful Brain.
1712092	1724736	190	B	0.9998	This is sort of like one of the bibles of early creative thinking about brain function, and it presaged the idea of distributed systems.
1724768	1728650	191	B	0.99983	This was sort of the thing that Vernon Moncasso was very much into.
1729660	1744248	192	B	0.98	And so to this day, the way most people think about brain function is boxes, where each part of the brain is confined to a box, and then there are arrows pointed to other boxes.
1744424	1747880	193	B	1	And so we get this idea that there's a circuitry.
1747960	1764710	194	B	0.99999	So you often hear neuroscientists talk about circuits, and that kind of comes from the idea that you have these boxes and you have arrows and you have plus and minus signs with the arrows, and then somehow the pluses and minuses add up and tell you what's going to happen at the next box.
1765880	1774612	195	B	0.89	And that is nice because you can kind of simplify things and talk about causality in very concrete terms.
1774666	1784808	196	B	0.99	And it's great if you're an engineer, because you can write transfer functions about defining how you get an output from an input, but that's not the way the brain works.
1784974	1809040	197	B	0.88	And I think Kyle can attest to the early days of MRI studies where everybody was doing pseudocolored representations of these different areas to see which area would light up a particular task, as if each area had a specific job and could be assigned to a specific task.
1811140	1837850	198	B	0.97241	Neuroscience in general is still suffering from that point of view, and it's only become a little bit more clear as computational science has matured in the last five or ten years, especially with the adaptation of artificial neural networks to the mainstream, that we can start to explore more biological meaningful ways of brain function.
1838460	1861090	199	B	0.79	And Vernon Macassill recognized that as sort of the I would say the founder of systems neuroscience, modern systems neuroscience, and Edelman talked about that a little know, there's group theory and some of the things that OLEF has started.
1862740	1885060	200	B	0.99975	With graph theory still sort of based on strict anatomical you know, if you read like Olaf's latest review, where the field is starting to progress away from that constraint of anatomical connectivity, we're starting to get more toward the idea of truly distributed systems.
1885220	1887508	201	B	1	And to me, that's super exciting.
1887604	1906092	202	B	0.99995	But you can look back to this book from the see that the seed was planted way back then and see how almost 50 years later, now, it's finally starting to evolve into something that's becoming more mainstream.
1906236	1921140	203	B	1	And if you sort of look at the evolution of neuroscience, I think if you project ahead to the next ten or 20 years, this is going to be really the fundamental change in the way we think about neural function.
1921290	1930260	204	B	1	And I'm super excited about that and you look and sort of back in history to see how that's evolved.
1930420	1937130	205	B	0.96	And I don't know, I think there's something very attractive about thinking about things that way.
1939040	1939452	206	C	0.80274	Yeah.
1939506	1949150	207	C	0.84497	Okay, I'll add something, I think, talking about Edema's, the brilliance about seeing things through.
1949920	1950524	208	C	1	I don't know.
1950562	1959410	209	C	0.99994	In the neurobiology field, you people still sort of think the neuro Darwinism idea is still there, right?
1960500	1970176	210	C	0.99681	So that was the time when I was with him in Rockefeller University he would talk things like know Darwinism for evolution species.
1970288	1975088	211	C	0.99	And he saw that in immunoglobulin chronos selection.
1975184	1979290	212	C	0.99315	So he applied to this neurodarwinism idea.
1979660	1990940	213	C	0.99955	But I have to say, subsequently, actually, my career is mainly in university, Southern California and working on this morphogenesis tissue patent formation.
1991360	1996376	214	C	0.99	And in our field, sort of more bench work aspect of Edelman.
1996488	2008300	215	C	0.99512	This direction, not the neurobiology direction, but in the field, there were people originally more talking about the stem cells are predetermined and then they go this lineage.
2008380	2009996	216	C	0.87596	They go this lineage.
2010188	2012688	217	C	0.99994	But we using the skin as a model.
2012774	2017888	218	C	0.99945	Actually, I start to write these things kind of a Darwinism within the skin.
2017984	2022992	219	C	0.97	I mean, basically it's that there is no preset forever stem cells.
2023056	2028772	220	C	0.99999	If you wipe out these stem cells, other cells are waiting there to take over the space.
2028906	2036772	221	C	0.99994	So there is even during development and during regeneration to make the tissue patterning process robust.
2036916	2049068	222	C	0.99999	There is a small so called Darwinism competition going on in there and that is sort of also influencing our work in morphogenesis these days.
2049154	2056050	223	C	0.99	And I think that's kind of the impact of him on this aspect as well.
2059550	2060300	224	C	0.74765	Wow.
2060990	2061658	225	A	0.94301	All right.
2061744	2063114	226	A	0.99906	I'll read a question.
2063232	2065170	227	A	0.99977	This was from Dave Douglas.
2065350	2080100	228	A	0.99014	Dave wrote, we know that Professor Edelman used deep analogies in exploring new subjects as in his leveraging his knowledge of immunology and organismal development to probe conceptualization and learning.
2080470	2085506	229	A	1	Did he ever work specifically on metaphor and analogy as such?
2085688	2095990	230	A	0.99999	For example, did he leverage his experience of music and poetry to dig out scientific facts while separating fertile from sterile analogies?
2100490	2104060	231	A	0.40158	An answer or just what that makes you think of?
2107470	2113078	232	D	0.74118	It makes me think of something which Edelman used to call me, which I am an intellectual thug.
2113174	2117774	233	D	0.99842	So I'm sure that there's a great answer to that.
2117812	2118830	234	D	0.99988	Excellent question.
2118980	2122906	235	D	0.99	And it does speak to Edelman's skills and interests.
2122938	2140100	236	D	0.99979	As a violinist, I do remember that BBC Horizon came to do a profile on him and his ideas and it was prefaced with, I think, shots of him playing the violin to concert standard.
2140490	2151106	237	D	0.99978	But I have absolutely no idea whether he used that sort of part of his life to take things beyond metaphor.
2151138	2159980	238	D	0.76571	So as an intellectual thug, I'm going to hand over to my two colleagues to see whether they can give a more elegant answer.
2167530	2171130	239	A	1	Or anything in that area of the arts.
2171550	2174410	240	A	1	And you brought up poetry.
2175710	2178890	241	A	0.99999	Anything in the arts and sciences?
2181890	2193950	242	C	0.99205	Well, I'm no brain biologist, but just to say that from my side of the interaction, he really tried to merge science and art.
2194100	2198100	243	C	0.99995	He would think a real science would be beautiful.
2198950	2201202	244	C	1	And that's the way I think when I learn.
2201256	2211554	245	C	0.99824	As I mentioned, when I say, oh, I was expecting a more clear cut CC's idea, but he would say Ming is like writing a poetry.
2211602	2215320	246	C	0.99806	He said, When I start, I don't know where it's going to end.
2216010	2221926	247	C	0.98879	It's like some artists when you ask them how do you create this painting?
2222038	2233738	248	C	1	I try to ask this question to some of my friends who are artists and they say they do not have a clear blueprint of how that painting would looks like.
2233824	2243258	249	C	0.99999	They have an idea, it's kind of floating in the sky and they try to grab it down, so they paint on the way and try to make it into a painting.
2243354	2249922	250	C	0.6555	Or I have a friend who are poets, I ask them this, they say they grab the word to make them coming down.
2250056	2256100	251	C	1	And I kind of feel adamant sort of treat the scientific idea like that.
2257370	2265080	252	C	0.99504	This is my superficial interaction, just some experience.
2266730	2270202	253	B	1	I don't have a direct reply to that.
2270256	2279654	254	B	0.99992	But in general, I think there's the idea of creativity that he brought to the forefront.
2279782	2290670	255	B	1	And then also with that creativity, you have to have a certain amount of courage to move out of the sort of mainstream, right?
2290740	2296420	256	B	0.99999	So if you have an idea and you have to have a certain amount of courage to put that forward.
2298950	2299314	257	C	0.76489	If.
2299352	2302270	258	B	0.99991	That idea is creative and out of the ordinary.
2302430	2310760	259	B	0.7	And I think artists and sort of really great scientists have that in common.
2313370	2322490	260	A	0.99998	Maybe to that nexus of creativity and career development and courage for you or just in the environment.
2322910	2330140	261	A	0.99992	How did his mentoring help bring out these threads in people?
2332130	2333870	262	A	0.97701	For better and for worse?
2334210	2336318	263	B	1	I think Karl could attest to that.
2336404	2341950	264	B	1	I have a hard time viewing Edelman as a feel good mentor.
2343490	2346242	265	B	0.99	I think he would throw ideas out there.
2346296	2353460	266	B	0.99934	He could be pretty aggressive and I would say frightening to young people.
2354790	2363190	267	B	0.97489	So I wouldn't cast Edelman's behavior as sort of the typical mentor.
2364490	2376970	268	B	0.99197	But again, I think the environment that he created was someplace that was really special and reflected that kind of courageous creativity.
2378350	2380394	269	B	1	And I really appreciate that.
2380432	2381020	270	B	0.99924	Now.
2383330	2390362	271	D	0.96156	Just to endorse that notion of courageous creativity, I think it's a really nice observation.
2390506	2405026	272	D	0.99882	I've often reflected on whether let's take for example, Julio and Olaf, and I think you could probably apply it to me and Andy and a number of other people as well.
2405048	2419990	273	D	0.99223	But if we just take Julio and Olaf, who've both become world leaders, thought leaders in their own particular field, having brought something new to the table, and in some instances in more than one area.
2420060	2432846	274	D	0.98759	So Julia TENone, in terms of sleep research and synaptic Homeostasis in terms of his work in consciousness studies, integrated information theory, olaf in.
2432868	2437920	275	D	0.99994	Terms of structural function and mean.
2438450	2442880	276	D	0.99986	Is it that Edelman had a good eye for bright young men?
2443410	2446510	277	D	0.9995	Or is it that bright young men learned how to do this?
2446580	2462774	278	D	0.99957	That this was the way to be courageous and to say it's an adversarial in that courage to be creative and to pursue what you have created in a slightly adversarial or at least sort of defensive way, I don't know.
2462812	2479130	279	D	0.99973	But what I do know is there was certainly a culture that was established that would allow those kinds of skills to be developed and is referred to them slightly obliquely.
2480590	2486282	280	D	0.99997	It was a dark culture and it has to be said, it was a very homophilic culture.
2486346	2488714	281	D	0.99999	There were no women allowed in this culture.
2488842	2506370	282	D	0.98568	So in my time, the culture was really one man and adoring young men and you had to repeatedly affirm that adoration.
2506730	2515058	283	D	0.93	And part of that was really useful and really enjoyable and has already mentioned the lunches.
2515234	2519174	284	D	0.98049	Exactly the same regime characterized my stay.
2519212	2530678	285	D	0.99724	There was a rigorous routine where all the young men would go off to the New York cafe, would have onion rings and burgers and Aileman would wax lyrical.
2530774	2545306	286	D	0.56	And perhaps this is not art and creativity, but he was artistic in his joke telling, so he'd always have a new joke every lunchtime in a New York diner.
2545498	2550322	287	D	1	And that was a routine and it was just pure theatre, day after day after day.
2550376	2553150	288	D	0.99966	Incredible energy, but it was theater.
2553230	2564370	289	D	1	The young men were the audience and we basically, I think, were dancing to his orchestration.
2564450	2567510	290	D	0.99989	He was the conductor and he was the director.
2570490	2587678	291	D	0.55386	It's possible that that culture did actually instill in all of us, and particularly Olaf and Julio, the notion that to make it to make a difference and to be true to one's convictions, you really have to sort of fight for and autonomously pursue what you want to do.
2587764	2600930	292	D	0.98	And it is interesting that the style in which both Julia and Olaf have pursued their scientific ideology and ideas and creativity is very much slightly lonesome.
2601910	2617222	293	D	0.99994	With the exception of Julia's work in the molecular biology of sleep, the theoretical contributions are very sort of associated with them personally, to a certain extent, with me.
2617276	2629446	294	D	1	And what one could argue is the mathematical version of value dependent learning, which would be the free energy principle.
2629558	2638830	295	D	0.99998	All of these things have the same flavor as neural Darwinism, or as some people used to call it, neuralmanism.
2639890	2660422	296	D	0.62672	So I often ask that question was this the skill of Edelman in choosing people who are going to make a difference or did he basically provide a culture in which it gave people the tools or the motivation or the confidence that you can make a difference because you saw him make a difference?
2660556	2661560	297	D	1	I don't know.
2663690	2666566	298	C	1	I think both of you actually said something.
2666668	2667910	299	C	0.77	I shared the experience.
2668060	2671662	300	C	0.85354	Definitely he set up a right environment.
2671826	2675702	301	C	0.9999	But just like when we do stem cell, stem cell and its niche.
2675766	2676982	302	C	0.99994	You need the interaction.
2677046	2682246	303	C	0.9999	You need a conversation between epiphelia and the methanchyma cells or in the brain.
2682278	2687098	304	C	1	I heard it's more like interaction between neuronal cells and gulia cells.
2687194	2697758	305	C	0.99359	So a successful interaction would lead, whatever the process, to move forward, but not every process would be successful.
2697854	2705950	306	C	0.92277	So, as said, I also like the way Karl mentioned about Edelman is the conductor.
2706030	2708818	307	C	0.99985	He actually said that in our meeting at the time.
2708904	2711570	308	C	0.98245	He said, Edelman, I'm the conductor.
2712390	2718358	309	C	0.98678	You guys is my symphony, prayers, and you pray together.
2718444	2720300	310	C	0.99996	You can make a good music.
2721630	2729180	311	C	0.99939	But it's also true not every interaction works, because I was with him for almost eight years or so.
2729710	2732006	312	C	0.99989	Not every person work, let's put it that way.
2732048	2733120	313	C	0.97607	That is a fact.
2733490	2735694	314	C	0.89632	So some work, some don't, right?
2735732	2738398	315	C	0.99381	So I think people are given that opportunity.
2738564	2742990	316	C	0.97	And as Andrew said, it's a good, outstanding environment.
2743410	2762390	317	C	0.97968	So you pick up the idea from Edelman, you develop yourself and some of them, or you can call it Edmund, then we success in a certain way or not, but I think it's an exciting environment.
2762810	2765814	318	C	1	I would put it that way.
2766012	2767030	319	C	0.98705	It's both.
2767180	2769000	320	C	0.99916	He inspires you.
2769450	2775580	321	C	0.99685	He gives you a sort of exciting environment to evolve, but not everyone.
2776430	2779094	322	C	0.98399	He can choose everyone to be successful.
2779142	2780474	323	C	0.99343	No, it's not like that.
2780592	2789374	324	C	0.99998	But he did give you that opportunity to be successful and to pick up something, and he also give you that courage to do it.
2789412	2805166	325	C	0.99935	As I mentioned, people would normally think using the feather as a model is kind of very high risk, but he has that encouragement, and I do that, and I feel I really using Federal as a Rosetta Stone.
2805198	2810214	326	C	1	I have learned something for the Morphogenesis patent formation field.
2810332	2810758	327	C	0.71071	Yeah.
2810844	2813160	328	C	0.99885	So I appreciate him for that.
2817480	2818032	329	B	0.9839	Andrew.
2818096	2819670	330	A	0.99993	Or I can ask another question.
2821820	2824810	331	B	1	I really don't have anything to add right now.
2826380	2827610	332	A	0.99998	Thank you, though.
2828140	2830250	333	A	0.99954	It's really amazing.
2831900	2840972	334	A	0.97761	It's such a different world, and the environment of learning and of carrying out science is so different.
2841106	2853168	335	A	0.99799	So, personally, I really appreciate just even a window into settings that are elsewhere and in a different time.
2853334	2856800	336	A	0.99545	So thank you for all of this.
2856870	2860420	337	A	0.9459	All right, I'll ask another question from Dave.
2862760	2872724	338	A	0.99812	Professor Edelman was reputed to be skeptical about the risk of abusing mathematical or computer models in creating theories of neural functioning, cognition, and consciousness.
2872852	2878200	339	A	0.99997	Some reviewers went so far as to mock him in print for using computers as research tools.
2878700	2888600	340	A	0.99843	But he worked with Tanini on the foundations of integrated information theory, an extremely math heavy theory that sometimes explained using computing imagery.
2888760	2896488	341	A	0.99982	Did Edelman change his attitude towards the role of math or of computing paradigms in thinking about the mind?
2896674	2905520	342	A	0.99826	Or did he simply start trusting his colleagues to think computationally without falling into rabbit holes dug by von Neumann and Turing?
2910640	2923520	343	A	0.99906	Or how did you see the role of math and computers in Edelman's thinking and research develop over a period where they were also undergoing such rapid developments more broadly.
2924340	2931540	344	B	0.98052	So I'm pretty sure that Edelman respected mathematics and computational approaches to neuroscience.
2933320	2938148	345	B	0.99872	There certainly were a lot of theory fellows that were computationally savvy.
2938324	2954152	346	B	0.9992	While I was at the so, for instance, Karl mentioned these robots that were used to sort of explore and learn, sort of the beginning, I guess, of embodied cognition.
2954216	2964784	347	B	0.97974	Karl, you would say, where they explore the environment and learn, and then from that learning, they build internal say.
2964822	2979780	348	B	0.61	And that was Olaf's ballywig, I would say that was highly computational and certainly a major thrust in edelman's emphasis in what he wanted to do at the institute.
2980200	2988744	349	B	0.99	And there were a number of other things, I think, the integrated part that Julio did.
2988782	3012560	350	B	1	I think that was almost all Julio's work, along with some of the other computational you know, I think Edelman wanted to be part of that, but that really, I think, was mostly, I think, you know, as part of the culture, edelman managed to get his name on Julio's paper.
3012630	3020610	351	B	0.99999	We used to laugh about that quite a bit, but again, I would say that was 99% Julio's work.
3023300	3029030	352	D	0.99841	Yeah, I can concur, because I was there when the work was actually done.
3030360	3046532	353	D	0.99415	There was a sort of period I can't remember there was some hypothesis that pertained to a core, a dynamical core, as sort of oppression are necessary for some kind of consciousness.
3046596	3068364	354	D	0.78	And I think Ehlmann was comfortable with this sort of intuitive notion of a dynamic core, but when it became articulated in terms of information theory, I think even if he didn't say so out loud, he would have responded as he responded to me, with, oh, you've got mathematosis.
3068492	3084928	355	D	0.89437	So this is another of his ways of dealing with people who had a tendency to over mathematicalize and oversimplify, as a physicist would, reducing a horse to a point and then writing down differential equations.
3085024	3086836	356	D	0.99649	He was very allergic to that.
3087018	3091812	357	D	0.99986	He didn't like that and would call that an instance of mathematosis.
3091956	3100860	358	D	1	I think that's very distinct, though, from what Andy was just talking about, which is the commitment to physically realized embodied computation.
3101840	3110412	359	D	1	And I think it's a really well observed point that this was embodied cognition circa 1980, 1990.
3110546	3119384	360	D	0.74043	So he was quite visionary in, I think, sort of testing out ideas in physical in realized systems.
3119512	3121036	361	D	0.99996	You couldn't just hand wave with maths.
3121068	3122544	362	D	0.99972	You had to show it worked.
3122662	3126236	363	D	0.99976	This idea worked in a real setting.
3126268	3142868	364	D	1	And at that time, they were the Darwin series to the extent that I, for example, had to spend six months learning to paralyze C in order to program the robot.
3143044	3147972	365	D	0.9818	So it wasn't he was frightened of new technology or computer science.
3148116	3151150	366	D	1	I think he didn't like trivializing things.
3152400	3168496	367	D	0.83707	All a physicist with mathematics, but you would certainly be fully committed to the notion that computation is at the heart of the kind of dynamics that he wanted to understand.
3168678	3174804	368	D	0.99	And underwrote theory and indeed, I think that the theory of neural group selection speaks to that.
3174842	3180740	369	D	0.91882	He wanted to see it realized in a robot.
3181880	3183684	370	D	0.98245	But I think Andy's absolutely right.
3183722	3193800	371	D	0.59	At the point when Julia sort of just basically went straight from the axioms to consciousness and phi with equations.
3194140	3202250	372	D	1	I think that was the time that Julia had to leave the family, basically, and Julie did so.
3204140	3218720	373	B	0.47497	Sort of extrapolated that a little bit think, you know, when I read Edelman's books and some of his papers, I don't understand his, you know, his phrases and his descriptions.
3219060	3220832	374	B	0.99	A lot of things don't make sense.
3220966	3227920	375	B	0.99992	If he had written those out or someone had written those out as equations that's the nice thing about equations.
3228000	3232596	376	B	0.99998	Once you see the equation, you don't have to worry about the words so much.
3232778	3234484	377	B	0.99999	Things become pretty clear.
3234682	3252568	378	B	1	And I think, looking back, if he had been able to do that, I think his ideas, first of all, would have been crystallized in his own mind better and second of all, would have been able to be others would have understood them more clearly.
3252744	3258748	379	B	1	And I think that's really important for me.
3258914	3261870	380	B	0.99964	Maybe with an engineering background or something.
3262580	3273488	381	B	0.98387	If you have a model or if you have an idea, if you can write that out explicitly with an equation, it really clarifies things, it crystallizes things.
3273574	3282452	382	B	0.99	And that was the thing that I liked about Julio's work because again, this word of know, it's like nobody knows what that really means.
3282586	3304124	383	B	0.99958	But at least Julio had a form of equations, right, where he was talking about information theory and the know, you could have a cluster where information was internal versus the external information and say, that okay, if you have to have consciousness, here it is.
3304162	3308280	384	B	0.8	And he could describe that with a concrete equation.
3308440	3310364	385	B	0.99	I mean, that's a step forward.
3310562	3322576	386	B	1	And again, I always say as someone that records neurons in the brain all the time, if I wanted to find consciousness, how would I know it if I found it, right?
3322678	3325124	387	B	0.97	I mean, if I had an equation, maybe I could do it.
3325162	3329152	388	B	0.99977	But just the way it's defined right now, who knows?
3329216	3330644	389	B	1	I could have already discovered it.
3330682	3331670	390	B	1	I wouldn't know.
3332200	3337480	391	B	0.46884	So I think that's an interesting point.
3337550	3349896	392	D	0.99987	Anyway, I can't resist his following up on that because especially evident for me in the remembered present this notion that his words don't actually make any sense.
3350078	3364664	393	D	1	I think that's pure poetry and pure brilliance because what I tend to find myself doing is reading the meaning into his ambiguous sentences and finding all sorts of meanings which wouldn't have occurred to me otherwise.
3364712	3366096	394	D	1	I think that's part of his art.
3366198	3386068	395	D	1	I suspect that he would have been terrified if somebody had actually come along and tried to time down to a clear formal, naturalized mathematical formalism because he wouldn't have had that sort of biotic expressiveness and ambiguity that, of course, is at the heart of his evolutionary thinking.
3386154	3393956	396	D	0.83847	But I think it's great that you, Andy, are able to say you don't understand what he wrote, because I look at some of his sentences.
3394068	3396248	397	D	0.99795	What on earth is he trying to say here?
3396334	3408648	398	D	0.89	And of course, but the exercise of trying to make sense of Edelman itself brings to the table some really interesting sort of associations and ideas.
3408744	3424880	399	D	0.58487	I'm wondering whether that was part of the secret of his success, is that he resisted the temptation to be crystal clear and just left that mystical, magical ambiguity hanging in the air for people like you and me to worry about and try to resolve.
3425560	3429616	400	B	0.95	I suppose he's given that privilege after winning a Nobel Prize.
3429808	3434580	401	B	1	I think some of us mere mortals wouldn't be afforded that luxury.
3439490	3441362	402	A	0.95765	All right, I'll read a few more questions.
3441416	3442402	403	A	0.99804	We can have a few more things.
3442456	3444434	404	A	0.9817	So, small questions.
3444632	3451686	405	A	0.99998	In the book Topobiology Changming, did you draw the feathers, or is that your work?
3451868	3453574	406	C	1	The feather is my work, yeah.
3453612	3455160	407	C	0.88396	It's based on my work.
3456170	3456920	408	A	0.99998	Awesome.
3459370	3478026	409	A	0.99947	Well, how do we take things forward in science and in our work here in this level of the fractal with this amazing story and history with Edelman?
3478218	3484410	410	A	0.98801	But how do we take our historical and our mentoring context?
3484490	3487294	411	A	0.60696	Like, how do you carry that forward?
3487412	3489300	412	A	0.99826	Is it something you think about?
3494300	3500680	413	D	1	I personally do, and I congratulate myself every day on not being like Edelman when it comes to mentoring.
3505680	3506670	414	A	0.81566	How so?
3508560	3515256	415	D	0.99952	I'm not going to answer the how so question, but you could read between the lines whether that's the right thing to do or not.
3515298	3516210	416	D	1	I don't know.
3516660	3518930	417	D	1	I don't think you could be Edelman now.
3519700	3521760	418	D	0.99924	In 21st century.
3524900	3530284	419	D	0.88012	We'd be too close to all the culture wars, I think, to even entertain that style anymore.
3530412	3532544	420	D	1	And I suspect that's quite a good thing.
3532662	3541364	421	D	0.99435	Although pressure makes diamonds, and as Andy says, it was an exciting both my colleagues have said it's an exciting, informative time.
3541402	3542664	422	D	0.99965	It was a pressure time.
3542782	3552040	423	D	0.71053	It was a dark time for me in terms of the dynamics, the systemic, the personal interactions.
3552700	3556120	424	D	0.99996	But because it was pressured, it made diamonds.
3556280	3568056	425	D	0.99	And so we may be throwing away the opportunity to make academic diamonds and be truly creative in terms of making things that endure like diamonds by not having that style of mentorship.
3568168	3574880	426	D	0.99936	But I don't think it will be even legal nowadays, to be quite honest, to run a lab like Edelman ran.
3579800	3591960	427	B	0.76809	So, again, I think that over the years, neuroscience, I don't know about the rest of science, but it's almost become sort of industrialized.
3592400	3602604	428	B	0.998	So there's a method as a young person, when you finally get your own job, you have to set out.
3602642	3607644	429	B	1	And if you're at a university environment, there's certain boxes you have to check off.
3607682	3614960	430	B	0.99991	You have to get a grant, you have to get a certain number of papers, you have to get something in science or Nature in order to get promoted.
3615460	3632176	431	B	0.9849	There's these steps and I think young people are so focused on moving through those steps at the point in their career where they're going to be the most creative and their minds are the most flexible and they can be the most productive.
3632368	3646668	432	B	1	And I see that as a shame, actually, that they're not given this opportunity to be a little freer in the way they accomplish things.
3646834	3653752	433	B	1	And then when they do accomplish some modicum of success, they rely on their past behavior.
3653816	3663536	434	B	0.99999	So instead of saying, okay, I had to go through that in order to get tenure, now that I have tenure, I'm free and I can do something that I really want to do.
3663718	3667400	435	B	0.99002	That really doesn't happen because people get stuck in a rut.
3667500	3673648	436	B	0.83	And I see that as really holding back progress in neuroscience.
3673744	3678240	437	B	0.87	And that was kind of the cool thing about the Neuroscience Institute.
3678400	3682316	438	B	0.99979	For better or worse, we weren't allowed to go out and get our own grants.
3682368	3684740	439	B	0.99927	We had to rely on internal funds.
3684900	3689812	440	B	0.99662	But as a result, the only person we had to convince was Edelman in order to get funded.
3689956	3695340	441	B	0.78	And to a certain extent, that allowed us to do things that were really creative.
3696720	3702620	442	B	0.99986	In hindsight, I think that was a mistake, because financially, that was doom for the Institute.
3703040	3706708	443	B	0.99922	There could have been a hybrid approach that would have been more productive.
3706904	3721190	444	B	0.99957	But then again, as Karl was saying, the investigators would have had to have more freedom to do that, and that was not exactly in the culture, although I think I was an outlier because I maintained a separate lab.
3722600	3729510	445	B	0.99999	So I was somewhat inoculated from that, and that made it a lot more pleasant for me.
3730460	3746700	446	B	0.87451	But again, I see that in current neuroscience, it would be nice if people were willing to take more chances and be a little more creative instead of hoeing to the status quo.
3748400	3753550	447	B	0.99731	That would be, I think, what we need in order to move forward.
3757320	3782044	448	C	0.47482	Yeah, no, I think that in terms of the mentorship that Karl was talking about, I mean, certainly I have seen people do very well, but I also have the opportunity, sort of when I moved to University Southern California, to have some interaction with Dr.
3782082	3783224	449	C	0.42592	Simo Benter.
3783352	3786124	450	C	0.99	And some of you probably know him.
3786162	3799040	451	C	0.96	I mean, you would see actually he is also very successful, but when he came out, he would always have his students surrounding him very kindly.
3799380	3806840	452	C	1	I think that Edelman is brilliant, but it's kind of the sun is too bright.
3807020	3813620	453	C	0.99517	Sometimes people have to be distilled into the, as you say, academic diamond.
3814280	3815348	454	C	0.97874	That's interesting.
3815514	3824020	455	C	0.99989	So we also have seen some people didn't get along with him well, but still, I think there are many impact.
3824180	3828360	456	C	0.95292	He certainly have encouraged many people go different directions.
3828700	3835220	457	C	1	And in terms of the academic the academic future right.
3835310	3857856	458	C	1	I think you two are more talking about the neurobiology side, but on the morphogenesis side, I would also say he always emphasized the patterns thinking that pattern is kind of the way nature either biology, non biology, they leave some clue for us to figure out.
3857958	3866816	459	C	0.64	And when I was there, I remember every time he talked about the visual columns tolson we saw they have worked out, he got very excited.
3866928	3875400	460	C	0.99	And in fact, I have one of my peer at that time was working on the visual columns of the cat.
3875550	3881316	461	C	0.67645	But I think that paper that work never really go out to be published.
3881428	3892216	462	C	0.99992	But anyway, on the more practical things, I work on the tissue patterns and I feel that you mentioned about the top of biology.
3892408	3907780	463	C	1	And again, I think he coined the term, and I think the term I think it means a lot because eventually my career was trying to figure out these signaling molecules.
3908120	3912352	464	C	0.99996	Because at that time, people only talk about signaling molecule.
3912416	3913830	465	C	0.69487	Very important.
3914360	3925684	466	C	0.99998	But the idea of topobiology is that you even position these simply by positioning these signaling centers in a different topology.
3925812	3942248	467	C	0.6784	You can actually have a lot of consequence from there and the signaling center can also have a different lifetime, the strength and the duration and the range they can influence.
3942344	3964448	468	C	0.99626	So by modulating he like these terms to modulating these signaling center, you can create a lot of regional differences and up to now, as I say from my own take bird, you look at it right feather here, downing feather here, the beautiful crown feather here, tail feather.
3964544	3966800	469	C	0.99998	But these are all from the same genome.
3966880	3989660	470	C	0.99999	So it actually is through the positioning of these different signaling center in a different way, and you basically have the same ingredient, but you can play with them by topologically, temporal, and especially arrange them and to create a quite complex pattern.
3990720	4008112	471	C	1	I feel that in the tissue patterning Morphogenesis side, I feel that his vision is great, and I think we still try to work out more about how these patterns are positioned.
4008256	4015860	472	C	0.99999	But I think that's sort of the direction in a more visualized purple biology aspect we can appreciate.
4018520	4019184	473	A	0.99999	Awesome.
4019322	4025400	474	A	0.53828	Well, perhaps if each of you would like to give any closing thoughts.
4031370	4048394	475	D	0.97091	Yes, to echo those last sentiments, I think everything that Adelman said or tried to say, depending whether you could understand him, I think he's absolutely right.
4048512	4053178	476	D	1	And we are slowly discovering the truths we've just heard about top ofology and the importance of patterns.
4053194	4057886	477	D	0.99	And of course, if you speak to somebody like Mike Levin, he'd be talking about exactly the same thing.
4057908	4061214	478	D	0.98051	He'd use words like basal cognition and pattern formation.
4061262	4070142	479	D	0.97579	But I think that we're talking about the same principles of biological self organization and edelman.
4070286	4078134	480	D	1	I didn't know about turbobiology, but I do know there are other fundamental ideas that he just incidental to him.
4078172	4079014	481	D	1	I am absolutely sure.
4079052	4087706	482	D	0.96	I think notions of degeneracy in the neurosciences and psychology, the notion of many to one structure, function mappings, for example.
4087808	4105034	483	D	0.99921	These are fundamental ideas which now are taken almost for granted in my world, but you sort of forget how much he actually contributed or at least laid the seeds for, and sometimes very explicitly so, it should be acknowledged.
4105082	4112400	484	D	0.99834	Although he was, as Mark Rakel put it, in his typically gentlemanly fashion, edelman was a very complicated man.
4113010	4125910	485	D	0.93938	He was also very brilliant and is responsible, I think, for a lot of the direction of travel and the intellectual growth, certainly of my intellectual growth, but I would say also many aspects of our academic communities.
4128330	4129474	486	A	0.99831	Thank you, Karl.
4129602	4135880	487	A	0.99289	Perhaps Andrew oh, unmute and then please continue.
4139670	4164398	488	B	0.95994	So I would know if there's anyone listening out there, there's something to be said about maybe looking back in the ancient literature that goes back quite a bit and maybe seeing how some of these things came about and trying to put it together and see that there's this iteration that constantly takes place.
4164484	4178978	489	B	1	People rediscover the same thing that's been discovered multiple times and try to see how there is a status quo in the way science works.
4179064	4186466	490	B	0.77	And then there's these outliers where there's sort of creative bubbles that come to fore.
4186648	4206460	491	B	0.98	And I think it's interesting to think of Edelman and the things he did and the people that were associated with him in terms of sort of these disruptive, they call it disruptions and how those disruptions may have consequence many years later.
4207230	4209820	492	B	0.97631	It's kind of interesting if you take the long view.
4210510	4234050	493	B	0.99995	So I think it's maybe worthwhile thinking about this once in a while and for young people out there to be encouraged to think out of the normal way of doing things once in a while, try to foster your creativity and have the courage to go after some of those ideas.
4234470	4238280	494	B	1	I think that's a take home message for me anyway.
4241270	4254226	495	C	0.99737	Yeah, I would say I always like all sort of influenced by his idea, saying that we should study the important question that have a general meaning.
4254338	4258114	496	C	0.9996	So I think that kind of ideas he said that, look at the big pictures.
4258162	4261378	497	C	1	I remember when I was there, he talked like that, the big pictures.
4261474	4275710	498	C	0.71464	So that is where when he thinking about the Darwinism, he would say it's not only for the species evolution, for the immunoglobulin chronos selection, he would push it to the brain theory.
4276050	4279050	499	C	0.64	And for me, I work on the morphogenesis.
4279130	4284846	500	C	1	I actually would come to realize that is also what happened at the tissue level.
4284948	4290590	501	C	0.99994	These cells are competing with each other to form that patterns and then pattern is selected.
4290670	4295010	502	C	0.66925	When there is a functional advantage, it will be stabilized.
4295830	4304118	503	C	1	I think the idea of saying if we're going to do science, we ask big questions, ask for the generalization, I appreciate that.
4304204	4307494	504	C	1	And certainly he is like how you want to call it, right?
4307532	4308578	505	C	1	A huge elephant.
4308674	4314860	506	C	0.65861	So we all touch him through different side and have a different take on that.
4315870	4322330	507	C	0.99999	In terms of the young scientist, I also remember he likes the Chinese proverb I cited to him.
4322480	4329470	508	C	0.65547	That is to say, if you want to get Tiger's son, you must get into Tiger's cave.
4330770	4332400	509	C	0.73598	So with three did.
4335490	4336574	510	A	0.99991	Thank you all.
4336692	4338202	511	A	0.99863	That's a great note.
4338266	4341178	512	A	0.99994	Really appreciate this conversation.
4341354	4343662	513	A	0.76	And again, thanks.
4343716	4344960	514	A	0.99956	Until next time.
4345410	4346206	515	C	0.93793	Okay.
4346388	4347086	516	C	0.99641	Thank you.
4347188	4347754	517	C	0.97357	Bye.
4347882	4349360	518	C	0.99895	Nice meeting you all.
4349850	4350434	519	D	0.96977	Bye bye.
4350482	4351240	520	D	0.99975	Thank you.
4351610	4351890	521	C	0.47107	Bye.
