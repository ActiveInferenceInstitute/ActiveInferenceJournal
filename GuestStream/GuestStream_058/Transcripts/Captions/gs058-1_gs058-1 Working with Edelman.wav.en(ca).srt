00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,118
Hello and welcome, everybody. It is

2
00:00:11,284 --> 00:00:14,766
September 19, 2023. We're here

3
00:00:14,788 --> 00:00:16,590
at the active inference Institute in

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,414
guest stream 58.1, and today

5
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:23,214
the session will be around the

6
00:00:23,252 --> 00:00:25,334
experiences of those who have worked

7
00:00:25,372 --> 00:00:29,094
with Gerald Edelman. Edelman lived from

8
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:30,806
1929 to 2014,

9
00:00:30,828 --> 00:00:34,898
and as hopefully this conversation

10
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:37,442
can explore and unpack a little bit,

11
00:00:37,516 --> 00:00:40,826
worked in various areas related to the

12
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:43,770
brain, body, and mind. So without

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,670
further ado, I will have our guests

14
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,974
introduce themselves, give a little bit

15
00:00:50,032 --> 00:00:53,086
of a background on how they came to be

16
00:00:53,188 --> 00:00:55,614
working with Professor Edelman, and then

17
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:58,222
we have several prepared questions and

18
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:00,766
several other questions. So thank you

19
00:01:00,788 --> 00:01:03,950
all for joining, and perhaps, Andrew,

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,282
if you'd like to begin. All right,

21
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:09,394
so I'll just start a little bit with my

22
00:01:09,432 --> 00:01:12,606
background. I did my PhD at University

23
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:16,002
of Minnesota, and then I

24
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:19,582
did my postdoc at Hopkins with Apostles

25
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,370
Georgopoulos and Vernon Macassel.

26
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,942
And then I got a job in Phoenix working

27
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:29,334
in a small neuroscience institute

28
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:32,826
or neuroscience department at a

29
00:01:32,848 --> 00:01:35,994
hospital. And I worked there for six

30
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:38,762
or seven years. And my interest was

31
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,134
working with non human primates with

32
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:45,530
monkeys and studying how they reached

33
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,950
for different objects and drew objects

34
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,326
and then looked at the activity in

35
00:01:51,428 --> 00:01:55,490
primary motor cortex neurons. And we

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,174
carried out different kinds of analysis

37
00:01:58,222 --> 00:01:59,746
based on the directionality of the

38
00:01:59,768 --> 00:02:02,242
neurons in motor cortex built

39
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:05,518
populations and were able to actually

40
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:08,006
look at these neural signals and see how

41
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,262
they corresponded in a pretty exact way

42
00:02:10,316 --> 00:02:14,134
to the way the animals are moved in

43
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:16,134
time and space. In other words,

44
00:02:16,172 --> 00:02:20,042
trajectories. And after

45
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:22,106
working there six or seven years, I was

46
00:02:22,128 --> 00:02:24,714
invited to come and look at this new

47
00:02:24,752 --> 00:02:26,586
institute that Gerald Edelman was

48
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:30,090
establishing in San Diego in La Jolla

49
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,126
and met a bunch of super interesting

50
00:02:34,228 --> 00:02:36,826
people like Guilio Tononi and Olof

51
00:02:36,858 --> 00:02:39,886
Sporns. And really,

52
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:42,754
their deep intellect and curiosity and

53
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:46,100
creativity has convinced me to move to.

54
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,050
I ended up moving there. And so Edelman

55
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,326
was able to build this gorgeous research

56
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,510
facility on the Tory Pines

57
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,846
cliffs, basically, and it

58
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:08,570
was a magnificent architecture.

59
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,860
And he recruited a number of people

60
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,130
besides sparns and Tononi,

61
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,314
and so he divided the group into

62
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:22,698
theorists and experimentalists. And I

63
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:25,206
was an experimentalist, but we would

64
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:28,080
have lunch every day together as a group

65
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,818
and discuss different topics.

66
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:35,330
And I was really exposed to a whole new

67
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,954
way of thinking about neuroscience in

68
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:40,046
terms of sort of the cognitive aspects

69
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:42,734
of it, which I still have difficulty

70
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:44,786
with, to tell you personally, because I

71
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,466
don't even know how you define

72
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:48,918
cognition. And I'm not sure that anybody

73
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:51,926
really can, or as Vernon Machasto would

74
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:53,254
say, I don't know the answer to that,

75
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:56,966
nor does anybody else. Maybe Karl would

76
00:03:57,068 --> 00:04:00,922
take issue with that. But anyway, the

77
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:03,002
coolest thing about it was being really

78
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:06,554
exposed to a lot of creative thinking

79
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:09,900
and deep intellectual endeavors, and

80
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,486
I've really never regretted the seven or

81
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:15,534
eight years I spent there. I think it

82
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:18,442
really helped change the way my career

83
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:22,334
went from being sort of a motor control

84
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:26,722
strict, sort of very

85
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:29,314
careful scientist to using my

86
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,362
imagination a lot more than I would have

87
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:35,060
otherwise. So I'll leave it at that.

88
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,328
Awesome. Cheng Ming okay,

89
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:47,736
yeah, I can speak about my

90
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:50,684
journey with Dr. Edelman. So I was

91
00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:53,516
originally from Taiwan. I graduated with

92
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:56,684
a medical degree in Taiwan university in

93
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:59,580
78. But I was very interested in doing

94
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,312
basic science. So I applied a PhD

95
00:05:02,376 --> 00:05:04,388
program and got into Rock Federal

96
00:05:04,424 --> 00:05:08,400
University and that started to

97
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,504
search for a laboratory. And certainly

98
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:15,524
Dr. Ederman is very

99
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:19,270
powerful intellectual capacity building

100
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,236
in the building it was on 9th floor of

101
00:05:23,258 --> 00:05:24,964
the Bronx laboratory. I was very

102
00:05:25,002 --> 00:05:28,360
impressed. So I joined the laboratory.

103
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,520
So since 78 to 83

104
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:37,176
I was a PhD student and

105
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:41,064
I was working on the topic called neural

106
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:44,028
cell adhesion molecule. So at that time

107
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:46,524
Edelman already got his Nobel prize for

108
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:51,776
immunoglobulin. But he would be usually

109
00:05:51,878 --> 00:05:55,452
elegant way would say I solved molecular

110
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:58,368
recognition. So he said I don't want to

111
00:05:58,534 --> 00:06:00,864
stay in immunology to collect more

112
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,212
awards. He said I will work out cell

113
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:08,004
recognition. So in his mind how cell

114
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:11,412
recognition work is through a group

115
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:14,964
of adhesion molecular interaction. So

116
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:17,236
that's how he started to work on the

117
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:19,988
cell adhesion molecule and duty's house

118
00:06:20,074 --> 00:06:21,812
actually work out the chicken cell

119
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:24,296
adhesion molecular. So when I joined the

120
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:28,090
laboratory, my PhD things was work out

121
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,556
the first mammalian cell adhesion

122
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:34,904
molecule. And in addition to NCAM,

123
00:06:34,952 --> 00:06:38,430
though, I supposed to work out on these

124
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,408
adhesion molecule mediating the Neurolog

125
00:06:42,504 --> 00:06:45,392
cell recognition as he said he would

126
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,016
say. I asked him also after all what

127
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:50,752
would be my PhD thesis and he would say

128
00:06:50,806 --> 00:06:54,036
ming, when I start to write a poem, I

129
00:06:54,058 --> 00:06:56,388
don't know how it's going to end.

130
00:06:56,554 --> 00:06:59,232
That's the way he would put his language

131
00:06:59,296 --> 00:07:02,256
there. So he just figured out retinal

132
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,744
tectoprojection I'm

133
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,024
hardworking student so I would work out

134
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:10,952
on that. And as you know, these days our

135
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:14,292
so called systems biology approach,

136
00:07:14,356 --> 00:07:17,560
right, is these transcriptome single

137
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,956
cell RNA sequencing to identify a

138
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:24,744
non biased way to identify molecules

139
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:27,516
involved. At that time the so called

140
00:07:27,618 --> 00:07:30,332
systems biology approach was making

141
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:33,856
monoclonal antibodies. So I would be

142
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:36,496
there taking out the brain and the

143
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:40,172
retina and the tectum and produce

144
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:43,800
I produce 18 batch of the monochromatic

145
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,172
antibody against these neuronal cell

146
00:07:47,226 --> 00:07:49,204
membranes. So I certainly have

147
00:07:49,242 --> 00:07:51,584
identified a lot of adhesion molecule

148
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:54,900
but none of them really

149
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,200
show a very distinct pattern these days.

150
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,776
I think the field using the

151
00:08:00,798 --> 00:08:02,664
transcription factors was able to

152
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:05,848
identify some patterns but at that later

153
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:10,664
it's kind of all altogether. But I

154
00:08:10,702 --> 00:08:14,692
remember that actually anyway, I didn't

155
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:16,676
really figure out retinol technical

156
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,796
projection but that's enough for me to

157
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,604
graduate. But at

158
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:25,504
that time I also still remember how I

159
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:28,848
actually had a great impact on my

160
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:31,404
professional career. So I was cutting

161
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:34,512
chicken spinal cord cross section to

162
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:37,120
mapping these cell adhesion molecules.

163
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,224
So I have some feather chicken feather

164
00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:43,780
hanging outside there, and they stand

165
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,196
with this NCAM with the most beautiful,

166
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:47,700
exquisite pattern.

167
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,608
Later work on the feather as my major

168
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:54,612
research model, kind of as a rosetta

169
00:08:54,676 --> 00:08:57,144
song to understand the language of

170
00:08:57,182 --> 00:09:00,216
morphogenesis. But there I remember how

171
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:02,368
I started that. You have these feather,

172
00:09:02,484 --> 00:09:04,732
they form these branches. So these

173
00:09:04,786 --> 00:09:06,776
branches are actually originally formed

174
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:09,420
cells. Then they die to become space.

175
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,852
But before they die, they actually light

176
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:15,104
up with NCM. Light up with NCM with the

177
00:09:15,142 --> 00:09:18,304
most exquisite pattern there. So you

178
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:20,236
kind of say, okay, you're going to carve

179
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,876
out this region. You light up with NCM,

180
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:25,252
you light up with sonic, and then other

181
00:09:25,306 --> 00:09:28,004
signal coming to say you die. But before

182
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:30,240
they die, they light up that pattern.

183
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,844
So the feather pattern is very

184
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:34,464
exquisite. Radio symmetry, bilateral

185
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:37,444
symmetry, bilateral symmetry. So Adam

186
00:09:37,492 --> 00:09:41,400
was very impressed by those findings.

187
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,090
I appreciate he actually encouraged that

188
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,180
when he sees something, he appreciates

189
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,004
he encouraged it. He didn't say, oh,

190
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:57,164
you're supposed to work on the brain or

191
00:09:57,202 --> 00:09:59,356
whatever. He actually like it. And

192
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,560
subsequently he also developed this idea

193
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,832
of topobiology, which he would

194
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:07,696
acknowledge to say it's sort of based on

195
00:10:07,718 --> 00:10:10,896
the very exquisite pattern we found in

196
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:12,988
the feather. But of course he developed

197
00:10:13,004 --> 00:10:15,344
it further. But some other time he would

198
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:18,672
say, if this is not in feather, I am

199
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:20,784
adamant I'm going to get another Nobel

200
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:24,032
Prize. So I like it. Let him encourage

201
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:27,284
that direction. So later when I became

202
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:30,250
independent, I sort of say, okay,

203
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,800
brain is wonderful, but it's all like

204
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,184
being curved inside. I don't figure it

205
00:10:36,222 --> 00:10:38,956
out, but I'm not that smart. But I might

206
00:10:38,978 --> 00:10:41,224
be able to figure out feather pattern

207
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:43,640
formation. So I have a reasonable,

208
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,972
successful career. Figure out the able

209
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:50,460
debo of the feather, but as I said,

210
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,520
not just feather itself, but use feather

211
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,304
as a rosetta stone to figure out

212
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:59,730
morphogenesis. And that

213
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,596
sort of I think I appreciate that he's

214
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:06,756
encouraged on that. Also, as you know,

215
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:09,076
the stem cell biology comes along and

216
00:11:09,098 --> 00:11:11,924
the feather in a bird baby chicken is

217
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,384
one way. Adult chicken, male, female,

218
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:16,756
all looks differently, but they are all

219
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:18,612
from the same group of the stem cell

220
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,016
that my lab have stemon straight. So it

221
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:23,464
is the so called stem cell niche would

222
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:27,032
be modulated by sex hormone, by age, by

223
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,852
season, by temperature, and let them

224
00:11:29,986 --> 00:11:33,500
help you produce different feather forms

225
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,508
to adapt to the environment. I think

226
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:41,084
I enjoy my research career and it was

227
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:43,904
obviously have his impact. And I think

228
00:11:43,942 --> 00:11:46,848
he's intellectually brilliant and always

229
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:50,284
encouraged going after fundamental

230
00:11:50,332 --> 00:11:52,496
principles, saying that if you're going

231
00:11:52,518 --> 00:11:55,200
to work on a question, ask most profound

232
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,940
questions and approach with the most

233
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,804
available technology, current technology

234
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:03,924
of the day. Don't waste your time on

235
00:12:03,962 --> 00:12:06,164
small questions. And I think I have

236
00:12:06,202 --> 00:12:09,944
taken those in so I can stay up to here

237
00:12:09,982 --> 00:12:11,850
and we can discuss more later.

238
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,352
Thank you. Awesome. Karl hi.

239
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:19,692
So my name is Karl Friston, and like my

240
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:22,716
two colleagues, I found my stay with

241
00:12:22,738 --> 00:12:24,972
Jerry Edelman both foundational and

242
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:28,012
very, very formative. I was quite early

243
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:30,316
in my research career when I joined the

244
00:12:30,338 --> 00:12:33,308
neuroscience Institute. Having trained

245
00:12:33,324 --> 00:12:35,084
as a psychiatrist, I got into brain

246
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:37,916
imaging. And at the inception of brain

247
00:12:37,948 --> 00:12:40,592
imaging, people were for the first time

248
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,956
discovering principles of functional

249
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:45,076
brain organization, such as the

250
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,508
principle of functional segregation and

251
00:12:47,594 --> 00:12:49,424
subsequently principles of integration,

252
00:12:49,472 --> 00:12:52,848
how segregated specialized parts

253
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:54,596
of the brain communicate or are

254
00:12:54,618 --> 00:12:56,792
coordinated or are integrated together.

255
00:12:56,926 --> 00:13:00,312
And one of the key theoreticians and

256
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:04,052
neuroanatomists that authored

257
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,784
this particular interpretation and

258
00:13:05,822 --> 00:13:07,556
deployment of neuroimaging was Semir

259
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:10,716
Zeki. And semir zeki. For those of you

260
00:13:10,738 --> 00:13:12,860
who don't know, he's still very active,

261
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,300
one of the architects of neuroaesthetics

262
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,884
in his late retirement now, but he was

263
00:13:19,922 --> 00:13:21,804
friendly with Jerry Edelman, and Semi

264
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:26,652
was famed for understanding

265
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:30,432
the computational anatomy of early

266
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:32,044
visual cortex and visual cortical

267
00:13:32,092 --> 00:13:35,108
hierarchies. And I repeat, the

268
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,768
principles of functional specialization

269
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:40,244
and integration. So after a couple of

270
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:43,712
years at the inception

271
00:13:43,776 --> 00:13:46,624
of human brain mapping, using positron

272
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:48,760
emission tomography and establishing,

273
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,168
for example, the color center in a

274
00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:56,616
particular part of the visual cortex, I

275
00:13:56,638 --> 00:13:59,390
was effectively sent to New York.

276
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,870
So my period of engagement was

277
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,544
a fellowship between about 1990 and 1992

278
00:14:07,592 --> 00:14:11,260
93. So this slightly predates Andy,

279
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,536
and it covered the translocation of

280
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:17,008
the Neurosciences Institute from the

281
00:14:17,014 --> 00:14:21,600
Rockefeller University to La Jolla

282
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,484
and under the auspices of the script.

283
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:29,020
So I spent half my fellowship at the

284
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,216
Rockefeller and then subsequently

285
00:14:31,408 --> 00:14:33,264
watched the building of the magnificent

286
00:14:33,312 --> 00:14:35,584
neuroscientist Institute on North Tory

287
00:14:35,632 --> 00:14:37,784
Pines Road that Andy referred to with

288
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:40,628
the auditorium, if I remember, designed

289
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:44,296
by imported experts in audition and

290
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:47,188
music and sound engineering from Sweden.

291
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:50,476
It was really an amazing place. I do

292
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:53,484
remember a couple of lunches before I

293
00:14:53,682 --> 00:14:57,100
returned to the UK to pursue my

294
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,748
career in imaging neuroscience under the

295
00:15:00,754 --> 00:15:03,772
auspices of the welcome Trust, but only

296
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:05,916
a couple because we were sort of in

297
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,888
rented accommodation from the script on

298
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:09,744
the other side of the road. But it was

299
00:15:09,782 --> 00:15:12,284
an awe inspiring bit of architecture,

300
00:15:12,332 --> 00:15:15,636
both intellectually and practically in

301
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:18,548
terms of the early days of the

302
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:21,764
Neuroscience Institute. So I was

303
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:25,488
sent there basically because Sami

304
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:27,044
Zecki thought it would be good for me to

305
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:28,820
go and work with Jerry Adelman

306
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,464
retrospectively. I now appreciate that.

307
00:15:31,502 --> 00:15:34,228
I was sent there to replace a gentleman

308
00:15:34,244 --> 00:15:37,480
called Reed Montague, who had

309
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,712
been tasked with on the pure theory

310
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:42,248
side, as opposed to the celadesian

311
00:15:42,264 --> 00:15:45,820
molecule and the wet lab side of

312
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,592
Edelman's research. On the pure theory

313
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:53,164
side, the point of my arrival,

314
00:15:53,212 --> 00:15:54,912
and to a certain extent at the point of

315
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:59,104
Reed's brief exposure to

316
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:01,596
the neuroscientist institute, the theory

317
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,592
of neuronal group selection was becoming

318
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:06,580
consolidated. And in particular, what

319
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,304
drove the selection of neuronal groups,

320
00:16:10,352 --> 00:16:12,336
neuro ensembles, cell assemblies,

321
00:16:12,448 --> 00:16:15,300
however you want to describe them, and

322
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:20,620
given Edelman's polchamp

323
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,050
for incredibly incisive and

324
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,640
straightforward but very creative

325
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,524
biological thinking. He thought, well,

326
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:32,856
it's obviously some kind of natural

327
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:35,516
selection and therefore there must be

328
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:38,636
the homologue of adaptive fitness that

329
00:16:38,658 --> 00:16:41,616
is underwriting the scaffolding and the

330
00:16:41,638 --> 00:16:45,712
dynamic structuring of

331
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:49,584
connectivity or connections that were

332
00:16:49,782 --> 00:16:52,336
definitive of in the spirit of

333
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:54,328
functional specialization, segregation,

334
00:16:54,444 --> 00:16:57,264
but also the mediator of functional

335
00:16:57,312 --> 00:17:01,536
integration of these neuronal

336
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:05,312
groups. So this became known generically

337
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:08,600
as value. So Reed was working on value

338
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,336
dependent learning the plasticity and

339
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:14,424
the principles that underwrite which

340
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:17,336
synaptic connections have the right kind

341
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:19,280
of adaptive fitness in their mileage.

342
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,596
In that context that enabled them to

343
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:24,668
persist and other connections went away

344
00:17:24,754 --> 00:17:28,108
and became or contributed to

345
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:31,588
the sparse coupling of neural networks.

346
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:35,424
And then Reed, and we can talk about

347
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:38,924
the glorious stories about the departure

348
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:43,856
of Reed. Reed actually ended up in

349
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:45,868
a rather circuitous way with Terry

350
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:48,624
Sejnowski at the Salk subsequently,

351
00:17:48,672 --> 00:17:50,224
then hooked up with people like Peter

352
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:54,036
Diane and Wolfram Schultz, who at

353
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:56,870
that time was in Zurich. And of course

354
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,576
the story that emerged from that was the

355
00:17:59,598 --> 00:18:02,984
reward prediction error story that

356
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,592
actually, ironically, Reed did not. But

357
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:08,328
a number of Wolfram eventually got the

358
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:11,148
brain prize for some decade or so later.

359
00:18:11,314 --> 00:18:13,404
But the inception of that story was

360
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:16,492
actually at the Rockefeller. And it was

361
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:21,224
basically an

362
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:24,480
attempt by, I think, Reed to formalize

363
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,864
the principles that must be

364
00:18:28,902 --> 00:18:32,444
in play to make the theory of neural

365
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:36,916
group selection under what

366
00:18:36,938 --> 00:18:40,288
was an important dynamic from Edelman's

367
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:41,652
point of view, which is this notion of

368
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:44,212
reentrant dynamics. So very, very early

369
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:47,556
on he had identified the fundamental

370
00:18:47,588 --> 00:18:50,232
importance of recurrent connectivity and

371
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:55,656
reentry as very formative in the

372
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:57,864
emergence of these structured groups and

373
00:18:57,902 --> 00:18:59,656
the associated functional

374
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:03,112
specialization. Just open brackets,

375
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:07,244
just to point out that you

376
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:09,212
could claim that certainly his early

377
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:13,760
conversations with people

378
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,976
at that time sort of preempted stuff in

379
00:19:16,998 --> 00:19:19,440
computational neuroscience that we now

380
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,144
take as for granted, not really

381
00:19:22,182 --> 00:19:24,016
realizing where it came from, but

382
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,564
certainly his work with Vernon Mancast.

383
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:27,284
I'm sure Andy will be able to speak to

384
00:19:27,322 --> 00:19:30,212
this later on. On the importance of

385
00:19:30,346 --> 00:19:32,916
reentry and dynamics and oscillations in

386
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,836
the formation of these groups and sort

387
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:37,176
of cortical. Columns and the like. That

388
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:40,916
was sort of, I think, the monographs

389
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:43,224
that they not the monographs, but the

390
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:45,176
papers and the articles they wrote at

391
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:47,800
that time I think were quite visionary.

392
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,132
Steven Grossberg was also hanging around

393
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:53,436
a few years earlier, and I think you

394
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,228
could probably claim that between the

395
00:19:55,234 --> 00:19:56,872
two of them, they invented computational

396
00:19:56,936 --> 00:20:00,252
neuroscience. Certainly know New York,

397
00:20:00,306 --> 00:20:03,730
Boston, sort of East Coast kind of

398
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,700
style of computational neuroscience,

399
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,176
closely involved with something called

400
00:20:10,198 --> 00:20:11,900
the Neuroscience Research Foundation,

401
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,104
so that they, as I understand it and

402
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:16,644
again, Andy may want to correct me here,

403
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,396
but this was like the forerunner of the

404
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,316
Society for Neuroscience. It was a group

405
00:20:21,338 --> 00:20:25,056
of people. People, and perhaps Max Cowan

406
00:20:25,168 --> 00:20:26,904
is the name that comes to mind, people

407
00:20:26,942 --> 00:20:29,160
who actually invented words like

408
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,168
neuroscience, which wasn't a thing,

409
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:35,384
certainly when I was applying to my

410
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:38,264
undergraduate studies and trying to

411
00:20:38,302 --> 00:20:40,036
create institutions, academic

412
00:20:40,068 --> 00:20:41,644
institutions, that would endorse this

413
00:20:41,682 --> 00:20:43,228
notion of neuroscience. And the

414
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:44,796
Neuroscience Research Foundation was

415
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:47,164
like the old guard. And then the Young

416
00:20:47,202 --> 00:20:50,604
Turks came along and reacted against the

417
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:52,232
old Guard, the Neuroscience Research

418
00:20:52,306 --> 00:20:54,224
Foundation, to form the Society for

419
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:56,016
Neuroscience. And then we all know the

420
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:58,176
story since that time. It's one of the

421
00:20:58,198 --> 00:21:01,120
biggest societies in academia.

422
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,680
So just making the point that Aidelman

423
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,224
and his colleagues and vicarious

424
00:21:08,272 --> 00:21:10,656
colleagues, a lot of people, oliver

425
00:21:10,688 --> 00:21:13,572
Sacks being one, ernst Mer being another

426
00:21:13,626 --> 00:21:17,316
of his favorite sort of characters to

427
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:18,724
talk to, all of whom would come and

428
00:21:18,762 --> 00:21:20,728
visit, and we were privileged just to

429
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:23,336
listen in. And conversations in this

430
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:24,856
very formative time where some of the

431
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:26,936
sort of, I think, conceptual pillars of

432
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,460
the way that we understand neuroscience

433
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,532
in the 21st century were

434
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,812
first articulated, probably not using

435
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:41,324
quite the same words that we use

436
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:43,176
nowadays. So no one talks about reentry

437
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,196
anymore, so about recurrent neural

438
00:21:45,228 --> 00:21:48,656
networks or sort of feed forward and

439
00:21:48,678 --> 00:21:50,704
feedback and the like, but the same

440
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,496
underlying dynamics. And maths, I think,

441
00:21:52,518 --> 00:21:54,404
is absolutely there. Anyway, I was

442
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:56,980
brought in to replace Reed Montague,

443
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,700
so that was my little contribution.

444
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,820
Whilst we were in the Rockefeller,

445
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,996
I made the mistake of thinking that the

446
00:22:09,018 --> 00:22:10,424
right way to do this was to actually

447
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,216
write down equations and try and sort of

448
00:22:12,238 --> 00:22:15,476
naturalize it in terms of mathematics.

449
00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:17,604
Edelman was a great biological thinker.

450
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:19,380
He was not a very good mathematical

451
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,004
thinker, so there was a bit of a clash

452
00:22:22,052 --> 00:22:27,004
there. So I remember one

453
00:22:27,122 --> 00:22:29,932
meeting very early on when it was being

454
00:22:29,986 --> 00:22:32,130
decided what I was going to be doing.

455
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,848
Perhaps it's useful just to say the

456
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,404
context in which those early meetings

457
00:22:37,452 --> 00:22:39,744
took place. So Andy has already

458
00:22:39,782 --> 00:22:42,140
mentioned Guilio Tononi and Olaf spawns.

459
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,916
They were two key people, edelman's

460
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,536
young men who already in sight,

461
00:22:48,588 --> 00:22:51,220
you. And then I replaced Reed,

462
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,324
and they were working really purely on

463
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:57,256
theory. And that theory was tested in

464
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:01,476
the context of a forerunner

465
00:23:01,508 --> 00:23:03,784
of supercomputing, a hypercube that was

466
00:23:03,822 --> 00:23:06,824
driving, in my day, little robots. So,

467
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:10,108
again, Edelman was doing neurobotics in

468
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:13,580
the 1980s in exactly

469
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,084
the same way that people now in

470
00:23:15,122 --> 00:23:17,964
developmental neurobotics are still

471
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:19,790
addressing exactly the same questions,

472
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,208
probably with the same kind of computer

473
00:23:24,294 --> 00:23:26,640
infrastructure that obviously upgraded.

474
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,524
So we were sitting around and Edelman

475
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:34,036
was called out to take a phone call from

476
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:37,136
Germany, and there was a look of horror

477
00:23:37,168 --> 00:23:39,312
on people's faces because I'd suggested

478
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,424
a relationship between value dependent

479
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:44,660
learning and the riskola Wagner rule

480
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,936
from behavioral psychology. And as soon

481
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,748
as you mention an equation or a formula,

482
00:23:51,844 --> 00:23:53,944
that set Edelman off. And I didn't know

483
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:56,536
that, so I didn't know I pushed the

484
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,564
wrong button. So when Edelman came back

485
00:23:59,602 --> 00:24:02,604
in, I was effectively rusticated. I was

486
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:06,172
prevented from doing any work for three

487
00:24:06,226 --> 00:24:08,860
months and for every day,

488
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,708
afternoon and morning I had to sit in

489
00:24:11,714 --> 00:24:14,604
the Rockefeller library and read purely

490
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:17,776
biological great texts, and I

491
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:20,256
ended up having to. The last one was The

492
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:22,412
Growth of Biological Thought by Ernst

493
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:25,604
Mayer. I had to read from page to page,

494
00:24:25,722 --> 00:24:27,124
and when I did so, I had become

495
00:24:27,162 --> 00:24:28,736
sufficiently sanitized to be allowed

496
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:32,404
back into the workplace to actually do

497
00:24:32,442 --> 00:24:36,192
some work anyway. So that was our

498
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,130
contribution. And then when we moved to

499
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,012
the whole parade of 16

500
00:24:43,076 --> 00:24:45,016
Wheeler traxxas, translocating all the

501
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:49,316
kit and all the paperwork to

502
00:24:49,358 --> 00:24:51,836
La Jolla, and then relocating out there,

503
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:54,924
settling down, I brought that work to

504
00:24:54,962 --> 00:24:56,956
closure. And interesting, that was at

505
00:24:56,978 --> 00:24:59,676
the point when Giulio well, Olaf, I

506
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:03,232
remember him saying what he wants is

507
00:25:03,286 --> 00:25:07,920
basically to understand and simulate

508
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,944
the brain in a way that draws

509
00:25:14,992 --> 00:25:17,696
explanatory power from the architecture

510
00:25:17,728 --> 00:25:20,070
of the connectivity. Basically, we say

511
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,404
he wants to establish connectomics as

512
00:25:24,442 --> 00:25:27,512
a discipline, and of course, ten years

513
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:31,176
later, he's Mr. Connectomics. Julio at

514
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:35,300
that point was inventing integrated

515
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,960
information theory with a particular

516
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,736
focus on information, theoretical

517
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:42,700
formulations of complexity, and what

518
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,112
special, if you like, counterintuitive

519
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,324
behaviors, do you get from these

520
00:25:47,362 --> 00:25:49,228
biologically configured connectors when

521
00:25:49,234 --> 00:25:51,536
you put dynamics on structure and trying

522
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:53,248
to quantify that in a way that

523
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:56,028
ultimately transpired to be measures

524
00:25:56,044 --> 00:25:59,648
like phi in IIT. So that

525
00:25:59,654 --> 00:26:02,960
was a fun time as the mathematician,

526
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,296
closet mathematician, because I wasn't

527
00:26:05,328 --> 00:26:07,136
allowed to say anything about the maths

528
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:09,764
at the time. I enjoyed that bit. And so

529
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,996
looking being in

530
00:26:13,178 --> 00:26:16,536
at the, if you like, ground zero at

531
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:19,380
the inception of all these aspirations,

532
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,604
which eventually led to very fruitful

533
00:26:21,652 --> 00:26:26,456
careers. And then I went back to

534
00:26:26,478 --> 00:26:30,232
the UK. Just had fond memories and

535
00:26:30,366 --> 00:26:33,628
non fond memories, but both of a

536
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,710
nostalgic sort since that time.

537
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,724
Awesome. Great tales. Changming or

538
00:26:41,842 --> 00:26:43,776
Andrew, anything you want to add? Or I

539
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:45,490
can go to one of the questions.

540
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,616
Well, just to expound a little bit on

541
00:26:49,638 --> 00:26:51,744
what Karl was saying, I don't know if

542
00:26:51,782 --> 00:26:55,684
you can see this book. Okay, so this

543
00:26:55,722 --> 00:26:58,356
was something that came out of the

544
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:00,884
neuroscience research program that was

545
00:27:00,922 --> 00:27:03,904
sort of the old boys club that Francis

546
00:27:03,952 --> 00:27:08,032
Schmidt started at MIT and

547
00:27:08,106 --> 00:27:10,216
later was the basis for the

548
00:27:10,238 --> 00:27:13,304
neurosciences Institute. And what this

549
00:27:13,342 --> 00:27:14,776
was was sort of the who's who in

550
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:16,856
neuroscience. So, again, if you look at

551
00:27:16,878 --> 00:27:19,964
this book, it says, edited by Francis O.

552
00:27:20,002 --> 00:27:21,852
Schmidt. So he was the guy that started

553
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:22,510
that.

554
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,536
This persisted even throughout

555
00:27:30,568 --> 00:27:31,870
the 2000s.

556
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,976
Once or twice a year at the

557
00:27:36,998 --> 00:27:38,864
neurosciences Institute, they would

558
00:27:38,902 --> 00:27:40,688
organize one of these meetings, and it

559
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:43,244
would be a who's who of neuroscience.

560
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:45,028
So all the Nobel laureates in

561
00:27:45,034 --> 00:27:47,572
neuroscience, all the big names, would

562
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:50,804
come for a four or five day meeting and

563
00:27:50,842 --> 00:27:53,828
talk about their research. And as a

564
00:27:53,994 --> 00:27:55,904
member of the neurosciences Institute,

565
00:27:55,952 --> 00:27:59,464
I got to sit in and meet these people.

566
00:27:59,662 --> 00:28:03,256
And it was phenomenal, especially with

567
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:06,024
my background, because I was sort of not

568
00:28:06,062 --> 00:28:09,116
on the mainstream of neuroscience at

569
00:28:09,138 --> 00:28:12,540
that point. And that was really

570
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,004
fascinating. So you got to meet people

571
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:19,420
like Wolf Schultz and all the big names

572
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,380
that were there, francis Crick.

573
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,552
But what I want to go back to is this

574
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:30,316
original book by Edelman and Mac Castle

575
00:28:30,428 --> 00:28:32,656
called The Mindful Brain. This is sort

576
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:36,964
of like one of the bibles of early

577
00:28:37,162 --> 00:28:39,300
creative thinking about brain function,

578
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,684
and it presaged the idea of

579
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,396
distributed systems. This was sort of

580
00:28:45,418 --> 00:28:47,704
the thing that Vernon Moncasso was very

581
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:51,464
much into. And so to this

582
00:28:51,502 --> 00:28:53,192
day, the way most people think about

583
00:28:53,246 --> 00:28:56,040
brain function is boxes,

584
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,416
where each part of the brain is confined

585
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:02,424
to a box, and then there are arrows

586
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:05,404
pointed to other boxes. And so we get

587
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:08,156
this idea that there's a circuitry. So

588
00:29:08,178 --> 00:29:10,956
you often hear neuroscientists talk

589
00:29:10,978 --> 00:29:13,644
about circuits, and that kind of comes

590
00:29:13,682 --> 00:29:15,496
from the idea that you have these boxes

591
00:29:15,528 --> 00:29:17,584
and you have arrows and you have plus

592
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,984
and minus signs with the arrows, and

593
00:29:20,022 --> 00:29:21,984
then somehow the pluses and minuses add

594
00:29:22,022 --> 00:29:23,424
up and tell you what's going to happen

595
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:24,710
at the next box.

596
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,332
And that is nice because

597
00:29:29,386 --> 00:29:31,444
you can kind of simplify things and talk

598
00:29:31,482 --> 00:29:34,612
about causality in very concrete terms.

599
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:36,112
And it's great if you're an engineer,

600
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:38,212
because you can write transfer functions

601
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,228
about defining how you get an output

602
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:43,384
from an input, but that's not

603
00:29:43,422 --> 00:29:46,936
the way the brain works. And I think

604
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:50,620
Kyle can attest to the early days of MRI

605
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,084
studies where everybody was doing

606
00:29:53,122 --> 00:29:57,960
pseudocolored representations

607
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,804
of these different areas to see which

608
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:02,956
area would light up a particular task,

609
00:30:02,988 --> 00:30:06,784
as if each area had a specific job and

610
00:30:06,822 --> 00:30:09,040
could be assigned to a specific task.

611
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,864
Neuroscience in general is still

612
00:30:12,902 --> 00:30:15,508
suffering from that point of view, and

613
00:30:15,594 --> 00:30:19,172
it's only become a little bit more clear

614
00:30:19,226 --> 00:30:21,476
as computational science has matured in

615
00:30:21,498 --> 00:30:24,068
the last five or ten years, especially

616
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:28,544
with the adaptation of artificial

617
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:31,830
neural networks to the mainstream, that

618
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,780
we can start to explore more biological

619
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,210
meaningful ways of brain function. And

620
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,348
Vernon Macassill recognized that as

621
00:30:44,434 --> 00:30:47,736
sort of the I would say the founder

622
00:30:47,768 --> 00:30:50,696
of systems neuroscience, modern systems

623
00:30:50,728 --> 00:30:54,272
neuroscience, and Edelman talked about

624
00:30:54,326 --> 00:30:58,012
that a little know, there's group theory

625
00:30:58,076 --> 00:31:00,464
and some of the things that OLEF has

626
00:31:00,502 --> 00:31:04,064
started. With graph

627
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,104
theory still sort of based on strict

628
00:31:07,152 --> 00:31:10,436
anatomical you know,

629
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:13,430
if you read like Olaf's latest review,

630
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,888
where the field is starting to progress

631
00:31:15,984 --> 00:31:19,460
away from that constraint of anatomical

632
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,264
connectivity, we're starting to get more

633
00:31:22,302 --> 00:31:24,164
toward the idea of truly distributed

634
00:31:24,212 --> 00:31:26,872
systems. And to me, that's super

635
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,852
exciting. But you can look back to this

636
00:31:29,906 --> 00:31:33,676
book from the see that the

637
00:31:33,698 --> 00:31:36,972
seed was planted way back then and see

638
00:31:37,026 --> 00:31:40,108
how almost 50 years later, now,

639
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:43,040
it's finally starting to evolve into

640
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,184
something that's becoming more

641
00:31:45,222 --> 00:31:48,096
mainstream. And if you sort of look at

642
00:31:48,118 --> 00:31:50,864
the evolution of neuroscience, I think

643
00:31:50,902 --> 00:31:53,376
if you project ahead to the next ten or

644
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:56,820
20 years, this is going to be really

645
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,076
the fundamental change in the way we

646
00:31:59,098 --> 00:32:03,104
think about neural function. And I'm

647
00:32:03,152 --> 00:32:05,892
super excited about that and you look

648
00:32:06,026 --> 00:32:09,096
and sort of back in history to see how

649
00:32:09,118 --> 00:32:12,728
that's evolved. And I don't know,

650
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:14,664
I think there's something very

651
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:16,312
attractive about thinking about things

652
00:32:16,366 --> 00:32:19,452
that way. Yeah.

653
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:22,252
Okay, I'll add something, I think,

654
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:24,460
talking about Edema's,

655
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,428
the brilliance about seeing things

656
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:30,876
through. I don't know. In the

657
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:34,624
neurobiology field, you people still

658
00:32:34,742 --> 00:32:37,360
sort of think the neuro Darwinism idea

659
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:41,456
is still there, right? So that was the

660
00:32:41,478 --> 00:32:44,136
time when I was with him in Rockefeller

661
00:32:44,188 --> 00:32:46,852
University he would talk things like

662
00:32:46,986 --> 00:32:50,176
know Darwinism for evolution species.

663
00:32:50,288 --> 00:32:53,568
And he saw that in immunoglobulin

664
00:32:53,744 --> 00:32:57,444
chronos selection. So he applied to this

665
00:32:57,482 --> 00:33:00,984
neurodarwinism idea. But I have to say,

666
00:33:01,102 --> 00:33:03,096
subsequently, actually, my career is

667
00:33:03,118 --> 00:33:04,996
mainly in university, Southern

668
00:33:05,028 --> 00:33:07,544
California and working on this

669
00:33:07,582 --> 00:33:10,940
morphogenesis tissue patent formation.

670
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,024
And in our field, sort of more bench

671
00:33:14,072 --> 00:33:17,224
work aspect of Edelman. This direction,

672
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:20,716
not the neurobiology direction, but in

673
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:23,372
the field, there were people originally

674
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:25,840
more talking about the stem cells are

675
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,824
predetermined and then they go this

676
00:33:27,862 --> 00:33:30,912
lineage. They go this lineage. But we

677
00:33:30,966 --> 00:33:33,904
using the skin as a model. Actually, I

678
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:36,116
start to write these things kind of a

679
00:33:36,138 --> 00:33:38,404
Darwinism within the skin. I mean,

680
00:33:38,442 --> 00:33:41,600
basically it's that there is no preset

681
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,004
forever stem cells. If you wipe out

682
00:33:44,042 --> 00:33:46,324
these stem cells, other cells are

683
00:33:46,362 --> 00:33:48,772
waiting there to take over the space.

684
00:33:48,906 --> 00:33:51,604
So there is even during development and

685
00:33:51,642 --> 00:33:54,484
during regeneration to make the tissue

686
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,864
patterning process robust. There is a

687
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:01,336
small so called Darwinism competition

688
00:34:01,448 --> 00:34:04,204
going on in there and that is sort of

689
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,516
also influencing our work in

690
00:34:07,538 --> 00:34:10,332
morphogenesis these days. And I think

691
00:34:10,386 --> 00:34:13,648
that's kind of the impact of him

692
00:34:13,734 --> 00:34:16,050
on this aspect as well.

693
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,114
Wow. All right. I'll read a question.

694
00:34:23,232 --> 00:34:26,430
This was from Dave Douglas. Dave wrote,

695
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,642
we know that Professor Edelman used deep

696
00:34:29,706 --> 00:34:33,262
analogies in exploring new subjects as

697
00:34:33,316 --> 00:34:35,214
in his leveraging his knowledge of

698
00:34:35,252 --> 00:34:37,706
immunology and organismal development to

699
00:34:37,748 --> 00:34:40,100
probe conceptualization and learning.

700
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,834
Did he ever work specifically on

701
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:46,034
metaphor and analogy as such? For

702
00:34:46,072 --> 00:34:48,018
example, did he leverage his experience

703
00:34:48,104 --> 00:34:50,694
of music and poetry to dig out

704
00:34:50,732 --> 00:34:53,490
scientific facts while separating

705
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,990
fertile from sterile analogies?

706
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:03,018
An answer or just what that makes you

707
00:35:03,104 --> 00:35:04,060
think of?

708
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,530
It makes me think of something which

709
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,866
Edelman used to call me, which I am an

710
00:35:11,888 --> 00:35:14,700
intellectual thug. So I'm sure that

711
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,774
there's a great answer to that.

712
00:35:17,812 --> 00:35:20,222
Excellent question. And it does speak to

713
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:23,246
Edelman's skills and interests. As a

714
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:26,842
violinist, I do remember that BBC

715
00:35:26,906 --> 00:35:30,754
Horizon came to do a profile on

716
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:33,886
him and his ideas and it was prefaced

717
00:35:33,918 --> 00:35:37,454
with, I think, shots of him playing

718
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:41,414
the violin to concert standard. But I

719
00:35:41,452 --> 00:35:43,800
have absolutely no idea whether he used

720
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,680
that sort of part of his life to

721
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,006
take things beyond metaphor. So as an

722
00:35:52,028 --> 00:35:54,522
intellectual thug, I'm going to hand

723
00:35:54,576 --> 00:35:57,898
over to my two colleagues to see whether

724
00:35:57,984 --> 00:35:59,980
they can give a more elegant answer.

725
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,130
Or anything in that area of the arts.

726
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,410
And you brought up poetry.

727
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,890
Anything in the arts and sciences?

728
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:25,482
Well, I'm no brain biologist,

729
00:36:25,546 --> 00:36:28,686
but just to say that from my side of the

730
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:32,298
interaction, he really tried to merge

731
00:36:32,474 --> 00:36:36,354
science and art. He would think a

732
00:36:36,392 --> 00:36:39,314
real science would be beautiful. And

733
00:36:39,352 --> 00:36:41,426
that's the way I think when I learn. As

734
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:44,594
I mentioned, when I say, oh, I was

735
00:36:44,632 --> 00:36:47,794
expecting a more clear cut CC's idea,

736
00:36:47,912 --> 00:36:51,078
but he would say Ming is like writing a

737
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,458
poetry. He said, When I start, I don't

738
00:36:53,474 --> 00:36:56,662
know where it's going to end. It's like

739
00:36:56,716 --> 00:37:00,426
some artists when you ask them how do

740
00:37:00,448 --> 00:37:03,002
you create this painting? I try to ask

741
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:05,514
this question to some of my friends who

742
00:37:05,552 --> 00:37:09,354
are artists and they say they

743
00:37:09,392 --> 00:37:12,074
do not have a clear blueprint of how

744
00:37:12,112 --> 00:37:14,026
that painting would looks like. They

745
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:16,286
have an idea, it's kind of floating in

746
00:37:16,308 --> 00:37:18,478
the sky and they try to grab it down,

747
00:37:18,564 --> 00:37:22,174
so they paint on the way and try to make

748
00:37:22,212 --> 00:37:24,302
it into a painting. Or I have a friend

749
00:37:24,356 --> 00:37:26,802
who are poets, I ask them this, they say

750
00:37:26,856 --> 00:37:29,330
they grab the word to make them coming

751
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,114
down. And I kind of feel adamant sort of

752
00:37:32,152 --> 00:37:36,100
treat the scientific idea like that.

753
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:41,750
This is my superficial interaction,

754
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,414
just some experience. I don't have

755
00:37:47,452 --> 00:37:51,594
a direct reply to that. But in

756
00:37:51,632 --> 00:37:55,162
general, I think there's the idea

757
00:37:55,216 --> 00:37:58,346
of creativity that he brought to

758
00:37:58,368 --> 00:38:01,914
the forefront. And then also with

759
00:38:01,952 --> 00:38:03,838
that creativity, you have to have a

760
00:38:03,844 --> 00:38:07,342
certain amount of courage to move

761
00:38:07,396 --> 00:38:10,218
out of the sort of mainstream,

762
00:38:10,314 --> 00:38:13,646
right? So if you have an idea and you

763
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:15,102
have to have a certain amount of courage

764
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:16,420
to put that forward.

765
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,506
If. That idea is creative and out of the

766
00:38:21,528 --> 00:38:25,314
ordinary. And I think artists and sort

767
00:38:25,352 --> 00:38:29,240
of really great scientists have that

768
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,760
in common.

769
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:36,850
Maybe to that nexus of creativity

770
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:40,394
and career development and courage for

771
00:38:40,432 --> 00:38:43,882
you or just in the environment. How did

772
00:38:43,936 --> 00:38:47,658
his mentoring help bring out

773
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:50,140
these threads in people?

774
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,242
For better and for worse? I think Karl

775
00:38:55,306 --> 00:38:57,614
could attest to that. I have a hard time

776
00:38:57,652 --> 00:39:01,022
viewing Edelman as a feel good

777
00:39:01,076 --> 00:39:04,786
mentor. I think he

778
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:07,042
would throw ideas out there. He could be

779
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:10,706
pretty aggressive and I

780
00:39:10,728 --> 00:39:13,460
would say frightening to young people.

781
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:18,230
So I wouldn't

782
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,766
cast Edelman's behavior as sort of the

783
00:39:21,788 --> 00:39:26,086
typical mentor. But again,

784
00:39:26,188 --> 00:39:29,070
I think the environment that he created

785
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,060
was someplace that was really special

786
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:35,862
and reflected that kind of courageous

787
00:39:35,926 --> 00:39:39,562
creativity. And I really

788
00:39:39,616 --> 00:39:41,020
appreciate that. Now.

789
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,998
Just to endorse that notion of

790
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:49,006
courageous creativity, I think it's a

791
00:39:49,028 --> 00:39:51,182
really nice observation. I've often

792
00:39:51,236 --> 00:39:55,674
reflected on whether let's

793
00:39:55,722 --> 00:40:00,030
take for example, Julio and Olaf,

794
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,906
and I think you could probably apply it

795
00:40:01,928 --> 00:40:03,906
to me and Andy and a number of other

796
00:40:03,928 --> 00:40:06,930
people as well. But if we just take

797
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,070
Julio and Olaf, who've both become world

798
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,758
leaders, thought leaders in their own

799
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,386
particular field, having brought

800
00:40:14,418 --> 00:40:17,734
something new to the table, and in some

801
00:40:17,772 --> 00:40:20,294
instances in more than one area. So

802
00:40:20,332 --> 00:40:23,418
Julia TENone, in terms of sleep research

803
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:27,722
and synaptic Homeostasis in terms of his

804
00:40:27,856 --> 00:40:29,398
work in consciousness studies,

805
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:32,846
integrated information theory, olaf in.

806
00:40:32,868 --> 00:40:37,920
Terms of structural function and mean.

807
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:41,614
Is it that Edelman had a good eye for

808
00:40:41,652 --> 00:40:44,874
bright young men? Or is it that bright

809
00:40:44,922 --> 00:40:46,766
young men learned how to do this? That

810
00:40:46,788 --> 00:40:50,194
this was the way to be courageous and to

811
00:40:50,232 --> 00:40:52,430
say it's an adversarial in that courage

812
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,834
to be creative and to pursue what you

813
00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:58,402
have created in a slightly adversarial

814
00:40:58,466 --> 00:41:00,520
or at least sort of defensive way,

815
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,520
I don't know. But what I do know is

816
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,294
there was certainly a culture that

817
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:12,090
was established that would allow those

818
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,910
kinds of skills to be developed

819
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,086
and is referred to them slightly

820
00:41:18,118 --> 00:41:22,510
obliquely. It was a dark culture

821
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,894
and it has to be said, it was a very

822
00:41:24,932 --> 00:41:27,230
homophilic culture. There were no women

823
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:31,182
allowed in this culture. So in

824
00:41:31,236 --> 00:41:35,202
my time, the culture was really

825
00:41:35,336 --> 00:41:38,820
one man and adoring young men

826
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:44,350
and you had to repeatedly

827
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:47,894
affirm that adoration. And part of that

828
00:41:47,932 --> 00:41:51,270
was really useful and really enjoyable

829
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:55,058
and has already mentioned the lunches.

830
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:58,902
Exactly the same regime characterized my

831
00:41:58,956 --> 00:42:01,898
stay. There was a rigorous routine where

832
00:42:01,984 --> 00:42:04,058
all the young men would go off to the

833
00:42:04,144 --> 00:42:06,630
New York cafe, would have onion rings

834
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,974
and burgers and Aileman would wax

835
00:42:10,022 --> 00:42:13,374
lyrical. And perhaps this is not art

836
00:42:13,412 --> 00:42:17,038
and creativity, but he was

837
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:19,386
artistic in his joke telling, so he'd

838
00:42:19,418 --> 00:42:22,746
always have a new joke every lunchtime

839
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:26,286
in a New York diner. And that was a

840
00:42:26,308 --> 00:42:28,934
routine and it was just pure theatre,

841
00:42:29,002 --> 00:42:30,894
day after day after day. Incredible

842
00:42:30,942 --> 00:42:33,634
energy, but it was theater. The young

843
00:42:33,672 --> 00:42:37,140
men were the audience and we basically,

844
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,920
I think, were dancing to

845
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,666
his orchestration. He was the conductor

846
00:42:45,778 --> 00:42:47,510
and he was the director.

847
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,794
It's possible that that culture did

848
00:42:52,832 --> 00:42:54,906
actually instill in all of us, and

849
00:42:54,928 --> 00:42:58,262
particularly Olaf and Julio, the notion

850
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,826
that to make it to make a difference and

851
00:43:00,848 --> 00:43:02,874
to be true to one's convictions, you

852
00:43:02,912 --> 00:43:05,198
really have to sort of fight for and

853
00:43:05,284 --> 00:43:07,678
autonomously pursue what you want to do.

854
00:43:07,764 --> 00:43:10,558
And it is interesting that the style in

855
00:43:10,564 --> 00:43:12,990
which both Julia and Olaf have pursued

856
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:16,562
their scientific ideology and ideas and

857
00:43:16,616 --> 00:43:19,934
creativity is very much slightly

858
00:43:19,982 --> 00:43:24,046
lonesome. With the exception of Julia's

859
00:43:24,078 --> 00:43:27,526
work in

860
00:43:27,548 --> 00:43:30,294
the molecular biology of sleep, the

861
00:43:30,332 --> 00:43:32,486
theoretical contributions are very sort

862
00:43:32,508 --> 00:43:34,950
of associated with them personally,

863
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,982
to a certain extent, with me. And what

864
00:43:39,036 --> 00:43:44,554
one could argue is the

865
00:43:44,592 --> 00:43:46,454
mathematical version of value dependent

866
00:43:46,502 --> 00:43:48,842
learning, which would be the free energy

867
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:51,546
principle. All of these things have the

868
00:43:51,568 --> 00:43:55,054
same flavor as neural Darwinism, or as

869
00:43:55,092 --> 00:43:56,510
some people used to call it,

870
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,830
neuralmanism.

871
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,310
So I often ask that question was this

872
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,794
the skill of Edelman in choosing people

873
00:44:05,832 --> 00:44:07,922
who are going to make a difference or

874
00:44:08,056 --> 00:44:10,866
did he basically provide a culture in

875
00:44:10,888 --> 00:44:15,426
which it gave people the tools or the

876
00:44:15,448 --> 00:44:17,158
motivation or the confidence that you

877
00:44:17,164 --> 00:44:19,302
can make a difference because you saw

878
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,560
him make a difference? I don't know.

879
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:26,102
I think both of you actually said

880
00:44:26,156 --> 00:44:27,910
something. I shared the experience.

881
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,630
Definitely he set up a right

882
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,274
environment. But just like when we do

883
00:44:33,312 --> 00:44:35,946
stem cell, stem cell and its niche. You

884
00:44:35,968 --> 00:44:37,546
need the interaction. You need a

885
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:39,978
conversation between epiphelia and the

886
00:44:39,984 --> 00:44:42,474
methanchyma cells or in the brain. I

887
00:44:42,512 --> 00:44:44,782
heard it's more like interaction between

888
00:44:44,836 --> 00:44:47,694
neuronal cells and gulia cells. So a

889
00:44:47,732 --> 00:44:50,094
successful interaction would lead,

890
00:44:50,212 --> 00:44:52,800
whatever the process, to move forward,

891
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:56,834
but not every process would

892
00:44:56,872 --> 00:45:00,354
be successful. So, as said, I also like

893
00:45:00,392 --> 00:45:05,314
the way Karl mentioned about Edelman is

894
00:45:05,352 --> 00:45:07,266
the conductor. He actually said that in

895
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:09,730
our meeting at the time. He said,

896
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,758
Edelman, I'm the conductor. You guys is

897
00:45:13,864 --> 00:45:17,686
my symphony, prayers, and you

898
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:19,674
pray together. You can make a good

899
00:45:19,712 --> 00:45:23,642
music. But it's also true not

900
00:45:23,696 --> 00:45:26,234
every interaction works, because I was

901
00:45:26,272 --> 00:45:29,180
with him for almost eight years or so.

902
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,786
Not every person work, let's put it that

903
00:45:31,808 --> 00:45:35,054
way. That is a fact. So some work, some

904
00:45:35,092 --> 00:45:37,214
don't, right? So I think people are

905
00:45:37,252 --> 00:45:40,234
given that opportunity. And as Andrew

906
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:42,042
said, it's a good, outstanding

907
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:45,454
environment. So you pick up the

908
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,100
idea from Edelman, you develop yourself

909
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:52,260
and some of them, or you can call it

910
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:57,526
Edmund, then we success in

911
00:45:57,548 --> 00:46:00,898
a certain way or not, but I think it's

912
00:46:00,914 --> 00:46:04,854
an exciting environment. I would put it

913
00:46:04,892 --> 00:46:08,386
that way. It's both. He inspires

914
00:46:08,418 --> 00:46:11,706
you. He gives you a sort of

915
00:46:11,888 --> 00:46:14,922
exciting environment to evolve, but not

916
00:46:14,976 --> 00:46:18,106
everyone. He can choose everyone to

917
00:46:18,128 --> 00:46:20,474
be successful. No, it's not like that.

918
00:46:20,592 --> 00:46:23,866
But he did give you that opportunity to

919
00:46:23,888 --> 00:46:26,766
be successful and to pick up something,

920
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:29,166
and he also give you that courage to do

921
00:46:29,188 --> 00:46:31,422
it. As I mentioned, people would

922
00:46:31,476 --> 00:46:33,806
normally think using the feather as a

923
00:46:33,828 --> 00:46:36,690
model is kind of very high risk,

924
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:40,146
but he has that encouragement, and I do

925
00:46:40,168 --> 00:46:43,902
that, and I feel I really using Federal

926
00:46:43,966 --> 00:46:46,174
as a Rosetta Stone. I have learned

927
00:46:46,222 --> 00:46:49,154
something for the Morphogenesis patent

928
00:46:49,202 --> 00:46:52,034
formation field. Yeah. So I appreciate

929
00:46:52,082 --> 00:46:53,160
him for that.

930
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,670
Andrew. Or I can ask another question.

931
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,784
I really don't have anything to add

932
00:47:03,902 --> 00:47:06,984
right now. Thank you,

933
00:47:07,022 --> 00:47:10,250
though. It's really amazing.

934
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,132
It's such a different world, and the

935
00:47:15,186 --> 00:47:18,056
environment of learning and of carrying

936
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:21,790
out science is so different. So,

937
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,572
personally, I really appreciate just

938
00:47:24,626 --> 00:47:28,690
even a window into settings that are

939
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:33,712
elsewhere and in a different time. So

940
00:47:33,766 --> 00:47:36,800
thank you for all of this.

941
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:39,220
All right, I'll ask another question

942
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,420
from Dave.

943
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,804
Professor Edelman was reputed to be

944
00:47:44,842 --> 00:47:46,992
skeptical about the risk of abusing

945
00:47:47,056 --> 00:47:49,204
mathematical or computer models in

946
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:51,104
creating theories of neural functioning,

947
00:47:51,152 --> 00:47:53,144
cognition, and consciousness. Some

948
00:47:53,182 --> 00:47:55,128
reviewers went so far as to mock him in

949
00:47:55,134 --> 00:47:57,256
print for using computers as research

950
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:00,920
tools. But he worked with Tanini

951
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,772
on the foundations of integrated

952
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:04,996
information theory, an extremely math

953
00:48:05,028 --> 00:48:06,952
heavy theory that sometimes explained

954
00:48:07,016 --> 00:48:09,672
using computing imagery. Did Edelman

955
00:48:09,736 --> 00:48:12,364
change his attitude towards the role of

956
00:48:12,402 --> 00:48:14,972
math or of computing paradigms in

957
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:17,472
thinking about the mind? Or did he

958
00:48:17,526 --> 00:48:19,696
simply start trusting his colleagues to

959
00:48:19,718 --> 00:48:22,236
think computationally without falling

960
00:48:22,268 --> 00:48:24,896
into rabbit holes dug by von Neumann and

961
00:48:24,918 --> 00:48:25,520
Turing?

962
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,296
Or how did you see the role of math and

963
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:36,432
computers in Edelman's thinking and

964
00:48:36,486 --> 00:48:39,504
research develop over a period where

965
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,724
they were also undergoing such rapid

966
00:48:41,772 --> 00:48:45,444
developments more broadly. So I'm pretty

967
00:48:45,482 --> 00:48:48,816
sure that Edelman respected mathematics

968
00:48:48,848 --> 00:48:50,516
and computational approaches to

969
00:48:50,538 --> 00:48:54,052
neuroscience. There certainly

970
00:48:54,106 --> 00:48:56,340
were a lot of theory fellows that were

971
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:59,176
computationally savvy. While I was at

972
00:48:59,198 --> 00:49:03,288
the so,

973
00:49:03,374 --> 00:49:06,810
for instance, Karl mentioned these

974
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,984
robots that were used to sort of explore

975
00:49:10,052 --> 00:49:12,796
and learn, sort of the beginning, I

976
00:49:12,818 --> 00:49:14,796
guess, of embodied cognition. Karl, you

977
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:17,916
would say, where they explore the

978
00:49:17,938 --> 00:49:19,676
environment and learn, and then from

979
00:49:19,698 --> 00:49:24,784
that learning, they build internal say.

980
00:49:24,822 --> 00:49:28,416
And that was Olaf's ballywig, I would

981
00:49:28,438 --> 00:49:32,624
say that was highly computational and

982
00:49:32,742 --> 00:49:35,840
certainly a major thrust in edelman's

983
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,916
emphasis in what he wanted to do at the

984
00:49:38,938 --> 00:49:41,444
institute. And there were a number of

985
00:49:41,482 --> 00:49:44,580
other things, I think, the integrated

986
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,384
part that Julio did. I think that was

987
00:49:49,422 --> 00:49:52,184
almost all Julio's work,

988
00:49:52,302 --> 00:49:53,592
along with some of the other

989
00:49:53,646 --> 00:49:57,992
computational you

990
00:49:58,046 --> 00:49:59,976
know, I think Edelman wanted to be part

991
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:02,984
of that, but that really, I think,

992
00:50:03,022 --> 00:50:04,600
was mostly,

993
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,764
I think, you know, as part of the

994
00:50:08,802 --> 00:50:11,436
culture, edelman managed to get his name

995
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:13,664
on Julio's paper. We used to laugh about

996
00:50:13,702 --> 00:50:17,776
that quite a bit, but again, I would say

997
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:20,610
that was 99% Julio's work.

998
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,230
Yeah, I can concur, because I was there

999
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,030
when the work was actually done.

1000
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,036
There was a sort of period I

1001
00:50:34,058 --> 00:50:36,096
can't remember there was some hypothesis

1002
00:50:36,128 --> 00:50:37,952
that pertained to a core, a dynamical

1003
00:50:38,016 --> 00:50:42,070
core, as sort of

1004
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,640
oppression are necessary for some kind

1005
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,308
of consciousness. And I think Ehlmann

1006
00:50:48,324 --> 00:50:50,028
was comfortable with this sort of

1007
00:50:50,114 --> 00:50:52,684
intuitive notion of a dynamic core, but

1008
00:50:52,882 --> 00:50:55,804
when it became articulated in terms of

1009
00:50:55,842 --> 00:50:57,180
information theory,

1010
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,864
I think even if he didn't say so out

1011
00:51:02,902 --> 00:51:05,056
loud, he would have responded as he

1012
00:51:05,078 --> 00:51:07,184
responded to me, with, oh, you've got

1013
00:51:07,222 --> 00:51:11,056
mathematosis. So this is another of

1014
00:51:11,078 --> 00:51:14,992
his ways of dealing with

1015
00:51:15,046 --> 00:51:16,932
people who had a tendency to over

1016
00:51:16,986 --> 00:51:19,428
mathematicalize and oversimplify, as a

1017
00:51:19,434 --> 00:51:22,596
physicist would, reducing a horse to a

1018
00:51:22,618 --> 00:51:24,384
point and then writing down differential

1019
00:51:24,432 --> 00:51:26,836
equations. He was very allergic to that.

1020
00:51:27,018 --> 00:51:29,544
He didn't like that and would call that

1021
00:51:29,742 --> 00:51:32,376
an instance of mathematosis. I think

1022
00:51:32,398 --> 00:51:33,816
that's very distinct, though, from what

1023
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:35,304
Andy was just talking about, which is

1024
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:38,596
the commitment to physically realized

1025
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:40,860
embodied computation.

1026
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,664
And I think it's a really well observed

1027
00:51:44,712 --> 00:51:47,820
point that this was embodied cognition

1028
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,484
circa 1980, 1990. So he was quite

1029
00:51:51,522 --> 00:51:55,096
visionary in, I think, sort of testing

1030
00:51:55,128 --> 00:51:58,488
out ideas in physical in realized

1031
00:51:58,584 --> 00:52:00,580
systems. You couldn't just hand wave

1032
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,544
with maths. You had to show it worked.

1033
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:06,236
This idea worked in a real setting.

1034
00:52:06,268 --> 00:52:11,236
And at that time, they were the

1035
00:52:11,258 --> 00:52:15,030
Darwin series to the extent that

1036
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,568
I, for example, had to spend six months

1037
00:52:18,654 --> 00:52:21,576
learning to paralyze C in order to

1038
00:52:21,598 --> 00:52:24,584
program the robot. So it wasn't he was

1039
00:52:24,622 --> 00:52:27,176
frightened of new technology or computer

1040
00:52:27,278 --> 00:52:29,588
science. I think he didn't like

1041
00:52:29,694 --> 00:52:33,740
trivializing things. All a physicist

1042
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,444
with mathematics, but you would

1043
00:52:36,482 --> 00:52:39,836
certainly be fully committed to the

1044
00:52:39,858 --> 00:52:44,016
notion that computation is at

1045
00:52:44,038 --> 00:52:47,024
the heart of the kind of dynamics that

1046
00:52:47,142 --> 00:52:50,028
he wanted to understand. And underwrote

1047
00:52:50,124 --> 00:52:51,808
theory and indeed, I think that the

1048
00:52:51,814 --> 00:52:54,508
theory of neural group selection speaks

1049
00:52:54,524 --> 00:52:58,340
to that. He wanted to see it realized

1050
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,136
in a robot. But I think Andy's

1051
00:53:03,168 --> 00:53:05,044
absolutely right. At the point when

1052
00:53:05,162 --> 00:53:08,872
Julia sort of just basically went

1053
00:53:08,926 --> 00:53:10,952
straight from the axioms to

1054
00:53:11,006 --> 00:53:14,408
consciousness and phi with equations. I

1055
00:53:14,414 --> 00:53:18,296
think that was the time that Julia had

1056
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:21,064
to leave the family, basically, and

1057
00:53:21,102 --> 00:53:24,696
Julie did so. Sort of

1058
00:53:24,718 --> 00:53:27,644
extrapolated that a little bit think,

1059
00:53:27,762 --> 00:53:30,280
you know, when I read Edelman's books

1060
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,176
and some of his papers, I don't

1061
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:36,488
understand his, you know,

1062
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:39,456
his phrases and his descriptions. A lot

1063
00:53:39,478 --> 00:53:41,616
of things don't make sense. If he had

1064
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:43,676
written those out or someone had written

1065
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:47,076
those out as equations that's the nice

1066
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:48,676
thing about equations. Once you see the

1067
00:53:48,698 --> 00:53:51,236
equation, you don't have to worry about

1068
00:53:51,258 --> 00:53:53,764
the words so much. Things become pretty

1069
00:53:53,802 --> 00:53:57,828
clear. And I think, looking back,

1070
00:53:57,914 --> 00:54:00,024
if he had been able to do that, I think

1071
00:54:00,062 --> 00:54:03,384
his ideas, first of all, would have been

1072
00:54:03,502 --> 00:54:06,104
crystallized in his own mind better and

1073
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:08,424
second of all, would have been able to

1074
00:54:08,462 --> 00:54:11,404
be others would have understood them

1075
00:54:11,442 --> 00:54:15,772
more clearly. And I think that's really

1076
00:54:15,826 --> 00:54:18,748
important for me.

1077
00:54:18,914 --> 00:54:21,276
Maybe with an engineering background or

1078
00:54:21,298 --> 00:54:24,864
something. If you have a model or

1079
00:54:24,902 --> 00:54:26,672
if you have an idea, if you can write

1080
00:54:26,726 --> 00:54:30,000
that out explicitly with an equation,

1081
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,416
it really clarifies things, it

1082
00:54:32,438 --> 00:54:34,656
crystallizes things. And that was the

1083
00:54:34,758 --> 00:54:36,884
thing that I liked about Julio's work

1084
00:54:36,922 --> 00:54:39,984
because again, this word of know, it's

1085
00:54:40,032 --> 00:54:41,892
like nobody knows what that really

1086
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:45,716
means. But at least Julio had a

1087
00:54:45,738 --> 00:54:47,764
form of equations, right, where he was

1088
00:54:47,802 --> 00:54:50,644
talking about information theory and the

1089
00:54:50,842 --> 00:54:55,160
know, you could have a cluster

1090
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,900
where information was internal versus

1091
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:01,132
the external information and say, that

1092
00:55:01,186 --> 00:55:03,336
okay, if you have to have consciousness,

1093
00:55:03,448 --> 00:55:06,076
here it is. And he could describe that

1094
00:55:06,258 --> 00:55:08,876
with a concrete equation. I mean,

1095
00:55:08,898 --> 00:55:11,916
that's a step forward. And again, I

1096
00:55:11,938 --> 00:55:14,696
always say as someone that records

1097
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:18,224
neurons in the brain all the time, if I

1098
00:55:18,262 --> 00:55:20,416
wanted to find consciousness, how would

1099
00:55:20,438 --> 00:55:23,104
I know it if I found it, right? I mean,

1100
00:55:23,142 --> 00:55:24,884
if I had an equation, maybe I could do

1101
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:27,604
it. But just the way it's defined right

1102
00:55:27,642 --> 00:55:29,972
now, who knows? I could have already

1103
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:34,516
discovered it. I wouldn't know. So I

1104
00:55:34,538 --> 00:55:37,480
think that's an interesting point.

1105
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:41,496
Anyway, I can't resist his following up

1106
00:55:41,518 --> 00:55:44,296
on that because especially evident for

1107
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:46,884
me in the remembered present this notion

1108
00:55:46,932 --> 00:55:49,192
that his words don't actually make any

1109
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:52,316
sense. I think that's pure poetry and

1110
00:55:52,338 --> 00:55:54,236
pure brilliance because what I tend to

1111
00:55:54,258 --> 00:55:57,576
find myself doing is reading the meaning

1112
00:55:57,688 --> 00:56:00,456
into his ambiguous sentences and finding

1113
00:56:00,488 --> 00:56:03,608
all sorts of meanings which wouldn't

1114
00:56:03,624 --> 00:56:04,976
have occurred to me otherwise. I think

1115
00:56:04,998 --> 00:56:07,056
that's part of his art. I suspect that

1116
00:56:07,078 --> 00:56:09,104
he would have been terrified if somebody

1117
00:56:09,142 --> 00:56:10,736
had actually come along and tried to

1118
00:56:10,758 --> 00:56:13,788
time down to a clear formal,

1119
00:56:13,884 --> 00:56:16,288
naturalized mathematical formalism

1120
00:56:16,384 --> 00:56:17,636
because he wouldn't have had that sort

1121
00:56:17,658 --> 00:56:21,348
of biotic expressiveness and

1122
00:56:21,434 --> 00:56:23,828
ambiguity that, of course, is at the

1123
00:56:23,834 --> 00:56:26,356
heart of his evolutionary thinking. But

1124
00:56:26,378 --> 00:56:29,156
I think it's great that you, Andy, are

1125
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:31,176
able to say you don't understand what he

1126
00:56:31,198 --> 00:56:33,416
wrote, because I look at some of his

1127
00:56:33,438 --> 00:56:35,576
sentences. What on earth is he trying to

1128
00:56:35,598 --> 00:56:37,384
say here? And of course, but the

1129
00:56:37,422 --> 00:56:40,476
exercise of trying to make sense of

1130
00:56:40,498 --> 00:56:44,412
Edelman itself brings to the table some

1131
00:56:44,466 --> 00:56:47,752
really interesting sort of associations

1132
00:56:47,816 --> 00:56:49,836
and ideas. I'm wondering whether that

1133
00:56:49,858 --> 00:56:51,870
was part of the secret of his success,

1134
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,568
is that he resisted the temptation to be

1135
00:56:55,654 --> 00:56:57,664
crystal clear and just left that

1136
00:56:57,702 --> 00:57:00,496
mystical, magical ambiguity hanging in

1137
00:57:00,518 --> 00:57:02,848
the air for people like you and me to

1138
00:57:02,934 --> 00:57:05,876
worry about and try to resolve. I

1139
00:57:05,898 --> 00:57:07,764
suppose he's given that privilege after

1140
00:57:07,802 --> 00:57:11,268
winning a Nobel Prize. I think some of

1141
00:57:11,274 --> 00:57:13,184
us mere mortals wouldn't be afforded

1142
00:57:13,232 --> 00:57:14,580
that luxury.

1143
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:21,010
All right, I'll read a few more

1144
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,146
questions. We can have a few more

1145
00:57:22,168 --> 00:57:25,282
things. So, small questions. In the book

1146
00:57:25,336 --> 00:57:28,642
Topobiology Changming, did you draw the

1147
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:31,686
feathers, or is that your work?

1148
00:57:31,868 --> 00:57:34,134
The feather is my work, yeah. It's based

1149
00:57:34,172 --> 00:57:36,920
on my work. Awesome.

1150
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:43,834
Well, how do we take

1151
00:57:43,872 --> 00:57:47,642
things forward in science and

1152
00:57:47,696 --> 00:57:50,906
in our work here in this

1153
00:57:51,088 --> 00:57:54,300
level of the fractal with this amazing

1154
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:58,766
story and history with Edelman? But how

1155
00:57:58,788 --> 00:58:02,574
do we take our historical and our

1156
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:05,262
mentoring context? Like, how do you

1157
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:08,474
carry that forward? Is it something you

1158
00:58:08,532 --> 00:58:09,300
think about?

1159
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,996
I personally do, and I congratulate

1160
00:58:17,028 --> 00:58:18,664
myself every day on not being like

1161
00:58:18,702 --> 00:58:20,680
Edelman when it comes to mentoring.

1162
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,276
How so? I'm not going to

1163
00:58:29,298 --> 00:58:31,756
answer the how so question, but you

1164
00:58:31,778 --> 00:58:33,964
could read between the lines whether

1165
00:58:34,002 --> 00:58:35,408
that's the right thing to do or not. I

1166
00:58:35,414 --> 00:58:37,776
don't know. I don't think you could be

1167
00:58:37,798 --> 00:58:41,760
Edelman now. In 21st century.

1168
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,716
We'd be too close to all the culture

1169
00:58:46,748 --> 00:58:49,072
wars, I think, to even entertain that

1170
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:51,548
style anymore. And I suspect that's

1171
00:58:51,564 --> 00:58:54,256
quite a good thing. Although pressure

1172
00:58:54,288 --> 00:58:57,156
makes diamonds, and as Andy says, it was

1173
00:58:57,178 --> 00:58:59,316
an exciting both my colleagues have said

1174
00:58:59,338 --> 00:59:01,508
it's an exciting, informative time. It

1175
00:59:01,514 --> 00:59:03,944
was a pressure time. It was a dark time

1176
00:59:03,982 --> 00:59:07,624
for me in terms of the

1177
00:59:07,662 --> 00:59:10,968
dynamics, the systemic, the personal

1178
00:59:11,054 --> 00:59:13,956
interactions. But because it was

1179
00:59:13,998 --> 00:59:17,116
pressured, it made diamonds. And so we

1180
00:59:17,138 --> 00:59:19,308
may be throwing away the opportunity to

1181
00:59:19,314 --> 00:59:21,464
make academic diamonds and be truly

1182
00:59:21,512 --> 00:59:23,964
creative in terms of making things that

1183
00:59:24,002 --> 00:59:26,812
endure like diamonds by not having that

1184
00:59:26,866 --> 00:59:28,876
style of mentorship. But I don't think

1185
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,344
it will be even legal nowadays, to be

1186
00:59:31,382 --> 00:59:34,140
quite honest, to run a lab like Edelman

1187
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:34,880
ran.

1188
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:44,472
So, again, I think that

1189
00:59:44,526 --> 00:59:47,428
over the years, neuroscience, I don't

1190
00:59:47,444 --> 00:59:49,588
know about the rest of science, but it's

1191
00:59:49,604 --> 00:59:51,960
almost become sort of industrialized.

1192
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,644
So there's a method as

1193
00:59:55,682 --> 00:59:56,750
a young person,

1194
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,676
when you finally get your own job, you

1195
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:03,708
have to set out. And if you're at a

1196
01:00:03,714 --> 01:00:06,028
university environment, there's certain

1197
01:00:06,114 --> 01:00:08,076
boxes you have to check off. You have to

1198
01:00:08,098 --> 01:00:10,704
get a grant, you have to get a certain

1199
01:00:10,742 --> 01:00:12,016
number of papers, you have to get

1200
01:00:12,038 --> 01:00:13,744
something in science or Nature in order

1201
01:00:13,782 --> 01:00:16,976
to get promoted. There's these steps and

1202
01:00:16,998 --> 01:00:20,976
I think young people are so focused

1203
01:00:21,168 --> 01:00:24,724
on moving through those steps at

1204
01:00:24,762 --> 01:00:26,288
the point in their career where they're

1205
01:00:26,304 --> 01:00:28,100
going to be the most creative and their

1206
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,596
minds are the most flexible and they can

1207
01:00:30,618 --> 01:00:34,404
be the most productive. And I

1208
01:00:34,442 --> 01:00:37,590
see that as a shame, actually,

1209
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,060
that they're not given this opportunity

1210
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:45,116
to be a little freer in

1211
01:00:45,138 --> 01:00:47,708
the way they accomplish things. And then

1212
01:00:47,874 --> 01:00:50,076
when they do accomplish some modicum of

1213
01:00:50,098 --> 01:00:53,180
success, they rely on their past

1214
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,516
behavior. So instead of saying, okay, I

1215
01:00:55,538 --> 01:00:58,456
had to go through that in order to get

1216
01:00:58,498 --> 01:01:00,944
tenure, now that I have tenure, I'm free

1217
01:01:00,982 --> 01:01:02,544
and I can do something that I really

1218
01:01:02,582 --> 01:01:05,392
want to do. That really doesn't happen

1219
01:01:05,446 --> 01:01:09,124
because people get stuck in a rut. And I

1220
01:01:09,162 --> 01:01:12,176
see that as really holding back progress

1221
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:15,428
in neuroscience. And that was kind of

1222
01:01:15,434 --> 01:01:17,312
the cool thing about the Neuroscience

1223
01:01:17,376 --> 01:01:19,556
Institute. For better or worse, we

1224
01:01:19,578 --> 01:01:21,636
weren't allowed to go out and get our

1225
01:01:21,658 --> 01:01:23,924
own grants. We had to rely on internal

1226
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:26,792
funds. But as a result, the only person

1227
01:01:26,846 --> 01:01:28,664
we had to convince was Edelman in order

1228
01:01:28,702 --> 01:01:32,388
to get funded. And to a certain extent,

1229
01:01:32,484 --> 01:01:34,204
that allowed us to do things that were

1230
01:01:34,242 --> 01:01:37,624
really creative. In hindsight,

1231
01:01:37,672 --> 01:01:39,260
I think that was a mistake, because

1232
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:41,756
financially, that was doom for the

1233
01:01:41,778 --> 01:01:43,916
Institute. There could have been a

1234
01:01:43,938 --> 01:01:45,516
hybrid approach that would have been

1235
01:01:45,538 --> 01:01:49,164
more productive. But then again, as Karl

1236
01:01:49,212 --> 01:01:52,256
was saying, the investigators would have

1237
01:01:52,278 --> 01:01:54,048
had to have more freedom to do that,

1238
01:01:54,134 --> 01:01:56,524
and that was not exactly in the culture,

1239
01:01:56,652 --> 01:01:58,224
although I think I was an outlier

1240
01:01:58,272 --> 01:02:01,190
because I maintained a separate lab.

1241
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,724
So I was somewhat inoculated from that,

1242
01:02:06,842 --> 01:02:08,884
and that made it a lot more pleasant for

1243
01:02:08,922 --> 01:02:12,296
me. But again,

1244
01:02:12,398 --> 01:02:16,120
I see that in current neuroscience,

1245
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,708
it would be nice if people were willing

1246
01:02:18,724 --> 01:02:21,896
to take more chances and be

1247
01:02:21,918 --> 01:02:24,664
a little more creative instead of hoeing

1248
01:02:24,712 --> 01:02:26,700
to the status quo.

1249
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,140
That would be, I think, what we need

1250
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:33,550
in order to move forward.

1251
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,070
Yeah,

1252
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,804
no, I think that in terms of the

1253
01:02:44,842 --> 01:02:47,924
mentorship that Karl was talking about,

1254
01:02:48,042 --> 01:02:51,304
I mean, certainly I have seen people do

1255
01:02:51,342 --> 01:02:53,816
very well, but I also have the

1256
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:56,730
opportunity, sort of when I moved to

1257
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:00,264
University Southern California, to have

1258
01:03:00,302 --> 01:03:03,224
some interaction with Dr. Simo Benter.

1259
01:03:03,352 --> 01:03:06,268
And some of you probably know him. I

1260
01:03:06,274 --> 01:03:08,492
mean, you would see actually he is also

1261
01:03:08,546 --> 01:03:12,012
very successful, but when

1262
01:03:12,066 --> 01:03:14,832
he came out, he would always have his

1263
01:03:14,886 --> 01:03:19,040
students surrounding him very kindly.

1264
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:22,560
I think that Edelman is

1265
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:25,824
brilliant, but it's kind of the sun is

1266
01:03:25,862 --> 01:03:29,588
too bright. Sometimes people

1267
01:03:29,674 --> 01:03:32,004
have to be distilled into the, as you

1268
01:03:32,042 --> 01:03:34,736
say, academic diamond. That's

1269
01:03:34,768 --> 01:03:37,204
interesting. So we also have seen some

1270
01:03:37,242 --> 01:03:40,472
people didn't get along with him well,

1271
01:03:40,606 --> 01:03:43,272
but still, I think there are many

1272
01:03:43,326 --> 01:03:45,876
impact. He certainly have encouraged

1273
01:03:45,908 --> 01:03:48,360
many people go different directions.

1274
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,880
And in terms of the academic

1275
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:55,916
the academic future right. I think you

1276
01:03:55,938 --> 01:03:58,076
two are more talking about the

1277
01:03:58,098 --> 01:04:01,516
neurobiology side, but on the

1278
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:04,944
morphogenesis side, I would also say he

1279
01:04:04,982 --> 01:04:07,904
always emphasized the patterns thinking

1280
01:04:08,022 --> 01:04:12,620
that pattern is kind of the way nature

1281
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:15,424
either biology, non biology, they leave

1282
01:04:15,622 --> 01:04:18,544
some clue for us to figure out. And when

1283
01:04:18,582 --> 01:04:20,884
I was there, I remember every time he

1284
01:04:20,922 --> 01:04:24,176
talked about the visual columns tolson

1285
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:26,244
we saw they have worked out, he got very

1286
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:30,056
excited. And in fact, I have one of my

1287
01:04:30,238 --> 01:04:32,808
peer at that time was working on the

1288
01:04:32,814 --> 01:04:36,392
visual columns of the cat. But I think

1289
01:04:36,446 --> 01:04:39,944
that paper that work never really go out

1290
01:04:40,062 --> 01:04:42,684
to be published. But anyway, on the more

1291
01:04:42,722 --> 01:04:45,704
practical things, I work on the tissue

1292
01:04:45,752 --> 01:04:50,284
patterns and I feel that you

1293
01:04:50,322 --> 01:04:53,196
mentioned about the top of biology. And

1294
01:04:53,378 --> 01:04:56,256
again, I think he coined the term, and I

1295
01:04:56,278 --> 01:04:59,792
think the term I think it means a lot

1296
01:04:59,846 --> 01:05:03,584
because eventually my career was trying

1297
01:05:03,622 --> 01:05:07,780
to figure out these signaling molecules.

1298
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,404
Because at that time, people only talk

1299
01:05:10,442 --> 01:05:12,980
about signaling molecule. Very

1300
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:16,464
important. But the idea of topobiology

1301
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:19,844
is that you even position these simply

1302
01:05:19,892 --> 01:05:24,100
by positioning these signaling centers

1303
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:26,392
in a different topology. You can

1304
01:05:26,446 --> 01:05:31,032
actually have a lot of consequence from

1305
01:05:31,086 --> 01:05:34,524
there and the signaling center can also

1306
01:05:34,642 --> 01:05:37,400
have a different lifetime, the strength

1307
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,684
and the duration and the

1308
01:05:40,722 --> 01:05:44,332
range they can influence. So by

1309
01:05:44,386 --> 01:05:46,840
modulating he like these terms to

1310
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:49,584
modulating these signaling center, you

1311
01:05:49,622 --> 01:05:53,596
can create a lot of regional differences

1312
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:57,184
and up to now, as I say from my own take

1313
01:05:57,302 --> 01:05:59,892
bird, you look at it right feather here,

1314
01:05:59,946 --> 01:06:02,404
downing feather here, the beautiful

1315
01:06:02,522 --> 01:06:04,852
crown feather here, tail feather. But

1316
01:06:04,906 --> 01:06:07,076
these are all from the same genome. So

1317
01:06:07,098 --> 01:06:09,596
it actually is through the positioning

1318
01:06:09,648 --> 01:06:13,656
of these different signaling center in

1319
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:16,312
a different way, and you basically have

1320
01:06:16,366 --> 01:06:19,352
the same ingredient, but you can play

1321
01:06:19,406 --> 01:06:21,480
with them by topologically,

1322
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,812
temporal, and especially arrange them

1323
01:06:24,866 --> 01:06:29,660
and to create a quite complex pattern.

1324
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,516
I feel that in the tissue patterning

1325
01:06:34,568 --> 01:06:38,368
Morphogenesis side, I feel that

1326
01:06:38,534 --> 01:06:42,016
his vision is great, and I think we

1327
01:06:42,038 --> 01:06:45,472
still try to work out more about how

1328
01:06:45,526 --> 01:06:48,756
these patterns are positioned. But I

1329
01:06:48,778 --> 01:06:51,268
think that's sort of the direction in a

1330
01:06:51,274 --> 01:06:54,676
more visualized purple biology aspect we

1331
01:06:54,698 --> 01:06:55,860
can appreciate.

1332
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,776
Awesome. Well, perhaps if each of you

1333
01:07:00,798 --> 01:07:05,400
would like to give any closing thoughts.

1334
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:15,994
Yes, to echo those

1335
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:19,610
last sentiments, I think everything

1336
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,594
that Adelman said or tried to

1337
01:07:23,632 --> 01:07:25,866
say, depending whether you could

1338
01:07:25,888 --> 01:07:27,786
understand him, I think he's absolutely

1339
01:07:27,888 --> 01:07:30,186
right. And we are slowly discovering the

1340
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:31,594
truths we've just heard about top

1341
01:07:31,632 --> 01:07:33,178
ofology and the importance of patterns.

1342
01:07:33,194 --> 01:07:34,654
And of course, if you speak to somebody

1343
01:07:34,692 --> 01:07:37,022
like Mike Levin, he'd be talking about

1344
01:07:37,076 --> 01:07:38,494
exactly the same thing. He'd use words

1345
01:07:38,532 --> 01:07:40,734
like basal cognition and pattern

1346
01:07:40,782 --> 01:07:42,526
formation. But I think that we're

1347
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:45,346
talking about the same principles of

1348
01:07:45,368 --> 01:07:49,282
biological self organization and

1349
01:07:49,336 --> 01:07:51,074
edelman. I didn't know about

1350
01:07:51,112 --> 01:07:54,054
turbobiology, but I do know there are

1351
01:07:54,092 --> 01:07:56,614
other fundamental ideas that he just

1352
01:07:56,812 --> 01:07:59,014
incidental to him. I am absolutely sure.

1353
01:07:59,052 --> 01:08:01,366
I think notions of degeneracy in the

1354
01:08:01,388 --> 01:08:04,994
neurosciences and psychology, the notion

1355
01:08:05,042 --> 01:08:06,650
of many to one structure, function

1356
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,186
mappings, for example. These are

1357
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:11,242
fundamental ideas which now are taken

1358
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:14,394
almost for granted in my

1359
01:08:14,432 --> 01:08:17,386
world, but you sort of forget how much

1360
01:08:17,488 --> 01:08:20,798
he actually contributed or at least

1361
01:08:20,884 --> 01:08:23,054
laid the seeds for, and sometimes very

1362
01:08:23,092 --> 01:08:24,606
explicitly so, it should be

1363
01:08:24,628 --> 01:08:26,542
acknowledged. Although he was, as Mark

1364
01:08:26,596 --> 01:08:28,682
Rakel put it, in his typically

1365
01:08:28,746 --> 01:08:31,022
gentlemanly fashion, edelman was a very

1366
01:08:31,076 --> 01:08:34,162
complicated man. He was also very

1367
01:08:34,216 --> 01:08:36,434
brilliant and is responsible, I think,

1368
01:08:36,472 --> 01:08:38,642
for a lot of the direction of travel and

1369
01:08:38,696 --> 01:08:40,466
the intellectual growth, certainly of my

1370
01:08:40,488 --> 01:08:42,174
intellectual growth, but I would say

1371
01:08:42,232 --> 01:08:45,186
also many aspects of our academic

1372
01:08:45,218 --> 01:08:48,854
communities. Thank you,

1373
01:08:48,892 --> 01:08:54,342
Karl. Perhaps Andrew oh,

1374
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:55,880
unmute and then please continue.

1375
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:03,046
So I would know if

1376
01:09:03,068 --> 01:09:04,838
there's anyone listening out there,

1377
01:09:05,004 --> 01:09:07,206
there's something to be said about maybe

1378
01:09:07,308 --> 01:09:10,946
looking back in the ancient

1379
01:09:10,978 --> 01:09:13,078
literature that goes back quite a bit

1380
01:09:13,164 --> 01:09:16,154
and maybe seeing how some of these

1381
01:09:16,192 --> 01:09:18,746
things came about and trying to put it

1382
01:09:18,768 --> 01:09:22,014
together and see that there's this

1383
01:09:22,052 --> 01:09:24,398
iteration that constantly takes place.

1384
01:09:24,484 --> 01:09:27,066
People rediscover the same thing that's

1385
01:09:27,098 --> 01:09:30,960
been discovered multiple times and

1386
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:35,506
try to see how there is a

1387
01:09:35,528 --> 01:09:38,978
status quo in the way science works.

1388
01:09:39,064 --> 01:09:41,154
And then there's these outliers where

1389
01:09:41,192 --> 01:09:45,250
there's sort of creative bubbles that

1390
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,706
come to fore. And I think it's

1391
01:09:48,738 --> 01:09:50,566
interesting to think of Edelman and the

1392
01:09:50,588 --> 01:09:52,934
things he did and the people that were

1393
01:09:52,972 --> 01:09:55,606
associated with him in terms of sort of

1394
01:09:55,628 --> 01:09:57,814
these disruptive, they call it

1395
01:09:57,852 --> 01:10:01,674
disruptions and how

1396
01:10:01,712 --> 01:10:05,222
those disruptions may have consequence

1397
01:10:05,286 --> 01:10:07,946
many years later. It's kind of

1398
01:10:07,968 --> 01:10:09,820
interesting if you take the long view.

1399
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:14,010
So I think it's maybe worthwhile

1400
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:16,526
thinking about this once in a while and

1401
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:19,678
for young people out there to be

1402
01:10:19,764 --> 01:10:23,470
encouraged to think

1403
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:26,738
out of the normal way of doing things

1404
01:10:26,824 --> 01:10:29,314
once in a while, try to foster your

1405
01:10:29,352 --> 01:10:32,306
creativity and have the courage to go

1406
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:34,994
after some of those ideas. I think

1407
01:10:35,032 --> 01:10:37,622
that's a take home message for me

1408
01:10:37,676 --> 01:10:38,280
anyway.

1409
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:44,546
Yeah, I would say I always like

1410
01:10:44,728 --> 01:10:47,746
all sort of influenced by his idea,

1411
01:10:47,848 --> 01:10:51,234
saying that we should study the

1412
01:10:51,272 --> 01:10:53,382
important question that have a general

1413
01:10:53,516 --> 01:10:56,546
meaning. So I think that kind of ideas

1414
01:10:56,578 --> 01:10:58,114
he said that, look at the big pictures.

1415
01:10:58,162 --> 01:11:00,022
I remember when I was there, he talked

1416
01:11:00,076 --> 01:11:02,282
like that, the big pictures. So that is

1417
01:11:02,336 --> 01:11:04,426
where when he thinking about the

1418
01:11:04,448 --> 01:11:07,130
Darwinism, he would say it's not only

1419
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,346
for the species evolution, for the

1420
01:11:10,368 --> 01:11:12,666
immunoglobulin chronos selection, he

1421
01:11:12,688 --> 01:11:15,710
would push it to the brain theory.

1422
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:19,050
And for me, I work on the morphogenesis.

1423
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:22,254
I actually would come to realize that is

1424
01:11:22,292 --> 01:11:24,846
also what happened at the tissue level.

1425
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:26,974
These cells are competing with each

1426
01:11:27,012 --> 01:11:29,362
other to form that patterns and then

1427
01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:31,506
pattern is selected. When there is a

1428
01:11:31,528 --> 01:11:33,954
functional advantage, it will be

1429
01:11:33,992 --> 01:11:37,682
stabilized. I think the idea of saying

1430
01:11:37,736 --> 01:11:40,194
if we're going to do science, we ask big

1431
01:11:40,232 --> 01:11:42,578
questions, ask for the generalization,

1432
01:11:42,754 --> 01:11:45,494
I appreciate that. And certainly he is

1433
01:11:45,532 --> 01:11:47,686
like how you want to call it, right? A

1434
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:50,214
huge elephant. So we all touch him

1435
01:11:50,332 --> 01:11:52,746
through different side and have a

1436
01:11:52,768 --> 01:11:56,586
different take on that. In terms of

1437
01:11:56,608 --> 01:11:58,714
the young scientist, I also remember he

1438
01:11:58,752 --> 01:12:01,786
likes the Chinese proverb I cited to

1439
01:12:01,808 --> 01:12:05,742
him. That is to say, if you want to get

1440
01:12:05,796 --> 01:12:08,714
Tiger's son, you must get into Tiger's

1441
01:12:08,762 --> 01:12:12,400
cave. So with three did.

1442
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:18,202
Thank you all. That's a great note.

1443
01:12:18,266 --> 01:12:21,178
Really appreciate this conversation.

1444
01:12:21,354 --> 01:12:24,960
And again, thanks. Until next time.

1445
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:28,766
Okay. Thank you. Bye. Nice meeting you

1446
01:12:28,788 --> 01:12:31,240
all. Bye bye. Thank you.
