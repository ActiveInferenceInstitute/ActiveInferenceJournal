1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,559
in the world

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,200
hello and welcome everybody

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,820
it is September 19th 2020 23. we're here

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,680
at the octave inference Institute in

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,380
guest stream 58.1

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,340
and today the session will be around the

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,500
experiences of those who have worked

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,480
with Gerald Edelman

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,239
Edelman lived from 1929 to 2014 and as

10
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,180
hopefully this conversation can explore

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,160
and unpack a little bit worked in

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,879
various areas related to the brain body

13
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,200
and mind

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,860
so without further Ado I will have our

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,739
guests introduce themselves give a

16
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,379
little bit of a background on how they

17
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,239
came to be working with Professor

18
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,879
Edelman and then we have several

19
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,039
prepared questions and several other

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,520
questions so thank you all for joining

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,799
and perhaps Andrew if you'd like to

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,780
begin

23
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,060
all right so uh I'll just start a little

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,360
bit with my background I did my PhD at

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,939
University of Minnesota

26
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,479
um and then I did my postdoc at Hopkins

27
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,420
with Apostles georgopoulos and Vernon

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,740
mock Castle

29
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,100
and then I got a job in Phoenix working

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,700
in a small uh Neuroscience Institute or

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,900
neuroscience

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,900
department at a hospital

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,540
and uh I worked there for six or seven

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,600
years and my interest was working with

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,900
uh non-human primates with monkeys and

36
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,020
studying how they uh reached for

37
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,380
different objects and Drew objects

38
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,360
and then looked at the activity in

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,560
primary motor cortex neural and we

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,720
carried out uh different kinds of

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,820
analysis based on the directionality of

42
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,520
the neurons in motor cortex built

43
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,280
populations and were able to actually

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,160
look at these neural signals and see how

45
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,318
they corresponded in a pretty exact way

46
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,640
to the way the animals are moved in time

47
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,640
and space in other words trajectories

48
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,620
and um

49
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,200
after working there six or seven years I

50
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,840
was invited to come and look at this new

51
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,700
Institute that Gerald Edelman was

52
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,739
establishing in San Diego in La Jolla

53
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:34,319
and met a bunch of super interesting

54
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,140
people like Guilio tanoni and Olaf's

55
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,040
Barnes and uh really their deep

56
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,500
intellect and curiosity and creativity

57
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,760
is convinced me to move to San Diego

58
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,420
um

59
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,040
and uh

60
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,160
so I ended up moving there and so

61
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,420
Edelman

62
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,500
uh was able to build this gorgeous

63
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,879
research facility on the Torrey Pines

64
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:05,519
Cliffs basically and uh

65
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,879
it was a magnificent architecture

66
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,340
and he recruited uh a number of people

67
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,420
besides uh spawns and tanoni and so he

68
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,659
divided the group into theorists and

69
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,599
experimentalism I was an experimentalist

70
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,120
but we'd have lunch every day together

71
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,000
as a group and uh

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,480
discuss different topics and and I was

73
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,180
really exposed to a whole new way of

74
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,640
thinking about Neuroscience in terms of

75
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,680
sort of the cognitive aspects of it

76
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,379
which I still have difficulty with to

77
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,420
tell you personally because I don't even

78
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,239
know how you Define cognition and I'm

79
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,760
not sure that anybody really can or as

80
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,500
Vernon Mark Castle would say I don't

81
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,239
know the answer to that nor does anybody

82
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,159
else

83
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:59,340
maybe Karl would uh take issue with that

84
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,220
um but anyway the coolest thing about it

85
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,580
was being really exposed to a lot of

86
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,519
creative thinking and deep intellectual

87
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,459
Endeavors and I've really never

88
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,280
regretted that seven or eight years I

89
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,858
spent there I think it really helped

90
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,440
change the way my career went

91
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,079
um from being sort of a motor control

92
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,880
strict

93
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,300
sort of uh you know very careful

94
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,419
scientist to using my imagination a lot

95
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,020
more than I would have otherwise

96
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,859
so I'll leave it at that

97
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,600
awesome

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,120
Ching Ming

99
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,240
um okay yeah I think that uh speak about

100
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,699
uh my my uh Journey with Dr Edelman so I

101
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,919
was originally uh from Taiwan I

102
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,900
graduated with a medical degree in

103
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,560
Taiwan University uh in 78 but I was

104
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,479
very interested in doing basic science

105
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,479
so I applied the PHD program and got

106
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,500
into Rockefeller University and that you

107
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,020
know started to search for a laboratory

108
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,520
and certainly Dr Edelman you know with

109
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,660
his very powerful intellectual capacity

110
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,699
building

111
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,740
on the in the building you know it was a

112
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,840
ninth floor of the Bronx laboratory I

113
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,360
was very impressed so I I joined the

114
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,280
laboratory

115
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,840
um so um since 78 to 83 I was a PHP

116
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,080
student

117
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,320
and I was working on the topic called um

118
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,440
called neural cell adhesion molecule so

119
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,780
at that time element already got his

120
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,840
Nobel Prize for immunogram but he would

121
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,539
be you know usually you know in use

122
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,900
usually elegant way but to say I solved

123
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,539
the molecular recognition so he said I

124
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,300
don't want to be stay in Immunology to

125
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,360
collect more Awards he said I will work

126
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,660
out the cell recognition so in his mind

127
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,120
that the cell wholesale recognition work

128
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,360
is through a group of artificial

129
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,840
molecular interaction uh so that that's

130
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,580
how he starts to work on the cell

131
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,039
adhesion molecule and the duties house

132
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,139
actually work out the chicken cell or

133
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,539
tissue molecule so when I joined the

134
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:28,919
laboratory my PhD since was work out

135
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,800
um the first mammalian cell adhesion

136
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,479
molecule and in addition to end candle I

137
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,020
supposed to work out on these um a

138
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,419
tissue molecular media in the new law

139
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,840
cell recognition as he said he would say

140
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,940
you know I asked him oh so after all

141
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,639
what would be my PhD thesis and he was

142
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,720
the same mean

143
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,419
you know when I start to write a poem I

144
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,759
don't know how it's going to end you

145
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,860
know that's the way he would put his

146
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,380
language there so he said just figure

147
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,319
out a retinal tactile projection you

148
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,600
know so that you know I'm hard-working

149
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,539
student so I would work out on that and

150
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,780
as you know these days our so-called our

151
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,280
systems biology approach right is this

152
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,020
transcriptome single cell are in the

153
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,860
sequencing to identify a non-biased way

154
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,520
to identify molecules involved at that

155
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,800
time the so-called systems biology

156
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,319
approach was making monoclonal

157
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,940
antibodies

158
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,060
so I would be there taking out the brain

159
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,800
you know and the retina and the tech

160
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,400
talk take them and produce I produce 18

161
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,520
batch of this of the monoclonal antibody

162
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,280
against these these neuronal cell

163
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,800
membranes so I certainly have identified

164
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,699
a lot of adhesion molecule but

165
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,800
um none of them really show a very

166
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,740
distinct pattern I mean these days I

167
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,020
think we I mean the field using the

168
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,759
transcription factors was able to

169
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,580
identify some patterns but at least

170
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,139
later it's kind of all altogether but

171
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,780
um I I remember that actually no I so

172
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,180
anyway that's enough I didn't really

173
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,280
figure out the retinal sector projection

174
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,520
but that's enough for me to to graduate

175
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,780
um but

176
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,500
um

177
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,360
um at that time though I also still

178
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,000
remember you know how I actually um it

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,699
has a great impact on my professional

180
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,399
career so I was cutting chicken spinal

181
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,219
cord you know cross-section to mapping

182
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,458
resale adhesion molecules

183
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,440
so I have some feather chicken feather

184
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,039
hanging outside there and they stand

185
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,839
with this end came with the most

186
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,420
beautiful Exquisite pattern you know I

187
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,180
mean brain I data work on the feather as

188
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,300
my major research model kind of as a

189
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,000
rosetta song to understand the language

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,940
of morphogenesis but today I remember

191
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,040
how I started is that you have this

192
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,620
feather they form these branches so

193
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,540
these branches are actually originally

194
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,940
formed cells when they die to become

195
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,580
space but before they die they actually

196
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,580
light up with n camp right up with ncam

197
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,060
with the most exclusive pattern there uh

198
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,040
so you kind of say okay you're going to

199
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,500
carve out this region you light up with

200
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,899
and cam you light up with the Sonic and

201
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,540
then other signal coming to say you die

202
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,880
but before they die they light up that

203
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,040
pattern so the feather pattern is very

204
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,500
Exquisite radio Symmetry by natural

205
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,380
symmetry bilateral asymmetry so anyway

206
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,959
was very impressed by those you know

207
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,899
those findings and

208
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,740
um so that you know that I appreciate he

209
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,440
actually encouraged that he he when he

210
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,500
sees something he appreciate he he goes

211
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,080
he he encouraged it he didn't say oh

212
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,360
you're supposed to work on the brand or

213
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,420
whatever he actually like it and

214
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,100
subsequently he also you know developed

215
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,740
this idea of couple biology which he

216
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,320
would acknowledge to say it's sort of

217
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,140
based on the very Exquisite pattern we

218
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,300
found in the in the feather but of

219
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,700
course he developed it further but some

220
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,920
other time he would say if this is not

221
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,620
in feather I'm going to I am adamant I'm

222
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,500
going to get another Nobel price so I I

223
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,839
like it let him encourage that direction

224
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,620
so later when I became independent I

225
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,040
sort of say okay you know a brand is

226
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,860
wonderful but it's all like being curved

227
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,920
inside I don't figure it out but I'm not

228
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,019
that smart but I might be able to figure

229
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,959
out the further pattern formation also I

230
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,720
have a reasonable successful career I'll

231
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,120
figure out you know the Evo-Devo of

232
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,120
the feather but but as I said not just

233
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,180
the feather itself but use feather as as

234
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,420
a as a result to figure out

235
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,260
morphogenesis and uh that uh sort of I

236
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,560
think I appreciate that his encourage of

237
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,140
that and also you know as you know the

238
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,540
stem cell biology comes along and the

239
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,760
feather in a bird you know baby chicken

240
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,820
is one way adult chicken male female all

241
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,160
looks differently but they are all from

242
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,079
the same group of the same cell that's

243
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,720
my lab have demonstrate so it is the

244
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,940
so-called stem cell niche would be

245
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,240
modulated by sex hormone by age by

246
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,720
season by temperature and then help you

247
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,260
produce different feather forms to to

248
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,260
let them to adapt to the environment so

249
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,140
so I I think I I enjoy my research

250
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,959
career and it was obviously I have his

251
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,320
impact and I think he's intellectually

252
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,360
brilliant and always encouraged going

253
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,519
after

254
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,320
fundamental principles saying that if

255
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,360
you're going to work on a question ask

256
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,640
the most profounded questions and

257
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,620
approach with the most available

258
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,680
technology other technology of the day

259
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,440
you know don't waste your time on small

260
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,540
questions and and I think I have to take

261
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,620
those in so I can say up to here and we

262
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,640
can discuss more later

263
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,040
thank you awesome! Karl?

264
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,959
all right sir my name is Karl friston

265
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,380
and like my two colleagues I found my

266
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,940
stay with Jerry Edelman both

267
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,060
foundational and very very formative

268
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,160
um I was quite early in my research

269
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,140
career when I joined the Neuroscience

270
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,579
Institute

271
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,620
um having trained as a psychiatrist I

272
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,440
got into brain Imaging and at the

273
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,540
Inception of brain Imaging people were

274
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,640
for the first time discovering

275
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,380
principles of functional brain

276
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,720
organizations such as the principal of

277
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,360
functional segregation and subsequently

278
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,360
principles of integration has segregated

279
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,459
um specialized parts of the brain

280
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,800
Communicator or coordinated or are

281
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,060
integrated together and one of the key

282
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,579
theoreticians and neuroanatomists that

283
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:03,440
um

284
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,820
authored this particular interpretation

285
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,800
deployment of neuroimaging with Samir

286
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,680
Zeki and Semir Zeki for those of you

287
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,540
don't know it's it's still very active

288
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,600
uh one of the architects of the of newer

289
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,740
Aesthetics

290
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,040
um in his late retirement now but he was

291
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,019
friendly with Jerry Ackerman and Semir

292
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,740
was um famed for

293
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,000
um understanding the computational

294
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,620
anatomy of early visual cortex and

295
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,200
visual cortical hierarchies and the

296
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,880
um and I repeat the principles of

297
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,440
functional specialization and

298
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,000
integration

299
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,700
um so after a couple of years

300
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,820
um at the inception of

301
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,800
the human brain mapping using positron

302
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,440
emission tomography and establishing

303
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,339
um this um for example the color Center

304
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,139
in the in a particular part of the

305
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:58,740
visual cortex I was effectively sent to

306
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,120
New York

307
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,800
um so my period of um engagement was a

308
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,380
um a fellowship between about 1990 and

309
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,880
1992-93 so this slightly predates Andy

310
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,279
um and it covered the

311
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,440
um translocation of The neurosciences

312
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,760
Institute from the Rockefeller

313
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,160
University to

314
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,360
um La Jolla um and the uh under the

315
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,180
auspices of the Scripps so I spent you

316
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,220
know half my fellowship at the

317
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,040
Rockefeller and then subsequently

318
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,360
watched the building of the magnificent

319
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,820
neuroscientist Institute on North Tory

320
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,980
Pines Road that Andy referred to with

321
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,220
the auditorium if I remember designed by

322
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,880
imported experts in audition and music

323
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,120
and sound engineering from Sweden it was

324
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,699
a really an amazing place I I do

325
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,579
remember a couple of lunches um before I

326
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:57,720
returned to the UK to pursue my career

327
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,180
in imaging neuroscience

328
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,800
um under the auspices of the Wellcome

329
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,060
trust

330
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,980
um but only a couple because we were

331
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,620
sort of in rented accommodation from the

332
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,880
scripts on the other side of the road

333
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,820
but it was an awe-inspiring bit of

334
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,820
architecture both intellectually and

335
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,519
um practically in terms of uh the you

336
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,199
know the early days of the Neuroscience

337
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,500
Institute. And so I was sent there

338
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,160
basically uh because some music thought

339
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,779
it would be good for me to go and work

340
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:29,339
with Jerry Edelman

341
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,560
um retrospectively I now appreciate that

342
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,380
I was um sent there to replace a gentle

343
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,320
called Read Montague

344
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,440
who had been tasked with on the pure

345
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,360
theory side as opposed to the solidation

346
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,079
molecule and the wetnab um side of uh

347
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,120
Edelman's research

348
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,940
um on the pure theory side

349
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,000
um on the point of my arrival and to a

350
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,100
certain extent at the point of Read's um

351
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,800
brief uh exposure

352
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,440
um to The Neurosciences Institute the

353
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,240
theory of neural group selection was

354
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,720
becoming consolidated and in particular

355
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,139
what drove the selection of neuronal

356
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,360
groups neural Ensemble cell assemblies

357
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,480
however you want to describe them and

358
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,560
given

359
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,180
um

360
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,899
Edelman's

361
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:19,680
um

362
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,180
portion for incredibly incisive in um

363
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,680
and

364
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,560
um straightforward but very creative

365
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,959
biological thinking he thought well it's

366
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,320
obviously some kind of natural selection

367
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,760
um and therefore there must be the

368
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,060
homologue of adaptive Fitness that is

369
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,759
underwriting the scaffolding and the

370
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,139
dynamic

371
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,040
um uh structuring of connectivity or

372
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,740
connections that were definitive

373
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,440
Definitive of in the spirit of

374
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,240
functional specialization of segregation

375
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,360
but also the mediator of functional

376
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,860
integration

377
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,160
um of these neural cell neuronal groups

378
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,779
so this

379
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,699
um this became known generically as

380
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:06,660
value

381
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,359
um so Read was working on

382
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,220
value-dependent learning the plasticity

383
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,520
and the principles that underwrite which

384
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,520
synaptic connections have the right kind

385
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,439
of adaptive Fitness in their milia in

386
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,839
that context that enabled them to

387
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,599
persist and other connections went away

388
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,359
and became

389
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,620
or contributed to the you know the

390
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,919
sparse coupling of neural networks and

391
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,360
then read

392
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,080
um

393
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,240
and we can talk about the other glorious

394
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,299
stories about the the the departure of

395
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,440
Read

396
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,340
um Reid actually ended up um in a rather

397
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,799
circuitous way with uh Terry Sejnowsky at

398
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,559
the salt and subsequently then hooked up

399
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,440
with people like Peter Diane and Wolfram

400
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,080
um Schultz uh who at that time was in

401
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,600
Zurich and of course this the you know

402
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,580
the story that emerged on that was the

403
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,220
reward prediction error story

404
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,160
um that um actually ironically uh Read

405
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,559
did not but a number of all from

406
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,360
um eventually got the brain prize for

407
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,059
some decade or so later but the

408
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,100
Inception of that story was actually at

409
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,360
the Rockefeller

410
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,320
um and it was um basically uh

411
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,820
a

412
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,760
than attempt by I think Read to

413
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,380
formalize the pr the principles or that

414
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,220
must be in play to make the theory of

415
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,539
neural group

416
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,660
um selection under what were important

417
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,580
what was an important

418
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,799
um dynamic from Edelman's point of view

419
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,539
which is the notion of re-entry

420
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,240
Dynamics so very very early on

421
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,700
um he had identified the the fundamental

422
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,400
points of of recurrent connectivity and

423
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,080
re-entry as very formative in um the you

424
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,480
know the emergence of these structured

425
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,820
groups and the um associated functional

426
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,380
specialization

427
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,900
um and just (open brackets) just to point

428
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,720
out that you know you could

429
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,059
um you could claim that certainly his

430
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,280
early conversations with with

431
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,360
um

432
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,200
um

433
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,440
but people are at that time so preempted

434
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,140
stuff in computational Neuroscience that

435
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,140
we now would take as of for granted not

436
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,179
really realizing where it came from but

437
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,620
certainly his work with Vernon Mountcastle

438
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,360
I'm sure Andy will be able to speak to

439
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,240
this later on on your the importance of

440
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,640
re-entry and dynamics and oscillations

441
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,860
in the formation of these groups and

442
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,780
sort of cortical columns and the like

443
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,880
that was a sort of I think

444
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,700
um you know the monographs that they not

445
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,020
the monographs but the the the the

446
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,299
papers and the articles they wrote at

447
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:48,480
that time I think were quite visionary

448
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,700
um Stephen grossberg was also hanging

449
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,400
around a few years earlier and I think

450
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,140
you could probably claim that between

451
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,520
the two of them they invented

452
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,559
computational Neuroscience certainly

453
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,380
a la you know New York, Boston sort of

454
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,280
uh you know the East Coast kind of um uh

455
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,620
um style of of computational

456
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,960
Neuroscience personally involved with

457
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,980
something called the Neuroscience

458
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,559
Research Foundation so that they they

459
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:16,020
as I understand it and again Andy may

460
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,640
want to correct me here but this was

461
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,919
like the um the forerunner the Society

462
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,660
for Neuroscience it was a group of

463
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,340
people people

464
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,919
um and perhaps Max Cowan [[1931-2002]] is as the name

465
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,480
that comes to mind people who actually

466
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,020
invented words like Neuroscience uh

467
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,059
which wasn't a thing certainly when I

468
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,640
was applying to to you know to to my

469
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,320
undergraduate studies

470
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,480
um and trying to create institutions

471
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,700
academic institutions that would endorse

472
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,440
this notion of Neuroscience and the

473
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,940
Neuroscience Research Foundation was

474
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,280
like the old guard and then The Young

475
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,460
Turks came along and reacted against the

476
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,020
um the Old Guard the Neuroscience

477
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,179
Research Foundation to form the society

478
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,039
for neuroscience and then we all know

479
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,900
the story uh since that time it's now

480
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,299
one of the biggest Societies in in

481
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,799
Academia

482
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,140
um so it's just making the point that

483
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,500
Edelman and um you know his colleagues

484
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,960
and vicarious colleagues uh you know a

485
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,539
lot of people Oliver Sacks being one

486
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,340
Ernst Mayr being another of his

487
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,720
favorite sort of

488
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,299
um characters to talk to all of whom

489
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:19,860
would come and visit and we were

490
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,660
privileged just to listen in and

491
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,059
conversations in this very formative

492
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,559
time where some of the sort of I think

493
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,780
conceptual pillars of the way that we

494
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,580
understand

495
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,380
your Neuroscience uh

496
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,320
um uh you know in the 21st century were

497
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,860
um were first

498
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,419
articulated probably not using quite the

499
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,179
same words that that we use nowadays so

500
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:44,280
no one talks about re-entry anymore it's

501
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,020
all about recurrent neural networks or

502
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,039
sort of

503
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,440
um uh feed forward and feedback and

504
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,480
they're like but the same underlying

505
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,220
Dynamics and maths I think is absolutely

506
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,679
there anyway I was brought in to replace

507
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,659
Read Montague

508
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,360
um so that was my little contribution

509
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,419
um whilst we're in the Rockefeller

510
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,360
um

511
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,220
I made the mistake of

512
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,720
um thinking that the right way to do

513
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,980
this was to actually write down

514
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,900
equations and try and sort of naturalize

515
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,360
it in terms of in terms of mathematics

516
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,760
Edelman was a great biological thinker

517
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,380
he was not a very good mathematical

518
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,580
thinker

519
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,440
um so there was a bit of a clash there

520
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,340
so I I remember one

521
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,559
one meeting

522
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,179
um very early on when it was being

523
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,820
decided what I was going to be doing

524
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,919
um and perhaps it's useful just to say

525
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,659
the context and you know in which those

526
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:39,179
those early meetings took place so Andy

527
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,220
Owen has already mentioned Giulio Tononi

528
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,280
and Olaf Sporns they were two key uh

529
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,740
people uh Edelman's young men who

530
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,559
already already in inside you

531
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,960
um and then I replaced read

532
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,240
um and they were working really purely

533
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,559
on Theory

534
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,600
um and that theory was tested in the

535
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,860
context of uh it was a a forerunner a

536
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,960
supercomputing a hypercube that was

537
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,140
driving in my day little robots so again

538
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,840
you know Edelman was doing neurorobotics

539
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,960
in the 1990 or 1980s

540
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,760
um in exactly the same way that people

541
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,980
now in developmental neural neurobotics

542
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,140
are are still addressing exactly the

543
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,580
same questions

544
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,760
um probably with with the same kind of

545
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,860
computer infrastructure that obviously

546
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,299
upgraded

547
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,100
um so

548
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,480
um we were sitting around and later

549
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,240
amongst uh called out to take a a phone

550
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,659
call from from Germany um and there was

551
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,220
a look of horror on people's faces

552
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,200
because I'd suggested a relationship

553
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,140
between value dependent learning and the

554
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,080
risk scholar Wagner rule

555
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,020
from behavioral psychology and and as

556
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,240
soon as I you mention an equation or a

557
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,640
formula that set Ada went off and I

558
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,280
didn't know that so I didn't know I

559
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,100
pushed the road man so when everyone

560
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,140
came back in I was effectively

561
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,539
rusticated I was prevented from doing

562
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,400
any work

563
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,640
um for three months and for every day

564
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,880
afternoon and morning I had to sit in

565
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,700
the Rockefeller library and read purely

566
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,360
biological great texts and I ended up

567
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,000
having to the last one was "The Growth of

568
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,400
Biological Thought" by Ernst Mayr I had

569
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,340
to read from from page to page and when

570
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,380
I did so I become sufficiently sanitize

571
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,659
be allowed back into the workplace to

572
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:34,320
actually do some work anyway

573
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,559
um so that that was our contribution uh

574
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,480
and then when we moved to

575
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,640
um you know the whole

576
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,159
um parade of 16 wheeler tracks is

577
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,039
transportating all the kids and all the

578
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,900
um all the paperwork to

579
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,480
um to La Jolla and then relocating out

580
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,820
there settling down

581
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,039
um I brought that work to closure and

582
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,480
the interesting that was that the point

583
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,539
when Giulio well Olaf I remember in

584
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,100
saying you know

585
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,780
what he wants is basically to understand

586
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,640
the and simulate

587
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,520
um the uh the brain

588
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,280
um in a way that is

589
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,280
um draws explanatory power from the

590
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,140
architecture of the connectivity it

591
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,940
basically would say he wants to be he

592
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,460
wants to establish connectomics

593
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,520
um as as a discipline and of course you

594
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,820
know 10 years later he's Mr. Connectomics!

595
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,640
uh Guilio at that point was

596
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,340
um inventing Integra integrated

597
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,320
information Theory

598
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,080
um with a particular focus on

599
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,640
information theoretic formulations of

600
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,460
complexity and what special if you like

601
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,500
counter-intuitive behaviors do you get

602
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,720
from these biologically configured

603
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,340
connectors when you put Dynamics on

604
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,740
structure and trying to quantify that in

605
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,600
a way that ultimately

606
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,179
um transpired to be measures like Phi in

607
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:58,980
IIT

608
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,799
um so that that was a fun time as the

609
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,380
math

610
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,460
closet mathematician because I wasn't

611
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,020
allowed to to say anything about the

612
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,720
maths at the time I enjoyed that bit and

613
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,679
sort of looking

614
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:11,700
um you know

615
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,059
um being in uh at the if you like um

616
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:17,580
Ground Zero at the inception of all

617
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,100
these all these aspirations I mean which

618
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,080
eventually led to very fruitful careers

619
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,000
and then I went back

620
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,620
um to

621
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,240
um uh to the UK just had fond memories

622
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,960
and a non-fond memories uh but both of a

623
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,460
nostalgic sorts at some time

624
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,480
awesome

625
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,840
great Tales changing or Andrew anything

626
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,940
you want to add or I can go to one of

627
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,200
the questions

628
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,740
well uh just to expound a little bit on

629
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,020
what Karl was saying I don't know if you

630
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,520
can see this book okay so this was uh

631
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,340
something that came out of the

632
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,960
Neuroscience research program that was

633
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,600
sort of the uh old boys club that

634
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,159
Francis Schmidt

635
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:09,659
um started at MIT and later was the

636
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:11,960
basis for the neurosciences Institute

637
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,700
and what this was sort of the who's who

638
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,039
in Neuroscience so again if you look at

639
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,100
this book it says edited by Francis o

640
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,080
Schmidt so he was the guy that started

641
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,860
that

642
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,779
and uh so this persisted even

643
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:32,640
to the uh throughout the 2000s

644
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,960
um and uh so once or twice a year uh at

645
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,940
The neurosciences Institute they would

646
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,799
organize one of these meetings and it

647
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,740
would be a who's who of Neuroscience so

648
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,779
all the Nobel laureates and Neuroscience

649
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:48,960
all the big names would come for uh four

650
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,080
or five day meeting and talk about their

651
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,840
research and as a member of The

652
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,419
neurosciences Institute I got to sit in

653
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:01,320
and meet these people and it was a

654
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,659
phenomenal especially for with my

655
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:06,179
background because I was sort of a not

656
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:09,299
on the the mainstream of neuroscience at

657
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:12,720
that point and uh that was a really

658
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,059
fascinating so you got to meet people

659
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,039
like will Schultz and

660
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,620
and all the the big names

661
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,400
um that were there Francis Crick

662
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,880
um you know and uh but what I want to go

663
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,340
back to is this original book by Edelman

664
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,860
and my castle called the mindful brain

665
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,799
this is sort of like one of the uh

666
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,460
Bibles of early creative thinking about

667
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,100
brain function and it

668
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,520
he says the idea that of distributed

669
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,140
systems this was sort of the thing that

670
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,679
Vernon montcastle was very much into

671
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,679
um and so the to this day the way most

672
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,799
people think about brain function is

673
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,100
boxes uh where each part of the brain is

674
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,740
confined to a box and then there are

675
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,400
arrows pointed to other boxes and so we

676
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,980
get this idea that there's a circuitry

677
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,919
so you often hear

678
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,720
neuroscientists talk about circuits and

679
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,760
that kind of comes from the idea that

680
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,559
you have these boxes and you have arrows

681
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,779
and you have plus and minus signs with

682
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:21,179
the arrows and then somehow the pluses

683
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:22,980
and minuses add up and tell you what's

684
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,559
going to happen at the next box

685
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:30,120
um and that is nice because you can kind

686
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,679
of simplify things and talk about

687
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,980
causality in in very concrete terms and

688
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,360
it's great if you're an engineer because

689
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,520
you can write transfer functions about

690
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,679
defining how you can output from an

691
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:41,820
input

692
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,700
but that's not the way the brain works

693
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,120
and you know I think Kyle can attest to

694
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,899
the early days of uh MRI

695
00:29:50,899 --> 00:29:53,159
studies where everybody was doing

696
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,200
pseudo-colored

697
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,020
um

698
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,279
representations of these different areas

699
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,220
to see which area would light up in a

700
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,340
particular task as if each area had a

701
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,919
specific job and could be assigned to a

702
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,179
specific task

703
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:10,980
and

704
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,960
so Neuroscience in general still

705
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,659
suffering from that point of view and

706
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:19,260
it's only become a little bit more clear

707
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,659
as computational science has matured in

708
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:24,240
the last five or ten years especially

709
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,779
with uh you know adaptation of

710
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:29,880
artificial neural networks to the

711
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,960
mainstream

712
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,220
that you know we can start to explore

713
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,500
more biological meaningful ways of brain

714
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,399
function

715
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,340
and you know Verner mock Castle

716
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,940
recognized that you know as a sort of

717
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,059
the uh I would say the founder of

718
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:50,820
systems Neuroscience modern systems

719
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,279
neuroscience

720
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:56,279
and Edelman talked about that a little

721
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,799
bit you know this group Theory and some

722
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,039
of the things that oleff has started

723
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:05,340
um you know with graph Theory

724
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,039
still sort of based on strict anatomical

725
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,299
connectivity

726
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:12,059
and you know if you read like Olaf's

727
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:15,179
latest review where the field is

728
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:17,159
starting to progress away from that

729
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:20,539
constraint of anatomical connectivity

730
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:22,919
we're starting to get more toward the

731
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:25,860
idea of truly distributed systems and to

732
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,860
me that that's super exciting but you

733
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,260
can look back to this book you know from

734
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,320
the 70s and see that the seed was

735
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,279
planted way back then and see how you

736
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,860
know almost 50 years later now is

737
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,020
finally starting to evolve into

738
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,360
something that's becoming more

739
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,240
mainstream and if you sort of look at

740
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,340
the evolution of Neuroscience

741
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,159
I think if you project ahead to the next

742
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:56,000
10 or 20 years this is going to be

743
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,039
really the fundamental change in the way

744
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,760
we think about neural function and uh

745
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,399
I'm super excited about that and you

746
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:09,059
look and sort of back in history to see

747
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:12,000
how that's evolved and uh

748
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,039
I don't know I I think there's a

749
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,960
something very attractive about thinking

750
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,720
about things that way

751
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,600
um yeah okay yeah okay I'll add

752
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,580
something I think talking about the you

753
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,279
know elements uh Circle so so the

754
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,500
ingredients about you know seeing things

755
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,380
through I I I don't know in the neural

756
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,340
biology field you people still sort of

757
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,279
seeing the neurology is an idea it's

758
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,620
still there right yeah

759
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,320
so that was the time when I was uh with

760
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,720
him in Rockefeller University uh he

761
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,940
would talk things like that you know uh

762
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,059
Darwinism for evolution species and he

763
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:53,899
he saws that in immunological

764
00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:57,659
selection so he applied to the to this

765
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:00,720
neurota with some idea uh but I have to

766
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,760
say you know subsequently I actually my

767
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,039
career is mainly in University Southern

768
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,679
California and uh working on this

769
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,020
morphogenesis pattern for me tissue

770
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:13,380
pattern formation and in our field in a

771
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,600
sort of more bench work you know aspect

772
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,640
of element you know this direction not

773
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,120
the neural biology Direction but in the

774
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,760
field there were people originally more

775
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,159
talking about the stem cells are

776
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,019
predetermined and then they go listen

777
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:29,779
yes

778
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:32,700
but we using the skin as a model

779
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,220
actually you know I start to write these

780
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,559
things kind of a Darwinism within the

781
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,260
skin I mean basically is that there is

782
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,100
no preset forever stem cells if you wipe

783
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,500
out these stem cells other cells are

784
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,500
waiting there to take over the space so

785
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,779
there is even during development and

786
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,600
during regeneration to make the tissue

787
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,260
patterning process robust there is a

788
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,200
small so-called Darwinism competition

789
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,200
going on in there and the less is sort

790
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,679
of also influencing my our our work in

791
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,500
morphogenesis these days and I think

792
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,460
that's kind of the impact of him on this

793
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,199
aspect as well yeah

794
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:21,060
wow

795
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,820
all right I'll read a question this was

796
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,440
from Dave Douglas

797
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,119
Dave wrote

798
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,639
we know that Professor Edelman use deep

799
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,418
analogies in exploring new subjects as

800
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:35,280
in his leveraging his knowledge of

801
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,800
immunology and organismal development to

802
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,980
probe conceptualization and learning did

803
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,500
he ever work specifically on metaphor

804
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,099
and analogy as such for example did he

805
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:49,080
leverage his experience of music and

806
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,980
poetry to dig out scientific facts while

807
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,899
separating fertile from sterile

808
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:57,799
analogies

809
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,180
an answer or just what that makes you

810
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,779
think of

811
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,599
it makes me think of something which

812
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,060
Edelman used to call me which I am an

813
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,940
intellectual Thug so I'm sure that there

814
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,240
it's the great answer to that excellent

815
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,660
question and it does speak to Edelman's

816
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,720
skills and interests as a violinist

817
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,140
um I do remember that BBC Horizon came

818
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,460
to

819
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,760
um do a profile on him and his ideas and

820
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,940
it was uh prefaced with uh I think shots

821
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,060
of of him playing the violin you know to

822
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,820
concert standard uh but I have

823
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,040
absolutely no idea whether he used those

824
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,700
that that sort of part of his life to uh

825
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,240
um to um take things Beyond a metaphor

826
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,000
so as an intellectual Thug

827
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,220
um I'm gonna hand over to my two

828
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,040
colleagues whether they can give a more

829
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,700
elegant answer

830
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,240
or or anything in that area of the Arts

831
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,660
and you brought up poetry

832
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,839
anything in the Arts and Sciences

833
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,099
well I

834
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:26,820
I'm no no biologist if I just say that

835
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,820
from my side of the interaction you know

836
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,760
I mean he really tried to to merge our

837
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,520
science and art and he would think you

838
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,940
know a real science would be beautiful

839
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,160
and I and that's the way I think when I

840
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,500
learned as I mentioned you know uh when

841
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,839
I say oh I I was expecting a more

842
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,680
clear-cut CC's idea but he would say you

843
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,020
know Ming is like writing a poetry he

844
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,820
said that when I start I don't know

845
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,640
where it's going to end uh you know it's

846
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,240
like some artists when you ask them uh

847
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,760
how do you create this painting I I try

848
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,980
to ask this question to some of my

849
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,560
friends who are artists and they say

850
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,560
they say they do not they do not have a

851
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,960
clear blueprint of how that painting

852
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,940
what it looks like they have an idea

853
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,220
it's kind of floating in the sky and

854
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,500
they try to grab it down so they paint

855
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,560
on the way and then try to to make it

856
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,839
into a painting or I have a friend who

857
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:27,300
appointed I ask them this they say they

858
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,700
go up the world to make them come in

859
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,099
town and I kind of feel Adam I thought

860
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:34,560
about three to the the scientific idea

861
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,560
idea like that you know that's the you

862
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,980
know this is my superficial you know

863
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,020
an interaction yeah

864
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,560
uh yeah just some experience

865
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,480
so I don't have a

866
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,900
correct reply to that but I you know in

867
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,280
general

868
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,560
um I think there's the idea of

869
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,700
creativity

870
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,400
that that he brought to the Forefront

871
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,339
and then also you know with that

872
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,020
creativity there you have to have a

873
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,460
certain amount of Courage

874
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,900
to

875
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,619
move out of the sort of mainstream right

876
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:12,660
so if you have an idea

877
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,940
and you have to have a certain amount of

878
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,079
courage to put that forward uh

879
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,540
that if that idea is creative and out of

880
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,560
the ordinary and I think artists and

881
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,640
sort of uh

882
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,820
really great scientists have that

883
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,540
in common

884
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,500
maybe to that Nexus of creativity and

885
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,020
career development and courage

886
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,800
for you or just in the environment how

887
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,900
did his mentoring

888
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:51,920
help bring out these threats in people

889
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,140
for better and for worse I I think Karl

890
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,300
will could have tested that I I have a

891
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,420
hard time viewing Edelman as a as a

892
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,140
feel-good mentor

893
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,240
I think he would throw ideas out there

894
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,440
he could be pretty aggressive and uh

895
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,520
I would say frightening to young people

896
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,220
um so I I wouldn't

897
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,420
I wouldn't cast Edelman's behavior as

898
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,000
sort of the typical mentor

899
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,660
um but uh again I think the environment

900
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,140
that he created was someplace that was a

901
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,320
really special and reflected that kind

902
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,980
of courageous creativity

903
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,740
um and I really appreciate that now

904
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,079
you know just to endorse that notion of

905
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,660
courageous creativity

906
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,740
um I think it's a really nice

907
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,520
observation I've often reflected on

908
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,560
whether

909
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,660
um let's take for example

910
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:01,500
um Guilio and Olaf and I think you could

911
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,540
probably apply it to me and Andy and a

912
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,640
number of other people uh as well but if

913
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,579
we just take take Guilio and Olaf who

914
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:11,040
both become world leaders thought

915
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,680
leaders in their own particular field

916
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,420
having brought something new to the

917
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,560
table

918
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,839
um and in some in some instances in you

919
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:21,180
know more than one area so Guilio turnone

920
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,500
in terms of

921
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,420
um sleep research and synaptic

922
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,160
homeostasis

923
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,920
um in terms of his work in Consciousness

924
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,859
studies integrated information Theory

925
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:34,680
um Olaf in terms of structural and

926
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,700
function and connectomics I mean is the

927
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,760
is it that Edelman had a good eye for

928
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,320
bright young men

929
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,960
or is it that bright young men learned

930
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,180
how to do this that this was the way to

931
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,599
be courageous and so it's an adversarial

932
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,180
in that courage to be creative and to

933
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,760
pursue what you have created

934
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,099
um in a slightly adversarial or at least

935
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:02,400
sort of defensive way I I I'm not I I

936
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,920
don't know but what I do know is

937
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,520
um there were certainly a culture that

938
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,720
was

939
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,300
um established that would allow those

940
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,160
kinds of

941
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,200
um skills to be developed and you know

942
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,839
and is refer to them slightly obliquely

943
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,660
and it was uh you know it was a dark

944
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,420
culture it was uh and it has to be said

945
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,760
it was a very homophilic culture there

946
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,400
were no women allowed in this culture so

947
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,780
the you know in my time they

948
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,140
um the culture was really one man and

949
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,140
adoring young men

950
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,960
um and you had to

951
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,160
um repeatedly affirm that adoration and

952
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,960
part of that was

953
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,839
um really useful and really enjoyable

954
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,359
um and has already mentioned the uh the

955
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:57,540
lunches that exactly the same regime

956
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,520
um you know characterized my stay there

957
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,920
was a you know a rigorous routine where

958
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,140
all the young men would go off to the

959
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,720
New York Cafe we'd have onion rings and

960
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,140
and burgers uh and a remembrance wax

961
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,839
lyrical and

962
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,099
perhaps this is not art and creativity

963
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,020
but it was he was

964
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,140
um he was artistic in his joke telling

965
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,780
so he'd always have a new joke every

966
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,200
every lunch time in a New York uh diner

967
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,020
and that was a routine and it was just

968
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,480
pure theater day after day after day

969
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,599
incredible energy but it was theater the

970
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,700
young men were the audience

971
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,740
um and we basically

972
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,640
um

973
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,640
I think were

974
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,520
um dancing to you know his orchestration.

975
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,859
he was the conductor and he was the

976
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,240
director.

977
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,480
if that culture if that it's possible

978
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,820
that that culture did actually instill

979
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,220
in all of us and particularly Olaf and

980
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,420
Guilio

981
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,240
um the notion that to make it to make a

982
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,980
difference and to be true to one's

983
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,960
convictions you really have to sort of

984
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,660
fight for and be autonomously pursue

985
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,520
what you want to do. and it is it's

986
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,859
interesting that the the style in which

987
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:13,079
both Guilio and Olaf have pursued their

988
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:16,800
their scientific ideology and ideas and

989
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,040
creativity is very much is it's slightly

990
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,200
lonesome you know the

991
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,160
um with the exception of Guilio's work um

992
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,060
in um in the microbiology of sleep

993
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,339
um the theoretical contributions are

994
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:33,900
very sort of you know associated with

995
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,780
them personally and to a certain extent

996
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,720
with me. and um you know what one could

997
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,940
argue is

998
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,300
um then you know the um the mathematical

999
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,980
version of value-dependent learning

1000
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,900
which would um be the free energy

1001
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,780
principle all of these things have the

1002
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,440
same flavor as neural Darwinism (or as some

1003
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,359
people used to call it neural neural

1004
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,339
Edelmanism).

1005
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:01,980
um and so I I often asked that question

1006
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,560
was it what was this the skill of

1007
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,300
Edelman in choosing people who are going

1008
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,300
to make a difference or did he basically

1009
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,819
provide a culture in which it gave

1010
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:15,119
people the the tools or the

1011
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,099
um the motivation or the confidence that

1012
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:18,660
you can make a difference because you

1013
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,000
saw you saw him make a difference I

1014
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,240
don't know.

1015
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,980
um yeah I think most of you actually you

1016
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,660
know said something I I share the

1017
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,780
experience definitely he set up a right

1018
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,420
environment. uh but just like when we do

1019
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,180
stem cell stem cell and it's niche you

1020
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,680
need the interaction you need a

1021
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,200
conversation between epithelia and the

1022
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,839
messenger cells or in the brain I heard

1023
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:44,880
that it's more like interaction between

1024
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,880
pneumonal cells and we are sales so a

1025
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,400
successful interaction with the leader

1026
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,579
whatever the process to move forward and

1027
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:56,460
but not every process would be would be

1028
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,700
would be successful so as as I said I

1029
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,200
also you know like the way Kyle

1030
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,040
mentioned about the animals is

1031
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,200
is the conductor he actually said that

1032
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,839
in our lab meeting at the time he said I

1033
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,880
and Adam and I am the conductor you know

1034
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,339
I you know you guys you know it's my my

1035
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:17,579
symphony players and uh and you you you

1036
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:19,980
pray together you can make a good music

1037
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,720
and

1038
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,119
um but it's also true uh not every

1039
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:26,880
interaction works because I was with him

1040
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,300
for almost eight years or so uh not

1041
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,099
every person worked let's put that away

1042
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:34,920
that is the fact that uh so some work

1043
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,319
some don't right? so I think people are

1044
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:40,260
given that opportunity and uh as Andrew

1045
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,780
said it's a good outstanding environment.

1046
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:46,319
so so you pick up the the idea from

1047
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,740
adamant you develop yourself and some of

1048
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,780
them you know or what you can tell call

1049
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,480
it the element level

1050
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,900
and the medicine then we we success in a

1051
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,700
certain way or not.

1052
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,680
um but I think it's it's an exciting

1053
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,579
environment. uh I would put it put it way

1054
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:09,480
is is most you know he inspires you he

1055
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,660
gives you a sort of an exciting

1056
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,420
environment to evolve but not everyone

1057
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,480
is so he can choose everyone to be

1058
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,300
successful. no it's not like that but he

1059
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,819
did give you that opportunity to to to

1060
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:26,400
be successful and to to pick up

1061
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,440
something. and he also give you that

1062
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,960
courage to do it as I mentioned. you know

1063
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,700
people would normally think you know

1064
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,920
using the feather as a model is kind of

1065
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,339
very very high risk but but he's he has

1066
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:41,160
that encouragement and I I do that and I

1067
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,579
I feel I really using feather as a

1068
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:46,619
rosetta song I have learned something

1069
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:49,380
for the morphogenesis uh pattern

1070
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,500
formation field yeah. so I appreciate him

1071
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,460
on that yeah.

1072
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:01,440
Andrew or I can ask another question

1073
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,660
uh I really don't have anything to add

1074
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,480
right now.

1075
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,220
thank you though.

1076
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,119
it's really amazing it's

1077
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:15,240
it's such a different world and the

1078
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,180
environment of learning and of carrying

1079
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,280
out science is so

1080
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,859
different. so

1081
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:25,020
personally I really appreciate just even

1082
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,300
a window into

1083
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,060
settings that are

1084
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,720
elsewhere and in a different time. so

1085
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,119
thank you for

1086
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,700
all of this. all right I'll ask another

1087
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,078
question from Dave

1088
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,819
Professor Edelman was reputed to be

1089
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:47,040
skeptical about the risk of abusing

1090
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,319
mathematical or computer models in

1091
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:51,180
creating theories of neural functioning

1092
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,220
cognition and consciousness. some

1093
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,260
reviewers went so far as to mock him in

1094
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,359
print for using computers as research

1095
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:58,800
tools

1096
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,319
but he worked with Tononi

1097
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:02,940
on the foundations of integrated

1098
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,099
information Theory an extremely math

1099
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:06,960
heavy theory that sometimes explained

1100
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,720
using Computing imagery. did Edelman

1101
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,420
change his attitude towards the role of

1102
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,060
math or of computing paradigms and

1103
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,740
thinking about the mind?

1104
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,140
or did he simply start trusting his

1105
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,940
colleagues to think computationally

1106
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,119
without falling into rabbit holes dug by

1107
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:27,440
Von Neumann and Turing?

1108
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:33,480
or how did you see the role of math and

1109
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,540
computers in Edelman's thinking and

1110
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,660
research develop over a period where

1111
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,700
they were also undergoing such rapid

1112
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,339
developments more broadly?

1113
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,800
so I I'm pretty sure that Edelman

1114
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,740
respected mathematics and computational

1115
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,740
approaches to neuroscience uh he

1116
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,900
certainly there certainly were a lot of

1117
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,180
theory fellows that were computationally

1118
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:01,079
savvy uh while I was at the Institute.

1119
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:05,280
um and uh so for instance uh

1120
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,400
Karl mentioned these uh robots that were

1121
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,940
used to sort of explore and learn sort

1122
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,859
of the beginning I guess of embodied

1123
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:16,440
cognition Karl you would say

1124
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,540
um where they explore the environment

1125
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,520
and learn and then from that learning

1126
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,819
they they build internal models. so that

1127
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:26,160
is a I would say and that was Olaf's

1128
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,500
bailiwick.

1129
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,119
I would say that that was highly

1130
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:32,160
computational

1131
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,859
um and certainly a major thrust in

1132
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:36,180
Edelman's

1133
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:39,060
but emphasis and what he wanted to do at

1134
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,579
The Institute and there were a number of

1135
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:45,240
other things I think the integrated

1136
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:45,839
um

1137
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,940
part that uh

1138
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,980
Guilio did I think that was almost all

1139
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,420
Guilio's

1140
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,579
work along with some of the other

1141
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:57,839
computational fellows. uh so uh

1142
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:00,000
you know I think Edelman wanted to be

1143
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,520
part of that but that really

1144
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:06,480
I think was mostly Guilio's and uh

1145
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,940
I I think you know as part of the

1146
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,400
culture. uh Edelman managed to get his

1147
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,440
name on Guilio's paper we used to laugh

1148
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,599
about that quite a bit

1149
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,180
um but you know again I I would say that

1150
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:22,339
was 99% Guilio's work.

1151
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:26,720
yeah I I can conquer because I was there

1152
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,700
when the work was actually done there

1153
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:34,260
was a um there was a sort of um period I

1154
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,240
can't remember there was some hypothesis

1155
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,980
that pertained to a core a Dynamical

1156
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,079
Core as

1157
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:40,980
um

1158
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,740
um sort of

1159
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,780
oppressions are necessary for some kind

1160
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,720
of Consciousness. and I think Edelman was

1161
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,880
comfortable with this sort of intuitive

1162
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,800
notion of a dynamic core but when you

1163
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,920
when it became articulated in terms of

1164
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,800
information theory he

1165
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,380
um started I he would I think

1166
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,900
um even if he didn't say so out loud he

1167
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,880
would have responded as he responded to

1168
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,059
me with oh you've got mathematosis! so

1169
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:12,180
hey this is this is another of his sort

1170
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:12,900
of

1171
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:16,319
um ways of dealing with people who had a

1172
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,359
tendency to over mathematicalize and

1173
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:20,760
oversimplify as a physicist would. you

1174
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,980
know they're reducing a horse to a point

1175
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,599
and then writing down differential

1176
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:26,579
equations he was very allergic to that

1177
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:28,800
you know he didn't like that and would

1178
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,000
call that

1179
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,520
um an instance of mathematosis I think

1180
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,020
that's very distinct though from what

1181
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,940
Andy was just talking about which is the

1182
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:38,760
commitment to physically realized

1183
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,700
embodied computation

1184
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,220
um and you know I think it's a really

1185
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,900
well absurd point that you know that

1186
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,480
this was embodied cognition

1187
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,599
um Circa 1980, 1990. so he was quite

1188
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,780
Visionary in um I think sort of put

1189
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,960
testing out ideas in in physical and

1190
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,420
realized systems you couldn't just hand

1191
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,280
away with maths. you had to show it

1192
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,819
worked. this idea worked in a real um in

1193
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:07,380
a real setting and at that time they

1194
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,339
were

1195
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:10,559
um and you know

1196
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,800
um you know the Darwin series and you

1197
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,079
know to the extent that um you know I

1198
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,720
for example had to spend six months

1199
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,180
learning to paralyze [parallelize?] C

1200
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,819
um in order to program the robot so you

1201
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:25,559
know it wasn't he was frightened of new

1202
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,680
technology or computer science I think

1203
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,859
he didn't like trivializing things

1204
00:52:31,859 --> 00:52:34,740
um your ala physicist with with

1205
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,559
mathematics but you would certainly

1206
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:38,280
um

1207
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,619
um be fully committed to the notion that

1208
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:44,640
you that the computation is at the heart

1209
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,819
of the kind of dynamics that he wanted

1210
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:49,980
to understand that and and underwrote

1211
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,900
theory. and indeed I think that you know

1212
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,180
the theory of neural group selection

1213
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,740
um speaks that he wanted to see it

1214
00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:00,180
realized uh you know realized in in a

1215
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,099
robot. so

1216
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:03,599
um but yeah I think Andy is absolutely

1217
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,359
right at the point when uh Guilio sort of

1218
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:07,740
just basically

1219
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:11,220
um we went straight from the axioms to

1220
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,579
Consciousness and Phi with equations I I

1221
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:16,380
think that was the time that Guilio had

1222
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,280
to

1223
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,000
um

1224
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,400
had to leave the family basically

1225
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,619
um and and duly[?] did so.

1226
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:24,000
um

1227
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,700
brother extrapolated that a little bit

1228
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,099
more I think you know when I read

1229
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:31,619
Edelman's books and and some of his

1230
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:32,700
papers

1231
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,059
I don't understand his words okay and

1232
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:37,980
you know his phrases and his

1233
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,900
descriptions you know a lot of things

1234
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,300
don't make sense if he had written those

1235
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,400
out or someone had written those out as

1236
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,099
equations okay what you know that's the

1237
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,660
nice thing about equations once you see

1238
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:51,000
the equation you know you don't have to

1239
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,040
worry about the word so much uh you know

1240
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,920
things become pretty clear and I think

1241
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,920
you know looking back if he'd been able

1242
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,619
to do that I think his ideas

1243
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:03,440
first of all would have been

1244
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,300
crystallized in his own mind better and

1245
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:09,140
second of all would have been able to be

1246
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:11,819
others would have understood them more

1247
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:15,300
clearly. and I think that's

1248
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:19,079
really important. if you have for me okay

1249
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:21,480
maybe with an engineering background or

1250
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,240
something you know if you have a model

1251
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,760
or if you have an idea if you can write

1252
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,900
that out explicitly with an equation it

1253
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,059
really clarifies things it crystallize

1254
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:35,520
this thing. and that was the thing that I

1255
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,440
liked about Guilio's work because again

1256
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,020
this word of "Consciousness" you know it's

1257
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,300
like nobody knows what that really means

1258
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,420
but at least Guilio had

1259
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,940
a form of equations right where he was

1260
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,220
talking about information Theory and in

1261
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,020
a way you know you could have a a

1262
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:58,559
cluster where information was internal

1263
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,020
versus the external information and say

1264
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,700
that okay if you have to have

1265
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,920
Consciousness here it is! and he could

1266
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,880
describe that with a concrete equation. I

1267
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,119
mean that's a step forward. and again I

1268
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:14,339
always say as a someone that that

1269
00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:16,500
records neurons in the brain all the

1270
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,240
time

1271
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,520
if I wanted to find Consciousness how

1272
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,920
would I know it if I found it right? I

1273
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,839
mean if I had an equation maybe I could

1274
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:27,119
do it but you know just the way it's

1275
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,520
defined right now I mean who knows I

1276
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,900
could have already discovered it I

1277
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:36,180
wouldn't know! so uh I I think that's a

1278
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,720
an interesting point anyway.

1279
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,000
Karl: I can't resist just follow up on that

1280
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,180
because um especially evident for me in

1281
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,040
"The Remembered Present" this this notion

1282
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,260
that his words don't actually make any

1283
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,200
sense I think that's pure pure poetry

1284
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,240
and pure Brilliance because what I tend

1285
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,940
to find myself doing is writing reading

1286
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,579
the meaning into his ambiguous sentences

1287
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:01,980
and finding all sorts of

1288
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,260
um meanings which wouldn't have occurred

1289
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,640
to me otherwise I think that's part of

1290
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,619
his art. I suspect that he would have

1291
00:56:07,619 --> 00:56:09,660
been terrified if somebody had actually

1292
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,420
come along and tried to time down to a

1293
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:15,660
clear formal naturalized mathematical

1294
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,400
formalism because he wouldn't have had

1295
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,559
that sort of

1296
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,980
biotic expressiveness and ambiguity that

1297
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,319
of course is at the heart of uh of his

1298
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:26,880
evolutionary thinking. and I think it's

1299
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,800
it you know it's it's great that you

1300
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,540
Andy are able to say you don't

1301
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,700
understand what he wrote. Because I I

1302
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,500
look at some of his sentences and what

1303
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,720
the Earth is he trying to say here and

1304
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,760
of course but the exercise

1305
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,220
of trying to make sense of Edelmann

1306
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:44,640
itself brings to the table uh some

1307
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,559
really interesting

1308
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,140
um sort of associations and ideas. I I'm

1309
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,579
wondering whether that was part of the

1310
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:52,319
secret of his success

1311
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:55,800
is that he resisted the temptation to be

1312
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,839
crystal clear and just left that

1313
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:00,660
mystical magical ambiguity hanging in

1314
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,059
the air for people like you and me to to

1315
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:06,000
worry about and try to resolve.

1316
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,859
Andy:  I I suppose he's given their privilege after

1317
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:11,339
winning a Nobel Prize I I think uh some

1318
00:57:11,339 --> 00:57:13,380
of us mere mortals wouldn't be afforded

1319
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,280
that uh luxury

1320
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:21,359
all right I'll read a few more questions

1321
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,579
we have a few more things so small

1322
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:24,720
questions

1323
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,119
um in the book "Topobiology," Changming,

1324
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,660
did you draw the feathers or is that

1325
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,220
your work

1326
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,800
feather is my work yeah it's based on my

1327
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,180
work yeah.

1328
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:38,040
awesome

1329
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,359
um

1330
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:40,800
well

1331
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,920
how do we

1332
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:48,000
take things forward in science and in

1333
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,780
our work here in this level of

1334
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:56,040
diffractal with this amazing story and

1335
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:00,420
history with Edelman but how do we

1336
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,500
take our historical and our mentoring

1337
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,720
context? like how do you carry that

1338
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,000
forward is it something you think about?

1339
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,160
Karl: I personally do, and I congratulate

1340
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,780
myself every day on not being like

1341
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,460
Edelman when it comes to mentoring.

1342
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:28,460
how so?

1343
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,119
I'm not going to answer the "how so?"

1344
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:32,760
question but you can read between the

1345
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,980
lines! whether that's the right thing to

1346
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,140
do or not I don't know I don't think I

1347
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,240
don't think you could be Edelman now

1348
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:43,140
um you know in 21st century uh with you

1349
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:46,260
know um you know we'll be too close to

1350
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,299
all the culture wars I think to even

1351
00:58:48,299 --> 00:58:51,119
entertain that style anymore and I

1352
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,440
suspect that's quite a good thing

1353
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,660
although you know pressure makes

1354
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,980
diamonds.

1355
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:57,960
um and as Andy says it was an exciting

1356
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,180
one both my colleagues have said it's an

1357
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,920
exciting informative time it was a

1358
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,280
pressure time it was a dark time for me

1359
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,380
um you know in terms of the system the

1360
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,099
the dynamics of the systemic the the

1361
00:59:10,099 --> 00:59:12,780
personal interactions.

1362
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:15,299
um but because it was pressured it made

1363
00:59:15,299 --> 00:59:17,940
diamonds. and and so we may be throwing

1364
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,220
away the opportunity to make academic

1365
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,099
diamonds and be truly creative in terms

1366
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:24,960
of making things that endure like

1367
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,480
diamonds by not having that style of

1368
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,460
mentorship. but I'd don't think it would

1369
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,799
be even legal nowadays to be quite

1370
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:36,619
honest to run a lab like Edelman ran!

1371
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:43,819
Andy: So again I mean I I think

1372
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:47,520
that over the years Neuroscience yeah I

1373
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,140
don't know about the rest of science but

1374
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,900
it's almost become sort of

1375
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:54,720
industrialized. so there's a method you

1376
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,960
know you as a young person

1377
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,440
um you when you finally get your own job

1378
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,020
you have to set out and if you're at a

1379
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,180
university environment there's certain

1380
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,280
boxes you have to check off. you have to

1381
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,680
get a grant you know you have to get

1382
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,180
certain number of papers you have to get

1383
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:13,920
something in "science" or "nature" in order

1384
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,020
to get promoted you know there's there's

1385
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:19,380
these steps. and I think young people are

1386
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:24,420
so focused on moving through those steps

1387
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,220
at the point in their career where

1388
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,660
they're going to be the most creative

1389
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,640
and their minds are the most flexible

1390
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:33,119
and they can be the most productive and

1391
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,839
you know I see that as as a shame

1392
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:40,500
actually that that they're not given

1393
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:45,119
this opportunity to be a little Freer in

1394
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,579
the way they accomplish things and then

1395
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:49,559
you know when they do accomplish a

1396
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:51,480
modicum of success

1397
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,240
they rely on their past Behavior so

1398
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,280
instead of saying okay I had to go

1399
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,280
through that in order to get tenure now

1400
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,680
that I have tenure I'm free and I can do

1401
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,500
something that I really want to do that

1402
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,299
really doesn't happen because people get

1403
01:01:06,299 --> 01:01:08,819
stuck in a rut and uh

1404
01:01:08,819 --> 01:01:11,400
I see that as really holding back uh

1405
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,299
progress in neuroscience and that was

1406
01:01:15,299 --> 01:01:16,799
kind of the cool thing about the

1407
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,200
Neuroscience Institute for better or

1408
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,420
worse we weren't allowed to go out and

1409
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,520
get our own grants we had to rely on

1410
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,579
internal funds but as a result the only

1411
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:28,680
person we had to convince was Edelman in

1412
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:32,160
order to get funded and uh to a certain

1413
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,319
extent that allowed us to do things that

1414
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,780
were really creative

1415
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,940
in hindsight I think that was a mistake

1416
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:41,760
because financially that was a doom for

1417
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,099
The Institute there could have been a

1418
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:45,599
hybrid approach that would have been

1419
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,960
more productive and but then again uh as

1420
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,940
Karl was saying the uh

1421
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,859
the investigators would have had to have

1422
01:01:52,859 --> 01:01:55,200
more freedom to do that and that was not

1423
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,420
exactly in the culture although I think

1424
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,059
I was an outlier because I maintained a

1425
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:02,339
separate lab

1426
01:02:02,339 --> 01:02:06,660
so I I was somewhat inoculated from that

1427
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:09,059
and that made it a lot more pleasant for

1428
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,200
me

1429
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,280
um but uh again I see that that you know

1430
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,619
in current neuroscience

1431
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:18,839
it would be nice if people were willing

1432
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:20,940
to take more chances

1433
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:24,059
um and be a little more creative instead

1434
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:28,099
of hoeing to the status quo

1435
01:02:28,099 --> 01:02:32,220
that would be uh I think uh what we need

1436
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:35,359
in order to move forward

1437
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:38,819
yeah

1438
01:02:38,819 --> 01:02:39,660
um

1439
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:42,540
that um

1440
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:45,119
no I I think that in terms of the

1441
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,400
mentorship hunted you know car was

1442
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,920
talking about I mean certainly I I have

1443
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,440
seen people you know do very well but

1444
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,079
but I also have the opportunity you know

1445
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:56,880
sort of when I moved to Southern

1446
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,260
California University Southern

1447
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:01,559
California to uh have some interaction

1448
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:04,740
with the Dr Seymour Benson and uh some

1449
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,660
of you might probably know him I mean

1450
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:09,000
you would see actually he is also very

1451
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,599
successful but but he he when he came

1452
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:15,420
out he would always have his students

1453
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:18,119
around surrounding him you know very

1454
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:21,059
very kindly uh I think that you know

1455
01:03:21,059 --> 01:03:24,359
Adam and um is brilliant but it's kind

1456
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:26,839
of of the sun uh it's too bright

1457
01:03:26,839 --> 01:03:28,819
sometimes

1458
01:03:28,819 --> 01:03:32,099
people have to be distilled into the as

1459
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:34,200
you say academic time and let's uh

1460
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,660
that's that's interesting so we also

1461
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,460
have seen some people you know didn't

1462
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:41,700
get along with him uh well but still I

1463
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,339
think they are and many many impact here

1464
01:03:44,339 --> 01:03:46,619
he certainly have encouraged many people

1465
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:48,440
go different directions

1466
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:52,940
and in terms of the academic um the the

1467
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:56,040
academic future right I mean I think you

1468
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,200
two are more talking about the

1469
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,740
neurobiology side but on the on the

1470
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:04,559
morphogenesis side now I would also say

1471
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,380
he always emphasized the patterns you

1472
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:10,020
know thinking that you know pattern is

1473
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:13,020
kind of the way uh nature you know

1474
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,119
either biological biology they leave

1475
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,420
some some crew for us to figure out and

1476
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:20,460
when I was there I remember every time

1477
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:23,040
he talked about the the visual columns

1478
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,980
uh thousand whistle they have workout he

1479
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:28,619
got very excited and in fact I have a

1480
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:32,160
one of my peers at that time was working

1481
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,059
on on the visual Columns of the cat but

1482
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:38,400
I think that paper let's work never

1483
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,420
really go out to be published but anyway

1484
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,579
more practical things I work on the

1485
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:48,960
tissue tissue patterns and I I feel that

1486
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,000
you know go you know you mentioned about

1487
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,420
the top of biology and I again I think

1488
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:56,880
that he coined the term and I think that

1489
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,880
the term I mean I think it means a lot

1490
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,819
because I kind of you know eventually my

1491
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:05,839
career was trying to figure out uh these

1492
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:09,299
signaling molecules uh because at that

1493
01:05:09,299 --> 01:05:11,280
time people only talk about the

1494
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,859
signaling molecule very very important

1495
01:05:13,859 --> 01:05:16,500
but but the idea I'll talk about biology

1496
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:20,339
is that you even position this simply by

1497
01:05:20,339 --> 01:05:23,220
positioning this signaling

1498
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,640
centers in a different topology you can

1499
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,760
actually have a lot of consequence

1500
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,540
um so so from there and the signaling

1501
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:35,520
Center can also have a different

1502
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,579
lifetime the strength and the duration

1503
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:42,180
and the the the range they can inference

1504
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:45,720
so by money my by modulating you know he

1505
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,540
likes these terms so modulating uh this

1506
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:51,780
signaling Center you can create a lot of

1507
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:55,319
regional differences and up to now as I

1508
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:58,200
say from my own take you know but you

1509
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,599
look at it fried feather here Downy

1510
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:02,460
feather here you know the beautiful

1511
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:05,040
crown feather here tail feather but

1512
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,559
these are all from the same genome so it

1513
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:10,140
actually is through the positioning of

1514
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:13,980
these different signaling Center in in a

1515
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:16,440
different way and you you basically have

1516
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,200
the same same ingredient but you can

1517
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,079
play with them by topologically temporal

1518
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,780
space temporal and especially arrange

1519
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:28,680
them and to to create a quite complex uh

1520
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:33,119
pattern so so I I feel that in the

1521
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,660
tissue patterning morphogenesis side you

1522
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:39,299
know I I feel that you know his vision

1523
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:43,380
is is great and I I think we still try

1524
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:46,140
to work out more about how these

1525
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:49,140
patterns are positioned but I think

1526
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:51,720
that's sort of the direction in a more

1527
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:55,140
visualized autobiology aspective we can

1528
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,618
appreciate

1529
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,960
awesome well perhaps if each of you

1530
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,119
would like to give any

1531
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:07,079
closing thoughts

1532
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:15,059
yes I I understand to Echo

1533
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:18,720
you know there's less sentiments um

1534
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:23,039
I think everything that Edelman said or

1535
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,960
try to say

1536
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,099
um depending whether you could

1537
01:07:26,099 --> 01:07:28,020
understand him I think he's absolutely

1538
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:30,420
right and we're slowly discovering the

1539
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:32,039
truths we've just heard about typology

1540
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:33,660
and the importance of patterns and of

1541
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,039
course if you speak to somebody like

1542
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,559
Mike Levin he'd be talking about exactly

1543
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:39,299
the same thing he'd use words like basal

1544
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:41,339
cognition and you know pattern formation

1545
01:07:41,339 --> 01:07:43,140
but he I think that we're talking about

1546
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,539
the same uh the same principles of

1547
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:48,059
biological self-organization.

1548
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:51,000
um you know and Edelman I I didn't know

1549
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,440
about topobiology.

1550
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,299
um but I do know you know there are

1551
01:07:54,299 --> 01:07:56,579
other fundamental ideas that he just you

1552
01:07:56,579 --> 01:07:58,980
know incidental to him I am absolutely

1553
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:01,680
sure I think this is a degeneracy in the

1554
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,200
neurosciences and psychology

1555
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,059
um you know the notion of many to one

1556
01:08:06,059 --> 01:08:07,740
structure function mappings for example

1557
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:10,319
these are fundamental ideas which now

1558
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:13,260
are take enormous for granted

1559
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:16,319
um in in my world but you know you sort

1560
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,238
of forget how much he actually

1561
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,920
contributed

1562
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,500
um or at least laid the seeds for and

1563
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,779
sometimes very explicitly so it should

1564
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:26,759
be acknowledged although he was as Mark

1565
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:28,859
Reichel uh put it in his typically

1566
01:08:28,859 --> 01:08:31,198
gentlemanly fashion Edelman was a very

1567
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:34,380
complicated man. He was also very

1568
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:36,540
brilliant and his responsible I think

1569
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:38,759
for a lot of the direction of travel and

1570
01:08:38,759 --> 01:08:40,620
the intellectual growth certainly of my

1571
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:42,719
intellectual growth but I would say also

1572
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,299
many aspects of of our academic

1573
01:08:45,299 --> 01:08:47,719
communities.

1574
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:52,400
thank you Karl! perhaps Andrew?

1575
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:57,620
{oh wait unmute and then please continue}

1576
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:02,880
yeah so I I would say you know uh

1577
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,560
if there's anyone listening out there

1578
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,140
there's something to be said about maybe

1579
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:08,698
looking back

1580
01:09:08,698 --> 01:09:12,299
and in ancient literature that goes back

1581
01:09:12,299 --> 01:09:14,759
quite a bit and maybe

1582
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:16,859
seeing how some of these things came

1583
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:19,939
about and trying to put it together

1584
01:09:19,939 --> 01:09:22,319
and see that you know there's this

1585
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,479
iteration that constantly takes place.

1586
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:27,238
people ReDiscover the same thing that's

1587
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:29,819
been discovered multiple times.

1588
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:34,319
um and you know try to see how there is

1589
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:39,120
uh a status quo in the way science works.

1590
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,339
and then there's these outliers where

1591
01:09:41,339 --> 01:09:44,819
there's sort of creative bubbles that

1592
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:48,839
that come to fore. and I think uh it's

1593
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:50,759
interesting to think of Edelman and the

1594
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:53,100
things he did and the people that were

1595
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,739
associated with him in terms of sort of

1596
01:09:55,739 --> 01:09:57,900
these disruptive right they call it

1597
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,640
"disruptions"

1598
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,320
um and uh

1599
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,140
how those

1600
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:05,699
disruptions may have consequence many

1601
01:10:05,699 --> 01:10:06,719
years later.

1602
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,000
it's it's kind of interesting you take

1603
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,100
the Long View

1604
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:12,960
so I I think it's um

1605
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,880
maybe worthwhile thinking about this

1606
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,640
once in a while. and uh for young people

1607
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:18,780
out there

1608
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:23,520
to be encouraged to think off to think

1609
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,699
out of the normal way of doing things

1610
01:10:26,699 --> 01:10:29,520
once in a while. try to foster your

1611
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,400
creativity and have the courage to to go

1612
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,199
after some of those ideas.

1613
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:37,560
I think that's a take-home message for

1614
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,420
me anyway.

1615
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:42,020
[unintelligible]

1616
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:53,100
the important question let's have a

1617
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:55,980
general meaning so I I think that kind

1618
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:57,840
of idea she said that look at the big

1619
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,760
picture I remember when I was there you

1620
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,340
talk like that big pictures. so that is

1621
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:04,620
where when he thinking about the

1622
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:07,620
Darwinism he would say it's not only for

1623
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:10,500
the species Evolution for the for the

1624
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,560
immunological selection he would push it

1625
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:17,460
to to the Grand Theory and and for me I

1626
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:19,860
work on the morphogenesis I actually

1627
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:23,280
would come to realize that is also what

1628
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,860
happened at the tissue level. these cells

1629
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:28,140
are competing with each other to form

1630
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,060
that patterns and then pattern is

1631
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,360
selected when there is a functional

1632
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:36,360
advantage it will be stabilized. so so I

1633
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,340
think the idea of saying if we're going

1634
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:40,620
to do science we do we ask big questions

1635
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:43,320
ask for the generalization. I I

1636
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,960
appreciate that and certainly he is like

1637
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,179
how you want to call it right a huge

1638
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:50,940
elephant so we all touch him uh through

1639
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:53,820
different side and have a different take

1640
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:55,440
on that.

1641
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,719
and and in terms of the young scientists

1642
01:11:57,719 --> 01:11:59,699
I also remember he likes the Chinese

1643
01:11:59,699 --> 01:12:03,540
proverb I I cited to him "unless he's to

1644
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:06,780
say if you wanted to get a Tiger's son

1645
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:10,800
you must get into Tiger's cave!" so so so

1646
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,179
we treat it

1647
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:18,659
thank you all that's a great no really

1648
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:23,100
appreciate this conversation and again

1649
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,060
thanks until next time

1650
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:29,179
thank you
