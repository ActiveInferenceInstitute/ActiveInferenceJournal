1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,000
hello everyone it is august 3rd 2022

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,480
and it's actinf guest stream number 25.1

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,880
we're here with Brett Andersen

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,080
and we'll be hearing about autistic-like

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,400
traits and positive schizotype as

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,400
diametric specializations of the

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,840
predictive mind

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,199
there will be first a presentation

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,520
followed by a discussion segment so if

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,840
you're watching live feel free to add

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,920
any comments or questions

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,160
and brett thank you again for joining

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,200
and

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,120
on with the presentation

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,120
all right thank you Daniel uh for having

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,840
me

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,760
so yeah this is a paper that was

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,559
published this earlier this month

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,160
and uh so

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,440
before I get into the paper I should

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,960
probably introduce myself just a little

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,760
bit so I am an evolutionary psychology

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,440
phd student at the university of new

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,719
mexico

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,239
my research mainly has to do with

26
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,159
something called the diametric model of

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,000
autism and psychosis which i'll talk

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,080
more about that here in just a minute

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,439
so I am not

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,799
trained in active inference or

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,040
predictive processing I came to this

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,200
because I was looking

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,119
for a theory that could explain

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,000
variation along this autism schizotype

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,840
continuum and i'll i'll say what that is

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,360
here in just a minute

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,240
and I came across uh santa croix or

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,240
let's see Sander Van de Cruys and

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,360
colleagues 2014 their paper about autism

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,280
published in psychological review

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,040
and it was through that paper that i

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,520
sort of came to write this paper because

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,439
uh I realized at some point that that

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,280
was the theory I was looking for and

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,079
that

46
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,920
uh the opposite configuration of what

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,200
they put forward so they said that

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,920
autism results from giving an inflexibly

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,840
high weight to sensory input and what i

50
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,520
realized through reading that paper and

51
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,720
reading some other stuff around the

52
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,840
topic

53
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
was that giving an inflexibly low weight

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
to sensory input does a really good job

55
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,119
of explaining the other side of that

56
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,200
continuum and so that's what this paper

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,119
is about

58
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,159
so i'm putting forward

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,800
an explanation for a for a continuum of

60
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,639
individual differences

61
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,319
so uh just an idea of what i'm going to

62
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,440
talk about here so i'm going to talk

63
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,120
about the diametric model of autism and

64
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,640
psychosis what it is what some of the

65
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,400
evidence for it is

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,239
how it manifests in non-clinical

67
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,840
populations which is what my research

68
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,239
mainly focuses on and we refer to that

69
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,879
as the autism schizotype continuum

70
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,640
uh and then the hypothesis that I put

71
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,239
forward in this paper which has to do

72
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,920
with explaining variation along this

73
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,319
continuum uh due to trade-offs in

74
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,000
precision weighting due to precision

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,840
weighting and and then i'll talk about

76
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,599
some implications for predictive

77
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,080
processing and active reference

78
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,160
so the diametric model

79
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,239
of autism and psychosis was first put

80
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,480
forward by Crespi and Babcock uh Bernie

81
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,239
crest Bernie Crespi and Christopher

82
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,080
Babcock in a 2008 bbs paper

83
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,599
and

84
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,680
it is very simply uh very simply put

85
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,599
just the idea that autism spectrum

86
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,159
conditions and psychosis spectrum

87
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,560
conditions are cognitive and genetic

88
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,239
opposites

89
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,920
before I get into some of the evidence

90
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,840
for it I want to at least address what i

91
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,599
think is the most common objection i

92
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,440
hear it all the time which is that

93
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,440
how can the diametric model be true

94
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,840
given that some people who are diagnosed

95
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,360
with an autism spectrum condition

96
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,200
experience psychosis and vice versa

97
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,640
right so there's there's comorbidity

98
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,920
between these

99
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,239
disorders how can this diametric model

100
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,280
be the case

101
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,120
be true and

102
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,720
i have a whole video about that on my

103
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,400
youtube channel I might put the link in

104
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
the comments to this to this youtube

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,920
video uh but

106
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,200
basically

107
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,879
the response to this objection is just

108
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,840
to point out that DSM categories are

109
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,879
extremely heterogeneous so within each

110
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,560
DSM category you're going to find

111
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,879
multiple etiologies that may be totally

112
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,280
unrelated to each other in some cases so

113
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,840
for example you could have somebody

114
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,519
diagnosed with an autism spectrum

115
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,760
condition

116
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,680
uh is is diagnosed with that mainly

117
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
because for example they have like a

118
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,040
language condition they have maybe a

119
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,799
language delay and that causes a

120
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,200
communicative a communication problem

121
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,879
and then they get the autism diagnosis

122
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,239
and it's not supposed to happen that way

123
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,080
but it definitely does happen that way

124
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,760
and so that would be different from

125
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,600
somebody who has a more classical

126
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,959
presentation with restricted and

127
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,519
repetitive behaviors and so on and so

128
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,120
that person

129
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,800
their their etiology may have nothing

130
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,240
whatsoever to do with the diametric

131
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,000
model so basically given the

132
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,759
heterogeneity of these conditions we

133
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,240
don't expect to have any precise theory

134
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,040
that's going to explain uh every case of

135
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,800
the condition and that includes the

136
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,240
diametric model

137
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,520
so what is some of the evidence for the

138
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,040
diametric model

139
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,639
i think the best evidence for it is just

140
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,880
to point out all of the diametrically

141
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,600
related uh characteristics on either

142
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,520
side of this what's what's meant to be a

143
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,040
continuum

144
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,919
so

145
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,560
with autism spectrum conditions

146
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,479
there's evidence that paternally

147
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,800
expressed genes promote autism so

148
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,479
we get two copies of every gene we get

149
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,400
one from our mom and one from our dad

150
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
there are a subset of genes that are

151
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,560
called imprinted genes and with those

152
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,240
genes you only express one of those

153
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,840
copies so you might express the copy

154
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,000
from you only from your dad

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,759
that's a paternally expressed gene

156
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,280
paternally expressed genes when they're

157
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,440
hyper expressed tend to promote autism

158
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,400
and

159
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,560
autism spectrum conditions

160
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
we see overgrowth in autism especially

161
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,360
in infancy hypomentalizing which is

162
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,039
reduced attribution of mental states to

163
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,520
other people reduced imagination hyper

164
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,960
systemizing

165
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,880
relative right hemisphere dysfunction

166
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,560
increased cancer rates which is related

167
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,960
to the genomic imprinting issue and we

168
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,880
also see a sex difference where men tend

169
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,639
to be higher in autistic like traits and

170
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,240
they tend to be diagnosed with autism

171
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,240
more often and on the psychosis side of

172
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,680
things we see a lot of opposite

173
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,840
characteristics so we see evidence that

174
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,440
maternally expressed genes promote

175
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,440
psychosis spectrum conditions we see

176
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,440
undergrowth especially in infancy

177
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,360
hypermentalizing which is increased

178
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,960
attribution of mental states to other

179
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,720
people often that that manifest as

180
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,160
paranoia

181
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,800
increased imagination apophenia which is

182
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,280
predisposition to false positives

183
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,759
relative left hemisphere dysfunction

184
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,199
reduced cancer rates at least with

185
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,600
schizophrenia and we also see a sex

186
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,440
difference with positive schizotypes so

187
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,960
women tend to be higher in positive

188
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,639
schizotype

189
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,199
we're talking about psychosis so men

190
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,600
tend to be so the the type of psychosis

191
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,960
that men tend to present with tends to

192
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,840
be

193
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,720
more often degenerative schizophrenia

194
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,960
uh whereas women tend to uh present more

195
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,800
with acute psychosis which seems to have

196
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,160
more of a relation to the diametric

197
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,520
model so

198
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,800
um

199
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,960
now what this paper is focused on is how

200
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,639
the diametric model manifests in

201
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,560
non-clinical population so we we talk

202
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,880
about autistic like traits on one end of

203
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
this continuum and positive schizotype

204
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,360
on the other and so the hypothesis put

205
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,080
forward in this paper is not primarily

206
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,919
about dysfunction it's not primarily

207
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,240
about explaining mental condition mental

208
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,000
disorders or mental conditions it's

209
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,080
about explaining a continuum of

210
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,160
individual differences that we all fall

211
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,919
somewhere along and so this is the this

212
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,039
is referred to as the autism

213
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,800
schizotheric continuum

214
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,199
on the autistic side on the uh side

215
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,599
associated with autistic like traits

216
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,520
we see hypomentalizing reduced

217
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,720
imagination

218
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,319
increased systemizing they tend to be

219
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,319
relatively poor at noisy pattern

220
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,680
detection although they're very good at

221
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,800
pattern detection when there's not a lot

222
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,319
of noise in the system

223
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,080
we see this narrow focused attention

224
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,199
style

225
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,800
and people high in autistic like traits

226
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,360
are over represented among engineers and

227
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,840
other technical

228
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,120
professions on the positive schizotype

229
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,160
side we see hypermentalizing increased

230
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,639
imagination reduced systemizing

231
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,400
apophinia and this more broad

232
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,319
distractible attention style and they

233
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,080
tend to be over represented among

234
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,800
artists and other creative professions

235
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,000
and so

236
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,160
the hypothesis that I put forward to try

237
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,599
to explain variation along this

238
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,520
continuum I refer to it as the precision

239
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,080
weighting of sensory input hypothesis

240
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,240
uh as i'm sure everybody listening to

241
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
this knows precision weighting underlies

242
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,000
the allocation of attention

243
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,879
so

244
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,720
you can adjust

245
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,160
the precision that you're giving to

246
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,080
sensory input in order to account for

247
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,160
noise in the input

248
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,080
and van der kroys and colleagues in

249
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,840
their 2014 paper published in

250
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,319
psychological review uh this was not the

251
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,080
only so there was a few papers published

252
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,440
around this time that were sort of

253
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,960
talking about this idea theirs was the

254
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,039
first to really put it forward and like

255
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,639
in full detail

256
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,560
so they argued that autism spectrum

257
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,479
disorders are caused by giving an

258
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,560
inflexibly high weight to sensory

259
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,160
prediction errors

260
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,919
and my paper simply extends this

261
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,919
hypothesis i'm arguing that there is a

262
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,159
continuum of individual differences

263
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,760
characterized by people who give a

264
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,839
relatively high weight to sensory input

265
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,200
on one side that's associated with

266
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,440
autism and autistic electrodes

267
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,200
and people who give a relatively low

268
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,320
weight to sensory input on the other

269
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,080
side which is associated with positive

270
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,600
schizotyping

271
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,279
and these differences are going to be

272
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,959
associated with

273
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,959
uh over with with sort of leaning

274
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,880
towards overfitting sensory input which

275
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,640
is what happens in autism

276
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
and leaning towards underfitting sensory

277
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,560
input and that under fitting can explain

278
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,760
some of the features of positive

279
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,320
schizotyping and so just to give a

280
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,640
visual demonstration of this

281
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,160
there's a very simplified visual

282
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,480
demonstration but the dots here are

283
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,399
sensory input right and the line is the

284
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,720
model so if you're overfitting if you're

285
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
leaning towards giving a high weight to

286
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,600
sensory input

287
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,519
you're going to end up fitting your

288
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,399
model too precisely to the data and that

289
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,399
means that you're going to incorporate

290
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,240
so a lot of that variation in the model

291
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,920
is noise you're going to end up

292
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,880
incorporating noise into your model

293
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,240
the opposite problem that you can have

294
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,480
is instead of giving too much weight to

295
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,000
the sensory input you're giving too much

296
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,839
weight to your hypothesis about the

297
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,320
input so you're kind of imposing your

298
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
hypothesis onto the model you're

299
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,240
imposing your prediction onto the input

300
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,839
so in this example on the right hand

301
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,440
side of the screen

302
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,519
the top down prediction is that the data

303
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,640
is linear

304
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,160
and if you give too much weight to that

305
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,839
prediction you can end up imposing a

306
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,080
linear model onto the data

307
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,120
and

308
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,040
something like this I will argue is

309
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,600
going on in positive schizotype and then

310
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,040
there is some optimal balance that

311
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,399
you're going to find that is going to

312
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,160
give you the best chance of finding the

313
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,200
pattern underlying the data importantly

314
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,519
that balance is is never the same or

315
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,600
it's not it's not stable so it depends

316
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,160
on how much noise is in the data depends

317
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,920
on how how much you want to generalize

318
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,320
from the data and so there is no single

319
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,000
optimal solution right there are always

320
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,880
trade-offs associated with this

321
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,920
and so

322
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,399
these are the differences that I am i'm

323
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,000
going to

324
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,760
argue that I can explain with this

325
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,040
hypothesis

326
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,560
so differences along the autism

327
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,760
schizotype continuum these include

328
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,320
bottom-up versus top-down influences on

329
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,800
perception and cognition hypomentalizing

330
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,880
versus hypermentalizing reduced

331
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,839
imagination versus increased imagination

332
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,279
and everything everything on the left

333
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,800
here is associated with the autistic

334
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,880
like traits and then narrow detailed

335
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,040
attention versus broad distractible

336
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,760
attention apophinia which is associated

337
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,680
with positive schizotype systemizing

338
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,360
which is associated with autism and

339
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,880
autistic like traits and then

340
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,959
differences in the propensity for

341
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,880
exploration

342
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,320
so we're going to go through all of

343
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,760
these and show how this hypothesis may

344
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,839
be able to account for them

345
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,440
so

346
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,040
with bottom-up versus top-down

347
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,760
influences on perception uh Crespi and

348
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,560
Dinsdale in a 2019 paper reviewed

349
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,360
evidence for diametric susceptibility to

350
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,920
the rubber hand illusion so most people

351
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,040
probably know what the rubber hand

352
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,519
illusion is got a little visual thing on

353
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,959
the right hand side that shows what it

354
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,800
is so with the rubber hand illusion you

355
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,760
have your real hand hidden by some

356
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,079
screen or something and a rubber hand is

357
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,360
placed in front of you where you think

358
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,120
the real hand is going to go

359
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,920
and

360
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,839
the experimenter will take a feather or

361
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,680
something and they will stroke your real

362
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,519
hand at the same time as they stroke the

363
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,360
rubber hand and that will produce the

364
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,519
illusion that the rubber hand belongs to

365
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,399
you

366
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,760
and oftentimes at the end of the

367
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,200
experiment they'll take a hammer and

368
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,639
slam it down on the rubber hand and

369
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,240
you'll jump and and all that so you

370
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,839
really you really do sort of think that

371
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,200
the hand is yours

372
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,360
uh what Crespi and Dinsdale reviewed

373
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,120
evidence for is that

374
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,440
oh um before I get to that so Jakob

375
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,880
Hohwy I think that's how you say that

376
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,120
say his name uh Jakob Hohwy in his book

377
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,720
suggested that the illusion works

378
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,200
because of the top-down prior belief

379
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,839
that systematically related properties

380
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,839
in this case seeing a hand being stroked

381
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,200
and feeling your own hand being stroked

382
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,040
at the same time are very likely to be

383
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,720
causally related and so what that means

384
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,760
is that

385
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,680
susceptibility to the illusion should be

386
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,639
facilitated by by giving more weight to

387
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,399
your top down prior so a relative

388
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,079
overweighting of top-down priors should

389
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,600
facilitate susceptibility to the

390
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,000
illusion and decreased susceptibility

391
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,600
should be facilitated by giving more

392
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,839
weight to bottom-up sensor input and so

393
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,000
in that case we would expect for autism

394
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,160
and autistic like traits to be associ

395
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,480
associated with reduced susceptibility

396
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,200
and positive schizotype and psychosis to

397
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
be associated with more susceptibility

398
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,320
and that is what Crespi and Dinsdale

399
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,160
find so they find that

400
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,519
autism is associated with reduced

401
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,920
susceptibility and vice versa for

402
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,320
positive schizotype and uh

403
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,639
predisposition to psychosis

404
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,000
so

405
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,320
moving on to mentalizing

406
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,200
so

407
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,839
within the predictive processing

408
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,120
framework uh mentalizing our theory of

409
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,519
mind is thought to result from the use

410
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,360
of relatively abstract or high-level

411
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,600
predictions uh priors to predict other

412
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,440
people's behavior and so

413
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,120
again sort of the same principle as the

414
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,040
last time if that's the case we would

415
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,600
expect an overweighting of bottom-up

416
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,760
input relative to relative to priors

417
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,920
should result in hypomentalizing or

418
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,600
reduced attribution of mental states to

419
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,760
other people and an overweighting of

420
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,279
priors should result in the opposite of

421
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,000
hypermentalizing or giving

422
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,199
an increased attribution of mental

423
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,639
states to other people and of course

424
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,240
that is what we find associated with the

425
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,720
autism schizotype continuum uh this was

426
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,160
one of the things that van der kroys and

427
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,760
colleagues talked about in their 2014

428
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,600
paper but the opposite

429
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
positive schizotypal does result in the

430
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,720
opposite

431
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,040
finding

432
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,240
so next up is imagination

433
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,839
uh Andy Clark in a 2013 paper he argued

434
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,639
that we we go into our imagination when

435
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,720
we should when we sufficiently turn down

436
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,480
the weight that we're giving to

437
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,040
proprioceptive sensory input and so when

438
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,959
we do that we are now dealing with our

439
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,720
top down prediction sort of offline

440
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,160
right unmoored from the sensory input

441
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,519
what this should mean is that if you're

442
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,680
giving an inflexibly high weight to

443
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,440
sensory input that should make it more

444
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,360
difficult to turn down that weight

445
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,680
enough to go into your imagination

446
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
if you're giving an inflexibly low

447
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,199
weight to sensory input this should mean

448
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,880
that you will find it easier to go into

449
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,199
your imagination and that is we we do

450
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,720
find this difference along the autism

451
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,800
schizotypal continuum so people high in

452
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
autistic like traits

453
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,680
uh they have imaginative deficits often

454
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,160
and people high in positive schizotype

455
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,000
they do better on tasks that at least

456
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,519
purportedly measure imagination like

457
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,360
divergent thinking tasks

458
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,560
there's evidence that they spend more

459
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,639
time daydreaming and mind wandering and

460
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,560
of course they're also over represented

461
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,040
among artists and creative professions

462
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,120
so

463
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,680
uh moving on to attention

464
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,279
so

465
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,360
abu aakl and colleagues in a couple

466
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,839
papers in 2017 and 2018

467
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,279
demonstrated diametric attention styles

468
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,480
for people high and positive

469
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,079
schizotyping and people high in autistic

470
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,880
like traits what they showed

471
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,920
especially in the in the 2018 paper uh

472
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,000
people high in autistic like traits do

473
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
better on a task where they had to

474
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,399
ignore salient distractors right so

475
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,240
the task was essentially they had to

476
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,000
focus on something on the screen and

477
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,759
they had to ignore salient distractors

478
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,279
that would pop up in the periphery and

479
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,880
that facilitated them doing better on

480
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,920
the task

481
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,040
on the other hand people high in

482
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,959
positive schizotype

483
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,399
did better on a task that was

484
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,160
facilitated by the opposite by being

485
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,759
distracted by the by the things in the

486
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,399
periphery uh so we see this sort of

487
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,320
focused attention style with autism and

488
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,480
we see this uh more diffuse distractible

489
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,880
attention style with positive schizotype

490
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,560
there is other evidence for this and i

491
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,920
review that in the paper if you want to

492
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,040
look at that

493
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,079
so

494
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,839
the question is how can the PSI

495
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,680
hypothesis account for this I think this

496
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,440
one even though it should you might

497
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,959
think it's the most straightforward one

498
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,480
because precision weighting is about

499
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,800
attention and this is attention

500
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,240
it's actually I think the least

501
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,759
straightforward one

502
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,199
and the reason why

503
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,959
is because

504
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,600
it does seem somewhat intuitive that

505
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,639
if you're

506
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,480
being bombarded

507
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,240
sort of by highly precise sensory

508
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,160
prediction errors which is what we argue

509
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,399
happens in autism uh you might think

510
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,560
that would make you more distractible

511
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,880
and vice versa for positive schizotypes

512
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,240
since they're only paying attention to

513
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,759
relatively large prediction errors that

514
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,680
might make them less distractible

515
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,320
that is that isn't the case but

516
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,839
it'll take a little bit of unpacking to

517
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,199
explain why and i'm going to use an

518
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,920
analogy here we're going to use what i'm

519
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,399
calling the fire department analogy

520
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,400
so you can imagine that you have two

521
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,919
fire departments we'll just call them

522
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,480
fire department a and fire department b

523
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,720
and there are three kinds of fires that

524
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,079
you could have so you could have small

525
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,640
fires medium fires and large fires

526
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,959
and these departments

527
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,880
receive calls about the fires but they

528
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,039
are not told how big the fires are right

529
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,799
so they get a call they're told that

530
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,480
there's a fire at this location but

531
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,240
they're not told whether it's a small

532
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,000
medium or large fire they're just told

533
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,679
that there's a fire

534
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,960
department a

535
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,039
has a policy where they they receive

536
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,799
calls about all kinds of fires right so

537
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,960
they receive calls about small medium

538
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,440
and large fires and department b has a

539
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,520
policy where they only receive calls

540
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,120
about large fires right so they don't

541
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,080
take calls about small and medium fires

542
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,520
i'm arguing that this is basically

543
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
equivalent you know within this analogy

544
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,360
to giving a high weight to sensory input

545
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,120
for department a which they take calls

546
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,280
about all fires and as van der kroy's

547
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,039
and colleagues pointed out in their 2014

548
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,720
paper when you're giving a high weight

549
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,120
to sensory input you're treating all of

550
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,640
these sensory prediction errors as if

551
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,320
they're all important

552
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,919
the problem with that of course is that

553
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,360
not all sensory prediction errors are

554
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,000
actually important

555
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
department b who only receives calls

556
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,679
about large fires this is equivalent to

557
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,320
giving a low weight to sensory input

558
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,720
so which strategy works better that

559
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,039
depends on the context so if there are

560
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,799
more fires than you can put out at a

561
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,160
given time right if the whole city

562
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,400
catches fire at once department b works

563
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,919
better because in that case you actually

564
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,520
don't want to pay attention to the small

565
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,720
fires where you only want to pay

566
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,080
attention to the large fires you want to

567
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,480
ignore the details uh if there's not

568
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
that many fires at a time you don't want

569
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,080
to ignore small fires right you want to

570
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,280
pay attention to the small fires so

571
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,559
department a works better in that

572
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,080
context

573
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,600
so

574
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,919
now imagine that these two departments

575
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,200
are in the midst of putting out a

576
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,880
particularly large and important fire

577
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,120
they receive a call about a new fire and

578
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,640
the question here is what should they do

579
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,679
in relation to this call department a

580
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,679
should maintain focus on the current

581
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,760
fire that's because when they receive a

582
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,520
call they don't know whether it's small

583
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,360
medium or large it's more likely to be

584
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,799
small or medium

585
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,120
so they should ignore the call maintain

586
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,000
focus on their current task

587
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
department b should be more willing to

588
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,440
allocate resources to the new fire right

589
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,360
they know that it's a large fire because

590
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,880
they only receive calls about large

591
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,559
fires so they should be more willing to

592
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,480
redirect their attentional resources

593
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
okay this is my argument for why we see

594
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,280
this

595
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,640
uh attentional difference along the

596
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,039
autism schizotypal continuum uh people

597
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,320
high and autistic like traits have

598
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,400
learned that the peripheral prediction

599
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,480
errors are very likely to be unimportant

600
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,000
and that they should focus on the task

601
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,600
at hand that learning probably happens

602
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,880
unconsciously

603
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,720
uh people behind positive schizotype

604
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,320
have learned the opposite right

605
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,640
if they're if they receive a prediction

606
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,080
error on the periphery they've learned

607
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,679
to assume that it's important right

608
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,960
because they only pay attention to

609
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,320
important prediction areas so

610
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,000
uh so anyways this this analogy is what

611
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,679
i'm using to explain this attentional

612
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,520
difference along the autism schizotype

613
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,880
continuum

614
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,240
uh so moving on to systemizing

615
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,000
so people high in autistic like traits

616
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,320
and people with with an autism spectrum

617
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,559
condition are often very skilled at

618
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,760
learning about

619
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,919
uh rules-based systems so this would be

620
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,280
something like a computer programming

621
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,520
language most of mathematics falls under

622
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
this category uh they tend to be very

623
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,960
good at these things

624
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,760
and

625
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,600
if you'll remember you know overfitting

626
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,679
results from incorporating noise into

627
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,360
into your predictive model

628
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,000
the thing about a rules-based system is

629
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,159
that there is no noise in that system if

630
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,159
it's if it's truly rules-based then when

631
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,679
you put in a certain input you get the

632
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,440
same output every time it can be an

633
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,360
extremely complex these can be extremely

634
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
complex rules uh like there are with

635
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,960
computer programming languages but

636
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,000
they're extremely precise

637
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,720
and so that highly precise cognitive

638
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,320
perceptual style that comes with giving

639
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,159
a high weight to sensory input is going

640
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,240
to facilitate the systemizing ability

641
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,240
with with autism and autistic like

642
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,280
traits

643
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,080
so for a visual demonstration of this

644
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,480
you can have this complex pattern

645
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,919
and there's no noise in the pattern

646
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,120
right it might be highly complex but

647
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,559
there's no noise

648
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,840
if you're giving a high weight to

649
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,760
sensory input you can fit your model as

650
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
precisely as you want to this pattern

651
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,960
and you're not going to run into the

652
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,480
problem of overfitting because there is

653
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,880
no noise to be incorporated in the model

654
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,039
people high in positive schizotyping on

655
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,679
the other hand may attempt to impose a

656
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,760
simplifying assumption onto the model

657
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,600
right they may attempt to impose

658
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,919
simplifying assumptions onto this

659
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,440
complex but non-noisy input

660
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,200
and that will lead them to not be as

661
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,280
good at systemizing

662
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,360
and that is what we find

663
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,120
so

664
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,080
looking at noisy patterns now so people

665
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,840
with autism spectrum conditions are

666
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,000
relatively poor at picking up on noisy

667
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,039
patterns

668
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,480
i was not able to get to this in the

669
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,320
paper because I didn't have room but it

670
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,760
is something that I would have included

671
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,840
if I had room uh we reviewed the

672
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,480
evidence for this in an upcoming paper

673
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,240
with myself john vervicky and mark

674
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,360
miller

675
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,960
so if you're giving a high weight to

676
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,960
sensory input

677
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,320
it's going to make it more difficult to

678
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,080
pick up on patterns that were that are

679
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,760
embedded in noise

680
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,360
and there is no evidence that people

681
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,120
high in positive schizotype have issues

682
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,039
with noisy patterns so apophinia has a

683
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,080
different thing we'll talk about the

684
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,240
next but but there is evidence for this

685
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,799
with autistic like traits and ASD.

686
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,120
we can understand why that's the case

687
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
for the same reason so

688
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,200
if you have this noisy data and you're

689
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,760
trying to fit your model very precisely

690
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,679
to that noisy data you are not going to

691
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,440
pick up on the underlying pattern right

692
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,880
you're going to miss out on the

693
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,640
underlying pattern you're going to

694
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,039
over fit your model to this data

695
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,880
so people high in positive schizotypy

696
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,640
really ought to be better at picking up

697
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,320
on these kinds of noisy patterns because

698
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,840
they're not going to they're not going

699
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,520
to miss out on the big picture by paying

700
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,760
too much attention to the details is

701
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,879
essentially what would happen there

702
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,400
so apophinia is the next one so

703
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,520
apophinia is when you perceive patterns

704
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,960
and pure noise right and this is thought

705
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,400
to be a core feature of positive

706
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
schizotype

707
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,080
uh so for example people high in

708
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,840
positive schizotypal are more likely to

709
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,080
hear messages if they're if you listen

710
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,679
to audio that's pure noise they're more

711
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,039
likely to say that they heard a voice in

712
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,200
the noise or something like that

713
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,440
and giving a low weight to sensory input

714
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,440
means that they will often impose their

715
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,760
top down assumptions onto onto pure

716
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,720
noise

717
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,080
there's no evidence that people high in

718
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,679
autistic like traits have issues with

719
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,039
apophenia

720
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,960
and so again this is just a visual

721
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,200
demonstration of this

722
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,280
um with autistic like traits when

723
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,960
they're presented with pure noise again

724
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,320
they're not going to see any pattern in

725
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,760
that right they're just going to see

726
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
randomness people high in positive

727
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,120
schizotype

728
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,919
may again they may attempt to impose a

729
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,679
pattern onto this data

730
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,880
because they're giving more weight to

731
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,640
the top down to the top down assumption

732
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,760
and less weight to the bottom up input

733
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,360
so I think this is the last one I might

734
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,880
finish a little early

735
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,159
exploitation exploration so we do see uh

736
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,919
evidence

737
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,520
okay so yeah so deciding whether to

738
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,200
exploit current opportunities or search

739
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,120
for new ones direct exploration is a

740
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
fundamental trade-off that faces all

741
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,320
organisms

742
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,720
and there is evidence that people high

743
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,240
and positive schizotype are more

744
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,159
exploratory than people high in autistic

745
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,159
like traits so for example they are

746
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,240
higher in the personality traits of

747
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,360
openness

748
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,559
and extraversion uh Colin deYoung and

749
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,520
some of

750
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,200
some of his colleagues have argued that

751
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,120
those two traits form a higher order

752
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,200
trait called plasticity and the young

753
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,440
has argued that that plasticity

754
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,360
represents the general tendency towards

755
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,600
exploration so that's uh some evidence

756
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
uh for differences in exploratory

757
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,919
tendency we also see differences in

758
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,080
sensation seeking associated with this

759
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,159
so sensation seeking has also been

760
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,919
argued to be an indicator of exploratory

761
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,840
tendency

762
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,799
so

763
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,600
Kiverstein and colleagues and 2019 paper

764
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,200
said this

765
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,640
they they said that a large but

766
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,120
resolvable error signal informs the

767
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,960
agent that the environment offers the

768
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,799
opportunity or offers the opportunity to

769
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,799
resolve uncertainty

770
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,039
that opportunity to resolve uncertainty

771
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,320
makes exploration an attractive option

772
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,400
the issue is

773
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,760
so if you're if you're giving an

774
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,880
inflexibly high weight to sensory input

775
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,000
what that means is that you're not

776
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,840
seeing large differences between the

777
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,000
prediction errors that are that you're

778
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,679
receiving

779
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,200
giving a low weight to sensory input

780
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,400
means that people high in positive

781
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,960
schizotyping only tend to pay attention

782
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,039
to large prediction errors and these

783
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,720
large prediction errors are more likely

784
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,559
to incentivize exploration they

785
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,080
represent a greater potential

786
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,520
information game

787
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,840
information gain and so people high in

788
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,840
high and autistic like traits

789
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,960
we see that autism is associated with

790
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,679
restricted and repetitive behaviors and

791
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,000
relatively narrow interests

792
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,840
uh and that me and that's a reflection

793
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,678
of this reduced exploration

794
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,880
yeah so like I said before giving a high

795
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,320
weight to sensory input means that most

796
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,360
prediction errors are going to be

797
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,840
treated as relatively equal and in

798
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,600
importance and as van der kroys and

799
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,080
colleagues pointed out in the 2014 paper

800
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,240
if each prediction error is as important

801
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,000
as the next it is more difficult to

802
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,120
estimate

803
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,440
where predictive process can be made and

804
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,320
therefore

805
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,960
exploration is not as enticing

806
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,520
this comes with a benefit however

807
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,919
because the the decreased exploration

808
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,200
that's associated with autistic

809
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,240
literates

810
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,080
is also why they tend to be more

811
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,520
competent specialists they tend to

812
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,279
specialize on one highly particular

813
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,240
domain

814
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,000
and sort of drill deep into one thing

815
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,600
instead of spreading out their options

816
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,960
over many things

817
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,120
they are less likely to be distracted by

818
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,479
emergent opportunities

819
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,799
so

820
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,640
what are some of the implications of

821
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,799
this hypothesis

822
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,559
uh so like I said van der kroys and

823
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,640
colleagues their 2014 theory about

824
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,840
autism

825
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,080
should not be seen as being just a

826
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,760
theory about autism but rather as a

827
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,840
basis for a theory about individual

828
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,240
differences in general

829
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,320
because in addition to people who give

830
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,559
an inflexibly high weight to sensory

831
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,440
input

832
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,880
i've argued here that there are people

833
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,640
who also given inflexibly low weight to

834
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,080
sensory prediction errors and those are

835
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,640
people high in positive schizotyping

836
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,120
and this uh just as a reminder this

837
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,400
should not be thought of in terms of

838
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,919
dysfunction

839
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,679
it is a continuum of individual

840
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,440
differences that we all fall somewhere

841
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
along right so this is just a

842
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,360
a continuum that that will occur in

843
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,919
non-clinical populations as well

844
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,000
and this paper was an initial attempt to

845
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,159
sketch the evidence and implications of

846
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,600
this idea

847
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,200
there is still room for an empirical

848
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,600
research program to test and extend this

849
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
this idea and that's what i'm going to

850
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,120
do with the rest of my phd most likely

851
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,799
and theoretical work on its implications

852
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,120
so I am an evolutionary psychologist so

853
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,640
i should talk a little bit about some

854
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,919
evolutionary implications

855
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,159
the autism schizotypal continuum is a

856
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,000
highly heritable source of individual

857
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,480
differences we know that autism and

858
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,039
schizophrenia for example are about

859
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,799
have a heritability of about 0.8 so

860
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,799
they're very heritable

861
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,760
this means that they're going to be

862
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,480
highly responsive to selection pressures

863
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,799
and if this hypothesis that put forward

864
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,720
here is correct my contention is that

865
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,440
this continuum is very likely equivalent

866
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,520
or at least analogous to

867
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,360
specialist generalist continuums

868
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,480
elsewhere in biology and

869
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,399
that is because the the precise

870
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,320
perceptual style and autism is going to

871
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,640
facilitate specializing for highly

872
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,600
particular domains we do see this with

873
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,520
autism they tend to have relatively

874
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,120
narrow interests but that allows them to

875
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,919
be

876
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,080
to become very specialized in some some

877
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,919
particular domain

878
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,919
the imprecise perceptual style with

879
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,360
positive schizotype is going to

880
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,279
facilitate picking up on these more

881
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,600
noisy patterns and noisy patterns tend

882
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,120
to be more generalizable they tend to

883
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,200
generalize across context a little bit

884
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,240
better

885
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,440
so

886
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,880
there are models from theoretical

887
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,480
biology that have been used to

888
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,720
understand how specialist generalist

889
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,840
continuums like this can evolve

890
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,000
and basically the you know if I was

891
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,840
going to extract a general principle

892
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,080
from these models uh what they what they

893
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,240
tend to argue is that if you have

894
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,559
periods of relative stability punctuated

895
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,720
occasionally by periods of upheaval so

896
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,000
if you have fluctuating selection

897
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,720
pressures this can maintain a heritable

898
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
continuum of individuals individual

899
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,240
differences like this one

900
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,799
and there is evidence that this was the

901
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,320
environment that characterized human

902
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,159
beings before the advent of agriculture

903
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,000
so before the advent of agriculture

904
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,679
there was a lot more fluctuations in the

905
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,440
climate things were changing a lot more

906
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,799
often

907
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,320
so we could see the evolution of a

908
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,840
continuum of individual differences or

909
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,440
at least the maintenance of a continuum

910
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,840
like this one

911
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,640
so that is the end

912
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,399
and thank you to Daniel thank you to the

913
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,559
active inference institute for letting

914
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,240
me share my work

915
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,279
and that is it

916
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,840
thanks a lot you can unshare and we'll

917
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,440
talk a little bit more about this in our

918
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,760
store

919
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,559
all right

920
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,799
well to those who are watching along

921
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:07,679
live

922
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,279
please feel free to add any questions in

923
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,600
and if they're relevant we'll go with

924
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,640
them

925
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,760
well

926
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,880
a lot there

927
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,760
and

928
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,960
i wrote down

929
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,640
a bunch of questions

930
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,799
so

931
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,200
to enter the maze at just one point

932
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,120
here we have two axes

933
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,760
about the extent of the two traits that

934
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,440
you're focusing on

935
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,840
and the diametric model in my

936
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,640
understanding summarizes a manifold and

937
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,320
says that there's correlation across

938
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,039
these two dimensions

939
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,480
so I wondered what is that state space

940
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,120
are these like the big two

941
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,919
or what exactly

942
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,159
else might be in this broader space of

943
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,159
traits

944
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,960
yeah it's a really good question and

945
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,559
uh the thing is you know if we're

946
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,720
looking at something like

947
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,240
the big five right so this is how we

948
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,360
normally think about individual

949
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,880
differences we think about them in terms

950
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,279
of the big five as a psychologist

951
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,200
the thing about the big five is that it

952
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,039
my argument would be that it doesn't

953
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,720
carve nature at its joints right it's

954
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,399
this very top-down way of understanding

955
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,919
individual differences

956
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,919
and it doesn't it's it's completely

957
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,159
neutral about mechanism

958
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,480
with this with the autism schizotype

959
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,760
continuum

960
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,200
we're coming at things from the opposite

961
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,360
direction right so it's a bottom-up uh

962
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,640
way of thinking about individual

963
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,399
differences and

964
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,559
at least if this hypothesis is correct

965
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,120
we have a mechanism right if this does

966
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,720
explain the things I think it explains

967
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
in it we have a mechanism to explain it

968
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,559
now clearly

969
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,760
and you know if if it is just precision

970
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,640
weighting

971
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640
given the importance of precision

972
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,840
weighting within the predictive

973
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,360
processing framework we would expect

974
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,679
this to be a pretty important uh source

975
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,760
of individual differences however there

976
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,600
are clearly many other sources of

977
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,200
individual differences that are going to

978
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,120
interact with this in

979
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,240
uh unpredictable ways so for example you

980
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,600
know you're going to have you're going

981
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,720
to have

982
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,960
things that are that are mediated for

983
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,720
example by

984
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,320
blood testosterone levels right there

985
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,480
are clearly individual differences

986
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,240
mediated by

987
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,000
testosterone levels I don't think this

988
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,840
has much to do with that so how does

989
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,960
that interact with this how do you know

990
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,640
uh differences in something like

991
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,399
agreeableness which I don't think has

992
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,760
much to do with this you know how do

993
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,919
these things interact it's it's a big

994
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,799
question um my advisor and I are working

995
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,880
on a scale to measure this stuff so that

996
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,559
we can start unpacking some of those

997
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,919
interactions and trying to figure some

998
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,600
of that out but I would say that we're

999
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,360
just at the very beginning of that of

1000
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,679
that process so

1001
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,279
you know sort of conclude on your quest

1002
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,480
on your question

1003
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,919
um

1004
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,159
we don't really know I think that this

1005
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,760
is a large source of individual

1006
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,919
differences but

1007
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,080
in terms of how much of the variation

1008
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,159
and something like the big five trait of

1009
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,480
openness for example clearly this has

1010
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,840
something to do with variation and

1011
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,880
openness how much does it account for

1012
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,640
we also know that intelligence accounts

1013
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,399
for some of that variation how much does

1014
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,840
intelligence account for compared to

1015
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
this these are all open questions that

1016
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,120
that we're still

1017
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,919
we still haven't answered yet

1018
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,360
awesome thank you

1019
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,720
sure

1020
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,960
when I was seeing the

1021
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,840
side-by-side traits I was really struck

1022
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,240
by the mention of cancer

1023
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,840
and

1024
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,039
i am not an expert however these

1025
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,200
conditions in their clinical forms and

1026
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,960
potentially in their subclinical

1027
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,240
variances

1028
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,039
are associated with other organ systems

1029
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,360
like digestive system and skin and

1030
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,039
immunity and so on

1031
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,000
so I was just curious about what

1032
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,360
was

1033
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,880
the cancer empirical finding and how did

1034
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,480
this relate to

1035
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,799
multi-tissue multi-system effects and

1036
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,000
maybe even embodied cognition

1037
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,519
yeah yeah so it is the case that autism

1038
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,960
conditions are associated with an

1039
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,440
increased cancer rate uh with psychosis

1040
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,359
the evidence is a little bit more mixed

1041
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,119
so it is uh

1042
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,800
at least at the time that that Crespi

1043
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,639
and babcock wrote their paper

1044
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,599
there was good evidence that

1045
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,440
schizophrenia is associated with reduced

1046
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,199
cancer rates i've looked at some of the

1047
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,800
evidence more recently with

1048
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,719
schizophrenia I think that that that

1049
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,639
finding is still solid with bipolar

1050
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,159
disorder which is another psychosis

1051
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,159
spectrum condition uh the findings are

1052
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,800
definitely more mixed either way the the

1053
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
fact that schizophrenia is associated

1054
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,480
with reduced cancer is a very strange

1055
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,040
finding uh and the reason you know main

1056
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,719
reason why is because schizophrenia is

1057
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,239
pretty much associated with everything

1058
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,320
negative you can think of I mean the

1059
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,599
fact that it's it's associated with

1060
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,280
reduced cancer rates

1061
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,159
is strange just in light of that fact

1062
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,199
um

1063
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,599
athena activists wrote a book

1064
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,000
about cancer in 2018 I wish I could

1065
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,760
remember the name of that book

1066
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,119
but

1067
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,960
in that book she talked about so she

1068
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,640
didn't talk about it in terms of autism

1069
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,400
and psychosis but she talked about it in

1070
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,640
terms of imprinted genes so I i said

1071
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,480
that autism is associated with

1072
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,720
paternally expressed genes and psychosis

1073
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,800
is associated with maternally expressed

1074
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,760
genes

1075
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,520
um

1076
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,760
with imprinted genes

1077
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,240
what happens is that the genes that are

1078
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,640
that come from your dad they promote

1079
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,440
your dad's genetic interests now the

1080
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,119
thing about human beings is that we do

1081
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,760
not have complete paternity certainty

1082
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,640
meaning

1083
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,640
that it's not always you don't always

1084
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,720
know if you're a man you don't always

1085
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,839
know that the kids are yours right uh as

1086
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,280
a mother you know that all the kids are

1087
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,200
yours and you don't always know as a man

1088
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,400
they're gonna have kids with the same

1089
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,119
with the same woman so the paternally

1090
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,200
expressed genes have an interest in

1091
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,440
promoting growth they have an interest

1092
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,040
in taking as much of the mother's

1093
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,520
resources as they can

1094
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,599
and that is what they do and because

1095
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,760
they promote growth if they're hyper

1096
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,320
expressed they will also end up

1097
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
promoting cancer because cancer is

1098
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,760
something that uh that results from too

1099
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,119
much of you know the hormones that

1100
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,760
promote growth it can result from that

1101
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,160
on the other side with psychosis

1102
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,760
because it's associated with maternally

1103
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,280
expressed genes

1104
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,640
so as I said it's associated with

1105
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,400
undergrowth and infancy it's also

1106
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,280
associated with reduced suckling so

1107
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,560
kids who grow grow up to have

1108
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,400
schizophrenia they don't suckle as much

1109
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,599
they don't take as much of their

1110
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,040
mother's milk

1111
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,800
they also um there's evidence that they

1112
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,640
also just tend to be more calm as

1113
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,160
children

1114
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,079
and this is the the idea of the theory

1115
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,800
here is that this is because

1116
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,240
they are promoting their mother's

1117
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,400
interests right they have more they're

1118
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,760
they're expressing their mother's genes

1119
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,920
more and that promotes their the things

1120
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,280
that are interest that are in the

1121
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,560
interest of the mother's genetic

1122
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,079
interests so that would be reduced

1123
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,880
growth reduce suckling being an easier

1124
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,520
baby they take care of and so on uh so

1125
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,160
that's the that's the the most um i

1126
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,359
think that's the most prominent

1127
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,200
explanation for why we see this cancer

1128
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,040
difference

1129
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,960
that answers the question

1130
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,119
very interesting and

1131
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,040
staying with that topic of

1132
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,359
intergenerational imprinting

1133
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,520
that part was interesting to me as an

1134
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,400
insect biologist because

1135
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,839
parental imprinting is often used to be

1136
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,720
exploring differences in phenotype

1137
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,240
across nest mates within a colony

1138
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,320
so

1139
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,040
is this a key

1140
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,880
uh

1141
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,760
domain of imprinting are imprinting

1142
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,880
effects

1143
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,760
widespread outside of this

1144
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,880
uh diametric model and what does this

1145
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,960
imprinting mechanism tell us about

1146
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,359
intergenerational epigenetic effects

1147
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,280
more broadly

1148
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,800
yeah so

1149
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,480
in terms of the effect of imprinting so

1150
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,480
i think that they're I i'm confident

1151
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,880
that imprinting plays a role

1152
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,800
in variation in this continuum but how

1153
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,560
much of a role I think is very much up

1154
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,640
in the air I don't think that we have a

1155
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,280
good idea of

1156
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,839
how many genes are actually imprinted uh

1157
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,280
the the number of genes that are said to

1158
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,520
be imprinted is about 200.

1159
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,000
both my advisor and I have expressed our

1160
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
doubts about this we think that it's

1161
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,680
probably more widespread than that and

1162
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,440
there are difficulties in picking up on

1163
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,200
something so you could have partial

1164
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
imprinting for example uh that it would

1165
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,960
be more difficult to pick up on

1166
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,200
uh but yeah so

1167
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,079
in terms of how this

1168
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,240
i I think it's pretty important uh

1169
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,079
christopher badcock who was one of the

1170
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,079
the authors on the on the first paper

1171
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,440
he's written a couple of books about

1172
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,119
this he's made the case that it's very

1173
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,240
important

1174
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
um I published a paper

1175
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,839
a couple years ago

1176
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,680
showing that people high in positive

1177
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,320
schizotype they tend to

1178
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,480
migrate more often or you know what i

1179
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,599
what we actually showed is that they

1180
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,599
have more intentions to migrate we've

1181
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,880
argued that that would lead to more

1182
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,000
migration but they at least say that

1183
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,079
they they are more likely to or they

1184
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,320
they want to move to other locations

1185
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,839
more now what you see in the animal

1186
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,440
literature

1187
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,160
is that dispersal is often a mechanism

1188
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,400
to reduce competition among

1189
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
among family members essentially

1190
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,320
you don't want to be competing with all

1191
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,920
of your siblings

1192
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,359
maybe that has something to do with it

1193
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,800
here it's a little different with humans

1194
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,880
because we're so cooperative but if we

1195
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,240
were being consistent with the animal

1196
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,599
literature that would be consistent with

1197
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,960
the animal literature on that on that

1198
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,000
kind of stuff

1199
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,280
um

1200
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,720
yeah there's there's some very strange

1201
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
findings associated with this too

1202
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,560
i feel like are very controversial but

1203
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,520
i'll mention them anyways um

1204
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,160
so there was a book written so there was

1205
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,480
a paper and I i'm putting forward this

1206
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,960
stuff as very speculative so I want to

1207
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,560
be clear about that

1208
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,320
these are speculative things but there's

1209
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,839
a paper

1210
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,000
written a couple years ago about

1211
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,160
imprinting making the case

1212
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,560
that paternally expressed genes in

1213
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,599
humans

1214
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,760
will be associated with more war-like

1215
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,680
behaviors

1216
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,520
so and this is because

1217
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,720
humans are thought to

1218
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,000
was the word be more patrilocal so it is

1219
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,839
the the women who tend to disperse more

1220
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,000
often which means that you're the the

1221
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
people who are in your group are more

1222
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
likely to be your male relatives

1223
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,440
and

1224
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,640
they make an argument that that will

1225
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,800
lead to an increased uh

1226
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,119
group-like behavior in all this

1227
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,640
now

1228
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,240
a couple of findings that are associated

1229
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,920
with that which which are strange at

1230
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,000
least and that they might be associated

1231
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
with that there was a book published a

1232
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,839
couple years ago called the engineers of

1233
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,680
jihad and

1234
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,440
what they what they pointed out in that

1235
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,720
book is that

1236
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,480
people in engineering and technical

1237
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,720
professions are massively over

1238
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,359
represented among radical islamists and

1239
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,359
they're massively overrepresented among

1240
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,839
radical right-wingers which is a little

1241
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,680
surprising to me but the the data is

1242
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,200
very clear on that

1243
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,119
and I can't think of more

1244
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,200
war-like ideologies than those two you

1245
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,520
know uh if we're gonna be consistent

1246
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,440
with that with that theory now again i

1247
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,119
regard that as speculative but it's it's

1248
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,960
an interesting finding nonetheless we

1249
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,839
also see that people in the

1250
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,280
humanities uh who tend to be higher in

1251
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,800
positive schizotypes so they are the

1252
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,119
sort of artsy types they tend to be so

1253
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,040
people in the humanities are definitely

1254
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,319
more

1255
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,079
left-wing than other people

1256
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,160
and that's associated with ideologies

1257
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,400
that are sort of against war more often

1258
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,760
uh so

1259
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,599
so it's kind of an interesting finding

1260
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,680
um I would like to explore it more but i

1261
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,119
i don't know

1262
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,640
i would say it's definitely speculative

1263
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,079
anyways there's a lot of interesting

1264
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,079
implications of this that again have yet

1265
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,800
to be explored

1266
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,640
it's one of those experiments where you

1267
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,880
want a small sample size

1268
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,359
pretty rare for biology

1269
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,960
um

1270
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,520
a few more areas I think that would be

1271
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,440
awesome to explore

1272
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,720
so

1273
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,640
mixing it up a little bit

1274
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,040
how does what you're sharing and

1275
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,319
learning

1276
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,280
help us think about how to be respectful

1277
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,240
in our facilitation and communication in

1278
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,119
neurodiverse settings

1279
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,280
yeah so I think it's important to

1280
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,040
recognize that

1281
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,920
uh

1282
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,599
there are strengths and weaknesses

1283
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,040
associated with the with the sides of

1284
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,560
the continuum so

1285
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,720
um

1286
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,960
you know I i think that we often

1287
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,960
we often tend to think that the the

1288
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,040
people who think very differently than

1289
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,400
us and it's easy to come you know it's

1290
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
easy to sort of tell if somebody uh has

1291
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,480
a very different thinking style than you

1292
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,440
um

1293
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,280
i think that it's it's very easy to sort

1294
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,520
of think that that other thinking style

1295
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,560
is is less useful in whatever way

1296
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,480
um I think it's important to understand

1297
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,520
that

1298
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,280
you know really the implication of this

1299
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,119
is that we're we're all good

1300
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,800
um and of course there you know there's

1301
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,800
an iq thing as well that plays into this

1302
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,079
but we're all we're all

1303
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,760
going to be relatively better or worse

1304
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,839
at picking up on different kinds of

1305
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:50,960
patterns

1306
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,480
uh so people on that autistic side

1307
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,920
they're very good at picking up on these

1308
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,319
precise patterns right that are you know

1309
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,400
it's associated with engineering

1310
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,160
computer programming physics and

1311
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,800
mathematics and the more noisy patterns

1312
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,359
and the more

1313
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,599
not only noisy patterns but what's the

1314
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:08,290
word

1315
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:10,640
[Music]

1316
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,480
unstructured problems right so

1317
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,960
unstructured problems uh that require

1318
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,560
these sort of ins so there is evidence

1319
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,240
that people high in positive schizotype

1320
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,920
are better at solving insect problems

1321
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,520
for example like the nine dot problem if

1322
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,200
anybody is familiar with that

1323
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,280
um and so that's a that's an important

1324
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,800
difference and yeah I mean we're you

1325
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,440
know

1326
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,839
um I think that understanding this can

1327
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,240
help people to be a little more

1328
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,599
empathetic towards people who think

1329
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,480
differently than them yeah

1330
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,640
and also seeing like

1331
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,720
cognitive diversity amongst the nest

1332
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,680
mates

1333
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,000
in the context of the decision that the

1334
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,280
colony has to make

1335
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,599
can be harnessed and so that's very

1336
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,160
useful and definitely there's a

1337
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,280
long supply chain and last mile to

1338
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,520
respecting people in different specific

1339
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,000
contexts but definitely this helps link

1340
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,240
up a lot of the general themes like you

1341
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,319
mentioned explore exploit generalist

1342
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,440
specialist

1343
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,119
these are broader trends in biology and

1344
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,599
in statistics and machine learning and

1345
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:12,480
then

1346
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,280
the dance and the art and the science

1347
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,280
potentially is about

1348
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,280
bringing to bear

1349
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,240
these empirically informed and

1350
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,960
analytically derived in some situations

1351
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,839
frameworks and then meeting

1352
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:28,560
with

1353
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,400
the situatedness

1354
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,280
of someone in their own n equals one

1355
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,599
trajectory to really like

1356
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:36,960
make it work

1357
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,200
in that one situation

1358
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,960
yeah

1359
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,480
yeah

1360
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,920
okay um

1361
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,920
there's a a sequence of questions I have

1362
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,920
on attention but

1363
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,359
first in the very beginning you

1364
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,200
mentioned um

1365
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,680
finding active inference and predictive

1366
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,440
processing framework

1367
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,560
and

1368
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,400
kind of latching onto that and using

1369
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,400
that to continue building your research

1370
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,480
direction so

1371
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,280
what

1372
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,240
was it

1373
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,599
from a

1374
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,160
framework feature perspective

1375
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,680
that you felt was going to be providing

1376
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,880
a better explanation or prediction

1377
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,400
just how do you

1378
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,880
sense make amidst all of these decades

1379
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,680
and decades of bayesian brain predictive

1380
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,560
processing and coding active inference

1381
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,800
all these different threads in cognitive

1382
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,880
sciences and neuroscience

1383
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,880
what makes you

1384
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,480
go the way that you're going with your

1385
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,079
phd

1386
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,079
yeah I mean well you know I think i've

1387
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,880
read almost every theory of autism that

1388
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,079
there is you know like in terms of

1389
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,920
cognitive theories I mean obscure

1390
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,599
dissertations and all this stuff

1391
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,040
um

1392
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,200
the reason I i came to this predictive

1393
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,079
processing understanding is just because

1394
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,119
it's the one that explains

1395
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,800
so of course I was coming at this from

1396
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,880
the perspective of the diametric model

1397
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,280
right and this is the only thing that i

1398
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,680
found that that adequately to my mind

1399
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,240
explains both sides of this continuum

1400
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,880
uh other theories of autism you know

1401
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,319
maybe they maybe they work for

1402
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,240
explaining some features of autism but i

1403
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,160
needed something that worked for both

1404
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,400
right and this was this was what worked

1405
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,119
for both and so when i

1406
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,280
uh when I realized that and I actually i

1407
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,800
sort of had that revelation while I was

1408
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,280
reading Andy Clark's book really uh

1409
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,920
surfing uncertainty um when I realized

1410
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,640
that I i realized that you know I i

1411
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,680
should

1412
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,280
learn more about this framework and so i

1413
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,200
sort of started consuming literature on

1414
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,599
predictive processing very uh

1415
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:38,880
obsessively

1416
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,319
and

1417
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,319
at this point I think it's uh so another

1418
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,000
project I have you know I would like to

1419
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:44,960
work on

1420
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,960
is integrating some of the insights from

1421
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,880
evolutionary psychology with with

1422
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,400
predictive processing I think that's an

1423
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,520
integration that could be really

1424
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,480
interesting

1425
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,000
um

1426
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,440
but yeah that was basically it it's just

1427
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,079
that this uh that explanation the van

1428
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,079
der kroys and colleagues in their 2014

1429
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,520
paper you know the explanation they put

1430
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,599
forward for autism not only explained

1431
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,440
autism but the opposite explained the

1432
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,720
other side for me and so that's kind of

1433
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,720
why I sort of latched on to this

1434
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,480
this framework

1435
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,119
and do you think following in that that

1436
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,240
there are unique explanations or unique

1437
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,960
experimental designs that would help us

1438
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,200
reduce our uncertainty about some of

1439
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,040
these contending theories

1440
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,839
yeah yeah I mean for the predictive

1441
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,760
processing uh

1442
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,880
theory you know we need more experiments

1443
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,800
on attention right because this is the

1444
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,400
most I think this is sort of the most

1445
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,319
straight well you know straightforward

1446
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:39,680
but it's it's the most obvious

1447
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,119
implication right if

1448
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,240
these are really differences in

1449
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,319
precision weighting we should be able to

1450
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,319
precisely uh look at differences in

1451
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,960
attention along this continuum and

1452
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,200
it's not always clear

1453
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,040
you know I i've read uh you know quite a

1454
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,800
bit of the experimental work on autism

1455
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,000
in relation to this there's been a lot

1456
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,720
of it it's not always clear

1457
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,720
what the predictions actually are right

1458
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,720
some sometimes um yeah sometimes the

1459
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,439
predictions are not straightforward

1460
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,400
you know this this certainly from a

1461
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,400
retroactive perspective I think it

1462
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,720
explains all this stuff really well uh

1463
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,559
in terms of predicting new stuff right

1464
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,319
it's it gets more complicated it just

1465
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,559
does you know um and

1466
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:19,680
so one of the things that we're going to

1467
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,720
do um for my phd is we're definitely

1468
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,280
going to look at the scope of attention

1469
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,720
so

1470
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,559
it is the case that like people high in

1471
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:29,839
the in the trade of openness to

1472
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,800
experience uh they have a wider scope of

1473
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,280
attention right and we think this should

1474
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,440
be associated with positive schizotype

1475
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,880
and there's good evidence that people

1476
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,200
with autism have a narrower scope of

1477
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,800
attention it's been called tunnel vision

1478
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,400
they've called it tunnel vision uh we

1479
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,400
want to demonstrate this in non-clinical

1480
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,640
populations and uh you know using the

1481
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,680
scale that we're making we want to

1482
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,359
demonstrate this and so you know that's

1483
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,280
one direction that we're going with this

1484
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,800
um

1485
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,480
yeah i'll stop there I think that's all

1486
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,839
i have to say

1487
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,480
well awesome it leads to a few attention

1488
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,000
related questions that'll be great to

1489
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,880
dive into but but one reflection there

1490
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,599
is you described it as being able to

1491
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,319
retroaddictively connect a lot of dots

1492
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,400
through the usage of predictive

1493
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,839
frameworks

1494
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,520
however

1495
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,040
that is

1496
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,800
like one of those sides in the

1497
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,400
discussion today

1498
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,599
are we looking to um or which side are

1499
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,400
we looking to err on in that regression

1500
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,880
example was provided do we want the wavy

1501
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,520
line where the next batch of 10 points

1502
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,440
the wavy line is probably going to be

1503
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,200
totally off base because the initial

1504
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,520
wavy line was overfit

1505
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,680
or would we be okay with getting

1506
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,920
directional correctness

1507
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,000
but very little explanatory power like a

1508
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,880
high residual per point and the the

1509
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,680
optimum that science as this distributed

1510
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,640
system

1511
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,680
would be

1512
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,079
kind of navigating and weaving around

1513
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,319
that path of least action in that space

1514
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,800
would be the bayes optimal

1515
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,200
regression model which is actually what

1516
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,520
is described by the bayesian information

1517
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,400
criterion or the AIC its relative and

1518
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,119
those are statistical criteria

1519
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,559
that balance

1520
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,920
exactly that trade-off between a highly

1521
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,000
parameterized model that explains all

1522
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,079
the variants and then an under

1523
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,559
parameterized model too few parameters

1524
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,720
that explains maybe even

1525
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,720
a good chunk of the variation but then

1526
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,559
ultimately leaves a lot on the table

1527
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,640
when there's still like a a lot of um

1528
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,319
value to be gained by adding some more

1529
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:32,559
parameters so I was just seeing like

1530
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,319
that kind of bayesian information

1531
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,559
approach and then that's like the sweet

1532
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:37,440
spot

1533
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,559
but everybody moment to moment and year

1534
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,119
to year and life to life it's like a

1535
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,559
swarm weaving in that valley

1536
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,720
right and that is what constitutes part

1537
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,000
of our

1538
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,800
species level neurodiversity

1539
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,359
well you know I mean it's a good thing

1540
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,119
we have a lot of scientists working on

1541
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,960
this problem right so we can especially

1542
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,720
with autism you know so we can kind of

1543
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,520
go

1544
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,200
uh separate ways and meet in the middle

1545
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,400
a little bit you know we can kind of

1546
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,720
explore different different paths

1547
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,160
um yeah yeah go ahead

1548
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,000
let's talk a little bit about attention

1549
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,200
sure it's definitely a core term in

1550
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,440
active inference and it's um

1551
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,240
really one of the the tenants even

1552
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,000
though in reward-centric paradigms

1553
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,720
attention has been used like in neural

1554
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,280
networks that have attention and so it's

1555
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,599
interesting to see how even in a reward

1556
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,680
first paradigm still attentional

1557
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,800
features are brought in whereas active

1558
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,960
inference and predictive processing have

1559
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,000
a principled and analytically derived

1560
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,720
approach to attention so

1561
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,680
what is attention and what are the uh in

1562
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,680
a william james fashion what are the

1563
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:56,319
varieties of the attention experience

1564
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,119
yeah that's a tough question uh I mean i

1565
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,440
i've seen arguments you know within i

1566
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,280
think first in uh first and wrote a

1567
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,960
paper a couple years back arguing that

1568
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,240
there are these two

1569
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,079
uh different kinds of attention within

1570
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:09,359
within this framework right so there's

1571
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,480
like salience and then there is uh i

1572
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,520
forget what he called the other one but

1573
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,200
i'm not so sure that these are not

1574
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,880
really uh the same thing um

1575
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,119
you know what what it is to to pay

1576
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,880
attention to something my understanding

1577
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,119
within this framework is to treat

1578
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,720
you treat the input as if it's highly

1579
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,079
precise right you're treating it as if

1580
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,920
it's highly precise in a bayesian sense

1581
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,200
that means that you're treating it as if

1582
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,400
it's important

1583
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,079
it means it's having a large effect on

1584
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,680
updating your model

1585
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,920
and that includes you know because this

1586
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,520
is a hierarchical thing that also

1587
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,760
includes stuff that's generated by the

1588
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,520
the internal model right so you can give

1589
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,920
a high weight to you know a predict you

1590
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,359
know a prediction that's generated from

1591
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:50,640
your internal model so you're paying

1592
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,720
attention uh to what's going on inside

1593
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,480
of your own sort of internal model as

1594
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,359
well

1595
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,480
uh as far as the varieties of attention

1596
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,800
yeah I mean I i don't think I have a

1597
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,640
good answer to that uh I don't I don't

1598
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,359
know

1599
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,760
probably uh but that's but that's how i

1600
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,000
would define attention anyways uh with

1601
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,839
this within this model

1602
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,839
well it seems like a really interesting

1603
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,680
direction to

1604
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,559
see what kind of formalisms and models

1605
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,400
could underlie those um very

1606
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,280
gestalt capturing senses of attention

1607
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,800
like diffuse and laser and narrow but

1608
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,119
those are like spotlight metaphors but

1609
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,000
then

1610
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
where's the spotlight in the prediction

1611
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,720
and so it kind of crosses domains and so

1612
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,119
there's a lot of interesting um

1613
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,160
things there and yes what you said about

1614
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,359
uh attention being paid or salience in a

1615
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,119
bayesian statistical framework is

1616
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,000
exactly that like if there was a prior

1617
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,720
about the temperature and no attention

1618
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,040
was being paid to incoming thermometer

1619
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,720
readings then

1620
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,280
that prior would just play out whether

1621
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,920
it was a flat or whether it was expected

1622
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,839
to change from a top down hierarchical

1623
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,240
model whereas if a lot of attention were

1624
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,400
being paid to the thermometer readings

1625
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,920
in the extreme

1626
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,880
you just flip your best prediction to

1627
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,680
whatever the thermometer said less last

1628
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,359
and so then thinking back to those

1629
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,160
regressions that you showed

1630
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,559
they could be understood as in in a

1631
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:21,920
static sense

1632
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,599
as being like what is the relationship

1633
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,200
between

1634
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,359
the person's height and how friendly

1635
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:28,880
they are to me

1636
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,400
and then that could be like sort of an

1637
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,640
all at once static regression about

1638
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,800
features of the world or like when it's

1639
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,400
raining what is the temperature like so

1640
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,960
just sort of across different instances

1641
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,119
regression that helps capture the

1642
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,520
direction and magnitude and reliability

1643
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,079
of some causal outcomes but it's also

1644
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,640
interesting to think about that x-axis

1645
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,839
as time

1646
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,000
and the y-axis is tracking again like

1647
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,520
temperature or some other thing in the

1648
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,400
world

1649
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,920
and there's like the high attention

1650
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,119
whiplash with the noisy measurements and

1651
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,880
it's like things are very volatile

1652
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,760
but they're being fit well

1653
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,839
but it's just feels like things are

1654
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,799
volatile and then the other extreme

1655
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,480
would be just that

1656
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,319
straight regression line

1657
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:17,200
where

1658
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,119
things are simple

1659
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,359
however there's a lot of variability and

1660
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,480
that actually also plays into certain

1661
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,040
bayesian work on for example like

1662
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,240
narrative

1663
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,160
and what is called conspiracy theory

1664
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,680
thinking

1665
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,839
simple

1666
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,319
that's the simple regression line that's

1667
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,240
narrative and then it's like well then

1668
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,760
why is it why is

1669
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,520
this why are these five examples in

1670
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,280
front of us not the case if that's

1671
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,720
totally the way things are in the world

1672
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,200
that a is associated with b but here's

1673
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,799
five a and it's not associated with b

1674
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,799
it's like right well there's error to

1675
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,720
explain there's residual but that

1676
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,440
doesn't dissuade me from believing that

1677
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,839
there is this relationship in the world

1678
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,599
that's true

1679
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:00,880
yeah it's interesting uh you know like

1680
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,400
the conspiratorial thinking is

1681
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,559
associated with positive schizotyping

1682
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,160
empirically which is what you would

1683
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,760
expect right you know it's a very simple

1684
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,880
explanation it explains a lot uh but

1685
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,960
it's you know it's a little bit unmoored

1686
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,119
from the actual data something like that

1687
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,319
it can tolerate high variance

1688
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:22,319
between the prediction and the

1689
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:23,680
observation

1690
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,520
and that can be accommodated in a

1691
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,079
framework where more attention is being

1692
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,640
paid to the narrative prior so the

1693
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,280
posterior is not updating that much

1694
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,760
seeing a hundred examples of something

1695
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,400
happening doesn't really update my

1696
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,799
likelihood on what I think is gonna

1697
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,839
happen next

1698
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:44,880
um yeah

1699
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,160
[Music]

1700
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,000
it was it's often the case that you know

1701
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,920
with like conspiracy conspiratorial

1702
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,079
thinking evidence against the conspiracy

1703
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,400
is taken as evidence for the conspiracy

1704
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,400
because it's just evidence that they're

1705
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,240
really really good at hiding it right

1706
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,119
like uh you know like no evidence that

1707
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,200
this is going on is actually evidence of

1708
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,960
just how good they are at hiding it you

1709
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,040
know so you can incorporate almost any

1710
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,960
data into those kinds of models right

1711
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,400
it's an extremely

1712
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,240
uh yeah it's an extremely top-down

1713
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,079
biased way of thinking about the world

1714
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,760
and I think that's why it's associated

1715
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,280
with positive schizotypes

1716
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,440
and

1717
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,079
it leads to one attention related

1718
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,280
question which is

1719
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,480
how do we

1720
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,920
train our attention or how do we shape

1721
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,750
our attention

1722
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:31,839
[Music]

1723
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:34,480
to be who we want to be

1724
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,240
well I i think I have two answers to

1725
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,440
that question

1726
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,839
uh the first one is

1727
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,480
meditation I think can help but

1728
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,160
also

1729
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,319
you know I i've had

1730
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,880
issues with with my own attention and

1731
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,720
one of the things that made me better at

1732
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,160
paying attention to things that I may

1733
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,760
not have wanted to pay attention to but

1734
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,799
that I really

1735
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,400
that I really need to is just having

1736
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,720
clear goals right it like gets your like

1737
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,440
if you have clear written goals it gets

1738
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,559
your dopaminergic system on on your side

1739
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,559
right so instead of uh you know so you

1740
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:10,400
get that little that little reward every

1741
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,359
time you

1742
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:12,880
do your physics homework or whatever

1743
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,400
which you may not want to pay attention

1744
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,280
to

1745
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,880
but if you're getting rewarded for it

1746
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,680
because

1747
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,040
you know you have a clear goal that

1748
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,720
you're moving towards it makes it easier

1749
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,040
to pay attention another thing I would

1750
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,240
say

1751
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,040
so

1752
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,000
in in

1753
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,680
i think that's really

1754
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,920
it's under-appreciated how much our

1755
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,280
attention is related to our values

1756
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,839
you know when we value something it

1757
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:38,480
directs our attention towards relevant

1758
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,920
towards relation towards things that are

1759
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,599
relevant to the goal and so having clear

1760
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:43,440
goals is really important the other

1761
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,200
thing I would say

1762
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,160
is

1763
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,000
instead of you know instead of talking

1764
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,160
about changing uh or improving our

1765
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,720
attention is to put yourself

1766
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,119
into situations that are good for for

1767
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,520
your kind of attention style so you know

1768
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,280
i'm somebody who

1769
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,280
is not on the autistic side of that

1770
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,480
continuum

1771
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,400
i would never have been an engineer

1772
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,160
okay or a physicist or anything like

1773
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,760
that you know it's not my thing

1774
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,760
um I had to put myself in a situation

1775
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,280
where I could use my intellectual

1776
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,799
ability the intellectual abilities that

1777
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,960
i have I love these big picture things i

1778
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,559
love seeing all the dots between all

1779
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,000
these disparate things you know that's

1780
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,680
what that's what I do

1781
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,680
i had to find a way to put myself in a

1782
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,520
position where I could use that

1783
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,559
um so some of it is is is finding a way

1784
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,400
to get yourself in the right context

1785
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,000
that allows you to use your own

1786
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,559
attention style in the right way so

1787
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,079
it's not all about you know partly it's

1788
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,000
changing yourself but also partly it's

1789
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,839
changing uh the environment that you're

1790
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,520
in so that you can you can be who you

1791
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,760
are to some degree

1792
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,760
and that's definitely echoed

1793
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,160
in the ways that an active inference

1794
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,040
entity can reduce its variational or

1795
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,760
expected free energy which is it can

1796
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,839
update its generative model it can

1797
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:56,640
change its mind or it can engage in

1798
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,640
action it can change the world

1799
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,799
and I feel like that

1800
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,319
dialectic

1801
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,079
you know yesterday I tried to change the

1802
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,640
world today I tried to change myself and

1803
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,880
the way that we wouldn't want our

1804
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,880
actions to be

1805
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,839
malappropriated in the world or to be

1806
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:15,680
believing something falsely like that

1807
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,599
there isn't influence of our actions in

1808
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:20,400
the world but also it can be extreme and

1809
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,599
unhelpful when people have

1810
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,040
far-ranging beliefs about their own

1811
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,440
role and so like

1812
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,000
social cognition and how that gets

1813
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,599
mediated

1814
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,799
with attention and shared attention

1815
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,359
thinking through other minds and joint

1816
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,200
attention general synchrony a lot of

1817
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,440
these active inference

1818
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,760
ideas are really in a stage where

1819
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,559
some of the continents in the map have

1820
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,480
been laid out

1821
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,119
and there's a lot of exploration

1822
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,240
to go fractal exploration to go

1823
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,290
to move from

1824
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:00,720
[Music]

1825
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,640
framing different things as like a

1826
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,400
deficit of reward to a perturbation

1827
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,000
of precision

1828
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,040
which also navigates the balance with

1829
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,319
pathology

1830
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,480
because we can say that

1831
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,000
bayes optimal cognition is occurring

1832
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,040
given the priors and the attention

1833
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,920
if this is the prior and here's how much

1834
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,680
or this type of attention that's being

1835
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,480
paid

1836
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,359
that's not a irrational or an even

1837
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:31,680
necessarily an incorrect it might be an

1838
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,319
outcome that isn't valued highly under

1839
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,799
some social criterion or another but

1840
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:38,960
then again that's that imperative to ask

1841
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,799
like what could be different in the

1842
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:42,960
person's developmental trajectory and

1843
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,640
their niche which includes their social

1844
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,400
niche so

1845
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,799
it is just opening up the discussion

1846
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:51,280
around these topics so it's a good time

1847
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,760
to be starting your phd in it

1848
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,079
yeah yeah definitely yeah with the with

1849
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,400
the psychopathology I mean I really love

1850
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,160
this you know the the

1851
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,680
uh this framework for thinking about

1852
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,280
psychopathology because there is that

1853
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,520
right like a lot of times what we label

1854
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,520
as psychopathology is actually you're

1855
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,640
you're working just the way you're

1856
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,760
supposed to

1857
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,599
um but I do think that there are there

1858
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:13,119
are times where we get caught in like

1859
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:14,720
these feedback loops right we get caught

1860
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,559
in these in these sort of uh

1861
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:18,160
mark miller has some good papers about

1862
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,559
this in relation to addiction and things

1863
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:21,839
like that you know we get caught in this

1864
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:23,200
uh you know what what they refer to as

1865
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,960
reciprocal narrowing

1866
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,240
and

1867
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,920
it's like we're reducing prediction

1868
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,520
error in a local

1869
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,760
aspect but we're ignoring all of the all

1870
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,760
of the other areas in which we could be

1871
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,039
reducing prediction error so like if

1872
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:36,559
you're addicted to a drug

1873
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:39,200
of some kind if it's like a dopaminergic

1874
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,599
uh substance it's going to tell you that

1875
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:43,119
like you're doing great right you're

1876
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:46,160
reducing prediction error you know uh

1877
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,240
you know in an awesome way but uh

1878
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,760
everywhere around you you know it's just

1879
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,920
chaos right um so anyways so yeah i

1880
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,359
think this is a really cool framework

1881
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:55,440
for thinking about uh psychopathology in

1882
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,440
general

1883
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,359
and bring it into that extended

1884
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:03,839
context

1885
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:04,559
if

1886
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:06,720
one cell were growing at the expense of

1887
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,640
others if it were having high fitness

1888
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,039
that's the kind of evolutionary lens

1889
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:14,000
if it were doing uh if it were modifying

1890
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,319
the signaling environment so it was

1891
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:18,079
getting exactly the hormone levels it

1892
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:19,839
expected

1893
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,440
even if those were potentially within a

1894
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,799
healthy range

1895
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,960
that might have deleterious consequences

1896
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,039
at the group

1897
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,520
fitness or free energy minimization or

1898
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,440
reward perspective and so we see kind of

1899
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,520
this braiding

1900
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,599
when things are working

1901
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:36,559
then

1902
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:39,359
they can be analyzed with

1903
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:42,559
fitness reward precision and when things

1904
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,280
fail additionally we kind of see all of

1905
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,280
those different framings

1906
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,799
coalesce again

1907
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:50,319
and I think the interesting and

1908
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:52,000
informative space

1909
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,240
will be to understand

1910
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,559
where those frameworks differ not just

1911
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:59,119
to justify or explore scientific

1912
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:01,520
hypotheses but truly to be in that gray

1913
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,039
zone and in that situation where it does

1914
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,880
matter how we act and whether we're

1915
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,440
justifying our actions with this or that

1916
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,920
flavor of evolution or reward or

1917
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,760
precision type thinking

1918
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,039
yeah

1919
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,039
yeah it's it's uh yeah and it's it's

1920
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,720
exciting to sort of be at the beginning

1921
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,480
of this kind of stuff I mean I think

1922
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,240
we're really just getting started

1923
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,559
um in terms of you know understanding

1924
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,319
individual differences from a predictive

1925
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:27,839
processing perspective and

1926
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:30,559
psychopathology um

1927
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:31,920
you know like we're we're working on

1928
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,559
some stuff about psychosis too um

1929
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,839
and you know how

1930
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,160
positive schizotype uh sort of the the

1931
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,240
sort of next step in this in this at

1932
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,240
least in the theoretical part of this

1933
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,760
one of the implications of the

1934
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,200
hypothesis I talked about in this paper

1935
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,680
so with autism and van der kroys and

1936
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,880
colleagues talked about this in their

1937
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,200
2014 paper prediction matching should

1938
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,039
take place at relatively low levels of

1939
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,960
the processing hierarchy right so like

1940
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,720
more the more concrete levels of the

1941
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,799
processing hierarchy uh for people with

1942
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:02,640
autism and that is sort of what we find

1943
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,960
it's a very detail-oriented style

1944
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,559
but with positive schizotype you should

1945
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,640
see the opposite of prediction errors

1946
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,760
traveling farther up the hierarchy and

1947
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,760
what we think is happening in psychosis

1948
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,280
is basically like those prediction

1949
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,599
errors travel up to those

1950
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:19,119
at higher levels of the hierarchy like

1951
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,280
those are the those are the priors

1952
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,760
upon which many other priors depend and

1953
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,240
so if you disrupt those priors right you

1954
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,480
lose precision not only on those but on

1955
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,400
everything that they're dependent on and

1956
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,240
if that happens very suddenly you can

1957
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,480
get a massive increase in entropy and a

1958
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,640
massive increase in in behavioral and

1959
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,880
psychological entropy and kind of think

1960
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,520
that's what psychosis is um

1961
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,520
it's not entirely original to that idea

1962
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,520
but it just sort of talks about how it

1963
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,920
develops right because if we know that

1964
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,520
people who give a low weight to sensory

1965
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,720
input are

1966
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,720
are susceptible to it that tells us why

1967
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,000
they're susceptible right because those

1968
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,680
prediction errors are going to go up to

1969
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,760
those more high level priors if that

1970
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,240
makes sense

1971
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:04,799
is there anything else you want to add

1972
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:07,760
talk about ask

1973
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,359
uh

1974
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,520
i think i'm good man I really appreciate

1975
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,839
the opportunity to share my work and and

1976
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:16,000
have this conversation

1977
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,440
really good

1978
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,520
excellent best of luck with your

1979
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:22,400
continued research and education

1980
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,960
all right thank you Daniel see you later

1981
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,960
bye

1982
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,960
you
