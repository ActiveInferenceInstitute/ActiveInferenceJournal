1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,566
Speaker 1: So, Hello!

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,066
Speaker 1: Hi, everyone.

6
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:14,133
Welcome to the Active Inference Lab

7
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:17,500
and to the first Active Inference Gueststream.

8
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm here with our special guest,
Majid Beni.

9
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:25,433
And we're just really honored and excited
to be hearing your presentation.

10
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:29,366
We're going to be having a
about 30 minute presentation

11
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:32,133
on whatever you'd like to be speaking on.

12
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:35,600
And then I'm going to be
collecting questions from a live chat

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,800
and then relaying them to you.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,966
Speaker 1: And it was already just fun
to talk to you right before we started.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,633
So thanks again, Majid, and take it away.

16
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:45,000
Go for it.

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,500
Speaker 1: All right.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,033
Hello. Thank you very much.

19
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:51,966
I'm very excited to and I thank you

20
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:55,400
very much for giving me the chance
to present a part of my work. So

21
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:58,166
I'm basically beginning.

22
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,400
To speak what I've.

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,533
Speaker 1: Done, the parts of my work.

24
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:06,800
On our pre-interview principles.

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,833
Speaker 1: So I will try.

26
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,666
To share my screen. Right.

27
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:14,100
Now because I'm a great believer
in extended mind.

28
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,833
And you could do anything
without having my screen share

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,966
so you won't be able to see
my screen yet.

30
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:24,866
It looks perfect. Thank you. Perfect.

31
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:31,833
So I'm basically going to present
the parts of my.

32
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:35,200
Work in a recent paper, and since it was
critical, it's very critical.

33
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:37,500
I know you see more and more anything.

34
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,100
And the structure.

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,133
Speaker 1: Of this talk is quite straightforward.

36
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:46,533
So I briefly.

37
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,600
Speaker 1: Very.

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,566
Speaker 1: Briefly and with a very broad brush with
the speaker will create the principle.

39
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:53,566
And Marco, we had modernism.

40
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:55,700
So I gloss over.

41
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,100
Speaker 1: That technical stuff because.

42
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,866
Speaker 1: For one thing,

43
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:01,700
I'm a philosopher and I'm not very.

44
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,700
Speaker 1: Well versed in these technical
aspects of everything.

45
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,066
I'm going to present the core of my work,
which is about scientific models.

46
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,600
Speaker 1: So after that.

47
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,300
Speaker 1: I speak briefly about scientific models
and scientific modeling

48
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:18,433
and philosophy of science,
but coming from a background

49
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:21,366
of philosophy of science as. What

50
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:23,100
it is, the main.

51
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,666
Speaker 1: Part of my contribution
to this literature, being educated, to

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,100
look at it through the lens
of philosophy, of science

53
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,266
and usual scientific representation.

54
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:35,366
Then I'm going to

55
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,433
describe

56
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:41,600
microbial models
as some sort of scientific models that.

57
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:46,100
Scrutinize their relationship with
their target models in the real world.

58
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,900
Speaker 1: And see whether any of these.

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,500
Speaker 1: Descriptions of the relationship
between microbial models

60
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,133
and their target system
could support more coffee and.

61
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:55,900
Movies.

62
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:58,166
And briefly, at the end, I will.

63
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,666
Ask to. Evaluate.

64
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:04,200
Christopher and colleagues attempt

65
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,633
at developing more appropriate models
of along the lines of the structure.

66
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:15,000
So So most probably, you know, more.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,900
Speaker 1: Than we have created the critical
and predicted process.

68
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,600
The idea has been.

69
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,533
Speaker 1: Reintroduced to science, but

70
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,633
the roots of this idea
seems to be quite old.

71
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,000
But it has been.

72
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:34,500
Around refused to restore to science
by corporate and colleagues.

73
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,200
Speaker 1: And this is all based.

74
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,366
Speaker 1: On a simple and subtle idea.

75
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:42,133
So generally

76
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:45,266
it. Provides

77
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,733
a framework that explains
how a biological system explores

78
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:53,366
the random and unpredictable fluctuation
in its external environment

79
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:57,800
and can restrict itself to occupying
a limited number of the state

80
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,933
and therefore therefore survive
in some recognizable form.

81
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:06,100
So in order to be able.

82
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,466
Speaker 1: To resist those dispersing
the force of the environment,

83
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,500
the organism has to, in a nutshell,
have to keep.

84
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:16,500
The amount. Of its free energy.

85
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,533
Speaker 1: Low and predicted.

86
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:22,466
Processing some sort of material
application, indicating that then applied

87
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,700
to the brain of some broken system
such as yourselves.

88
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,133
In all creativity of minimizing.

89
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,133
Rain, you could be specified in terms of

90
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:35,600
minimization, of prediction error.

91
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:39,466
So there are very few models in the brain
and through a process of.

92
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:40,733
A top down.

93
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:44,233
Process, the brain
or the organism, and order to.

94
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:46,833
Apply these models.

95
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:47,433
To reality

96
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:48,866
or at least check them

97
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:52,733
against the reality, against the evidence
that receives from the external.

98
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:53,200
World.

99
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:54,600
And when.

100
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,433
Speaker 1: There is a discrepancy in zeros to.

101
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:02,466
Somehow revise.

102
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:06,533
The models updated model or at least
make changes to the environment,

103
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:07,500
so there is.

104
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,733
Speaker 1: Some sort of action by the.

105
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:12,233
Governmental action or overt action.

106
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:14,400
But acting. In France is the.

107
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,400
Speaker 1: Other side.

108
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:21,300
Minimization of prediction, error.

109
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,566
Speaker 1: And freestone and colleagues.

110
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:28,233
Made a freestone devil of free energy
principle into a fascinating theory

111
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:31,033
of consciousness
in terms of temporal richness

112
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:34,800
or temporal depths of generating models.

113
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,200
Speaker 1: So not only some organism can

114
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:38,900
minimize.

115
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,600
Speaker 1: Their creativity.

116
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,100
Speaker 1: And. Optimize
the representation of the environment,

117
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:49,566
they could also some hope for some sort
of foresight or prediction of.

118
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:50,400
The possible.

119
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,133
Speaker 1: Outcomes of their action
in the environment and.

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Speaker 1: It seems that this.

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Speaker 1: Capacity is somewhat tied with you.

122
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,000
Speaker 1: With conscious.

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,966
Speaker 1: Progresses or consciousness.

124
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:07,333
And of course there this idea of Markov
blankets.

125
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:10,466
Due to the appeal.

126
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:13,633
Introduced them I think in 1980s.

127
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,933
There are some sort of Bayesian rules
which.

128
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,466
Speaker 1: Could help.

129
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:23,300
Us to make a distinction
between cognition and the going forward

130
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,600
to cognition or independence between

131
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,900
internal and external spaces.

132
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:33,933
So on the literature
itself, free creativity.

133
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:36,100
Principle has been quite. Flourishing.

134
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,566
Quite a number of.

135
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:41,066
Scientists philosophers.

136
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:41,666
Have.

137
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:46,233
Contributed to developing this literature
and among the philosophers of up

138
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:48,400
to just to mention a few.

139
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,300
Speaker 1: Of our great people who.

140
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,400
Speaker 1: Contributed to such a

141
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:54,300
proposal and are shown.

142
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,766
Speaker 1: By lively and

143
00:06:57,733 --> 00:06:59,266
even people who are coming from a.

144
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:01,800
Background of philosophy or science
such as Mr.

145
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,900
Fine. Art, but have contributed.

146
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,633
Speaker 1: To this rich literature.

147
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:10,233
But what what's interesting is that.

148
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:12,266
The free energy creative code.

149
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,733
Has not been developed.

150
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,733
Into some sort of.

151
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:17,700
Metaphysical.

152
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,033
Speaker 1: Cases of cognition
or consciousness or brain.

153
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:24,600
So as far as I can see, this

154
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:28,100
paper.

155
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,466
Speaker 1: Which is the target paper of my paper,
incentives for Cartesian

156
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:33,633
biology to Markov motives,
there is a sort

157
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,900
of a Cristiano is an observer.

158
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,166
As far as I can see.

159
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,333
It is the main work.

160
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,233
The main paper.

161
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:47,000
That actually contributed to

162
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,566
this painting or to the metaphysical

163
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:52,766
implications.

164
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:55,133
Of the free energy principle,
which is the main paper,

165
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:56,633
as far as I can see, that.

166
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:57,900
Try to develop free.

167
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,133
Speaker 1: Energy principle into some sort of.

168
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,900
Metaphysical tissue.

169
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,300
Speaker 1: Self-Consciousness
and I think that for this reason

170
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,933
alone, the paper deserves attention.

171
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:14,100
And I'm a great admirer of for
I usually do not engage with.

172
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,200
Speaker 1: Reviewing or criticizing single papers.

173
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,033
But this paper attracted my attention
and interest because I think.

174
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:26,433
That it is so even before.

175
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:30,000
Is people such as, for example,
Christian Impulse and themselves

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,566
trying to develop a free energy
principle into a theory of consciousness

177
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,500
that provides. A point to.

178
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:37,600
Cartesian.

179
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,866
Speaker 1: Do all these souls to.

180
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,066
Speaker 1: Try to do so.

181
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:44,100
But as far as I can see, here.

182
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,366
Speaker 1: For the first time created,
the principle has having developed. Into

183
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,500
a very well-defined metaphysical.

184
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,200
Speaker 1: Texts, which is modernism.

185
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Speaker 1: So the main point here
is that I'm more sympathetic.

186
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,766
Speaker 1: To the goal of this paper,

187
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:05,466
to the objective of this paper
that at times the paper may indicate.

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,666
Speaker 1: And what I'm going. To say.

189
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,266
Is mainly

190
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:12,733
aimed to

191
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:13,500
invoke.

192
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,766
Speaker 1: Provoke the brain of the principles to
develop this Markov in motives mean into.

193
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,166
A slightly

194
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:24,366
better, I call it well-supported.

195
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:27,266
Account of consciousness,
metaphysical account of consciousness.

196
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,400
Speaker 1: And I'm going. To look at this issue.

197
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,500
And so regardless of philosophy,
of statements to see the relationship

198
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,466
between my career blankets
and their environment

199
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:40,000
as some sort of relation between
scientific models, because more program

200
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:42,633
or some sort of scientific models
and I'm going to.

201
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Speaker 1: Argue for.

202
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,800
Speaker 1: Provide some argumentation sort of.

203
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,200
Speaker 1: To draw a connection.

204
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,100
Speaker 1: Between.

205
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:54,133
Markov yet

206
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:57,533
models on the one and the target system
on the other and so-called.

207
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:59,966
Consciousness
that appears to this relationship.

208
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,200
Speaker 1: Could be put.

209
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,700
Speaker 1: Into some sort of monism,
which is a metaphysical search.

210
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,200
So I'm going to look at this issue

211
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,766
through the lens
of philosophy of science.

212
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:12,966
And unfold.

213
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:16,666
The implication of the implication
for Markov in modernism.

214
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,833
Speaker 1: So the taste is
itself Markov and modernism.

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,500
Speaker 1: Is quite straightforward.

216
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,633
Speaker 1: I have highlighted.

217
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:25,066
The part of it for you here.

218
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:28,633
So the thesis is, is that fundamentally.

219
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:28,933
There is.

220
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:31,633
Only one type of thing and only one type.

221
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:33,600
Of irreversible progress.

222
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,000
And Markov in Black
has formed the calculus of belief,

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,133
which is not only a nice scientific
mathematical model of consciousness,

224
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:44,666
but also provides
a clear metaphysical statement.

225
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,100
And I can shed light on.

226
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,733
Speaker 1: Current philosophical debates.

227
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:51,433
So the highlighted only. Two parts that.

228
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:55,066
So it is this is the statement
of North Korean modernism.

229
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,733
And the red.

230
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:59,100
Box indicates that.

231
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:01,633
How. Forcefully

232
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:05,900
the theory has been spelled
metaphysical term.

233
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,633
So there is only one type of team
is a strong metaphysical physics.

234
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,766
And this is something that has been also

235
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:16,766
stated in Freecell and colleagues paper

236
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,300
so. And here I highlighted.

237
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,366
Speaker 1: Another part of the same phrase
which indicates that.

238
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,100
Speaker 1: This is a statement of.

239
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,400
Speaker 1: Consciousness.

240
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,266
Speaker 1: On the basis of more programed models
is not just the most scientific.

241
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,633
Speaker 1: Or mathematical model of consciousness,

242
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:39,633
but also provides
and it's a physical statement.

243
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:44,266
So the main question here is this
how could Holcomb

244
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:46,800
that we could build Holcomb?

245
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:47,433
Holcomb that.

246
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:50,000
We could read off a metaphysical tissues.

247
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:50,800
Speaker 1: On the.

248
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,033
Speaker 1: Basis of our scientific models
of the phenomenal

249
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:56,400
scientific
mathematical models of phenomena.

250
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,700
Speaker 1: So I'm going to

251
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:02,800
ask this question.

252
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,600
Speaker 1: As I say.

253
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,400
Speaker 1: Through the lens of philosophy of science
to see what's the.

254
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,233
Speaker 1: Relation between.

255
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,033
I think that this basic.

256
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:11,266
Question of the recipe of science,
what's the relation

257
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:14,600
between scientific models
and their target system.

258
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:17,100
They are significantly on.

259
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,666
Speaker 1: The claim of Markov and.

260
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,400
Is which tries to.

261
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,333
Speaker 1: Develop some sort.

262
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:25,066
Of a strong metaphysical tests
on the basis of dispersion

263
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,633
modeling to scientific model, which are.

264
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:29,133
More blanket

265
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:34,266
so this is an.

266
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:37,066
Insight from philosophy of science.

267
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:38,533
And the insight has been.

268
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:39,133
I think, that.

269
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,866
Originally it has its roots in works of

270
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:46,766
Ronald Gary. And

271
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:47,366
Paul.

272
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,200
Churchland, for example.

273
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,866
Speaker 1: And a number of.

274
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:54,633
Boston for us and himself,
a number of important causes

275
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:56,966
for ourselves to be developing this idea.

276
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,700
Speaker 1: Of model.

277
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,166
Speaker 1: Based approach
to scientific theories in 1980s

278
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,433
and it has been recently

279
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:08,033
surveys.

280
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:10,833
Of. Research groups they work so Michael.

281
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,900
Weisberg and Rob.

282
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,166
Speaker 1: Manfred and Godfrey isms so.

283
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,400
Speaker 1: And the general idea is.

284
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,800
Speaker 1: That scientific practice
is basically consist

285
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,400
of model making making scientific models.

286
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,466
Speaker 1: And the thing is that so if you have

287
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:30,600
been engaging.

288
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,866
Speaker 1: In scientific practice just.

289
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:33,400
Do not.

290
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,433
Speaker 1: Directly engage in course.

291
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,933
Speaker 1: Of reading of the ideas.

292
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:43,533
From the future of war,
reading of the theory of the theories do.

293
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:46,366
Not just latch on to the word directing.

294
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:47,566
There is some sort.

295
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:50,733
Of representation
and representation of relation between

296
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:53,533
scientific theories, scientific models
and the work is.

297
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,600
Speaker 1: Being.

298
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:54,800
Speaker 1: Done.

299
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,866
Indirect so scientific
theories do not represent the features

300
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:00,300
of the work directly.

301
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,933
Speaker 1: The main thing here is that

302
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:07,833
of, quote, a few human factors.

303
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:11,666
Interfere through the process
of scientific representation,

304
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,100
so to name only a few.

305
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:19,200
For example, scientists interest
and explanatory goals and intentions.

306
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,366
Speaker 1: Play a role in how scientists.

307
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:24,500
Are constructing their scientific models.

308
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,200
And or use them to.

309
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,366
Speaker 1: Represent the features.

310
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:31,200
Of reality by scientific models and.

311
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,566
Speaker 1: Those of free, for example.

312
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:34,600
Among other people.

313
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,333
Explains, this process of indirect
representation.

314
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:42,033
Is quite sophisticated.

315
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:45,266
It includes several stages,
such as the notation or

316
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:48,300
designation, example, exemplification.

317
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,700
Speaker 1: Kingo and.

318
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,533
Speaker 1: Imputation.

319
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:52,833
So the main point.

320
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,600
Here, the take home point here is that.

321
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,533
Speaker 1: The relationship
between science models on life and.

322
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:02,300
Reality, on the other hand, or the target
system on the other hand, is quite.

323
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,266
Speaker 1: Sophisticated. It never.

324
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:06,533
Is straightforward.

325
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,666
Speaker 1: And there are three ways of so

326
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:12,966
remarkable that kids more and.

327
00:15:12,966 --> 00:15:18,600
Models or just every shown scientific
tools in the model or told books that.

328
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,433
Speaker 1: Follow the model
or to represent the features of.

329
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:23,400
The world in the or.

330
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,333
Speaker 1: So I'm going to speak about three ways of

331
00:15:27,466 --> 00:15:29,600
understanding Markov young models.

332
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:33,066
I'm beginning so

333
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:33,700
as the.

334
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,133
Speaker 1: Sketch that I showed earlier indicates.

335
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:37,766
By beginning with.

336
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,500
Speaker 1: Interpreting Markov, we had models
as physical or material models first.

337
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,000
Then as fictional models
and finally as mathematical models.

338
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:50,033
And disorder has been chosen
deliberately because.

339
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,666
I'm going from the knees to.

340
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:56,666
Like the reading of Markov Year models,
I'm going to the most likely

341
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,066
interpretation of Markov. We have models.

342
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:00,533
So I'm convinced that Markov.

343
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:02,900
Models could be understood. Theories
as some sort.

344
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,200
Speaker 1: Of mathematical models.

345
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,400
But I also consider other.

346
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,000
Speaker 1: Options because there are some sort
of textual evidence to support them.

347
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,400
So for example. We could
it is indeed possible.

348
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,700
Speaker 1: To understand Markov blankets
or Marco models as some sort of.

349
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:20,700
Physical.

350
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,766
Speaker 1: Models, material models,
for example, Crystal Stirling.

351
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:28,000
But to 20 1934 that.

352
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:29,200
The Marco.

353
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,566
Speaker 1: Blanket is not some statistical device
by which we could

354
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,233
or we use it to observe or model

355
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:40,233
the more the necessary attributes
of the universe.

356
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:41,833
That can be.

357
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,866
Carved into. Tables.

358
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:46,400
So at least to.

359
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,766
Speaker 1: A first approximation,
we would try to read this phrase

360
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:52,800
or the second phrase from the same paper.

361
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,000
It seems that.

362
00:16:54,233 --> 00:16:56,866
For. Free energy
principle theories for free.

363
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:58,566
So for. Example.

364
00:16:58,566 --> 00:17:02,400
Markov Blankets are actually features
of the reality themselves.

365
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,500
They are physical things.

366
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,033
There are real,
real things out there. And

367
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:09,300
so I think that it is not.

368
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,000
Speaker 1: Only Greece
that is advocating this reading.

369
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,800
I think it also.

370
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:15,900
I have seen.

371
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,633
Speaker 1: Similar phrases in, for example, recent

372
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,533
your introduction
to predictive processing and also the.

373
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,766
Speaker 1: All. And Freestone paper is seen to 26,
I think.

374
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,966
Speaker 1: So this is there is some textual.

375
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:33,233
Basis for understanding.

376
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:36,366
Markov Markov blankets as physical model.

377
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:42,100
But I think
and I think that this indication.

378
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,633
Speaker 1: This reference to Markov blankets
as physical things has to be taken with.

379
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,300
A grain of salt.

380
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,966
I do not think that there are.

381
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:53,333
Actually such things.
So if we, for example.

382
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,366
Open the.

383
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:55,533
Bread or. Open an.

384
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,800
Organic system,
I do. Not think that we can.

385
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,500
Speaker 1: Find anything

386
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,500
resembling a Marco Rubio blanket
or actually there is no blanket there.

387
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,733
There is no such physical thing.

388
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:08,500
But I could understand if a.

389
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,066
Speaker 1: Terrorist.

390
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:12,366
Could conceive of.

391
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:13,766
The target system as.

392
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:16,233
You could really include this.

393
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:17,733
Representational device.

394
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:20,800
But the point is that
even if we consider.

395
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,100
Speaker 1: Some concept that Marco blankets
Marco Rubio and models

396
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,400
are features of reality
or physical things that exist in the.

397
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,066
Speaker 1: World, even if we consider that
it doesn't follow that

398
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,066
reality itself.

399
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:36,666
Sure.

400
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:41,066
As the ontological
and material futures market.

401
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:43,733
But I think that it doesn't follow
that there is.

402
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,533
Speaker 1: The same

403
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,633
self, same ontological category
that includes both Marco Polo and.

404
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:52,633
Their target system.

405
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,733
And there is an. Example
that could. Demonstrate that.

406
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:59,033
So for example, there is the such thing
as a hydraulic home

407
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,233
model of economics.

408
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:04,600
So hydraulic foam is a physical object.

409
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,466
Speaker 1: And for erotic model to work, some.

410
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:11,000
Properties of economics
is the most be identified because.

411
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,800
It already. Properties of. The pole.

412
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,000
Speaker 1: It could be, for example,

413
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,600
exemplified
through the process of imputation.

414
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:21,233
We could.

415
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,700
Speaker 1: Ascribe.

416
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,466
Speaker 1: Or attribute some of the appropriate use

417
00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:26,900
of the hydraulic pole
to the physical object.

418
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,500
Speaker 1: So sorry.

419
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,433
Speaker 1: To to ascribe
some of the properties of these reform

420
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:36,266
to the economic system
that is supposed to be represented.

421
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:38,433
But it doesn't follow that the.

422
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:42,166
Economical system and hydraulic pole,
which is a physical object.

423
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,433
Can be put.

424
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:48,666
Under the same ontological category
or material category.

425
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,066
So for example, he could already fall,
which is a physical object

426
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,066
is made of, for example,
a steel or plastic

427
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:58,800
or some some other matter ability
and it doesn't follow that economic sure.

428
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,500
As this.

429
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:00,700
Material.

430
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,933
Speaker 1: On to future.

431
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,766
So I simply put the

432
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:09,866
materialist.

433
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:12,933
Interpretation of Mark Markov
blanket aside.

434
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,300
Speaker 1: And proceed to consider.

435
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,800
Speaker 1: Remarkable.
That gives us a picture of models. So

436
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:21,400
and the main.

437
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,633
Speaker 1: Reason for this is that I assume that
if we for example, explore

438
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:29,233
with the actual grain of organism,
we couldn't find anything resembling.

439
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:31,533
A marble. Blanket inside the brains.

440
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:34,833
So we could interpret them as some.

441
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,400
Some sort of fictional objects and.

442
00:20:40,966 --> 00:20:44,600
So then the fiction on these

443
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:47,633
and again, there are textual support.

444
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:50,700
For this. For example, Christo.

445
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:55,466
And colleagues say that
if it's if we look into the behavior.

446
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:57,000
Of creatures through the lenses.

447
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,866
Speaker 1: Of Markov models,

448
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:03,266
it may look as if it is acting
with the creatures, acting to minimize.

449
00:21:03,266 --> 00:21:05,033
These particles are also, for example.

450
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:07,133
So this as.

451
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,600
A phrase, new categories.

452
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,166
Speaker 1: I think that is very important
in case that they do not think.

453
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,733
That there is such thing
as Markov blanketing the creature.

454
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,666
But it's look.

455
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,133
As if there is such thing.

456
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:21,500
And it has to be this.

457
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:26,100
Interpretation this picture values,
instrumentalist interpretation.

458
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,266
Speaker 1: Is gaining.

459
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:31,533
Momentum, as far as I can see.

460
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:35,700
So there are a number of other people,
such as Max Firearms and.

461
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,100
Various.

462
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:40,633
That are developing
some sort of fictionalized

463
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:44,433
and instrumentalist
interpretation of reinterpret principle.

464
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:46,933
But the thing is that
if you consider this.

465
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:49,066
Picture this interpretation. Of market.

466
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:51,300
Blanket or creator principle.

467
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:54,266
It follows that.

468
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:55,000
So if market.

469
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,033
Speaker 1: Blankets are used for fiction, we could.

470
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:59,300
End of

471
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,400
derive.

472
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,000
Speaker 1: Any sort of metaphysical conclusion
from them.

473
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,300
So from a fiction.

474
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,500
Speaker 1: So for.

475
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,733
Speaker 1: Example,
if you are studying Greek mythology.

476
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,600
Speaker 1: And assuming.

477
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,766
Speaker 1: That Greek
mythology is some sort of a fiction.

478
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,100
Speaker 1: You cannot derive any conclusion
about the nature.

479
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,900
Speaker 1: Of beauty
from what you read in a story from.

480
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,933
Greek mythology,
there are no metaphysical.

481
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:25,800
Conclusion to be drawn from.

482
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:27,700
Fictions.

483
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,566
Speaker 1: And stories.

484
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:32,800
And this is precisely the point
in invoking a fiction.

485
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,533
Speaker 1: Based approach for scientific models.

486
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:36,800
So people are using fiction.

487
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,733
Speaker 1: Assuming that scientific models
are fictions or useful

488
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:43,500
instruments to just get rid
of the metaphysical questions

489
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,266
about the nature of fiction models
or the relationship with reality.

490
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:49,500
So to make a long.

491
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:52,900
Story short,
this fictional interpretation doesn't

492
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,000
lead to any sort of metaphysical

493
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,100
conclusion
about the nature of consciousness.

494
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,800
Or the nature of mind
or anything of that sort.

495
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,733
So this brings us.

496
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:08,900
To the last interpretation of.

497
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,200
Speaker 1: Miracle for accurate.

498
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,600
And it comes in terms of.

499
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,333
Speaker 1: Over time or anything that I don't.

500
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:15,966
Have much time.

501
00:23:15,966 --> 00:23:17,633
I try to wrap it up quickly.

502
00:23:17,633 --> 00:23:20,000
So the final.

503
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,800
Speaker 1: Interpretation is.

504
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,166
Speaker 1: To interpret more.

505
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,500
Like it's in terms
of. Mathematical models.

506
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:29,833
And I think.

507
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,800
That there is. Good textual growth.

508
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,600
So it is to at least to my.

509
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,900
Speaker 1: Mind, to some extent

510
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,233
from for someone who is coming
from a background of of science.

511
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:40,666
It seems rather.

512
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:44,233
Obvious that more people than kids
are just mathematical modeling tool.

513
00:23:44,366 --> 00:23:45,566
So there are.

514
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:46,466
Mathematical.

515
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,466
Tools in the context of.

516
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:50,133
Bayesian.

517
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:53,500
Networks to describe to represent the.

518
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,200
Conditional.

519
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,966
Speaker 1: Independence
between internal and external spaces.

520
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,400
And there is.

521
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,433
Speaker 1: Textual evidence for that.

522
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:07,700
Again, I have my part of that
which indicates that

523
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:09,166
there.

524
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:13,500
Enterprise aims to describe a construct
from information theory.

525
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:16,366
And mathematical.

526
00:24:16,366 --> 00:24:18,900
Physics that helps them to.

527
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,733
Speaker 1: Define the.

528
00:24:22,733 --> 00:24:25,600
Properties of living system
and their cognition

529
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,600
and give them some sort of
meaningful interpretation.

530
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,933
Speaker 1: By invoking a mathematical.

531
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:37,266
Object that could be used to consolidate
this interpretation. So

532
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:40,966
and the use of.

533
00:24:40,966 --> 00:24:44,900
So I think
that there is some sort of enlightenment.

534
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,333
Speaker 1: Insight.

535
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:48,133
In modern.

536
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:50,833
Philosophy of science.

537
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,766
Speaker 1: In the wake of.

538
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:56,233
For example, postfix tubes
and both of them for us and in 1960s

539
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:59,000
and 1970s.

540
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:00,566
So people's.

541
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:02,700
Attention has been drawn to.

542
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,633
Speaker 1: The importance.

543
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:07,466
Of mathematical models, theory
and model theory and that sort of.

544
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,133
Speaker 1: Stuff.

545
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:10,566
For modeling

546
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,400
natural phenomena.

547
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,600
So when doing science scientists.

548
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,433
Speaker 1: The right of model are in some sense
the rise of model science.

549
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,666
Has. Been the result of being wonky,
which is sort of

550
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:25,666
mathematical approaches that.

551
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:26,033
Allow.

552
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:27,400
Us to.

553
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,400
Speaker 1: Represent

554
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,900
and model natural phenomena of, you know.

555
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,166
Speaker 1: Precision and vigor and rigor.

556
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:42,033
But the thing is
that if we assume that my career.

557
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:44,266
Models are some sort of mathematical.

558
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:45,000
Tools.

559
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,766
Speaker 1: That can be used
to represent the features of reality.

560
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,266
Speaker 1: The thing is that we couldn't develop

561
00:25:51,566 --> 00:25:54,066
any sort of metaphysical conclusion.

562
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:55,566
About the nature of reality

563
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:58,533
on the basis of application
of these mathematical tools.

564
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:01,633
Look, if we assume that Markov.

565
00:26:01,633 --> 00:26:02,766
Blankets are.

566
00:26:02,766 --> 00:26:03,466
Mathematical.

567
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:07,566
Tools, and if we want to identify
their nature with the nature of reality,

568
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,166
the only conclusion that follows
is that the reality

569
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,933
of some sort of mathematical object
is some sort of measurement.

570
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:16,233
Quite an interesting thing,
as I will argue.

571
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:17,500
Precisely the.

572
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
Speaker 1: Same sort of confusion that.

573
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:23,166
That.

574
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,600
Speaker 1: Priesthood and colleagues.

575
00:26:26,366 --> 00:26:28,766
Reached in the end of their.

576
00:26:28,766 --> 00:26:30,266
Paper. So

577
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,100
at some.

578
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,933
Speaker 1: Sense they are saying that they are.

579
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:35,166
In they intend. To defend some sort

580
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:39,133
of reductive materialist
or reductive physical objects.

581
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:40,133
But what happens. Is.

582
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:42,033
That they come to the.

583
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,233
Conclusion that.

584
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:46,533
Because these two ways of.

585
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:49,566
Describing the nature of reality,
this division on the basis

586
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:53,333
of more coherence
of the two external and internal spaces.

587
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,166
Because none of these

588
00:26:58,133 --> 00:26:59,300
interpretations.

589
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,700
Speaker 1: No one of these geometries
that they develop, none of this intrinsic

590
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,800
and extrinsic perspective could be.

591
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:08,766
Supported under the assumption
that neither.

592
00:27:08,766 --> 00:27:10,100
Perspective is pre.

593
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,966
Speaker 1: Related. One would.

594
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:13,533
Have to conclude
that reality is fundamentally.

595
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,933
Ontologically. Neutral.

596
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:18,000
And they assume that by.

597
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,200
Speaker 1: Speaking ontological, neutral
or neutral nature of reality, they are.

598
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,400
Trying to be open the.

599
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,266
Speaker 1: Mathematical nature of Markov
and blankets Markov.

600
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:33,633
Models to

601
00:27:33,633 --> 00:27:35,633
make concession on some sort of.

602
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:39,000
Monism which identifies
the nature of reality as neither

603
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,900
physical nor mental.

604
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:43,233
But I would say that it.

605
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:48,133
Would be quite a lot to read into the use
of mathematical models.

606
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,866
So of course.

607
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:52,866
Mathematical tools
are neither in substance.

608
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,733
Speaker 1: Or neither. Mental nor physical.

609
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:59,033
If you are not an idealist or a realist,
especially if you are

610
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:01,833
a physical historian
of mathematical entities.

611
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,566
Speaker 1: But it doesn't follow.

612
00:28:03,566 --> 00:28:05,933
That the target systems
that could be used.

613
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,033
Speaker 1: On the basis.

614
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:09,200
Of using these mathematical tools.

615
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,133
So the reality, the target system
that is going to be used by invoking

616
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:14,700
these sort of mathematical tools.

617
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,400
Speaker 1: Itself is neither mental nor physical.

618
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,600
So it is the conclusion of paper.

619
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,233
And for coming to that conclusion,
I have.

620
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:26,433
Also discussed some sort of a structure.

621
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:28,433
Here is interpretation of the paper.

622
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:29,566
Again, this is.

623
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:30,800
About the relation between.

624
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,200
Speaker 1: Mathematical tools and
the physical reality that they represent.

625
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,600
Speaker 1: So again, Freestone and colleagues
would be happy.

626
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,133
Speaker 1: To make conversation on some sort
of a structure or the earnings

627
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,766
interpretation of the remarkably unknown.

628
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:45,866
Exam but in the context.

629
00:28:45,866 --> 00:28:48,933
Of this structure, realism to a structure
really as.

630
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:50,266
Some of the.

631
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:53,533
Leading a structure
such as the Steven French and.

632
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:54,800
Again leading men are.

633
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,766
Speaker 1: Quite explicit about what is clear.

634
00:28:58,033 --> 00:29:00,266
They do not make their ontological.

635
00:29:00,266 --> 00:29:04,900
Commitments on the basis of the
mathematical framework that they use.

636
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,933
Speaker 1: So they use mathematical.

637
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:10,400
Framework, they use model theory,
they use theory because they believe that

638
00:29:10,766 --> 00:29:15,566
the semantic framework model to approach
or strategic approach science.

639
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,066
Speaker 1: Mirrors.

640
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:21,066
Its structure
use, loyalty's on its sleeves.

641
00:29:21,066 --> 00:29:24,833
But it doesn't mean that ontology itself.

642
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:29,166
Could be read off program, the features
of these mathematical tools that they do.

643
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:33,533
So they are very clear
that the job of the measurement.

644
00:29:33,866 --> 00:29:36,600
Tool is that the use of.

645
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,466
Speaker 1: Orthodoxies.

646
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:40,200
Structurally
and these are using mathematical tools

647
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,000
such as theory
and model, theory and category theory.

648
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:44,533
But they are very.

649
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:48,633
Clear that the job of these mathematical
tools is mainly representation.

650
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:51,466
It is not constitutional,
it is not ontological.

651
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:52,133
On the other hand,

652
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:55,066
it is the physical reality
that is supposed to be represented.

653
00:29:55,466 --> 00:29:57,166
That. Has some sort of.

654
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:59,633
Ontological. Constitution or rule.

655
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:02,900
And with regard to Mark
and is if you want to.

656
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,866
Speaker 1: Derive any sort.

657
00:30:03,866 --> 00:30:08,000
Of the use of the mere application
of more codified models does.

658
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,800
Speaker 1: Not lead to any sort of
metaphysical conclusion.

659
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:12,300
Because more and more.

660
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,000
Speaker 1: Those arguments
remained representational.

661
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,833
So they.

662
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:16,166
Help.

663
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:21,833
Us to represent features of the reality
that is the target system,

664
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,133
the brain or consciousness or organism
or the environment or whatever.

665
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,866
It doesn't.

666
00:30:27,866 --> 00:30:30,000
So we could not build up on.

667
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,933
Speaker 1: The features of this mathematical
model itself to derive any sort

668
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:38,300
of ontological or physical contribution
of the features of the target system.

669
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,666
Speaker 1: So thank you very much for listening and

670
00:30:45,066 --> 00:30:45,766
I hope.

671
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:48,233
That what I said
makes some sense, at least to some of.

672
00:30:48,233 --> 00:30:49,500
You, but although I.

673
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,233
Speaker 1: Could not be completely sure.

674
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:53,333
So thank you very much.

675
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:55,066
Awesome.

676
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:58,100
Thank you for that
fascinating presentation.

677
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,500
We already have

678
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,900
a couple questions in the chat,
so if anyone else wants to ask questions,

679
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,966
we'll have a good amount of time
now just to talk a little bit

680
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,766
and I'll just read down
the questions that were asked in the chat

681
00:31:10,766 --> 00:31:12,600
and a few things I wrote down.

682
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,900
So the first question in the chat was

683
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:18,566
as far as different styles of modernism

684
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,200
or different threads in the history
and the philosophy of non ism,

685
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,133
how does a Dawkins based mechanism

686
00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:29,800
so thinking about like means biological
or non

687
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,066
biological memetics
that's kind of a Dawkins mechanism,

688
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:37,366
how does that parallel or overlap
with for Estonian modernism?

689
00:31:37,966 --> 00:31:41,933
So in other words, how does for instance
modernism or the Markova and Mon ism

690
00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:46,100
relate or overlap with other approaches

691
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,100
to modernist type theories?

692
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,100
Speaker 1: Oh, well,

693
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:56,400
thank you very much for the question.

694
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,766
I mean, I'm not very knowledgeable
about the different types of Moonies.

695
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,700
Speaker 1: So I know about some quite classical
theories of modernism.

696
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,133
I know a few things about, for example,
or earlier among them, or.

697
00:32:10,866 --> 00:32:11,400
The form of.

698
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,700
Speaker 1: Modernism that has been developed by
Charles Sanders pay per se, aside from,

699
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,033
for example,
the classical forms that are Spinoza.

700
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:21,633
Out of

701
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:23,933
so I'm not

702
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:27,066
very well
versed, I'm not very knowledgeable.

703
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:30,166
About these kind of go
Keynesian modernism.

704
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,966
Speaker 1: I barely know.

705
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:38,000
Anything about memes,
and I'm not sure that we could

706
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,233
identify memes
as real ontological entity.

707
00:32:41,733 --> 00:32:44,000
But and I have already.

708
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,566
Speaker 1: Argued this, I have some sort. Of

709
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:50,200
misgivings about.

710
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:51,800
Priesthood and views.

711
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,033
Speaker 1: And. Customs version of Mormonism. So

712
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,966
I do not want to give.

713
00:32:57,966 --> 00:32:59,333
A readymade answer.

714
00:32:59,333 --> 00:32:59,866
I would say.

715
00:32:59,866 --> 00:33:03,200
That if Keynesian modernism resembles.

716
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:08,800
Free Estonian monies with regard
to the fact that it involves memes,

717
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,433
which are,

718
00:33:10,933 --> 00:33:15,566
as far as I can give, some sorts
of surgical tools as features of reality.

719
00:33:16,766 --> 00:33:18,366
It could be liable.

720
00:33:18,366 --> 00:33:20,700
To the same kind of objections
that I have.

721
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,966
Speaker 1: Spirited.

722
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:25,266
Here against. The.

723
00:33:25,266 --> 00:33:28,333
Free stonier kind of Mormonism.

724
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,233
Thanks for the clear answer.

725
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:34,400
And I guess the follow up on that is
where do you situate this Markov

726
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,366
and modernism in relationship
to these classical kinds of modernism

727
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:41,266
that you just mentioned?
Is that discussed in the paper or what?

728
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,566
How would you frame that.

729
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:46,100
So all right.

730
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,966
Thank you very much.

731
00:33:46,966 --> 00:33:49,900
Again, it is it is

732
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,200
a fascinating question.

733
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,400
Speaker 1: So before this,
I have developed some sort of a structure

734
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,833
or these theories of.

735
00:33:57,833 --> 00:34:00,300
Consciousness, too, that have been.

736
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,333
Speaker 1: Basically based.

737
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:02,400
So my own.

738
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,666
Speaker 1: Approach to free energy
principle is associated

739
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:08,966
with some sort of a structure
you need them to.

740
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:12,600
So, again, I myself have.

741
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,300
Speaker 1: Invoked some source of my time.

742
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,500
I suppose structure embodied information,
all the structures.

743
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:21,366
To describe the structure of the.

744
00:34:21,366 --> 00:34:23,500
Mind and consciousness. And my. Basic.

745
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:27,000
Argumentation
there was that this structure.

746
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:27,866
Sort.

747
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:29,666
Of underpinned the diversity

748
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:33,466
between different forms of consciousness
in terms of free energy principle.

749
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:34,833
Georg.

750
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:37,933
Nordhaus, resting state activity theory,

751
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:42,500
for example, integrated information
theory of consciousness.

752
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,100
Speaker 1: So I myself there are some.

753
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,733
Speaker 1: Sort of a stretch area

754
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:50,333
with regard to the metaphysical
that speaks with regard to so

755
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:54,666
by moon is them specifically as some sort
of metaphysic called approach.

756
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:56,400
And also I have been.

757
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,200
Speaker 1: Very cautious with regard
to stating a metaphysical existence.

758
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,400
Speaker 1: So at the very, you know.

759
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,200
Speaker 1: The structure of ideas and that's
how we have invented was some sort

760
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,033
of epistemic
historical area is it was still realism.

761
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,266
Speaker 1: But it was the piece of work

762
00:35:11,266 --> 00:35:14,966
in the sense
that I was ready to make commitments.

763
00:35:14,966 --> 00:35:18,900
To the fact that to the extent that
our scientific or scientific knowledge

764
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,133
is informing us the future of reality,
the structure

765
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:24,900
of what we could as many.

766
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:26,100
Assertions.

767
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,200
Speaker 1: About the nature of reality itself.

768
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,900
So whether it is the structure
of the world or whether it is.

769
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:32,766
The same.

770
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:33,700
As the

771
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:38,400
the self, same as thought that is there
or there are several kind of substances.

772
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:41,400
So I, I professed.

773
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,433
Speaker 1: Agnosticism
towards the future as a reality.

774
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:50,100
And so, so the version of a structure
that I defended was epistemic and I

775
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,600
have no stance on.

776
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,800
Speaker 1: The. Nature of reality.

777
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,566
And so there are mornings
or two of these times or any other.

778
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,066
Speaker 1: Kind of approach.

779
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,166
Speaker 1: That's really interesting

780
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:07,966
seems pretty fair to be agnostic
on the ultimate structure of reality.

781
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:11,400
And you had a quote on one of the slides
that the structural realism

782
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,100
is taking the pressure off
of strong ontological commitments.

783
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,566
So how would you summarize this

784
00:36:18,966 --> 00:36:23,200
kind of best of both worlds
structural realism approach?

785
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,100
Are we just is it a buffet
or are we just taking what we like

786
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,766
or what are we committing to
with epistemic structural realism?

787
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:33,300
Very, very surreal. So

788
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,766
I I think that

789
00:36:35,766 --> 00:36:39,066
it is partly an issue of motivations.

790
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:42,033
So when it's stating the structural
realism, for.

791
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,800
Example, people such as.

792
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,333
Speaker 1: John Gore or built utopian arguments.

793
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,333
From history of science to argue that.

794
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,133
So it takes the.

795
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:52,700
Pressure off

796
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,133
ontological pressure in the sense
that it doesn't make commitments

797
00:36:57,133 --> 00:37:02,300
to the intrinsic nature of entities,
it doesn't make commitment to objects.

798
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:03,433
It is committed.

799
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:05,933
Mainly to the relations so.

800
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:07,900
And I think that I'm defending.

801
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,100
Speaker 1: Some sort of epistemic form
of historical realism because as I say,

802
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,000
it is completely agnostic
about the future reality itself.

803
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:17,200
So for example, people
such as John Morel.

804
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:19,733
Are defending the structuralism.

805
00:37:19,733 --> 00:37:23,233
On the basis of history of science
has been very clear examples,

806
00:37:23,233 --> 00:37:26,366
for example,
from the history of optics to show

807
00:37:26,366 --> 00:37:30,433
that there is some sort of continuity
between theories of optics,

808
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:34,900
although it seems that there are cultural
scholarship in the history of science.

809
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,566
So some of the term
sort of some of the critical entities

810
00:37:38,566 --> 00:37:43,266
that were supposed to be the subject
of ontological commitments before. Or.

811
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:45,900
Eliminate from or ontology today.

812
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,300
But it seems that there is some sort of

813
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,066
continuity at the level of the structure
of the theories, at the level of form.

814
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,366
Speaker 1: So they are not making comment in.

815
00:37:53,366 --> 00:37:56,733
This they are indeed
taking ontological pressure from

816
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,966
their theory, although

817
00:37:58,966 --> 00:38:02,633
there are other forms of, for example,
anti construction realism.

818
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,266
Speaker 1: Which itself comes in.

819
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:07,366
Various stripes.

820
00:38:07,366 --> 00:38:10,033
For example,
James Legrand is defending some social.

821
00:38:10,933 --> 00:38:12,966
And. Humanities

822
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:15,100
approach to structure.

823
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,933
And I think that for good reasons
from the his

824
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:20,433
from reason that many particle physics.

825
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:22,766
Of what

826
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:25,066
I'm is slightly.

827
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:29,433
Skeptical that so that sort of structural
realism is taking a sort of.

828
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,600
Speaker 1: In terms of.

829
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,200
Speaker 1: Ontological commitments.

830
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,333
I'm skeptical that. It seems less.

831
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,533
Speaker 1: Cumbersome that.

832
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:38,800
The orthodox.

833
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,000
Speaker 1: Forms of scientific realism I'm sure.

834
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,933
Speaker 1: That if there is a. Perfect.

835
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:46,166
Match between the need to eliminate.

836
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,133
Speaker 1: The structural realism and.

837
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,933
Speaker 1: What we know about what.

838
00:38:52,933 --> 00:38:55,866
Model of physics,
many particle physics is representing

839
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,433
all of the features of the. World.

840
00:38:57,433 --> 00:38:58,333
But with regard to.

841
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:02,700
Metaphysics, for example, or to construct
variation claims that all that

842
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,466
there is is a structure
which is a strong metaphysical claim.

843
00:39:06,466 --> 00:39:08,633
So it. Eliminates.

844
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:11,666
Entities objects from the ontology,

845
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:16,066
which is quite ambitious
and a strong ontological commitment. So

846
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:20,000
and the thing is that I do not think.

847
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,133
Speaker 1: That the version of a structural realism
that Chris Dodd

848
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:26,633
and colleagues have defended is epistemic
because they are defending

849
00:39:26,633 --> 00:39:30,566
some sort of metaphysical cases or monies
that we some sort of metaphysical text.

850
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:34,166
So although the structural realism
was supposed to be

851
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,400
ontologically.

852
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,233
Speaker 1: Modest in the.

853
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:39,266
Sense that at.

854
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:42,400
Least, for example, Warhol's version
doesn't make commitment.

855
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:46,066
To the nature of

856
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:46,633
the word.

857
00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:51,100
Itself, the metaphysical versions
of a structure such as games labeling.

858
00:39:52,233 --> 00:39:54,900
Or or including.

859
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,300
Speaker 1: Or harboring a strong metaphysical tests
that will the features of reality

860
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,266
that they are.

861
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:00,933
Claiming to.

862
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:02,900
Be completely structural.

863
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,233
Speaker 1: And I think that in this sense.

864
00:40:05,233 --> 00:40:07,633
Markov in Monism
that is defined by Christopher

865
00:40:07,966 --> 00:40:10,766
and others, is not metaphysically modest
at all.

866
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:12,766
And I think that this is one reason

867
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,266
I do that.

868
00:40:15,266 --> 00:40:15,800
And thank you.

869
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,233
Speaker 1: Very much
for bringing this point to my attention.

870
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:22,400
I didn't know this point
clearly in the paper because I didn't.

871
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,266
Spend. Many time
to discuss the structural issues.

872
00:40:25,266 --> 00:40:26,233
And this is.

873
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,066
What I think that nor.

874
00:40:28,066 --> 00:40:30,533
That I look at it from.

875
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:33,400
Here, I can see that it could be the main

876
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,666
motive behind my mind that encouraged.

877
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:41,100
Me to be a bit critical
of all this formal modernism that is

878
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,400
presented in this paper,

879
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,500
wonderful paper by Freestone Records.

880
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,833
Speaker 1: Cool. Cool response.

881
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:53,166
Here's another question from the chat
kind of keeping with

882
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:57,266
this theme of physics and realism
and scientific communities.

883
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,900
That are evolving their models.

884
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,266
You mentioned optics,
so let's think about particle physics.

885
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,366
Cambridge Breaths.

886
00:41:05,366 --> 00:41:08,266
Can the author describe
in his personal belief,

887
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,566
the main difference
between a mathematical Markov

888
00:41:11,566 --> 00:41:13,600
blindness of an electron

889
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,533
when it's behaving as a particle versus
when it's behaving as a wave?

890
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,700
Speaker 1: So how do we think about

891
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,833
quantum mechanics and quantum phenomena

892
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,166
when we're talking about these different

893
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:29,733
realism ideas?

894
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,433
Speaker 1: But to be quite honest, I have no idea.

895
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:36,766
I do you think that

896
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:39,000
this is mainly because of my.

897
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,666
Speaker 1: Ignorance of.

898
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:42,300
Modern physics, so I have.

899
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,366
Speaker 1: Some general conception of what happens.

900
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,600
Speaker 1: At the level. Of particle physics.

901
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:50,166
But how to say that in terms of.

902
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:52,866
More than I can imagine, how could we.

903
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,566
Speaker 1: State that in terms of Markov blanket.

904
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:56,966
Speaker 1: But I cannot.

905
00:41:56,966 --> 00:42:01,500
See how the distinction is a particle
being in of state or being.

906
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,833
Speaker 1: An entity being.

907
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:05,633
In a very big state or part of the state.

908
00:42:05,633 --> 00:42:07,700
Could be related to this issue of

909
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,333
Markov models.

910
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:12,266
I assume that. Most probably are models.

911
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:14,533
So one thing that I know about Mark
Colvin.

912
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,266
All the models is that they are.

913
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:17,533
So powerful.

914
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:22,066
They are such powerful modeling tools
that they could be used almost to want.

915
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,700
Everything. That there is to be.

916
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,333
Speaker 1: Model. But

917
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,266
well, and I

918
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,566
suspect and it is only some sort of.

919
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,266
Wild guess that we.

920
00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:35,800
Could model the behavior of an.

921
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,233
Speaker 1: Entity either in its various states
or in.

922
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,033
Speaker 1: As far as we try.

923
00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:44,400
To provide some sort of probabilistic
representation.

924
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,066
Speaker 1: Of the.

925
00:42:45,066 --> 00:42:47,166
Behavior of the entity to.

926
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:48,700
Model the conditional.

927
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,800
Speaker 1: Independence
between different states out there.

928
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
Speaker 1: We could impose.

929
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,666
Speaker 1: Markov in blanket Markov
blankets to do a lot. Of

930
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,100
I think.

931
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,000
Speaker 1: At the same time,
I miss the main part of.

932
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,700
Speaker 1: The core of the question.

933
00:43:06,566 --> 00:43:07,500
I think

934
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,966
just maybe guessing from the context,

935
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:15,633
the electron is something
that we might say we might want to say

936
00:43:15,633 --> 00:43:19,200
Ontologically exists, or some might think
it ontologically exists.

937
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:23,433
Yet it can display this
sort of bimodal behavior

938
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:27,000
when it can, depending on the double slit
and the context of the observer,

939
00:43:27,266 --> 00:43:28,866
it can be impacted. Yeah. Great.

940
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:31,200
So, all right.

941
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,800
So how does a more coherent blanket does.

942
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,333
Speaker 1: To. That?

943
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:39,266
So as I say, this
this kind of approach to.

944
00:43:39,733 --> 00:43:43,166
The behavior of the entities
in many parts of physics

945
00:43:43,666 --> 00:43:47,733
was what motivated people
such as Steven French and James.

946
00:43:47,733 --> 00:43:50,066
They developed forms of a structure.
Yeah.

947
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:54,566
So it is not
only an issue of an electron.

948
00:43:54,566 --> 00:43:55,366
The thing is.

949
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,500
That they will look at this,

950
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,200
the behavior of entities at the level of
maybe at the fundamental level,

951
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:04,933
if I don't want to use a fundamental
at the level of many particle physics.

952
00:44:05,566 --> 00:44:06,900
They should do all behavior.

953
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,766
Speaker 1: There is some sort of package
that includes individual objects.

954
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:13,033
And it is the interpretation,
for example.

955
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:13,800
Of the.

956
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:18,733
Electron that allows us to identify
that as some sort of individual objects.

957
00:44:18,733 --> 00:44:23,800
And there is a package that doesn't allow
us to model it as an individual object.

958
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,133
Speaker 1: So there are rules.

959
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:27,066
So if you have. To conceive of the.

960
00:44:27,066 --> 00:44:30,333
As both individual individual objects
and non.

961
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:32,266
Individual objects and.

962
00:44:32,266 --> 00:44:33,533
This seems to recall.

963
00:44:33,533 --> 00:44:36,733
What would be your ontology
your model physics and its structure area

964
00:44:36,766 --> 00:44:38,800
is it provides
an answer to that saying that.

965
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,200
Speaker 1: Oh, look, let's.

966
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,500
Speaker 1: Consider the.

967
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,166
Speaker 1: Commonality, let's.

968
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:45,366
Consider the common structure that.

969
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,466
Speaker 1: Underpin both formulation
and the behavior.

970
00:44:48,466 --> 00:44:51,533
Of electrons, for example,
are restricted in terms of so

971
00:44:51,533 --> 00:44:54,700
our sort of the statistics
that are developed.

972
00:44:54,966 --> 00:44:55,766
From Max.

973
00:44:55,766 --> 00:44:58,833
Both work, for example,
both by studying statistics

974
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,133
and other sorts of statistics.

975
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:03,866
So I assume that we could also.

976
00:45:03,966 --> 00:45:07,433
Invoke some sort of a Markov blanket
to behavior.

977
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,666
Speaker 1: To, to model the. Behavior of.

978
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:10,933
Speaker 1: These.

979
00:45:10,933 --> 00:45:14,166
Kind of entities
at the level of so particle physics.

980
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,666
Speaker 1: What does the question.

981
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:18,600
Mean to indicate
that there would be some.

982
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,700
Speaker 1: Sort of. Ontological. Game to do?

983
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:25,600
So the thing is that even in philosophy
of physics, the discussion of a.

984
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,066
Speaker 1: Structure area that there would.

985
00:45:27,066 --> 00:45:28,866
Be could invoke some sort of.

986
00:45:28,866 --> 00:45:30,466
Representational.

987
00:45:30,466 --> 00:45:33,200
Mathematical tools or we have to just.

988
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,933
Speaker 1: Rely. On the

989
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,300
geometrical.

990
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,633
Speaker 1: Or physical statement of the situation.

991
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:40,633
So I think that.

992
00:45:40,633 --> 00:45:44,633
These are sophisticated issues
in the philosophy of physics.

993
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,366
Speaker 1: And hardly an.

994
00:45:47,366 --> 00:45:48,533
Expert in that.

995
00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:51,033
But I'm not very clear.

996
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,166
Speaker 1: What's obvious.

997
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:57,900
Advantage
is the state of regimentation of a state.

998
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,166
So, so particles in terms of markup
language would do

999
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:07,466
to the extent that metaphysical instances
all excuse or right or energy.

1000
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:09,666
Cool.

1001
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:12,833
So here are a few general questions,

1002
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,500
but what does it mean
to be ontologically neutral?

1003
00:46:17,033 --> 00:46:20,266
So that was brought up
and I was just wondering what

1004
00:46:20,633 --> 00:46:24,000
what is the alternative or
how could it be charged or not neutral?

1005
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,166
What is it that.

1006
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,633
Speaker 1: There are several ways
of remaining ontological.

1007
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,000
Speaker 1: Neutral. So for example.

1008
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,566
Speaker 1: A way that.

1009
00:46:32,566 --> 00:46:37,266
We prefer is to, as I say, appropriate
ontological agnosticism

1010
00:46:37,266 --> 00:46:40,500
to not make any commitments
about the nature to do. So.

1011
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:42,333
But I do not think that it is.

1012
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:46,400
This sort of ontological neutrality
that is at issue in Christian

1013
00:46:46,633 --> 00:46:47,966
colleague's paper.

1014
00:46:47,966 --> 00:46:49,933
I think that they want to be
ontologically.

1015
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:52,000
Neutral in the sense that it is.

1016
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,500
Speaker 1: Traditional division.

1017
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,800
Speaker 1: In the philosophy
of what is being physical.

1018
00:46:57,333 --> 00:47:00,766
So between dualism, for example,
physical exam, people

1019
00:47:00,766 --> 00:47:04,666
who think that the nature of mind
is physical and people who think that.

1020
00:47:06,266 --> 00:47:06,833
Mind.

1021
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:10,533
Or at least mental properties
are different from physical properties.

1022
00:47:10,533 --> 00:47:13,733
So I think that

1023
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:15,300
more coma and moaning.

1024
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,166
Speaker 1: Wants to be ontologically neutral
in the sense that it doesn't

1025
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:23,033
want to make commitments
to either mentalism

1026
00:47:23,033 --> 00:47:26,433
or physical things, that it doesn't
want to identify consciousness.

1027
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,066
Speaker 1: Either. In physical terms
or mental terms.

1028
00:47:30,066 --> 00:47:34,400
And in this service, it tries is tries
to remind ontological neutral.

1029
00:47:34,633 --> 00:47:36,200
Which I think it. Is quite cool.

1030
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,966
So as I. Say, I'm a great admirer.

1031
00:47:38,966 --> 00:47:42,466
Of this project because I think it is
the first significant attempt

1032
00:47:42,533 --> 00:47:45,166
that tries to develop
really or a principle into.

1033
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:47,666
A remarkable.

1034
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:49,100
Metaphysical test.

1035
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,600
Speaker 1: And I think that if.

1036
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,566
Speaker 1: Relative principle theories.

1037
00:47:52,566 --> 00:47:53,400
Could really show.

1038
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,200
Speaker 1: That the theory could support

1039
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,966
or could be construed along
the lines of a neutral moon is to show

1040
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,766
that it's really so persistence
that doesn't come close.

1041
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,166
Speaker 1: Either. To

1042
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,733
conceiving of the nature of

1043
00:48:07,733 --> 00:48:13,166
mind as a mental state or as a mental
as for mental properties or as physical.

1044
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:15,466
It will be a real.

1045
00:48:15,466 --> 00:48:17,566
Achievement, I think.

1046
00:48:17,566 --> 00:48:20,866
But at the same time,
I think that just depending

1047
00:48:20,866 --> 00:48:25,266
on the mathematical framework of Markov.

1048
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,000
Speaker 1: Model doesn't provide sufficient courage
for doing that.

1049
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,966
It doesn't provide a sufficient basis
for boosting

1050
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:36,333
the well-supported form of Mormonism.

1051
00:48:37,766 --> 00:48:38,966
Very cool.

1052
00:48:38,966 --> 00:48:41,866
So it sounds like
there is the eternal debate

1053
00:48:41,866 --> 00:48:45,000
of whether mind leads to matter
or matter leads to mind

1054
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,100
is there one type of thing,
two kinds of things?

1055
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,166
And it would be awesome for free energy
principle to step into that gap.

1056
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,200
But what we've seen so far
with the interpretation

1057
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,533
of the mathematical construct
of the mark of blanket does not

1058
00:48:59,533 --> 00:49:02,666
adequately resolve
this metaphysical question.

1059
00:49:03,066 --> 00:49:09,100
So what kind of analysis or research
or measurements or calculation?

1060
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,666
I mean, I'm a scientist,

1061
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:15,000
so I'm thinking about measurement
in experiments, but as a philosopher,

1062
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,800
what would reduce our uncertainty
about where the step fits into all of us?

1063
00:49:21,033 --> 00:49:24,533
So for
for it to be occurring with philosopher

1064
00:49:24,533 --> 00:49:28,566
to try to prescribe or endorse
anything to the scientist?

1065
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:32,166
The thing. Is that I feel that

1066
00:49:32,766 --> 00:49:34,133
the cool thing about Corrective.

1067
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:36,500
Services and neurosciences is that I.

1068
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,266
Speaker 1: Think that.

1069
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,000
Speaker 1: Philosophical ideas could really be
useful to scientists in this field.

1070
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,633
Speaker 1: But the nature of. This collaboration.

1071
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:46,466
The nature of what.

1072
00:49:46,466 --> 00:49:48,833
Happens here is so sophisticated that.

1073
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:52,733
One can hardly so so I'm told that.

1074
00:49:52,733 --> 00:49:56,000
Prediction is pretty hard,
especially about the future.

1075
00:49:56,266 --> 00:49:59,433
So I couldn't have any idea or.

1076
00:49:59,433 --> 00:50:00,833
Any prescription or.

1077
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:03,933
What can we do to break to.

1078
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:06,733
Make this approach more. Fruitful?

1079
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,933
The only thing that we could say
we could do.

1080
00:50:09,933 --> 00:50:12,300
Is precisely the thing that we are doing.

1081
00:50:12,666 --> 00:50:15,333
Just trying our. Best and collaborating.

1082
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:17,533
So I think. That is why this

1083
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:20,400
is a cool idea, because.

1084
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,666
Speaker 1: It. Allows people from different
backgrounds

1085
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:26,766
come and share their ideas
and we will see whether anything

1086
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:30,000
significant
will emerge from all of that or not.

1087
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,300
Speaker 1: But I think that this is.
The only thing that you could. Do.

1088
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:33,933
But it does mean the only.

1089
00:50:33,933 --> 00:50:37,800
Thing that we have been doing
for quite a while and those for.

1090
00:50:39,433 --> 00:50:43,000
Whom very it's almost like there's
the mind matter dualism and then there's

1091
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,933
the science and the humanities
or science and philosophy.

1092
00:50:46,166 --> 00:50:49,233
And so is one going to envelop the other?

1093
00:50:49,233 --> 00:50:52,366
Is there really only one
and the other one is kind of a subfield.

1094
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:56,800
And instead of playing
into that dichotomized debate,

1095
00:50:56,833 --> 00:51:01,300
which is polarized, it's almost like
we're taking it on to logically neutral

1096
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,766
stance here and highlighting
the importance of coming together

1097
00:51:05,766 --> 00:51:09,300
across different contexts
and having that conversation.

1098
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,133
Speaker 1: So my question on that would be
let's just say

1099
00:51:13,133 --> 00:51:17,800
that there were somebody who were curious
and wanted to jump in to learn more

1100
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:22,166
what kind of research or skills
or mentorship

1101
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,933
might help this person on their journey,
whether they're,

1102
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,600
you know, from a philosophical side
or from a scientific side.

1103
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,666
What do you think would be some key
tips for

1104
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:35,666
somebody
who's just starting on their journey?

1105
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,966
Speaker 1: Oh, well,

1106
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,733
the best thing that I've heard about.

1107
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:46,166
The relationship between two different
disciplines coming from a student

1108
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,666
who's a structuralist
and also a wise philosopher, also saying

1109
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:55,266
that metaphysics is best
for which science and science is best.

1110
00:51:55,266 --> 00:51:57,433
Then of I don't.

1111
00:51:57,433 --> 00:52:01,733
Want to say that informed by metaphysics,
but at least taking some metaphysical

1112
00:52:01,733 --> 00:52:03,300
insight into consideration.

1113
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:07,166
Speaker 1: So but on the other hand,
I think that the nature of.

1114
00:52:08,033 --> 00:52:10,733
Scientific and academic work these days.

1115
00:52:10,966 --> 00:52:12,000
Is so.

1116
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,266
So in other.

1117
00:52:13,266 --> 00:52:15,333
Words, the scientific activity is so

1118
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,466
compartmentalized these days.

1119
00:52:18,466 --> 00:52:19,566
People are doing

1120
00:52:19,566 --> 00:52:23,200
their different walks in different
disciplines in their own labs and.

1121
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,300
Speaker 1: Of the nature.

1122
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:29,333
Speaker 1: Of the problem is so hard that they have
to spend all of their time.

1123
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:32,000
On. A specific problem. So

1124
00:52:33,366 --> 00:52:35,866
I can hardly also provide any advice of

1125
00:52:37,433 --> 00:52:39,133
what kind. Of mentorship suits.

1126
00:52:39,133 --> 00:52:41,833
Anyone who wants to work hard or.

1127
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:44,200
Do some excellent job
afraid or depressed.

1128
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,333
But what I can say that

1129
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:49,833
what's very interesting
about creative principle is that it.

1130
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,500
Speaker 1: Seems to provide.

1131
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,666
Speaker 1: At least some. Of.

1132
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:58,133
Virtues for for a discourse,

1133
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:01,200
some space, for a discourse
between scientists and philosophers.

1134
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,200
Speaker 1: So it seems that sort of some of the

1135
00:53:05,466 --> 00:53:05,733
good.

1136
00:53:05,733 --> 00:53:08,666
Sciences, such as, for example, the max,
but are arms or

1137
00:53:10,166 --> 00:53:13,366
objects constant
or freestone himself or scientist or

1138
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:17,833
or completely interested in philosophical
discussions of what's happening.

1139
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,233
Speaker 1: And it seems that what's even more.

1140
00:53:20,233 --> 00:53:22,500
Wonderful, it seems this.

1141
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,200
Speaker 1: Philosophical.

1142
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,533
Speaker 1: Discussion or affecting the nature
of their work sources.

1143
00:53:26,633 --> 00:53:29,033
I think that is something
that you can hardly observe.

1144
00:53:29,033 --> 00:53:29,766
For example. In

1145
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:31,866
aged of the.

1146
00:53:31,866 --> 00:53:35,300
Our theories of physics, these days,
I don't know whether

1147
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:38,400
the great physicist are studying
philosophy for their amusement or not.

1148
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,233
Speaker 1: But I.

1149
00:53:39,233 --> 00:53:41,666
Doubt that they are in these sorts of

1150
00:53:42,466 --> 00:53:44,266
constructive

1151
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,400
relationship with philosophers. So

1152
00:53:48,866 --> 00:53:51,333
I think that just kind of in.

1153
00:53:51,366 --> 00:53:54,500
The nature of creativity creates,
you felt itself is quite unique

1154
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,700
to the cage, or he brings different
disciplines, we've got

1155
00:53:58,566 --> 00:54:01,600
different ideas
from different disciplines together.

1156
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,666
Speaker 1: So I have.

1157
00:54:02,666 --> 00:54:08,633
No clear idea about the mentorship
or any kind of a schedule or program.

1158
00:54:08,633 --> 00:54:11,833
But I can say that people
who are interested in creativity,

1159
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,666
principle and study.

1160
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:15,633
That our approach has.

1161
00:54:15,633 --> 00:54:17,666
To get a wider scope.

1162
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,400
Speaker 1: We invite. Intellectual school. We.

1163
00:54:21,033 --> 00:54:25,666
We insights from a number of different
disciplines biology,

1164
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:29,733
computational neuroscience,
cognitive psychology, philosophy of mind,

1165
00:54:30,566 --> 00:54:32,566
philosophy of biology,
and that sort of thing.

1166
00:54:32,566 --> 00:54:35,200
So it seems to
cognitive discipline as it is

1167
00:54:38,033 --> 00:54:38,866
theory.

1168
00:54:38,866 --> 00:54:41,500
Principle for response.

1169
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:46,133
And I liked how you grounded the paper
and the presentation in the history

1170
00:54:46,133 --> 00:54:50,100
and the philosophy of science,
because it is a community

1171
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:53,266
that enacts the conversation
around the ideas.

1172
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:57,300
And then when there is not
a healthy dialog, it's kind of like

1173
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,966
the philosophers are sweeping up
after the scientists or vice versa,

1174
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:06,100
or they're just sort of spectators
to each other, but then we're almost

1175
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:10,800
moving towards a fruitful
bi directional conversation

1176
00:55:11,233 --> 00:55:14,300
that actually, as you're pointing out,
with all the specific people

1177
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:18,966
who are taking this into their research
approach, it actually is something

1178
00:55:18,966 --> 00:55:23,133
where the science and the philosophy
are co influencing each other.

1179
00:55:23,566 --> 00:55:25,633
So that's very interesting and special.

1180
00:55:25,633 --> 00:55:28,333
It's almost like it's
such a big scientific idea

1181
00:55:28,933 --> 00:55:32,200
and so challenging that we know
that we need multiple expertizes,

1182
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,366
we know that we're going to need to be
working on it together for a long time

1183
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:39,600
and then that helps set the stage
for something

1184
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,500
that might surprise people because it's
not just coming from their camp.

1185
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,500
Speaker 1: So we have history
and philosophy, science.

1186
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,300
And then I guess another
thread is math, mathematics.

1187
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,500
Markov Blankets, as you pointed out,
came from Perl

1188
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,833
in the 1988 work and has been developed
a lot subsequently.

1189
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:03,066
Where does set or category theory

1190
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:07,100
come into this oh.

1191
00:56:07,466 --> 00:56:10,800
Whoa oh, whoa.

1192
00:56:11,366 --> 00:56:12,633
Very good question.

1193
00:56:12,633 --> 00:56:15,300
So I think that

1194
00:56:15,566 --> 00:56:19,400
in some sense
it depends on your view of your.

1195
00:56:19,433 --> 00:56:21,000
Perspective on mathematics.

1196
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,166
So if you are set towards a foundation
of using mathematic

1197
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,866
if you are a mathematician who.

1198
00:56:28,866 --> 00:56:30,333
Who. Prays

1199
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:33,566
to the God of surgery
every night in his long years,

1200
00:56:33,566 --> 00:56:37,466
you naturally think that every kind
of mathematical theory is coming

1201
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,700
is based on surgery
and surgery has a general condition

1202
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:46,400
or there are other people who are ready
to give this rule to the category theory.

1203
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,500
Speaker 1: But for me, because my engagement.

1204
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,600
Speaker 1: With these ideas
come from a background of structure.

1205
00:56:53,633 --> 00:56:54,400
Of realism,

1206
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,133
the main thing is that

1207
00:57:00,266 --> 00:57:02,400
and it has been.

1208
00:57:02,466 --> 00:57:05,233
Going to the wonderful work. So

1209
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:09,466
suits, perfect suits and that for us.

1210
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,000
And then philosophers of science came.

1211
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:14,666
To rational.

1212
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:18,533
Reconstruction have been the program
from the very beginning

1213
00:57:18,533 --> 00:57:20,900
of the history of philosophy of science.

1214
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,666
Speaker 1: So philosophers and again, it is why.

1215
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,466
Speaker 1: We the principle is so interesting for me

1216
00:57:26,733 --> 00:57:29,600
because of its great unification school.

1217
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,066
Speaker 1: And there have been philosophers.

1218
00:57:32,066 --> 00:57:35,366
Of things and there are some philosophers
outsiders who think that the main job

1219
00:57:35,366 --> 00:57:41,566
of philosophy of science is to form
some ideas about unification of sciences.

1220
00:57:41,566 --> 00:57:44,166
And in order
to bring about this unification and

1221
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,133
philosophers thought of using

1222
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,133
logical formal frameworks

1223
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:54,800
for a state regiment and different
theories from different disciplines.

1224
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,800
So for example, in physics,

1225
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,600
people are using this particular form
of mathematics in biology

1226
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,500
when they are using mathematics,
I so they may use a statistical. Of.

1227
00:58:04,533 --> 00:58:06,933
Theories
or different forms. Of mathematics.

1228
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:09,700
And they came. To this idea that.

1229
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,100
Speaker 1: If we use some form.

1230
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,600
Speaker 1: Of logic, so form, for example, theory
model theory.

1231
00:58:15,066 --> 00:58:17,833
We could have a cool mathematical.

1232
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:20,933
Framework that allows us to regiment
different theories

1233
00:58:20,933 --> 00:58:24,100
from different disciplines
and clarify their relationship together.

1234
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,800
Speaker 1: And have a

1235
00:58:29,366 --> 00:58:30,466
well-stated.

1236
00:58:30,466 --> 00:58:31,800
Clear,

1237
00:58:32,566 --> 00:58:35,666
neatly stated
view of what's happened in the war.

1238
00:58:35,866 --> 00:58:39,900
Assuming that science provides
a reliable picture of the war, if.

1239
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,433
Speaker 1: We could use Model.

1240
00:58:41,433 --> 00:58:43,966
T or set theory.

1241
00:58:44,133 --> 00:58:46,166
And the thing is this

1242
00:58:46,966 --> 00:58:47,666
and I stated.

1243
00:58:47,666 --> 00:58:50,466
This view in a book
that has been published by Springer,

1244
00:58:50,466 --> 00:58:52,366
according to A Structure of egotism.

1245
00:58:52,366 --> 00:58:56,233
I begin to have doubts
about the usefulness.

1246
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:58,333
Or at least realistic.

1247
00:59:00,266 --> 00:59:00,900
Impact.

1248
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:04,500
Speaker 1: Of using search theory and model to
or to represent the features of the war.

1249
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,466
Speaker 1: So I.

1250
00:59:05,466 --> 00:59:09,766
Become a skeptical in the sense
that I hope that this century

1251
00:59:09,766 --> 00:59:13,500
and we'll go to frameworks
or to abstract and.

1252
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,033
Speaker 1: Even encouragement.

1253
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:17,700
The structure of sciences
into this framework.

1254
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:19,366
We are still. Couldn't account

1255
00:59:19,366 --> 00:59:21,866
for scientific representation
because these are.

1256
00:59:22,866 --> 00:59:23,700
The set theory.

1257
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,166
Speaker 1: And categorically
do not represent the world.

1258
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,933
These are scientists
who are representing their work using.

1259
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:31,733
Mathematical models so I try to you

1260
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:35,400
would depart.

1261
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,900
Speaker 1: From the usual base

1262
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:40,233
of scientific representation
on the basis of sectarian model theory.

1263
00:59:40,766 --> 00:59:41,533
And invoke.

1264
00:59:41,533 --> 00:59:46,766
Other sorts of mathematical frameworks
that could provide a better.

1265
00:59:46,766 --> 00:59:48,500
Match, a more.

1266
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,766
Speaker 1: Congenial tool for accounting
for scientific representation.

1267
00:59:51,766 --> 00:59:53,700
If you. Are beginning. To.

1268
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,833
Speaker 1: Try. To introduce some sort of

1269
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,500
information towards you framework and
not only information towards your claim.

1270
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,666
Speaker 1: But embodied.

1271
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:06,966
Information sources framework mean
precisely the same sorts of framework

1272
01:00:06,966 --> 01:00:11,800
that Freestone and colleagues
are using in terms of approximate

1273
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,466
ways the ideas to regiment
the structure of scientific theories.

1274
01:00:15,466 --> 01:00:20,100
Because I came to the idea that those of
us to have a more realistic account,

1275
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,333
if you be able to regiment
the structure of theories into this

1276
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:28,066
approximate Bayesian framework,
for example, instead of sectarian models,

1277
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,233
we could provide a better understanding
of the relationship between.

1278
01:00:32,266 --> 01:00:32,866
Scientific.

1279
01:00:32,866 --> 01:00:34,933
Theories which are actually.

1280
01:00:34,933 --> 01:00:36,900
Embedded. In the brain of societies.

1281
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,900
Or at least in the scientific community
and their target system in the.

1282
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,066
Speaker 1: War because of

1283
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,033
their.

1284
01:00:45,033 --> 01:00:49,066
Centurion model theory or two others
try to take care of the job

1285
01:00:49,666 --> 01:00:53,066
of this kind of approximate Bayesians
there is something that that's used

1286
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:53,666
according to our

1287
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:57,500
besides theories is by default
and by the need to break up organism.

1288
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,766
Speaker 1: And in these. Theories we could. Have.

1289
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,900
Speaker 1: Scientific representations of our

1290
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:06,533
being the relationship
between the organism and its environment.

1291
01:01:06,866 --> 01:01:07,333
But it is.

1292
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:09,733
Another story
which is not directly related to this.

1293
01:01:09,733 --> 01:01:14,200
My program was obtained the. Year
well it's I think.

1294
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,700
Speaker 1: It's super interesting
because this embodied

1295
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,966
and enacted relational approach.

1296
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,233
We can't leave the scientist
out of the picture.

1297
01:01:23,533 --> 01:01:26,100
So it's almost like we remove too much

1298
01:01:26,233 --> 01:01:29,933
when we abstract that relationship away.

1299
01:01:30,366 --> 01:01:34,500
And then it almost hints towards
that electron question from earlier,

1300
01:01:34,766 --> 01:01:37,700
which is, well,
if your ontology or your model is

1301
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,933
just an electron, not even the context,
you're going to be lost

1302
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:43,833
because you won't understand
why certain things are happening

1303
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:46,033
to your system of interest.

1304
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:48,833
And so how do we pull back rigorously

1305
01:01:49,566 --> 01:01:52,666
and include enough context setting

1306
01:01:53,033 --> 01:01:58,300
so that there is an ontology
or a local logic that's making sense?

1307
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,866
So it's just cool,

1308
01:01:59,866 --> 01:02:02,933
like how the historical thread
in the philosophical thread, it's

1309
01:02:02,933 --> 01:02:08,200
not spice or salt on the research,
like just adding it up.

1310
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:13,433
It's actually something
that is, is intertwine us and,

1311
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:18,033
and sets the total scope
of the scientific journey.

1312
01:02:18,033 --> 01:02:20,166
So it's like very cool
to hear about that.

1313
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:24,833
So if there's any other questions
and live chat will ask, but yeah, good

1314
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,233
yeah.

1315
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,566
Speaker 1: Only with regard to the quick Buffalo.

1316
01:02:28,566 --> 01:02:30,233
That was the last point
that you mentioned.

1317
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:33,733
So that might be if the contemporary.

1318
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:37,366
Philosophy of science at least
the dominant approach to the search area

1319
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:40,833
is that precisely as you mentioned,
it needs those deep

1320
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,466
human beings also of the future
when it comes to presentation.

1321
01:02:44,466 --> 01:02:45,800
So there.

1322
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,566
Speaker 1: Were a. Bunch of brilliant
philosophers of science

1323
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,400
such as Ronald Geary and for example,

1324
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,733
Monsignor Cecil,
who you portrayed is still active.

1325
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:56,700
Speaker 1: Who tried to.

1326
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,866
Speaker 1: Provide some sort of cognitive.

1327
01:02:58,866 --> 01:03:01,533
Model. Of scientific practice.

1328
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:06,900
And so I'll say activity, but for some
reasons I'm not sure what the reason.

1329
01:03:07,766 --> 01:03:09,066
It has been pushed.

1330
01:03:09,066 --> 01:03:13,133
Aside and it is not the dominant view
of philosophy of science you gain.

1331
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,400
Speaker 1: So part of.

1332
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,333
Speaker 1: My activity in the philosophy of science

1333
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:19,133
was to bring this sort
of cognitive approach back.

1334
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,366
Speaker 1: To the foreground.

1335
01:03:21,366 --> 01:03:22,200
And I think that.

1336
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,300
Speaker 1: I was fortunate that I bumped up to this

1337
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:27,433
of creator of the principle
and predicted processing because

1338
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,833
in order to account
for cognitive models of science.

1339
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:34,666
So we thought sometimes
we do not just going to in

1340
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,000
your arms are also philosophers
but on to support

1341
01:03:38,033 --> 01:03:41,500
and philosophy of science
about some actual science material.

1342
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:42,600
Speaker 1: And in.

1343
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:47,266
Speaker 1: Order to develop these cognitive models
of studies, cognitive approach

1344
01:03:47,266 --> 01:03:49,000
to philosophy of science,

1345
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,833
it seems that free
and after principle and predictive coding

1346
01:03:52,266 --> 01:03:56,400
are fascinating tools because
they allow us to provide a very cool

1347
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:01,000
and well-supported picture
of the relationship between scientists

1348
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,833
who are basically organism
and the community of scientists.

1349
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:05,500
Which could be.

1350
01:04:06,933 --> 01:04:09,000
Specified in terms of.

1351
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,500
Speaker 1: I don't know, the.

1352
01:04:10,766 --> 01:04:11,866
Free energy principle.

1353
01:04:11,866 --> 01:04:12,600
Commentaries.

1354
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,766
Speaker 1: Of communication
or if we interpret this, the relationship

1355
01:04:15,766 --> 01:04:18,066
between community of scientists
underwater. And.

1356
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,966
Speaker 1: Their environment more on the other.

1357
01:04:20,966 --> 01:04:24,566
And I think that this picture
is much more realistic than the ordinary.

1358
01:04:25,266 --> 01:04:28,400
But the both of those
which are of scientific representation

1359
01:04:28,533 --> 01:04:31,700
that is questionable is yet cool.

1360
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:34,600
Speaker 1: It's like a
yes and with action and inference.

1361
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,966
So philosophy isn't just the armchair.

1362
01:04:36,966 --> 01:04:40,066
What does it look like
to be embodied and inactive?

1363
01:04:40,366 --> 01:04:44,866
And then perhaps it looks like what is
known by the career name of science?

1364
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:45,466
But we know

1365
01:04:45,466 --> 01:04:49,500
that learning and research happens
inside of academia, outside of academia.

1366
01:04:49,766 --> 01:04:53,966
So it is a more realistic picture and
here's a related question from the chat.

1367
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:57,033
Speaker 1: Steven asks This ability

1368
01:04:57,033 --> 01:05:01,200
to dissolve the internal list
and external list do list position

1369
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,500
is a powerful part of Markov and Monism,

1370
01:05:04,366 --> 01:05:06,733
thus giving an open dynamical system

1371
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:10,500
the adaptive open boundaries.

1372
01:05:11,133 --> 01:05:13,266
Any thoughts on this?

1373
01:05:13,266 --> 01:05:15,000
Yeah, I completely agree.

1374
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,666
So in the beginning I told that.

1375
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:18,400
I'm a great admirer of Markov.

1376
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,500
He wanted to know what I think, that

1377
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,533
it is a big step forward, and
this is precisely because of this reason.

1378
01:05:24,066 --> 01:05:24,900
Because it goes.

1379
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,500
Speaker 1: Beyond the scope of the possibilities
in between.

1380
01:05:28,666 --> 01:05:30,600
Go into. So here.

1381
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,000
Speaker 1: It is described as some sort of deal
between internal aspects

1382
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:36,233
and spaces. And.

1383
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,533
Speaker 1: Precedent causes a lot of force

1384
01:05:39,533 --> 01:05:42,900
and energy into developing
these kind of information or geometries.

1385
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,033
That's beginning, I think.

1386
01:05:44,033 --> 01:05:46,466
Is a wonderful form.

1387
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,666
Speaker 1: Of frameworks and models idea.

1388
01:05:48,666 --> 01:05:52,000
So this is precisely, in my.

1389
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,566
Speaker 1: Opinion, for what it is,
because this is precisely the.

1390
01:05:54,566 --> 01:05:58,600
Valuable part of Markov
that he tries to use.

1391
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,766
Speaker 1: This kind of scientific model that.

1392
01:06:01,266 --> 01:06:02,266
Goes beyond.

1393
01:06:02,266 --> 01:06:05,866
This dualism between internal spaces
and external spaces to.

1394
01:06:06,266 --> 01:06:10,200
Develop
some sort of of some some sort of.

1395
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,933
Speaker 1: Motives of metaphysical cases.

1396
01:06:11,933 --> 01:06:15,066
So I completely agree
that this is a brilliant idea.

1397
01:06:15,066 --> 01:06:16,633
So the question is what.

1398
01:06:16,633 --> 01:06:20,700
Sort of philosophy called argumentation
or scientific argumentation.

1399
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:25,033
Could be offered to support.

1400
01:06:25,033 --> 01:06:27,600
This future? So I. Think as as it is.

1401
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,633
Speaker 1: The status of this theory
is not strong enough to.

1402
01:06:32,033 --> 01:06:33,933
Carry the. Metaphysical weight.

1403
01:06:33,933 --> 01:06:35,433
The question is.

1404
01:06:35,633 --> 01:06:35,900
As I.

1405
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:39,133
Speaker 1: Said earlier, computer.

1406
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:41,166
Games to comes with the hope.

1407
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:44,833
To provoke the free energy
principle theories to develop these ideas

1408
01:06:44,866 --> 01:06:46,800
better a more podium. Monism.

1409
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,233
So what sort of.

1410
01:06:48,233 --> 01:06:52,466
Philosophical or scientific argumentation
could be offered. To.

1411
01:06:52,933 --> 01:06:56,133
Support this insight
that has been mentioned

1412
01:06:56,133 --> 01:07:00,933
by the Steven blogs at the core of Markov
and this is the main question.

1413
01:07:02,033 --> 01:07:02,733
Awesome.

1414
01:07:02,733 --> 01:07:05,766
So just in the last few minutes here,

1415
01:07:06,433 --> 01:07:09,033
this paper came out one week ago.

1416
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,233
You probably wrote it

1417
01:07:10,233 --> 01:07:14,866
several months before,
but what are your next research questions

1418
01:07:14,866 --> 01:07:18,900
or what are some exciting ongoing threads
like where do you go?

1419
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,966
Let's say someone read this paper. What?

1420
01:07:20,966 --> 01:07:24,233
Where are you taking
this frontier of thought?

1421
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:26,300
Speaker 1: All right.

1422
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,433
Again, a cool idea.

1423
01:07:29,466 --> 01:07:34,466
So as you have already gathered,
my mind is very disordered

1424
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:38,300
just because I'm pursing
several lines of research together.

1425
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,200
Speaker 1: So of course, all.

1426
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,566
Speaker 1: My research right now
is to develop this kind of model

1427
01:07:43,566 --> 01:07:46,300
because to understand
more and more needs them.

1428
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,066
Speaker 1: To a defense of.

1429
01:07:48,066 --> 01:07:50,900
Modularity is not precisely the source

1430
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:54,466
for glory and regularity,
both at least the source of modularity.

1431
01:07:54,466 --> 01:07:55,233
That are defended.

1432
01:07:55,233 --> 01:07:59,000
But for example, your quickly
and I think that the model this

1433
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,333
that would provide at least.

1434
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:03,966
Some some of grounds for.

1435
01:08:03,966 --> 01:08:06,200
Defending a source of modularity.

1436
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,166
Speaker 1: This is on the other hand

1437
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:09,933
the other thing.

1438
01:08:09,933 --> 01:08:10,766
Is that I feel.

1439
01:08:10,766 --> 01:08:15,200
That there is ample room
for metaphysical.

1440
01:08:15,266 --> 01:08:17,333
Work on this creator to crazy

1441
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:19,966
creator of the principle
theory of consciousness. So

1442
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,066
as you may know, there are already

1443
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:25,433
some more Korean Moonies.

1444
01:08:25,433 --> 01:08:28,466
For example offer
some sort of metaphysical reality.

1445
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,266
Three Bingo.

1446
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:32,200
Theory of.

1447
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,300
Speaker 1: Consciousness.

1448
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:36,600
Speaker 1: But there are also illusionist
course theory.

1449
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,833
Speaker 1: All still uses interpretations.

1450
01:08:38,866 --> 01:08:39,833
Of a.

1451
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:42,633
Theory of consciousness under free
and your crazy people.

1452
01:08:42,966 --> 01:08:45,300
And I think that for. Some reasons.

1453
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,800
Speaker 1: None of this provides a quite.

1454
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,500
Speaker 1: Good metaphysical interpretation
of the theory of consciousness

1455
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,266
under creativity principle.

1456
01:08:53,266 --> 01:08:55,133
So I'm developing other theory.

1457
01:08:55,133 --> 01:08:56,866
I'm trying to.

1458
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:57,366
Develop.

1459
01:08:57,366 --> 01:09:00,000
A theory of consciousness
under the creator of the principle.

1460
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,233
Speaker 1: That could because along the line of.

1461
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,833
Speaker 1: A strong internationalism,
it is associated with

1462
01:09:07,133 --> 01:09:08,700
works of historical work.

1463
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:12,200
So friends
runs out of anti create more recently.

1464
01:09:12,233 --> 01:09:14,266
So it is another.

1465
01:09:14,266 --> 01:09:16,966
Line of research
that I have in mind to associate.

1466
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,000
Speaker 1: This theory of.

1467
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,533
Speaker 1: Consciousness
with some sort of intention in order to.

1468
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,033
Speaker 1: Interrogate or engage with,

1469
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:28,866
as the paper may indicate, I'm.

1470
01:09:29,066 --> 01:09:32,400
Looking for further grounds
for for the results to.

1471
01:09:33,266 --> 01:09:33,933
Develop.

1472
01:09:33,933 --> 01:09:36,333
Or at least so forth is more coherent.

1473
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:37,233
Is that myself?

1474
01:09:37,233 --> 01:09:40,966
So as I say, this paper is just the first
the negative parts

1475
01:09:40,966 --> 01:09:43,733
of some sort of argument
that has to be produced by.

1476
01:09:43,733 --> 01:09:44,333
Others or.

1477
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:46,000
Myself. So

1478
01:09:47,866 --> 01:09:50,066
I. Also am trying to.

1479
01:09:50,066 --> 01:09:52,166
Because because I can see the appeal.

1480
01:09:52,166 --> 01:09:53,500
Of smart populism.

1481
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:57,366
So I try to find reasonable grounds
for supporting theory.

1482
01:09:57,866 --> 01:10:00,100
I'm not sure where does it go, but yeah.

1483
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,566
Speaker 1: It's an awesome approach.

1484
01:10:02,566 --> 01:10:04,200
A lot of times a critique, it's

1485
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,533
almost like Consequentialism
someone says, I don't like your outcome,

1486
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,466
so I'm going to look for all the details
or say that it wasn't really supported

1487
01:10:11,533 --> 01:10:12,566
conclusion.

1488
01:10:12,566 --> 01:10:16,966
And you're almost like saying, Actually,
I do see that goal

1489
01:10:16,966 --> 01:10:21,666
or I see the benefits here
and we just need to navigate

1490
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:25,466
in a slightly new way,
but we're going to be learning

1491
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:29,533
and connecting these ideas along the way
because it isn't mapped how we're going

1492
01:10:29,533 --> 01:10:30,933
to get to Markov modernism.

1493
01:10:30,933 --> 01:10:32,866
And maybe that's
not where we're going, but

1494
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:35,200
we're working towards it.

1495
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:35,866
Speaker 1: I just.

1496
01:10:35,866 --> 01:10:36,933
Get excited and.

1497
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:39,433
Quotes you
because it is related to another part.

1498
01:10:39,433 --> 01:10:42,866
Of my research
which tries to relate creative principle

1499
01:10:42,866 --> 01:10:45,600
to theories of group or group knowledge

1500
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,733
to account for, for example,

1501
01:10:48,733 --> 01:10:51,900
collective intentionality
on the basis of free energy principles.

1502
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:57,566
So Freeston, our fears have produced
very fascinating theories

1503
01:10:57,566 --> 01:11:01,800
of communication and social relation
on the range of principle.

1504
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:03,866
And I think that

1505
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,933
I think the this theory could be applied.

1506
01:11:06,933 --> 01:11:11,366
To develop the parts
of the pieces of our social kingdom.

1507
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,033
There would be wonderful,
wonderful results.

1508
01:11:14,033 --> 01:11:15,566
So it is natural.

1509
01:11:15,566 --> 01:11:18,500
For me to see this kind of scientific.

1510
01:11:18,666 --> 01:11:19,133
Back and.

1511
01:11:19,133 --> 01:11:24,566
Forth between different intellectuals
as some sort of collaboration

1512
01:11:24,566 --> 01:11:28,433
that's consequential, consequential use,
as you phrased that message

1513
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,466
that hopefully leads
to the growth of knowledge in general.

1514
01:11:33,133 --> 01:11:37,633
Yes, the individual in the armchair,
it lends one's toward it

1515
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:41,600
lends one's almost to neuro
reductionism and individualism.

1516
01:11:42,133 --> 01:11:45,966
But when the person is walking around
and at a conference

1517
01:11:45,966 --> 01:11:47,733
and there
they're sharing their experience

1518
01:11:47,733 --> 01:11:51,500
and their learning and being surprised
by by friends and colleagues,

1519
01:11:51,866 --> 01:11:54,866
then there really is something
that's more like distributed cognition

1520
01:11:54,866 --> 01:11:57,000
so all really
look forward to seeing that.

1521
01:11:57,966 --> 01:12:00,600
Majid,
thanks so much for this appearance.

1522
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:05,166
This was an epic and special
first guest stream for our lab,

1523
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:08,233
and you're always welcome.

1524
01:12:08,233 --> 01:12:10,700
Just let us know
if you have any other topics

1525
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:14,366
that you want to come on stream with you
or colleagues or students or anything.

1526
01:12:14,366 --> 01:12:18,600
We're always there to host
and hold the space for this kind of work.

1527
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,700
Speaker 1: So again, thanks a lot for the research
and I'm sure everyone

1528
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:25,000
really appreciated hearing it.

1529
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,533
Speaker 1: Thank you very much for having me.

1530
01:12:26,533 --> 01:12:30,266
And also cool work to do this call back.

1531
01:12:30,266 --> 01:12:31,066
To my friends.

1532
01:12:31,066 --> 01:12:34,800
So good luck with that often
very well done.

1533
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,166
Speaker 1: And thank you very much for having me.

1534
01:12:37,166 --> 01:12:38,766
Great. We'll be in touch.

1535
01:12:38,766 --> 01:12:39,966
So see you later, Majid.
