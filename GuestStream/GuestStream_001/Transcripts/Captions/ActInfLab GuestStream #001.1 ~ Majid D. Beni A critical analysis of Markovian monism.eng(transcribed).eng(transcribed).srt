1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,120
so uh hello i'm

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,399
Majid oh we all all started

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,160
all right so hello

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,200
hi everyone welcome to the active

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,320
inference lab

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,039
and to the first active inference guest

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:17,840
stream

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,560
i'm here with our special guest Majid

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,119
benny

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,880
and we're just really honored and

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,680
excited to be hearing your presentation

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,160
we're going to be having a about 30

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,519
minute presentation

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,479
on whatever you'd like to be speaking on

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,239
and then i'm going to be collecting

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,399
questions from the live chat and then

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,840
relaying them to you

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,280
and it was already just fun to talk to

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,040
you right before we started

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,920
so thanks again Majid and take it away

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,600
go for it

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,320
all right uh hello thank you very much

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:48,640
uh

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,840
yeah i'm very excited too and uh i thank

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,360
you very much for giving me the chance

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,160
to present a part of my work so

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,359
uh i'm basically beginning to speak uh

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,280
what i've done um a part of my work

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,840
uh on a free energy principle so

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,960
i will try to share my screen right now

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,119
because i'm a great believer in

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,119
extended mind and i barely could do

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,640
anything without

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,280
having my screen shared so you you

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,960
mostly able to see my

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,720
screen though yep it looks perfect thank

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,880
you perfect thank you

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,560
so uh uh

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,520
i'm basically going to present uh a part

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,640
of my work in a recent paper in centers

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,119
critical analysis of mercury and monism

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,439
and the structure of this talk is quite

43
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,520
uh a straightforward

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,799
so uh i'm not uh i briefly

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,280
uh very briefly and with a very broad

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,960
branch we'll speak about free energy

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,600
principle and mercury and monism

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,200
so i gloss over the technical stuff

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,079
because

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,280
for one thing i'm a philosopher and i'm

51
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,360
not very well versed in these technical

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,920
aspects and for everything i'm going to

53
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,680
present the core of my work which is

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,758
about scientific models

55
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,720
uh so uh after that i speak briefly

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,319
about scientific models and

57
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,239
scientific modeling in philosophy of

58
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,920
science and coming from the

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,680
background of philosophy of science is

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,080
what uh

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,680
but it is the main part of my

62
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,440
contribution to this literature

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,040
linearity principle to

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
look at it through the lens of

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,560
philosophy of science and issue of

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,640
scientific representation

67
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,840
um then i'm going to um

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,160
describe markovian models as some sort

69
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,319
of scientific models and

70
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,319
scrutinize their relationship with their

71
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,519
target model in the

72
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,360
real world and see whether any of these

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,440
descriptions of the relationship between

74
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,200
mercury and models and their target

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,120
system could support smart coffee and

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,560
monism

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,879
and briefly at the end i will also

78
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,280
evaluate

79
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,720
friston and colleagues attempted

80
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
developing markovian moonism along the

81
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,440
lines of structural realism

82
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,959
so um

83
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,840
so most probably you know more than a

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,200
free energy principle

85
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,239
and predictive processing uh the idea

86
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,080
has been reintroduced to

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,760
uh science but so the roots are

88
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,879
this idea seems to be quite old but uh

89
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,920
it it has been or introduced to resort

90
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,400
to

91
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,560
science by car freestyle and colleagues

92
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,480
and it is all based on

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,840
simple and subtle idea so

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,799
uh generally

95
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
it provides a framework that explains

96
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,879
how a biological system exposed to

97
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,760
random and

98
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,080
unpredictable fluctuation in its

99
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,480
external environment can restrict itself

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,439
to occupying

101
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,400
a limited number of a state and

102
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,120
therefore

103
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,599
therefore survive in some recognizable

104
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,080
form so

105
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,840
uh in order to uh be able to resist the

106
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,920
uh dispersing uh force of the

107
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,080
environment the organism have to

108
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,040
in a nutshell have to keep the amount of

109
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,560
its free energy

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,358
low and uh predictive processing is some

111
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:19,918
sort of

112
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,839
theory of application indicating that

113
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,680
when applied to the brain of

114
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,639
some kind of system such as ourselves in

115
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:26,960
all

116
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,080
free energy minimizing free energy

117
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,600
uh could be specified in terms of uh

118
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,840
minimization of prediction error so

119
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,520
there are these generative models in the

120
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,240
brain and

121
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,120
through a process of a top-down process

122
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,680
the brain

123
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,280
or the organism endeavor to uh

124
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,680
apply these models to reality or at

125
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,000
least to check them against real against

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,320
the

127
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,160
evidence that it receives from the

128
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,600
external world

129
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,479
um and then there is discrepancy it

130
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,919
endeavors to

131
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,280
uh uh

132
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,919
somehow revise the models update its

133
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,919
model or at least make changes to the

134
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,520
environment so there is

135
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,320
uh some sort of action by the covers

136
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,960
mental action or over attacking but

137
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,000
active influence is the uh other

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,280
side of minimization of prediction error

139
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,919
and uh princeton and colleagues mainly

140
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,639
prison

141
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,199
um developed free energy principle into

142
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,120
a fascinating theory of consciousness in

143
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,680
terms of

144
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,720
uh temporary richness or temporal depth

145
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,759
of

146
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,160
generative model so not only some

147
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,240
organism can

148
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,600
minimize their free energy and

149
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,520
optimize the representation of the

150
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,360
environment they could also

151
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,800
somehow form some sort of a foresight or

152
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,960
prediction about the possible outcomes

153
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,960
of their action in the environment and

154
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,280
it seems that this capacity is somehow

155
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,720
tied

156
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,680
up with conscious properties or

157
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,919
consciousness

158
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,240
and of course there is this idea of uh

159
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,440
mark of blankets

160
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,520
uh judah appeal introduced them i think

161
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,680
in

162
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,160
1980s and there are some sort of

163
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,600
bayesian networks uh which could help us

164
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,360
to make a distinction between

165
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,440
conditional independent account for the

166
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,080
conditional independence between

167
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,440
uh internal and external spaces

168
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,560
so uh the literature itself

169
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,199
uh free energy principle has been quite

170
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,160
flourishing

171
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,440
uh quite a number of scientists and

172
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,720
philosophers

173
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,520
uh have uh contributed to developing

174
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,400
this literature

175
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,360
and amongst the philosophers up to just

176
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,000
to mention

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,319
a few of them are great people who

178
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,840
contributed such as

179
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,240
uh jakub pauling andy clark sean

180
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,440
gallagher and

181
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,280
uh even people who are coming from a

182
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,440
background of philosophy of science such

183
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,039
as stefan hartman

184
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,039
have contributed to this uh rich

185
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,319
literature

186
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,919
uh but uh what what's interesting is

187
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:10,720
that the

188
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,120
free energy critical has not been

189
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,800
developed into some sort of

190
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,680
metaphysical test is about cognition or

191
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,120
consciousness or brain

192
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,319
so as far as i can see

193
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,080
this uh paper

194
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
which is the target paper of my paper

195
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
incentives from cartesian duality to

196
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,639
markovian modernism is the subtitle

197
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,160
of prison and whis and hobson uh as far

198
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,120
as i can see

199
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,880
it is uh the main work the main paper

200
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,039
uh that actually contributed to

201
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,639
uh spelling out the metaphysical

202
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,599
uh implications of the free energy

203
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,360
principle this is the main paper as far

204
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,639
as i can see that

205
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,120
try to develop free energy principle

206
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,639
into some sort of

207
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,840
metaphysical uh testis of consciousness

208
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,680
and i think that for this reason alone

209
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,720
the paper

210
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,840
deserves uh attention and uh i

211
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,720
i'm a great admirer of the sport i

212
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
usually do not engage with

213
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,720
uh reviewing or criticizing single

214
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,759
papers but

215
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,919
this paper attracted my attention and

216
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,840
interest because i think that

217
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,360
uh this is so even before this uh people

218
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,080
such as for

219
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,520
for example fristen and thompson

220
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,840
themselves try to develop a free energy

221
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,599
principle into a theory of consciousness

222
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,760
that provides a point to

223
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,240
um cartesian dualism uh

224
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,599
try to do so but as far as i can see

225
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,680
here for the first time free energy

226
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,080
principle has been developed into

227
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,760
a very uh well-defined

228
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,200
metaphysical thesis which is monism

229
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,360
so the main point here is that i'm more

230
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,240
sympathetic

231
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,080
to the goal of this paper to the

232
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,920
objective of this paper that at times

233
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,800
the paper may

234
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,399
indicate and what i'm going to say

235
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,959
uh is mainly uh aim to

236
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,800
invoke provoke the free energy

237
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
principles to develop this markovian

238
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,320
monism into

239
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,680
a slightly a

240
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,399
better uh account a well-supported

241
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,080
account of consciousness metaphysical

242
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,680
account of consciousness

243
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,440
and i'm going to look at this issue

244
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,040
through the lens of philosophy of

245
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,800
science to see the relation between

246
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,080
markovian

247
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,040
blankets and other environments as some

248
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,720
sort of relation between scientific

249
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,560
models because markovian models are some

250
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,320
sort of scientific models and i'm going

251
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,360
to

252
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,480
uh argue for provide some argumentations

253
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,360
for that

254
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,120
uh to draw a connection between

255
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,360
uh markovian models on the one hand and

256
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,040
the target system on the other hand and

257
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,880
so-called consciousness that appears

258
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,640
through this relationship

259
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,839
uh could be uh put into some sort of

260
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,760
modernism which is a metaphysical test

261
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,200
so i'm going to look at this issue

262
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,560
through the lens of philosophy of

263
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,800
science

264
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,000
and unfold the implication

265
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,160
as part of the implication for markovian

266
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,519
monism so

267
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,959
the test is itself markovian monism uh

268
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,040
is quite a straightforward i have

269
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,120
highlighted the part of it for you here

270
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,560
so the thesis is is that fundamentally

271
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,480
there is only one type of thing

272
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,480
and only one type of irreversible

273
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,600
property

274
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,560
and markovian blankets form the calculus

275
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,680
of belief which is not

276
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,079
only a nice scientific mathematical

277
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,160
model of consciousness but also provides

278
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,120
a clear

279
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,000
metaphysical statement and i can shed

280
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,120
light on

281
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,079
current philosophical debates so um the

282
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,440
highlighted parts

283
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,920
so it is this is the statement of

284
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,680
markovian moonism

285
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,880
and the red part indicates that

286
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,000
oh how forcefully the

287
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,800
theory have been uh spelled out in

288
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,399
metaphysical terms so

289
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,320
there is only one type of thing is a

290
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,240
strong metaphysical

291
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,880
thesis and this is something that has

292
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,320
been also stated

293
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,160
in a frieza and colleague's paper

294
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,000
so and i here i highlighted another part

295
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,360
of the same phrase

296
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,320
which indicates that

297
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,640
this statement of consciousness on the

298
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,200
basis of markovian models is not just a

299
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,399
nice scientific

300
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,640
or mathematical model of consciousness

301
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,320
but also provides a

302
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,120
metaphysical statement so the main

303
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,399
question here

304
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,720
is that how could uh hong kong that we

305
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,800
could build

306
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,560
hong kong that we could read of a

307
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,480
metaphysical thesis

308
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,360
on the basis of or scientific models of

309
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,200
the phenomena scientific mathematical

310
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,040
models of phenomena

311
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,800
uh so i'm going to uh

312
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,839
um ask this question as i say through

313
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,000
the lens of philosophy of science to see

314
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,760
what's the relation between i i think

315
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,639
that this

316
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,480
basic question of philosophy of science

317
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,000
what's the relation between scientific

318
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,120
models

319
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,440
and their target system they are

320
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,040
significantly on

321
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,120
the claim of markovian monism which

322
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,399
tries to

323
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,920
develop some sort of a strong

324
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,000
metaphysical thesis on the basis

325
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,079
of this efficient modeling tool

326
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,160
scientific modeling tool which are

327
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,279
mark of blankets

328
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,360
so this is an insight from

329
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,839
a philosophy of science and the insight

330
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,560
has been

331
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,880
i think that originally it has its roots

332
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,600
in works

333
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,680
of uh ronald geary and

334
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,120
uh uh paul churchland for example

335
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,800
uh and a number of and bosnian foreign

336
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,240
himself a number of important

337
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,920
philosophers of science who have been

338
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,839
developing this idea in

339
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,639
a model-based approach to scientific

340
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,839
tourism

341
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,880
uh 1980s and it has been recently

342
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,079
uh surfaced

343
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,880
uh resurfaced in works of michael

344
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,680
weisberg

345
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,040
and uh roman frigg and

346
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,360
uh god frieza so and the general idea is

347
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,160
that scientific practice is basically

348
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,240
consists of model making making

349
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,920
scientific models

350
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,120
and the thing is that so if you have

351
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,240
when engaging in scientific practice we

352
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,000
just do not directly engage in

353
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,720
in reading of the ideas from the feature

354
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,600
of word

355
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,440
uh reading of the theories the theories

356
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,639
do not just

357
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,040
latch on to the word directly there is

358
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,720
some sort of representation

359
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,399
and the representational relation

360
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,079
between scientific theory scientific

361
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:52,720
models

362
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,920
and the world is in indirect so

363
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,399
scientific theories do not represent the

364
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,839
features of the work directly

365
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,360
the main thing here is that uh quite a

366
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,000
few

367
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,519
uh human factors interfere through the

368
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,680
process of scientific representation

369
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,160
so to name only a few for example

370
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,199
scientist

371
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,399
interests and explanatory uh goals and

372
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,680
intentions uh play a role in how

373
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,519
scientists are constructing their

374
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,199
scientific models and how use them to

375
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,000
represent the features of reality by

376
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
scientific models and as

377
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,240
uh well free for example among other

378
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,600
people explains this

379
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,279
you know process of indirect

380
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,160
representation

381
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,800
is quite sophisticated it includes

382
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,279
several

383
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,079
stages such as denotation or designation

384
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,160
example

385
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,560
exemplification kingdom and imputation

386
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,680
so

387
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
uh the main point here the take-home

388
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,279
point here is that the relationship

389
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,360
between scientific models on that one

390
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,600
and

391
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,320
our reality on the other hand or the

392
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,040
target system on the other hand is quite

393
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,560
uh sophisticated it is never

394
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,600
straightforward

395
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,800
and there are three ways of so and mark

396
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,680
mark of blankets markovian models are

397
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,240
just

398
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,320
efficient scientific tools in the

399
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,519
modelers of

400
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,079
toolbox that allow the modeler to

401
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,240
represent the features of the world in

402
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,519
indirectly so i'm going to speak about

403
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,959
three ways of

404
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,399
uh understanding markovian models um

405
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,320
i'm beginning so uh as the sketch that i

406
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,279
showed earlier

407
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,759
uh in the case i'm beginning with uh

408
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,240
interpreting markovian models as

409
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,880
physical or material models first and as

410
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,240
fictional models and

411
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,360
finally as mathematical models and this

412
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,680
order has been chosen deliberately

413
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,880
because i'm going from

414
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,399
the at least likely reading of markovian

415
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,639
models i'm going to are the most likely

416
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,040
interpretation of markovian models

417
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,880
so i'm convinced that markovian models

418
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,160
could be understood this

419
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,600
as some sort of mathematical models

420
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,839
but i also consider other options

421
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,199
because there are some sort of

422
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,320
textual evidence to support them so for

423
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,399
example we could it is indeed possible

424
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,519
to understand more

425
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,160
blankets or markovian models as some

426
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
sort of

427
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,320
physical models material models for

428
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,880
example christian says in uh

429
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,560
uh 2019 paper that

430
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,440
the marco blanket is not some aesthetic

431
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,240
statistical device by which we could

432
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,399
or we use it to observe or model the

433
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,839
world it is the

434
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,800
necessary attributes of the universe

435
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,360
that

436
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,399
can be carved into things

437
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,480
so at least to a first approximation we

438
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,360
try to read this phrase or the second

439
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,000
phrase from the same paper it seems that

440
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,480
uh for uh free energy principle theories

441
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,320
for freedom for example

442
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,040
a mark of blankets are actually features

443
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,639
of the reality themselves they are

444
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,240
physical things there are real

445
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,280
real things oats there and

446
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,599
so uh i think that it is not uh only

447
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,559
freezing is

448
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,520
advocating this uh reading i think that

449
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,640
also

450
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,520
i i have seen similar phrases in for

451
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,119
example

452
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,520
these and medsingers introduction to

453
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,000
predictive processing and also in

454
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,439
allen and freestone's papers since uh

455
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,480
2060 i think so uh this is

456
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,559
there is some textual basis for

457
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,400
understanding markovia but marco

458
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,120
blankets as physical models

459
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,240
but uh i think

460
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,400
and i think that this indication this

461
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
reference to mark of blankets as

462
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,720
physical things has to be taken with

463
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,559
a grain of salt i do not think that

464
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,559
there are actually such things so if we

465
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,840
for example

466
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,559
open the brain or open an organic system

467
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,480
i do not think that we can find anything

468
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,559
resembling a markovian blanket there

469
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,360
actually

470
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,600
there is no blanket there there is no

471
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,760
such physical thing

472
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,360
but i can't understand if a terrorist

473
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,559
uh could conceive of

474
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,400
the target system as if it really

475
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,840
include this

476
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,960
uh representational device but the point

477
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,200
is that even if we consider somehow

478
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,960
considered that markov blankets

479
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,039
markovian models are

480
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,120
uh features of reality or physical

481
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,200
things that exist in the world

482
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,280
even if we can't say that it doesn't

483
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,000
follow that

484
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,799
reality itself shares the ontological

485
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,679
and material features of markov balance

486
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,280
it doesn't follow that uh

487
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,480
there is the same uh

488
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,600
cells same ontological category that

489
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,840
includes both markov blankets and their

490
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,520
target system and there is an example

491
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,360
that could demonstrate that so

492
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,840
for example there is a such thing as a

493
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,320
hydraulic pump

494
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,520
model of economics so hydraulic pump is

495
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,120
a physical object

496
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,440
and for hydraulic model to work some

497
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,840
properties of economic system mostly

498
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,360
identified with

499
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,919
uh hitlering properties of the pond it

500
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,240
could be for example

501
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,919
uh exemplified through the process of

502
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,000
imputation we could

503
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,919
ascribe or attribute some of the

504
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,000
properties of the literary poem to the

505
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
physical object

506
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,640
uh sorry

507
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,799
to to ascribe some of the properties of

508
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,720
israeli poem to the economical system

509
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,720
that is supposed to be represented

510
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,400
but it doesn't follow that the

511
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,640
economical system and hydraulic pump

512
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
which is the physical objects

513
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,320
uh can be put under the same ontological

514
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,960
category or material category so for

515
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,320
example hydraulic foam which is a

516
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,600
physical object

517
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,039
is made of for example steel or plastic

518
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:55,600
or some

519
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,360
some other material thing it doesn't

520
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,919
follow that economy shares this

521
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,039
material antique futures

522
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,760
uh so uh i i simply uh put the

523
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,880
uh materialist interpretation

524
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,960
of mark mark of blankets aside

525
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,240
and proceed to consider markov blankets

526
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,520
as fictional models

527
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,559
so and the main reason for this is that

528
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,760
i assume that if we

529
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,640
uh for example explore the actual brain

530
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,480
of organism we couldn't find anything

531
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,200
resembling a mark of blankets inside the

532
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,159
brains

533
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,120
so we could interpret them as some some

534
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,919
sort of

535
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,280
fictional objects and

536
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,679
uh so and

537
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,559
the fictionalist and again there are

538
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,640
textual support for this for example

539
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,799
christian

540
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,159
and colleagues say that if if we

541
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,320
look into the behavior of creatures

542
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,880
through the lenses of marconi and models

543
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,600
it will look as if it is acting the

544
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,000
creature

545
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,159
is acting to minimize its particle or

546
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,480
surf right zone so

547
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,600
this as if phrase luke has a phrase uh

548
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,360
i think that is very important it

549
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,120
indicates that they do not really think

550
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,559
that there is such thing as marco

551
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,400
polanki's in the creature but

552
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,200
uh it's look as if there is such thing

553
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,600
and

554
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,559
um it has been this interpretation this

555
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,120
fictionalist

556
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,080
instrumentalist interpretation

557
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,520
is gaining momentum as far as i can see

558
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,720
so there are a number of

559
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,320
other people such as maxwell ramstad and

560
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,520
uh venus uh that are developing some

561
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,840
sort of fictionalist and instrumentalist

562
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,880
interpretation

563
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,600
of free energy principle but the thing

564
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,520
is that if you concept this fictionalist

565
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,720
interpretation of

566
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,919
marco blanket our free energy principle

567
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,520
uh it follows that so if marco blankets

568
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,080
are used for fictions we couldn't uh

569
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,880
derive any sort of metaphysical

570
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,400
conclusion from them so

571
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,080
from a fiction so for example if you are

572
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,919
studying uh greek mythology

573
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,600
and assuming that greek mythology is

574
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,120
some sort of fiction

575
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,520
you cannot derive any conclusion about

576
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,880
the nature of deity

577
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,600
from what you read in a story from greek

578
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,480
mythology

579
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,799
there are no metaphysical conclusions to

580
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,200
be derived from

581
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,520
fictions and stories and this is

582
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,960
precisely the point

583
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,600
in invoking a fictionalized approach to

584
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,200
scientific models so

585
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,600
people are using fiction assuming that

586
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,200
scientific models are fiction

587
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,000
are useful instruments to just get rid

588
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,840
of the metaphysical questions about the

589
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,120
nature of fiction

590
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,720
models or their relationship with

591
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
reality so

592
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,400
to make a longer story show this

593
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,200
fictionalist interpretation doesn't lead

594
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,240
to any sort of metaphysical

595
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,320
conclusion about the nature of

596
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,720
consciousness or the nature of mind or

597
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,440
anything of that sort

598
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,280
so this brings us to

599
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
the last interpretation of markov

600
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,080
blankets and it comes in terms of

601
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,960
doesn't see how much time or everything

602
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,720
i don't have much time i try to

603
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,000
wrap it up quickly so uh the the final

604
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,120
interpretation

605
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,720
is uh to interpret

606
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,960
markov blankets in terms of mathematical

607
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,240
models

608
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,880
uh and i think that there is good

609
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,559
textual growth so uh

610
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,520
it is to to at least to my mind to some

611
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,280
extent from for someone who is coming

612
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,799
from a background or philosophy of

613
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,760
science

614
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
it seems rather obvious that marco

615
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,000
collected are just mathematical modeling

616
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,679
tools so they are

617
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,600
mathematical tools in the context of

618
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,320
bayesian networks to describe to

619
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,200
represent

620
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,240
their conditional uh

621
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,559
independence between internal and

622
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,360
external

623
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,799
spaces uh and there is uh

624
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,120
textual evidence for that again i have

625
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,720
highlighted part of that

626
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,080
which indicates that their enterprise

627
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,240
aims to describe a construct from

628
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,760
information theory

629
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,760
and mathematical physics

630
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,440
that helps them to define

631
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,559
the properties of living system and

632
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,679
their cognition

633
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,640
and give them some sort of meaningful

634
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,840
interpretation by invoking

635
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
uh mathematical objects that could be

636
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,960
used to

637
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,080
consolidate this interpretation so

638
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,200
uh and the use of so

639
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,919
i i think that there is some sort of

640
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:44,960
enlightenment

641
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,880
inside uh in modern philosophy of

642
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,080
science

643
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,360
uh in the wake of works of patrick soups

644
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,320
and basman for us and in 1960s and 1970s

645
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,840
uh so people's attention has been drawn

646
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,640
to

647
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,279
the importance of mathematical models

648
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,039
sec theory and model theory and that

649
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,480
sort of stuff

650
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,480
uh for modeling natural phenomena

651
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,840
so when doing science scientists

652
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,000
so the rise of modern in some sense the

653
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
rise of modern science

654
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,320
uh has been a result of invoking these

655
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,679
sorts of mathematical approaches that

656
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,840
allow us to

657
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,480
represent and model natural phenomena of

658
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,840
you know

659
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,279
precision and vigor and rigor but

660
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,360
uh the thing is that if we assume that

661
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,279
markovian models are some sort of

662
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,400
mathematical

663
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,480
tools that can be used to represent the

664
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,159
features of reality

665
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,600
the thing is that we couldn't develop

666
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,080
any sort of metaphysical conclusion

667
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,240
about the nature of reality on the basis

668
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,159
of application of these mathematical

669
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,039
tools

670
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,240
look if we assume that markov blankets

671
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,720
are

672
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,880
mathematical tools and if we want to

673
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,039
identify their nature with the nature of

674
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,200
reality the only conclusion that follows

675
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,799
is that the reality is some sort of

676
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,480
mathematical objects it's some sort of

677
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,000
mathematical entity

678
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,240
and interestingly enough as i will argue

679
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,400
this is precisely the same sort of

680
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
conclusion that

681
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,799
uh that uh fristen and colleagues

682
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,919
uh reached uh

683
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,120
in the end of their paper so uh at some

684
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,960
sense they are saying that they are

685
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,600
in they intend to defend some sort of a

686
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,559
reductive

687
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,279
materialist or redacted physicalist but

688
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,279
what happens is that

689
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,520
they come to the conclusion that because

690
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,679
these two ways of describing the nature

691
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,600
of reality this division on the basis of

692
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,039
markovian monuments

693
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,159
to external and internal spaces because

694
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,120
uh none of these

695
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,760
interpretations known of these

696
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,600
geometries that they develop none of

697
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,000
this

698
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,320
intrinsic and extrinsic perspective

699
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,840
could be

700
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,400
supported under the assumption that

701
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,600
neither perspective

702
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,760
is privileged one would have to conclude

703
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,159
that reality is fundamentally

704
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,600
ontologically neutral and they assume

705
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,159
that by speaking of ontological neutral

706
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,360
neutral nature of reality they are

707
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,440
trying to build open uh the mathematical

708
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,399
nature of markovian blankets markovian

709
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,919
models

710
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,600
to make concession on some sort of

711
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,840
monism which identifies the nature of

712
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,200
reality as neither physical nor mental

713
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,679
uh but i would say that it would be

714
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,159
quite a lot to read into

715
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,279
the use of mathematical models so

716
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,159
of course mathematical tools are neither

717
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,200
in some sense

718
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,919
are not neither a mental nor physical if

719
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:56,799
you are not

720
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,880
an idealist or realist especially if you

721
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,640
are not a physicalist or idealistic

722
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,120
mathematical entities but it doesn't

723
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
follow that the target systems that

724
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,240
could be used

725
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,559
on the basis of using these mathematical

726
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,679
tools itself

727
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,520
the reality the target system that is

728
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
going to be used by invoking this sort

729
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,039
of mathematical tools itself is neither

730
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,159
mental nor physical so this is the

731
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,480
conclusion of the paper and for

732
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,640
coming to that conclusion i have also

733
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,919
discussed some sort of

734
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,080
structural reality interpretation of the

735
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,600
paper again it is

736
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
about the relation between mathematical

737
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,520
tools and the physical reality that they

738
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,240
represent

739
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,120
so uh again fristen and colleagues would

740
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,000
be happy to

741
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,080
uh make conversation on some sort of

742
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,279
structural realities

743
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,520
uh interpretation of their markovian

744
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,480
modernism

745
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,640
but in the context of the structural

746
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,760
realism too a structural realist as

747
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
some of the leading structural realists

748
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
such as steven french and

749
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,080
james lady man are quite explicit about

750
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
this clear

751
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,320
they do not make their ontological

752
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,000
commitment on the basis

753
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,399
of the mathematical framework that they

754
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,600
use so

755
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,760
they use mathematical framework they use

756
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,679
modal theory they use set theory because

757
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,720
they believe that

758
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,480
this semantic framework modal

759
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,840
theoretical approach or

760
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,120
set theory capital to science uh virus

761
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,520
it's

762
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,559
uh structuralist loyalties on its

763
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,520
sleeves but it doesn't mean that

764
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,080
ontology itself could be read off from

765
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,440
the features of this

766
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,720
mathematical tools that they use so

767
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,960
they are very clear that the job of the

768
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,919
mathematical tools that they use so

769
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,039
uh orthodox structurings are using

770
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,200
mathematical tools such as set theory

771
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,840
and modal theory and category theory

772
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
but they are very clear that the job of

773
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,760
these mathematical tools is mainly

774
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,279
representational it is not

775
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,600
constitutional it is not ontological on

776
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,039
the other hand it is the physical

777
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,399
reality that is supposed to be

778
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,440
represented

779
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,000
that has some sort of ontological

780
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,520
constitutional rule

781
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,320
and with regard to markovian monism if

782
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,760
you want to derive any sort

783
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,240
so the use of the mere application of

784
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,840
markovian

785
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,159
doesn't lead to any sort of metaphysical

786
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,120
conclusion

787
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,440
because markovian models are themselves

788
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,840
mainly representational tools they

789
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,360
help us to represent features of the

790
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,399
reality

791
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,640
that is the target system the brain or

792
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,520
consciousness

793
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,520
or organism or the environment or

794
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,120
whatever attitude

795
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,360
it doesn't itself we could not build

796
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,679
upon the features of this mathematical

797
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,240
model

798
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,159
itself to derive any source of

799
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,480
ontological or metaphysical contribution

800
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,799
of the features of the target system

801
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,320
so uh thank you very much for listening

802
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,360
and uh i

803
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,360
i hope that what i said makes some sense

804
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,559
at least to some of you

805
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,640
but although i could not be completely

806
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,320
sure so thank you very much

807
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,360
awesome thank you for that fascinating

808
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,559
presentation

809
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,039
we already have a couple questions in

810
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,200
the chat so if anyone else wants to

811
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,880
ask questions we'll have a good amount

812
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,240
of time now just to

813
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,880
talk a little bit and i'll just read um

814
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,399
down the questions that were asked in

815
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,640
the chat and a few things i wrote down

816
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,000
so the first question in the chat was um

817
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,799
as far as different styles of monism or

818
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,360
different

819
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,880
threads in the history and the

820
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,880
philosophy of monism

821
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,320
how does a dawkins based monism

822
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,279
so thinking about like memes biological

823
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,360
or non-biological mimetics

824
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,000
that's kind of a dawkins monism how does

825
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,799
that parallel or overlap with fristonian

826
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,960
monism so in other words how does

827
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,399
fristin's monism

828
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,600
or the markovian monism relate

829
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,559
or overlap with other approaches to

830
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,279
monist

831
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,000
type theories

832
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,799
uh well uh thank you very much

833
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,320
uh for the question i'm so i'm not very

834
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,159
knowledgeable about the different types

835
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,519
of monies and

836
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,159
so i knew about some quite classical

837
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,039
theories of

838
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,200
modernism i know a few things about for

839
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,240
example

840
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,440
are russellian monism or uh the form of

841
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,000
monism that has been developed by

842
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,120
char sanders pairs aside from for

843
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,720
example the classical forms that are

844
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,640
developed by espinosa

845
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,840
but so i'm not very well versed

846
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,080
i'm not very knowledgeable about this

847
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,158
kind of dark kinsey and momentism

848
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,399
i barely know anything about memes

849
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,720
and i'm not sure that we could identify

850
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
men as real ontological

851
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,080
entities but uh and i have already

852
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,919
argued that i have some sort of

853
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,960
uh misgivings about

854
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,640
uh pristine and these uh and hobson's

855
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,960
version of monism so

856
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,799
uh i do not want to give a ready-made

857
00:32:58,799 --> 00:32:59,360
answer

858
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,080
i would say that if the arkansas monism

859
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,279
are resembles

860
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,399
a fristonian monism with regard to the

861
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,120
fact that it

862
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,799
involves memes which are uh

863
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,640
as far as i can guess some sort of

864
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,159
theoretical tools

865
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,840
as features of reality uh it could be

866
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,080
liable to the same kind of objections

867
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,960
that i have

868
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,000
uh experienced here against

869
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,320
the fristonian kind of momentum

870
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,559
thanks for the clear answer and i guess

871
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,159
the follow-up on that is

872
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,559
where do you situate this markovian

873
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,440
monism

874
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,519
in relationship to these classical kinds

875
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,600
of monism that you just mentioned is

876
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,279
that discussed in the paper or what

877
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,399
how would you frame that so

878
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,960
uh all right uh thank you very much

879
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,000
again it is

880
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,840
it is a fascinating question so before

881
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,919
this i have developed some sort of a

882
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,120
structural realist

883
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,039
uh theories of uh consciousness too

884
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,399
that happened basically based so my own

885
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,519
approach

886
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,640
to a free energy principle is associated

887
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,639
with some sort of a structural realism

888
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,440
too

889
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,679
so again i myself have invoked some sort

890
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,359
of mathematical structure

891
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,879
embodied informational structures uh

892
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,760
to describe the structure of the mind

893
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,520
and consciousness and my basic

894
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,320
uh argumentation there was that this

895
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,520
structure

896
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,918
sort of underpin the diversity between

897
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,679
different icons of consciousness in

898
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,480
terms of free energy principle uh gay

899
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,440
org north hopes resting estate activity

900
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,719
theory and for example uh integrated

901
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,040
information theory of consciousness so

902
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,599
i myself have developed some sort of a

903
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,679
structural realist but with regard to

904
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,000
the

905
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,639
metaphysical aspects with regard to so i

906
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,839
see monism

907
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,359
specifically as some sort of

908
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,199
metaphysical approach and

909
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,440
also i have been very cautious with

910
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,880
regard to stating

911
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,320
a metaphysical stance so the version of

912
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,000
a structural realism that i have

913
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,160
defended was some sort of epistemic

914
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,400
structure realism it wasn't still

915
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,920
realism

916
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,800
but it was epistemic in the sense that

917
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,119
uh

918
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,359
i was ready to make commitment to the

919
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,040
fact that to the extent that our

920
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,280
scientific or scientific knowledge

921
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,599
is informing us the future of reality is

922
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,079
a structure but we couldn't make

923
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,960
uh assertions about the nature of

924
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,560
reality itself so

925
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,240
whether it is a structure or not or

926
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,240
whether it is uh

927
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,880
the same stuff uh this the cell same

928
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,119
stuff that is there or there are several

929
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,400
kind of substances so uh i

930
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,320
i profess agnosticism uh about the

931
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,400
features of reality in itself

932
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,320
so the version of a structural realism

933
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,599
that i defended was episodic and i

934
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,800
have no stance on the nature of reality

935
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,240
in itself whether of

936
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,480
monies or dualist types or any other

937
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,200
kind of approach that's really

938
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,240
interesting um

939
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,240
seems pretty fair to be agnostic on the

940
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,240
ultimate structure of reality and you

941
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,079
had a quote on one of the slides that

942
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,000
the structural realism is taking the

943
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,200
pressure off of

944
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,960
strong ontological commitments so

945
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,359
how would you summarize this kind of

946
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,280
best of both worlds

947
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,000
structural realism approach are we just

948
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,520
is it a buffet are we just taking what

949
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,079
we like

950
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,040
or what are we committing to with um

951
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,760
epistemic

952
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,960
structural realism very very very good

953
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,359
so uh i think that it is partly

954
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,920
an issue of motivations so uh when

955
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,720
stating

956
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,040
a structural realism for example people

957
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,839
such as

958
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,520
john laurel uh built open arguments from

959
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,680
history of science to argue that so

960
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,800
uh it takes the pressure of

961
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,359
untold pressure in the sense that it

962
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:55,920
doesn't

963
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,720
make commitments to the intrinsic nature

964
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,720
of entities it doesn't make

965
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,440
commitment to objects it is committed

966
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,040
mainly to the relations

967
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,920
so uh and i think that uh i'm defending

968
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,440
some sort of epistemic form of a

969
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,200
structural realism because as i say it

970
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,640
is completely agnostic about the

971
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,720
features of reality itself so

972
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,640
for example uh people such as john

973
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,160
warrell are

974
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,320
are defending structuralism on the basis

975
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,560
of history of sciences with very clear

976
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,480
examples for example from

977
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,640
the history of optics to show that there

978
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,119
is some sort of continuity between

979
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,599
theories of optics although it seems

980
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,280
that there are radical theoretical

981
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,520
shifts in the history of science so

982
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,280
some of the terms some of the

983
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,359
theoretical entities that were supposed

984
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,200
to be the subject of anthological

985
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,960
commitments before

986
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,839
are eliminated from or ontology today

987
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,280
but it seems that there is some sort of

988
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,280
continuity at the level of the structure

989
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,599
of the theories at the level of form

990
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,599
so they are not making come and in this

991
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,119
sense they are indeed taking

992
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,160
ontological pressure from uh their

993
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,440
theory however there are

994
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,040
other forms of for example

995
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,200
anti-construction realism

996
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,720
uh which itself comes in in various

997
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,000
strides for example

998
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,640
james layman is defending some sort of

999
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,079
uh eliminativist

1000
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,599
uh approach the structural realism i

1001
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,680
think that for good reasons from the

1002
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,200
his from recent many particle physics

1003
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,480
uh but uh i'm

1004
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,040
slightly skeptical that so that sort of

1005
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,960
structuralism is taking any sort of

1006
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,520
in terms of ontological commitments i'm

1007
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,880
skeptical that it is

1008
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,079
less uh cumbersome that the

1009
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,440
orthodox forms of uh scientific realism

1010
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,880
i'm sure that

1011
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,599
there is a perfect match between elite

1012
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,560
eliminating

1013
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,759
structural realism and

1014
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,000
what we know about what modern physics

1015
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,839
many particle physics is representing

1016
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,359
about the features of the world

1017
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,359
but with regard to metaphysics for

1018
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,240
example antics structuralism claims that

1019
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,400
all that there is is a structure

1020
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,200
which is a strong metaphysical claim so

1021
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,680
it

1022
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,960
eliminates entities objects from the

1023
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,079
ontology which is quiet ambitious and a

1024
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,000
strong ontological commitment so

1025
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,920
and the thing is that i do not think

1026
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,359
that the version of

1027
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,280
structural realism that freestone and

1028
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,599
colleagues have defended is epistemic

1029
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,119
because they are defending some sort of

1030
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,280
metaphysical thesis here monism is some

1031
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,359
sort of metaphysical thesis so

1032
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,680
although structural realism was supposed

1033
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,520
to be

1034
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,960
ontologically modest in the sense that

1035
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,200
at least for example world's version

1036
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,880
doesn't make commitment

1037
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,000
to the nature of

1038
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,240
the world itself the metaphysical

1039
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,400
versions of a structural realism such as

1040
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,119
james lady

1041
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,560
are including are harboring strong

1042
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,839
metaphysical tests

1043
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,680
about the features of reality that they

1044
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,880
are claiming to be completely structural

1045
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,839
and i think that in this sense markovian

1046
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,000
monism that is defended by frieza

1047
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,319
and others is not metaphysically modest

1048
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,200
at all

1049
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,400
and i think that this is one reason so

1050
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,319
i didn't and thank you very much for

1051
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,319
bringing this point to my attention i

1052
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,440
didn't expel

1053
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,920
this point clearly in the paper because

1054
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,200
i didn't

1055
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,560
explain many times to discuss the

1056
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,880
structuralism this is specific paper

1057
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,040
but i think that not as i look at it

1058
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,560
from uh

1059
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,440
here i can see that it could be the main

1060
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,000
motive

1061
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,280
behind my mind that encouraged me to

1062
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,240
be a bit critical about this form of uh

1063
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,400
monism that is

1064
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,960
uh presented in this paper wonderful

1065
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,160
paper by fristen and colleagues

1066
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,280
cool cool response here's another

1067
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,960
question from the chat kind of keeping

1068
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,880
with this theme of physics and

1069
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,359
realism and scientific communities that

1070
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,960
are evolving their models

1071
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,880
you mentioned optics so let's think

1072
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,800
about particle physics

1073
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,160
cambridge breaths wrote can the author

1074
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,119
describe

1075
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,040
in his personal belief the main

1076
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
difference between a mathematical

1077
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,839
markov blanketness of an electron when

1078
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,520
it's behaving as a particle

1079
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,359
versus when it's behaving as a wave

1080
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,200
so how do we think about quantum

1081
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,640
mechanics and

1082
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,000
quantum phenomena when we're talking

1083
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,280
about these different

1084
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,720
realism ideas

1085
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,920
well to be quite honest uh i have no

1086
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,960
idea

1087
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,640
do you think that it is mainly because

1088
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,640
of my ignorance of uh

1089
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,040
modern physics so i have some general

1090
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,280
conception of what happens

1091
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,079
at the level of many particle physics

1092
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:48,480
but

1093
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,960
how to state that in terms of marco and

1094
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,520
i can

1095
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,079
imagine how could we state that in terms

1096
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,079
of markovian blankets

1097
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,400
but i cannot see how the distinction

1098
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,800
between a particle being in a vagus

1099
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,000
state or being

1100
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,839
an entity being in a very state or

1101
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,280
participant

1102
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,200
uh could be related to this issue of

1103
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,520
markovian models i assume that markovian

1104
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,240
models

1105
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,880
so one thing as i know about markovian

1106
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,400
models is that they are

1107
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,119
so powerful they are such powerful

1108
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,280
modeling tools that they could be used

1109
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,000
almost to model everything that there is

1110
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,400
uh

1111
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,240
to be modeled uh but

1112
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,920
well and i uh suspect and it is only

1113
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,480
some sort of uh wild guess that we could

1114
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,920
model the behavior of an

1115
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,040
entity either in in its their state or

1116
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,680
in

1117
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,480
as far as we try to provide some sort of

1118
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,800
probabilistic representation

1119
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,839
of the behavior of the entity to model

1120
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,599
the conditional independence between

1121
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,520
different states of identity

1122
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,920
we could involve markovian blankets

1123
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,359
marco blankets to do so but

1124
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,240
i think that at the same time i miss the

1125
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,520
main part of the

1126
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,560
uh the core of the question

1127
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,839
i think um just maybe guessing from

1128
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,960
the context the electron is something

1129
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,480
that we might say

1130
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,480
we might want to say it ontologically

1131
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,599
exists or some

1132
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,920
might think it ontologically exists yet

1133
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,280
it can display

1134
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,680
this sort of bimodal behavior when it

1135
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,920
can depending on the double slit and the

1136
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,200
context of the observer

1137
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,480
it can be acting yeah great so

1138
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,040
all right so how does a markovian

1139
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,160
blanket does

1140
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,680
that so uh uh as i say this

1141
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,720
this kind of approach to the behavior

1142
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,000
of entities in many particle physics was

1143
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,800
what

1144
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,200
motivated people such as steven french

1145
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,280
and james ladyman to develop forms of

1146
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,200
structural realism so it is not only

1147
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,359
an issue of an electron the thing is

1148
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,960
that when we look at this

1149
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,359
uh the behavior of entities at the level

1150
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,280
of at the fundamental level

1151
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,359
if i don't want to use a fundamental at

1152
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,520
the level of many particle physics

1153
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,200
they should do all behavior there is

1154
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,680
some sort of package that includes

1155
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,040
individual objects

1156
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,040
and it is the interpretation for example

1157
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,160
of the

1158
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,040
electron that allows us to identify that

1159
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,880
as some sort of individual objects and

1160
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,400
there is a package that

1161
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,960
doesn't allow us to model it as an

1162
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,400
individual object so

1163
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,560
there are both so we have to conceive of

1164
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,599
that as

1165
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,079
both individual individual objects and

1166
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,240
non-individual objects and

1167
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,160
this seems to wreak havoc with your

1168
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,000
ontology of modern physics and

1169
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,079
structural realism provides an answer to

1170
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,200
that saying that

1171
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,000
all right let's consider the common

1172
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,200
reality let's

1173
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,440
consider the common structures that

1174
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,560
underpin

1175
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,560
both formulation and the behavior of

1176
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,480
electrons for example are stated in

1177
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,280
terms of

1178
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,240
several sort of statistics that are

1179
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,040
developed

1180
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,440
from maxwell's war for example both

1181
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,440
einstein statistics

1182
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,480
and other sort of statistics so i assume

1183
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,079
that we could also

1184
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,400
invoke some sort of a mark of blankets

1185
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,000
to behavior

1186
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,359
to to model the behavior of this kind of

1187
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,760
entities at the level of subparticle

1188
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,720
physics

1189
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,960
but uh does the question mean to

1190
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,000
indicate that there

1191
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,319
would be some sort of ontological gain

1192
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:21,440
to do so

1193
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,359
uh the thing is that even in philosophy

1194
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:24,640
of physics the

1195
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,720
the discussion of a structural realism

1196
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,760
whether we could

1197
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,400
invoke some sort of representational

1198
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,079
mathematical tools

1199
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,359
or we have to just rely on the

1200
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,000
geometrical or physical statement of the

1201
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,880
situation

1202
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,200
so um i think that these are

1203
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,240
sophisticated

1204
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,640
issues in the uh philosophy of physics

1205
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,359
and

1206
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,560
and i'm hardly an expert in that field

1207
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,440
but

1208
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,720
uh i'm not very clear but uh

1209
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,880
obvious advantage with a state of

1210
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,040
regimentation of a state of subparticles

1211
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,000
in terms of markov

1212
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,119
blankets would do to the extent that

1213
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,400
metaphysically called

1214
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,880
stencils or attributes are a christian

1215
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,119
or attitude

1216
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,240
cool so here are a few um general

1217
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,880
questions what does it mean to be

1218
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,000
ontologically

1219
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,960
neutral so that was brought up and i was

1220
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,920
just wondering

1221
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,319
what what is the alternative or how

1222
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,160
could it be charged or not neutral what

1223
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:24,400
is

1224
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,800
that there are several ways of reminding

1225
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,000
ontologically neutral so for example uh

1226
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,359
a way that i prefer

1227
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,400
is to as i say process ontological

1228
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,599
agnosticism to

1229
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,280
not make any commitments about the

1230
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,800
nature of reality itself

1231
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,880
but i do not think that it is this sort

1232
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,200
of ontological neutrality that is at

1233
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,920
issue in freestone and colleagues paper

1234
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,200
i think that they want to be

1235
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,359
ontologically neutral in the sense that

1236
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,520
so this is this traditional

1237
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,760
uh division in the philosophy of mind

1238
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,760
between physicalism

1239
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,400
between dualism for example physicalism

1240
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,599
people who think that

1241
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,680
the nature of mind is physical and

1242
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,280
people who think that

1243
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,560
uh mind or at least mental processes are

1244
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,520
different from

1245
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,920
physical properties so i think that

1246
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,240
markovian monism wants to be

1247
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,560
ontologically neutral in the sense that

1248
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,440
it doesn't

1249
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,160
want to make commitment to either

1250
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,079
mentalism or physicalism

1251
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,680
it doesn't want to identify

1252
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,119
consciousness

1253
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,760
uh either in physical terms or mental

1254
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,839
terms and in this sense it

1255
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,559
strives to remind ontologically neutral

1256
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,240
which i think it is quite cool

1257
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,359
so as i say i'm a great admirer of this

1258
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:40,960
project because i think that it is the

1259
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,559
first significant attempt

1260
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,240
that tries to develop free energy

1261
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,319
principle into

1262
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,520
a remarkable metaphysical testis and i

1263
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,559
think that if

1264
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,800
free energy principle theories could

1265
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,400
really show that the theory

1266
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,319
could support or could be construed

1267
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:57,760
along the lines of

1268
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,720
neutral harmonism to show that it really

1269
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,200
supports a stance that doesn't commit us

1270
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,880
either to conceiving

1271
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,119
of the nature of mind as a mental state

1272
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:09,920
or

1273
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,240
as a mentalist or mental properties or

1274
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,319
as physical

1275
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:17,520
it will be a real achievement i think uh

1276
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,160
but at the same time i think that just

1277
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,280
depending on the mathematical uh

1278
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,559
framework of markovian models doesn't

1279
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:27,920
provide

1280
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,079
sufficient purchase for doing that it

1281
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:30,960
doesn't provide

1282
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,319
a sufficient basis for boosting a

1283
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,839
well-supported form of monism

1284
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,720
very cool so it sounds like there's the

1285
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,359
eternal debate of whether mind leads to

1286
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,200
matter or matter leads to mind is there

1287
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,079
one type of thing

1288
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,240
two kinds of things and it would be

1289
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,440
awesome for

1290
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,760
free energy principle to step into that

1291
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,559
gap

1292
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,200
but what we've seen so far with the

1293
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,240
interpretation

1294
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,920
of the mathematical construct of the

1295
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,400
markov blanket does not adequately

1296
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,359
resolve this metaphysical question so

1297
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:04,319
what kind of

1298
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,839
analyses or research or measurement

1299
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,359
or calculation i mean i'm a scientist so

1300
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,720
i'm thinking about measurement and

1301
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,520
experiments but as a philosopher what

1302
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,839
would um reduce our uncertainty about

1303
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:21,040
where the fep fits into all of this

1304
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,559
so uh far far it be from a philosopher

1305
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,280
to try to prescribe or endorse anything

1306
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:27,839
to

1307
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,160
the scientists the thing is that i feel

1308
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,440
that so

1309
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,720
so a cool thing about cognitive sciences

1310
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,280
and

1311
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,520
neurosciences is that i think that uh

1312
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,559
philosophy car

1313
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,720
ideas could really be useful to

1314
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,880
scientists in this field but

1315
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,760
uh the nature of this collaboration the

1316
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,520
nature of what happens here is so

1317
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,200
sophisticated that

1318
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,720
one can hardly so so i'm told that

1319
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,680
prediction is

1320
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,240
pretty hard especially about the future

1321
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:56,800
so

1322
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,680
i i couldn't have any idea or any

1323
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,880
prescription

1324
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,160
what can we do to bring to to

1325
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,119
make this approach more fruitful the

1326
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,280
only thing that we could i think

1327
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,599
we could do is precisely the thing that

1328
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:12,640
we are doing

1329
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,480
just trying our best and uh

1330
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,240
collaborating so

1331
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,079
and i think that this is why this active

1332
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,319
inference lab is a cool idea because

1333
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,160
it allows people from different

1334
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,440
background come

1335
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,839
and share their ideas and we will see

1336
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:26,800
whether anything

1337
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,440
uh significant will emerge from all of

1338
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,400
that or not but

1339
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,760
i think that this is the only thing that

1340
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,920
we could do oh it has been the only

1341
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,760
thing that we have been doing for quite

1342
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,440
a while and paid well those are

1343
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,119
cool very it's almost like there's the

1344
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,359
mind matter dualism and then there's the

1345
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:45,200
science and the humanities or science

1346
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,880
and philosophy and so

1347
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,359
is one going to envelop the other is

1348
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:50,480
there really only one

1349
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,640
and the other one is kind of a sub field

1350
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,760
and instead of

1351
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,880
playing into that dichotomized debate

1352
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,280
which is polarized it's almost like

1353
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,440
we're taking an ontologically neutral

1354
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,839
stance here and highlighting the

1355
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:04,960
importance of

1356
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,720
coming together across different

1357
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,480
contexts and having that

1358
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,520
conversation so my question on that

1359
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,760
would be let's just say that there was

1360
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,359
somebody who were curious

1361
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,400
and wanted to jump in to learn more

1362
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,359
what kind of research or skills or

1363
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:22,319
mentorship

1364
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:25,280
might help this person on their journey

1365
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,240
whether they're

1366
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,480
you know from a philosophical side or

1367
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,839
from a scientific side

1368
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,400
what do you think would be some key tips

1369
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,000
for somebody who's just starting on

1370
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,720
their

1371
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,400
fep journey uh

1372
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,400
well um the best thing that i've heard

1373
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,079
about the relationship between these

1374
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,680
different disciplines comes from

1375
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,760
a stephen french who is a structural

1376
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,000
realist and also a wise philosopher of

1377
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,280
science saying that

1378
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,680
metal physics is best when informed with

1379
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,240
science and science is best then

1380
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,720
uh i don't want to say that informed by

1381
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,079
metaphysics but that is

1382
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,480
taking some metaphysical insight into

1383
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,079
consideration so

1384
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,319
but on the other hand i think that the

1385
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:07,200
nature of

1386
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,480
uh scientific and academic work these

1387
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,040
days

1388
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,240
is so so in other words the scientific

1389
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,839
activity is so

1390
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:18,960
compartmentalized these days people are

1391
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,599
doing

1392
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,200
their different works in different

1393
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,040
disciplines in their own labs

1394
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,319
and uh the nature of the problem is so

1395
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:27,040
hard that

1396
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,079
they have to spend all of their time on

1397
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,280
specific problems so uh

1398
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,440
i can hardly also provide any advice of

1399
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,760
what kind of mentorship suits anyone who

1400
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,480
wants to

1401
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,440
work hard up do some excellent job in

1402
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,319
frener's principle what i can say that

1403
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,160
what's very interesting about free

1404
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,319
energy principle is that it

1405
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:55,520
seems to provide at least some uh

1406
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,800
purchase for for a discourse some space

1407
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,559
for a discourse between scientists and

1408
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:01,920
philosophers so

1409
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,520
it seems that some of us some of the uh

1410
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,280
good scientists such as for example

1411
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,200
maxwell ramstad or

1412
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,319
uh alex constant or fristen himself who

1413
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,480
are scientists are are

1414
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,559
completely interested in philosophical

1415
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,480
discussions of what's happening here

1416
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,240
and it seems that what's even more

1417
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,000
wonderful it seems that

1418
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,240
uh philosophical discussions are

1419
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,079
affecting the nature of their work in

1420
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:27,680
some sense i think that it is something

1421
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,680
that you can hardly observe for example

1422
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,319
in

1423
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:33,920
uh age wr theories of physics these days

1424
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,680
uh i don't know whether the great

1425
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,359
physicists are studying philosophy for

1426
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,040
their amusement or not but

1427
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,480
i doubt that they are in this sort of

1428
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,240
constructive uh relationship with uh

1429
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,079
philosophers so

1430
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,200
uh i think that this kind of

1431
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,440
and the nature of free energy principle

1432
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,079
itself is quite unificatory

1433
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,559
brings different disciplines because uh

1434
00:53:58,559 --> 00:53:59,200
different

1435
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,040
ideas from different disciplines

1436
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,319
together so

1437
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:05,040
i have no clear idea about the

1438
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,000
mentorship

1439
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,880
or any kind of schedule or program but i

1440
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,720
can say that people who are

1441
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,480
interested in free energy principle and

1442
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,480
studying that

1443
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,200
have already chanced to get a wider

1444
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:17,760
scope

1445
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,319
with wide intellectual scope with

1446
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,400
insights from a number of different

1447
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,400
disciplines biology computational

1448
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,200
neuroscience

1449
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,440
uh cognitive psychology philosophy of

1450
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,240
mind

1451
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,240
uh philosophy of biology and that sort

1452
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,079
of thing so it seems to come with the

1453
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,400
discipline as it is

1454
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,530
i

1455
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:41,520
[Music]

1456
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,079
and i liked how you grounded the paper

1457
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:45,200
and the presentation

1458
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,119
in the history and the philosophy of

1459
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,799
science because

1460
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,440
it is a community that enacts the

1461
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,319
conversation

1462
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,040
around the ideas and then when there is

1463
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,480
not a healthy dialogue

1464
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,799
it's kind of like the philosophers are

1465
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,040
uh sweeping up after the scientists or

1466
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,720
vice versa or they're just sort of

1467
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,480
spectators to each other

1468
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,599
but then we're almost moving towards a

1469
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,200
a fruitful bi-directional conversation

1470
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,640
that actually as you're pointing out

1471
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,960
with the specific people who are

1472
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,760
taking this into their research approach

1473
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,040
it actually is something

1474
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,640
where the science and the philosophy are

1475
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,520
co-influencing each other

1476
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,599
so that's very interesting and special

1477
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,119
it's almost like it's such a big

1478
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,160
scientific idea and so challenging that

1479
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,400
we know that we need multiple expertises

1480
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,520
we know that we're gonna need to be

1481
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,359
working on it together for a long time

1482
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:35,839
and

1483
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,040
then that helps set the stage

1484
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,960
for something that might surprise people

1485
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,200
because it's not just coming from their

1486
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,960
camp so we have history and philosophy

1487
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,200
science and then i guess another thread

1488
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,480
is math

1489
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,920
mathematics markov blankets as you

1490
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,040
pointed out came from

1491
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,440
pearl in the 1988 work and has been

1492
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,559
developed

1493
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,920
a lot subsequently where does set or

1494
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,680
category theory

1495
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,440
come into this uh

1496
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,960
well well

1497
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,319
uh very good question

1498
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,280
i think that in some sense it depends on

1499
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,079
your view

1500
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,040
of your your perspective on mathematics

1501
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:21,760
so

1502
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,480
if you are set or taking uh foundations

1503
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,440
in mathematics

1504
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,839
if you are a mathematician who uh

1505
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:32,079
prays to the god of set theory every

1506
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,240
night in his loneliness you naturally

1507
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,000
think that every kind of mathematical

1508
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,880
theory

1509
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,440
is coming is based on sectarian security

1510
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,040
has a general foundation or

1511
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,200
there are other people who are ready to

1512
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,079
give this

1513
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,280
rule to the category theory but

1514
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,640
uh for me because my uh engagement with

1515
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,200
these ideas come from a background of

1516
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,399
structural realism

1517
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,240
the main thing is that uh

1518
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,520
and uh it has been going to

1519
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,200
the wonderful works of uh

1520
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,160
soups uh patrick soups and van frozen

1521
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:10,400
and

1522
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,079
philosophers of science came to so so

1523
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,880
rational reconstruction have been a

1524
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,799
program from the very beginning of the

1525
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,799
history of philosophy of science

1526
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:24,000
so philosophers and again it is why free

1527
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,040
energy principle

1528
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,040
is so interesting for me because because

1529
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,240
of its great unifi

1530
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,359
unificatory scope and there have been

1531
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:32,960
philosophers of science and there are

1532
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,559
still philosophers of science who think

1533
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,079
that the main job of philosophy of

1534
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,640
science is to

1535
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,880
form some ideas about unification of

1536
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,119
sciences and in order to bring about

1537
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,799
this unification

1538
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:49,119
uh philosophers thought of using

1539
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,079
logical formal frameworks for state

1540
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:53,920
regimenting different theories from

1541
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,520
different disciplines so

1542
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,599
for example in physics people are using

1543
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,520
a special form of mathematics

1544
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,280
in biology when they are using

1545
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,960
mathematics at all they may use a

1546
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,240
statistical

1547
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,240
uh theories or different forms of

1548
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,359
mathematics

1549
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,240
and they came to this idea if that if we

1550
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,720
use some form of logic some form of for

1551
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,040
example set theory model theory

1552
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,839
we could have a cool mathematical

1553
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:20,160
framework that allows us to regiment

1554
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,359
different theories from different

1555
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:22,000
disciplines

1556
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,640
and clarify their relationship together

1557
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,200
and have a

1558
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,640
realistic clear

1559
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,040
neatly stated view of what's happening

1560
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,520
in the world assuming that science

1561
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,760
provides a reliable picture of the world

1562
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,640
if we

1563
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,079
could use model theory or set theory

1564
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,599
and the thing is that uh and i stated

1565
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:48,160
this view

1566
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,000
in a book that has been published by

1567
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,440
spring you're according to a structural

1568
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,319
realism

1569
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:55,359
i begin to have doubts about the

1570
00:58:55,359 --> 00:59:00,160
usefulness or at least the realistic

1571
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,480
impact of using set theory and model

1572
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,240
theory to represent the features of the

1573
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,200
world so

1574
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,200
i become a skeptical in the sense that i

1575
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,559
thought that this

1576
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,359
uh set theory and model theory uh

1577
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:14,000
frameworks are too abstract and even if

1578
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,040
we could regiment

1579
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,040
the structure of sciences into these

1580
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,079
frameworks

1581
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,079
we still couldn't account for scientific

1582
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,880
representation because these are

1583
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,960
the set theory and category theory do

1584
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,640
not represent the word these are

1585
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,559
scientists who are representing the word

1586
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,559
using mathematical models

1587
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:33,839
so i try to

1588
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,440
depart from the usual ways of scientific

1589
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,440
representation on the basis of sectarian

1590
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,720
model theory

1591
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,599
and invoke other sorts of mathematical

1592
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,119
frameworks that could

1593
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,480
uh provide a better match a more

1594
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,480
congenial tool for accounting for

1595
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,319
scientific representation it was very

1596
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:53,520
beginning to

1597
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,839
uh try to introduce some sort of

1598
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,920
information theory framework and not

1599
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,079
only information to article anymore but

1600
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:04,240
embodied information sort of framework

1601
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,319
meaning precisely the same sort of

1602
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:07,680
framework that

1603
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,440
fristen and colleagues are using in

1604
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,799
terms of

1605
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,920
approximate uh bayesianism to regiment

1606
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,520
the structure of scientific theories

1607
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,160
because

1608
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,319
i came to the idea that it allows us to

1609
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,559
have a more realistic account if we be

1610
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,319
able to regiment the structure of

1611
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,240
theories into this

1612
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,079
approximate bayesian framework for

1613
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,000
example instead of say theory and modal

1614
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,359
theory we could provide a better

1615
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,880
understanding of the relationship

1616
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,319
between

1617
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:35,040
scientific theories which are actually

1618
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,040
embedded in the brain of scientists or

1619
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,799
at least in the scientific community and

1620
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,960
their target system in the world

1621
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,000
because uh

1622
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,559
uh their set theory and model theory are

1623
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,319
too abstract to take care

1624
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:51,280
of the job uh this kind of approximate

1625
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,040
bayesianism is something that at least

1626
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,400
according to our best scientific

1627
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,319
theories is by default embodied in the

1628
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,920
brain of organism

1629
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,200
and in this sense we could uh have

1630
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,440
scientific representation super window

1631
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,359
the relationship between the organism

1632
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:07,760
and its environment but it is another

1633
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,799
story it is not directly related to this

1634
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:11,680
markovianism thing that i

1635
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,720
developed here well it is

1636
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,880
it's super interesting because this

1637
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:17,839
embodied

1638
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:21,200
and enacted relational approach

1639
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,799
we can't leave the scientist out of the

1640
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,640
picture so it's almost like we

1641
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,920
we remove too much when we abstract

1642
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,880
that relationship away and then it

1643
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:31,599
almost

1644
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,839
hints towards that electron question

1645
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:34,799
from earlier

1646
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,119
which is well if your ontology or your

1647
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,000
model is just

1648
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,160
an electron not even the context you're

1649
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,119
going to be lost

1650
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:42,960
because you won't understand why certain

1651
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,160
things are happening

1652
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,640
to your system of interest and so how do

1653
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,000
we pull back

1654
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,359
rigorously and include enough

1655
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:54,400
context setting so that there is

1656
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,440
an ontology or a local logic that's

1657
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,079
making sense so it's just cool like how

1658
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:02,079
the historical thread the philosophical

1659
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:02,720
thread

1660
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,680
it's not um spice or salt on the

1661
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,799
research

1662
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:09,039
like just adding it up it's actually

1663
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:10,319
something that

1664
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:13,839
is is um intertwined and

1665
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:16,799
and sets the total scope of the

1666
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:17,680
scientific

1667
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,680
journey so it's like very cool to hear

1668
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,760
about that so if there's any other

1669
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,520
questions in live chat we'll ask but

1670
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:28,160
yeah only with regard to a quick

1671
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,839
follow-up about the last point that you

1672
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:30,799
mentioned so

1673
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:33,680
part of that might be the contemporary

1674
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,280
philosophy of science at least the

1675
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,720
dominant approach which is

1676
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,119
structural realism is that precisely as

1677
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:40,880
you mentioned it leaves those

1678
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,880
human beings out of the picture when it

1679
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,200
comes to scientific representation so

1680
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,280
uh there were a bunch of brilliant

1681
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,200
philosophers of science such as

1682
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,559
ronald geary and for example

1683
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,119
nancy narcissian who is fortunately

1684
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:56,079
still active

1685
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:57,760
who try to provide some sort of

1686
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,599
cognitive model

1687
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:02,240
of scientific practice itself of

1688
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,000
scientific activity but

1689
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,319
for some reasons i i'm not sure about

1690
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:07,839
the reason

1691
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:10,720
it has been pushed aside uh and it is

1692
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,480
not the dominant view of philosophy of

1693
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,000
science again so

1694
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
part of my activity in the philosophy of

1695
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,280
science was to bring this

1696
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,319
sort of cognitive approach back to the

1697
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,480
foreground and i think that i was

1698
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,799
fortunate that i bumped up to this

1699
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:26,559
free energy principle and predictive

1700
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:27,920
processing because

1701
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,319
in order to account for cognitive models

1702
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:31,200
of science so

1703
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,480
we uh sometimes we do not just want to

1704
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,160
sit in your armchair and do philosophy

1705
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,079
of science but want to support our

1706
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:39,680
philosophy of science

1707
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,400
by some actual scientific theories and

1708
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,079
in order to develop these

1709
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:46,799
cognitive models of science cognitive

1710
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:48,960
approach to philosophy of science

1711
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,799
it seems that free energy principle and

1712
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,319
predictive coding

1713
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,720
are fascinating tools because they allow

1714
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,200
us to provide a very good

1715
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,119
well supported picture of the

1716
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:00,319
relationship between

1717
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,480
scientists who are basically organism

1718
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,319
and the community of scientists

1719
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:08,160
uh which could be uh specified in terms

1720
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:08,960
of

1721
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,839
i don't know free energy principle

1722
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:13,680
common theories of communication under

1723
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,039
free energy principle

1724
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:16,559
the relationship between community and

1725
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,880
scientists on the one hand and

1726
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,960
their environment the world on the other

1727
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,640
and i think that this picture is much

1728
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,280
more realistic than the ordinary

1729
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,599
but the orthodox picture of scientific

1730
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:28,480
representation

1731
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,160
that is fashionable yep cool it's like a

1732
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:32,720
yes

1733
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,880
and with action and inference so

1734
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,039
philosophy isn't just the armchair

1735
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,119
what does it look like to be embodied

1736
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:40,400
and inactive

1737
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,640
and then perhaps it looks like what is

1738
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,039
known by the career name of science

1739
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:46,640
but we know that learning and research

1740
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,720
happens inside of academia outside of

1741
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:49,839
academia

1742
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:52,160
so it is a more realistic picture and

1743
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,319
here's a related question from the chat

1744
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:58,240
stephen asks this ability to dissolve

1745
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,720
the internalist and externalist duelist

1746
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:01,520
position

1747
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,400
is a powerful part of markovian monism

1748
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,359
thus giving an

1749
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:08,400
open dynamical system uh uh

1750
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,760
the adaptive open boundaries any

1751
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,039
thoughts on this yeah i completely agree

1752
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:15,359
so

1753
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,200
in the beginning i told that i'm a great

1754
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,520
admirer of markovian monism i think that

1755
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,680
it is a bigger step forward and this is

1756
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,079
precisely because of this reason

1757
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:26,160
because it goes beyond this kind of

1758
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,359
orthodox dualism between

1759
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,920
intel so here it is described as some

1760
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,079
sort of dualism between internal spaces

1761
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:36,000
and external spaces

1762
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,119
and um frison and colleagues put a lot

1763
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:40,960
of force and energy into developing this

1764
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,119
kind of informational geometries that

1765
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:44,079
again i think

1766
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,520
is a wonderful uh formal framework to

1767
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,520
model this idea so

1768
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,799
this is precisely uh in my opinion for

1769
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:53,599
what it is

1770
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,520
this is precisely the valuable part of

1771
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,440
markovian modernism that it

1772
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,000
tries to use this kind of scientific

1773
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,559
model

1774
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,359
that goes beyond this dualism between

1775
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,240
internal spaces and external spaces to

1776
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,280
develop some source of uh

1777
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,720
uh some sort of hormones and

1778
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,559
metaphysical tests so

1779
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:14,079
i completely agree that this is a

1780
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,599
brilliant idea so

1781
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:17,359
the question is what source of

1782
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:19,359
philosophy called argumentation or

1783
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:22,640
scientific argumentation

1784
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,839
could be offered to support this picture

1785
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:28,319
so i think that's as it is the status

1786
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:29,440
quo of this

1787
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,640
theory is not strong enough to carry the

1788
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,359
metaphysical weight the question is

1789
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:39,200
and as i said earlier the paper uh

1790
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,000
aims to comes with the hope to provoke

1791
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,839
the free energy principle theories to

1792
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,240
develop this idea to develop markovian

1793
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,960
modernism so what sort of philosophical

1794
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:49,920
or scientific

1795
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,960
argumentation could be offered to uh

1796
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,680
support this insight that has been

1797
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,200
mentioned by

1798
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,960
stephen and lies at the core of

1799
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,079
markovian mode this is the main question

1800
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,039
awesome so just in the last um few

1801
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:06,480
minutes here

1802
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,640
this paper came out you know one week

1803
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,039
ago you probably wrote it several

1804
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,920
months before but what are your next

1805
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,359
research questions or what

1806
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:18,079
are some exciting ongoing threads like

1807
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:18,880
where do you go

1808
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,280
let's say someone read this paper where

1809
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,400
are you taking

1810
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,760
this frontier of thought uh

1811
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,760
all right again uh oh cool idea so

1812
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,880
uh so as we have already gathered

1813
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,119
uh my mind is very disorderly and it is

1814
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,280
because i'm cursing several lines of

1815
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,039
research together so

1816
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:42,079
uh part of my research right now is to

1817
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:44,000
develop this kind of model-based

1818
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,720
understanding of markovian monism

1819
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,599
to defense of modularity tests it's not

1820
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:50,559
precisely the

1821
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:52,960
source of fedorian modularity but at

1822
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,799
least the source of modularity that are

1823
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:57,280
defended by for example the alcohol and

1824
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,160
i think that

1825
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,000
the model-based approach provide at

1826
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,119
least some some

1827
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,359
grounds for defending this source of

1828
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:07,119
modularity this is

1829
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:09,359
on the other hand i'm trying so uh the

1830
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:11,200
other thing is that i feel that

1831
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,319
uh there is ample room for good

1832
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:16,479
metaphysical work on this free energy

1833
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:18,479
principle and free energy principle

1834
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:21,600
theory of consciousness so uh as you may

1835
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,080
know there are already

1836
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,560
so markovian monism for example offer

1837
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,719
some sort of metaphysical realist

1838
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:31,759
reading of uh

1839
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:33,920
theory of consciousness but there are

1840
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,920
also illusionists

1841
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,880
constitutes illusionist interpretations

1842
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:39,600
of

1843
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,520
a theory of consciousness under free

1844
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,960
energy principle

1845
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,679
and i think that for some reasons none

1846
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:46,960
of this provides

1847
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,839
a quiet good metaphysical interpretation

1848
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:50,479
of

1849
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:51,920
theory of consciousness under free

1850
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,319
energy principle so i'm developing

1851
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,880
another theory i'm trying to

1852
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,799
develop a theory of consciousness under

1853
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:00,640
free energy principle that could be

1854
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,319
construed along the line of

1855
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,960
uh strong intentionalism and it is

1856
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,479
associated with

1857
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:09,198
uh works of historical works of uh

1858
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:09,759
friends

1859
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,198
barantano and tinkering more recently so

1860
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:15,279
uh it is another line of research that i

1861
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:17,359
have in mind to associate

1862
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:18,960
this theory of consciousness with some

1863
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,359
sort of intentionalism

1864
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:26,640
uh and then again uh i'm engaged with uh

1865
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,439
as as the paper may indicate i'm looking

1866
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,040
for further groans for

1867
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,560
for the reasons to develop or at least

1868
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,719
support this markovian monism

1869
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,040
myself so as i say this paper is just

1870
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:39,920
the first

1871
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,759
the negative part of some sort of

1872
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,759
argument that has to be produced by

1873
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:46,839
others or myself so

1874
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:50,080
uh i also i'm trying to

1875
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,158
because i because i can't see the appeal

1876
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:54,400
of this markovian monism so i try to

1877
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,120
find

1878
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,960
reasonable groans for supporting this

1879
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,560
theory i'm not sure

1880
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,600
where does it go but yeah it is

1881
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,440
an awesome approach a lot of times a

1882
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,640
critique it's almost like

1883
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,480
consequentialism someone says i don't

1884
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,840
like your outcome

1885
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,679
so i'm going to look for all the details

1886
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:11,520
or say that it wasn't really supported

1887
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,560
conclusion

1888
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,560
and you're almost like saying actually i

1889
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,679
do

1890
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:19,280
see that goal or i see the benefits here

1891
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,080
and we just need to navigate in a

1892
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,040
slightly

1893
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,440
new way but we're going to be learning

1894
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,679
and connecting these ideas along the way

1895
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:29,520
because it isn't mapped how we're going

1896
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,199
to get to markovian monism and maybe

1897
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,560
that's not where we're going

1898
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,520
but we're working towards brilliant i

1899
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:35,920
just

1900
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,320
get excited and caught you because it is

1901
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,239
related to another part of my research

1902
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:40,800
which

1903
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,040
tries to relate free energy principle to

1904
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,320
theories of

1905
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,520
group group knowledge and uh to account

1906
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,800
for for example

1907
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,560
collective intentionality on the basis

1908
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,719
of free energy principles so

1909
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:55,840
uh freestone and fears have produced a

1910
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,480
very fascinating theories of

1911
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,480
communication and social relation under

1912
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,159
free energy principle

1913
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:05,280
and i think that i think that

1914
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,760
this theory could be applied to develop

1915
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,600
the part of the epistemological

1916
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,760
social epistemology and i think that

1917
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,040
there would be wonderful

1918
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,600
wonderful reasons so uh it is natural

1919
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,719
for me to

1920
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:19,199
see this kind of scientific back and

1921
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:20,800
forth between different

1922
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,600
uh intellectuals as some sort of uh

1923
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,880
collaboration that

1924
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,600
consequentially consequentialist as you

1925
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,199
phrase that masterfully

1926
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:31,440
that hopefully leads to the growth of

1927
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,199
knowledge in general

1928
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:36,320
yes the individual in the armchair it

1929
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,520
lends ones toward

1930
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,600
it lends ones almost to neuro

1931
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,239
reductionism and individualism

1932
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:44,719
but when the person is walking around

1933
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:46,400
and at a conference and they're

1934
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,760
they're sharing their experience and

1935
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,600
they're learning and being surprised by

1936
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,239
by friends and colleagues then there

1937
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:53,679
really is something that's more like

1938
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:55,440
distributed cognition so i'll really

1939
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,239
look forward

1940
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:59,600
to seeing that um majin thanks so much

1941
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,159
for this

1942
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:03,199
appearance this was a epic and special

1943
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:06,159
first guest stream for our lab and

1944
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:07,040
you're

1945
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,199
always welcome just let us know if you

1946
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,239
have any other

1947
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,840
topics that you want to come on a stream

1948
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,840
with you or colleagues or students or

1949
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,760
anything we're always there to

1950
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,159
host uh and hold the space for this kind

1951
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:19,040
of work so

1952
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,840
again thanks a lot for the research and

1953
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,520
i'm sure everyone really appreciated

1954
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,040
hearing it

1955
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,719
thank you very much for having me and

1956
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:28,480
also cool work to

1957
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,840
to do this uh active inference lab so uh

1958
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,560
good luck with that ah and very well

1959
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,239
done and thank you very much for

1960
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:39,199
having me great we'll be in touch so see
