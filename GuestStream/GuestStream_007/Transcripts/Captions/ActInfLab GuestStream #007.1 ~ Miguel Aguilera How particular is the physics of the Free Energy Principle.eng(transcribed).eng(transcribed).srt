00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,360
hello and welcome

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,639
everyone to the actin flab guest stream

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,400
number 7.1.07.1 actually very nice

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,279
number

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,400
it's may 28 2021

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,960
and we have some very special guests on

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,519
today

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,160
who i will let themselves uh introduce

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,640
themselves

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,840
and then we'll go into a presentation

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,520
followed by a discussion so any and all

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,520
questions and comments just put into the

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,840
live chat during the presentation and

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,520
i'll be compiling those so that we can

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,800
make sure to ask them

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,480
so please miguel go for it

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,760
okay hi yeah i'm Miguel Aguilera i'm

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,399
working as a postdoc since a year now at

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,199
the university

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,920
university of sussex and

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,440
then so my name is Christopher Buckley

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,000
i'm a

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,680
lecturer at the university of sussex in

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,080
both the sussex neuroscience and sussex

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,280
ai groups

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
uh interested in sensory motor control

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,439
in general

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,960
cool so miguel um share your screen i'll

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,080
resize it

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,000
and then we'll have a presentation take

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,520
as long as you'd like

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,799
okay okay thanks a lot for the yeah for

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,640
the invitation i'm really happy to

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,720
present our work here and it's been

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,000
really kind of fast because

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,200
we just released the prayer print a few

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,439
days ago but it's and it's good for the

39
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,720
opportunity to

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,840
do this discussion online so far uh

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
okay let's see okay can you see my

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,880
screen

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,200
yep so and i'll resize it now so go for

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,560
it

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,840
okay okay so okay so this is this work

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,720
uh

47
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,479
so this is a problem that we have just

48
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,640
published as miguel aguilera and

49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,079
and i we wrote it i wrote it with uh

50
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,799
alexander

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,360
alexander sons and christopher buckley

52
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,000
uh

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,200
from all from sussex but what's except

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,719
for brenda's now in oslo um

55
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,840
so the um so that they work just to

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,719
focus

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,800
on some of the recent publications about

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,479
the free energy principle

59
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,920
i guess most people watching know that

60
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,840
the pre-inner principle is

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,920
was conceived originally as a unified

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,200
brain theory

63
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,160
integrating experimental data and trying

64
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,680
to listen

65
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,599
to describe the relationship between

66
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,800
action perception

67
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,400
learning and so on and more recently the

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,760
theory has evolved and

69
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,640
and tried to become more general stating

70
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,440
that

71
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,760
any non-equilibrium dynamical system

72
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,840
under some special conditions can be

73
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,160
interpreted as performing by using

74
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,280
inference and this

75
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,879
will be a broader

76
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,519
theory of living system or a way to

77
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,800
describe

78
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,000
how certain living systems behave using

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,040
the tools from magician inference and

80
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,840
and okay so so this is kind of so in

81
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,200
principle this this kind of

82
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,560
schema of how a brain is predicting an

83
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,920
environment could be using different

84
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,000
systems like a cell or different

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,280
human beings and what i i imagine anyone

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,959
familiar with with the primary principle

87
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,720
have seen this kind of

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,760
pictures a lot and we're trying to

89
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,239
to to do different ones and yeah so i

90
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:22,959
think it's a

91
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,080
maybe a good thing to to to try to

92
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,760
visualize things in a new ways because

93
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,120
these ones have been repeated

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,440
done so many times um okay so so the

95
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,799
idea is so we are

96
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,159
interested in in exploring this the

97
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,400
the different assumptions behind the

98
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
principle because

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,159
um in in theory the free energy

100
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,599
principle applies to

101
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,440
a very diverse systems but in practice

102
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,840
there has been very few attempts to

103
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,720
explore it

104
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,560
to explore all the steps in the of the

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,200
theory in specific systems and

106
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,080
what we want to do here is just that and

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,560
we

108
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
want to understand the free energy

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,480
principle and its mathematical

110
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,840
assumptions in the

111
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,760
simplest system in the simplest

112
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,519
non-equilibrium system that we can find

113
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,239
and

114
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,799
this is a linear language dynamics that

115
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,239
i will explain later

116
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,000
and under an assumption of and the

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,439
assumptions that the couplings between

118
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,560
elements are weak

119
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
and in this very special case we can

120
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,839
compute all the relevant variables

121
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,639
analytically

122
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,919
and this will be a very again this is a

123
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,199
very interesting case for

124
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,280
studying in in-depth all the

125
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,560
mathematical

126
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,919
details um okay so the

127
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,320
the work i'm presenting today has is

128
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,479
related to the latest publications

129
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,120
around the ideas of the fib

130
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,960
the monograph of free energy for a

131
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,639
particular physics and the most

132
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,759
recent more recent paper uh by

133
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,840
thomas lance and carl about markov

134
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,680
blankets information geometry and

135
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,919
stochastic thermodynamics

136
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,639
and specifically we want to focus on on

137
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,520
two questions

138
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,400
the third question is is how general is

139
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,840
the free energy principle

140
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,360
that is uh from all the systems that we

141
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,479
can imagine

142
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,440
can capture aspects of biological

143
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,720
systems

144
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,960
how many of them conform to the

145
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,479
assumptions that

146
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,520
that the the principle requires

147
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,440
and the second question is how

148
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,560
informative is

149
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,320
the principle about the behavior of a

150
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,560
system so if if a system

151
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,080
if the first point holds so if a system

152
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,479
conforms to all the requirements of the

153
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,440
principle then

154
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,840
how much how much do we know about the

155
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,560
system right

156
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,080
how much uh the principle is able to

157
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,199
inform us about the behavior of this

158
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,479
organism okay so

159
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,960
so and and in this this we we find two

160
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,320
issues

161
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,400
that i will explain later in detail one

162
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,360
is that

163
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,919
and some of the requirements of of the

164
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:56,720
principle

165
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,880
uh are are make it challenging to find

166
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,560
systems in in the class of systems we

167
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,080
explore that that

168
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,880
find that that match the required

169
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,479
assumptions and

170
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,600
and the second issue we found is that

171
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,360
one important step in connecting the

172
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,199
behavior of the system to the

173
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,800
to the gradient of the free energy of

174
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,319
the sherlock principle

175
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,720
uh involves uh the coupling from the

176
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
history of interaction of a system

177
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,840
and this creates problems in the for

178
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,080
interpretation of a system behaving as

179
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,240
if minimizing apprentice i will

180
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
explain that into that so so before

181
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,600
starting

182
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,199
just one quick note on the notation we

183
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,280
are using which is a bit different from

184
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,759
from the papers and some of the

185
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,840
literature we are describing

186
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,919
external sensory active and internal

187
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,599
state with dc which is composed by

188
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,599
external states y

189
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,479
sensory states s active states a and

190
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,440
interval states

191
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,319
x and here also differently than in the

192
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,039
in the papers

193
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,919
both symbols represent a vector and

194
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,199
matrices

195
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,960
so and expectations instead which were

196
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,520
revolved in some of the papers here are

197
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,800
represented by these

198
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
m variables like my ms and so on

199
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,560
and sometimes the theory uses

200
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,639
conditional expectations given a blanket

201
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,319
state and in this case the

202
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,400
the blanket states the conditional state

203
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,759
is going to be between parentheses so

204
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,319
this is the

205
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,039
mean of y the mean of external states

206
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,160
given b

207
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,720
and also we can compute time derivatives

208
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,919
as usual

209
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,880
and we will represent marginal flows as

210
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,800
these f variables that i will describe

211
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,840
later

212
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,960
okay so so first we try to summarize the

213
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,599
different

214
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,360
conditions and assumptions that one

215
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
needs to derive the free energy

216
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,319
principle

217
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,479
and i am going to make a bit summary

218
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,318
which we will be useful for later

219
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,720
so first we the free energy principle

220
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,240
assumes we have a system that we can

221
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,360
describe

222
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,919
as a langevin stochastic differential

223
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,520
equation and this is just

224
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,800
having a noise term this omega which is

225
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,759
just random and

226
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,800
uncorrelated the white noise and some

227
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,680
flow function f that could be any

228
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,000
potentially non-linear function that

229
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,919
describes this time derivative this

230
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,120
evolution

231
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,879
this deterministic part of the evolution

232
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,479
of of a variable c

233
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,960
and in principle the the cubar er

234
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,879
omega's gaussian term and its covariance

235
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,199
is

236
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,440
just a diagonal matrix a gamma

237
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,200
because all the noise is independent

238
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,640
between elements

239
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,958
okay so the first condition that the the

240
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,200
free energy principle requires is that

241
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,839
the flow function decouples what the

242
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,279
it's generally called autonomous and

243
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,240
non-autonomous

244
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,360
states meaning that internal states

245
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,560
x are not going to influence external

246
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,320
and sensory states

247
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,399
and external states are not going to

248
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,519
influence active

249
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,920
and internal states and this so this is

250
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,720
what uh

251
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,519
what we generally expect from a sensory

252
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,279
motor loop in an agent

253
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,399
and so if we happen we represent this

254
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,240
evolution of the system like an euler

255
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,760
integration

256
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,720
so the external states do not influence

257
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,440
active and

258
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,120
internal and internal states do not

259
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,440
influence external and sensor

260
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,160
okay so so we are going to require

261
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
restrictor analysis to system that have

262
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,279
this

263
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,480
sensory model structure the second

264
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,800
condition of the principle is that

265
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,040
this system has a global attractor that

266
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,839
is that the

267
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,360
the probability distributions of the

268
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,959
state of a system converge

269
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,320
to some specific probability

270
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,720
distribution which is called t

271
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,240
and this speed and can be described by

272
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,560
the

273
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,279
surprise which is the negative logarithm

274
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:45,920
of this

275
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,080
of the probability which is how

276
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,279
surprising or how

277
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,560
unlikely is a state and

278
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,120
and the con this condition proposes that

279
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,000
this global attractor or this

280
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
steady-state distribution can be

281
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,680
described by a decomposition composition

282
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,079
helpful holds the composition or well an

283
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,320
a of the composition

284
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,880
which relates the flow function with the

285
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,560
surprise

286
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,680
via two matrices q and gamma gamma we

287
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,279
saw it before it was just the the

288
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,360
covariance of the noise

289
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,800
and q is a matrix capturing what's

290
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
generally called the solenoidal flows in

291
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,079
the system and

292
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,200
q is a it's asymmetric and the

293
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,320
solenoidal flows of the system mean mean

294
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,720
that uh it capture the non-equilibrium

295
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
influences in the system if if if a

296
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,760
system is at

297
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
thermodynamic equilibrium then q is

298
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,279
going to be zero

299
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,320
for all elements but if the system has

300
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,560
an

301
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,640
exchange of matter or energy or have

302
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,959
some asymmetry in the interaction

303
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,160
between the parts

304
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,399
q is going going to be non-zero okay

305
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,880
okay so we are going to have this and

306
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,240
this diffusion turns

307
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,399
gamma which are these these dot these

308
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,240
dust lines and then we are going to have

309
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,680
couplings between elements with these

310
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,200
solenoidal

311
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,079
influences that are captured by these uh

312
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:10,880
blue

313
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,920
arrows here this one will be arrows okay

314
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,480
so that's

315
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,160
the second condition and the last

316
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,000
condition that the free energy sport

317
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,360
requires is the mark of blanket

318
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,399
condition this

319
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,440
yeah maybe very well known which

320
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,120
requires that so that the sensory motor

321
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,680
states

322
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,560
s and a and which are generally called a

323
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,440
blanket state

324
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,279
with that we are going to call v

325
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,040
compressing the two

326
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,440
so the condition requires that this

327
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,640
variable

328
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,880
and are going to play a very special

329
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,560
role decoupling

330
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,079
internal external states in the

331
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,079
following way and they are going to

332
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,800
if if we compute a conditional

333
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,839
distribution

334
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,839
fixing b and of into external internal

335
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,360
states these states is going to be

336
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,320
independent

337
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,079
for a fixed v so they are not

338
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,519
independent in general but they are

339
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,200
independent for a specific

340
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,720
blanket state okay so we can yeah

341
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,040
so if these arrows are conditional our

342
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,639
statistical dependencies

343
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,519
the given b we have y and x but they are

344
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,399
not

345
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,920
and they are not statistically

346
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,000
correlated for a given b

347
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,800
okay and and so and in this sense the

348
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,720
these blanket states are going to be

349
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,000
like a a boundary or a barrier

350
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,839
between external and internal states

351
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,680
okay so so these are the conditions

352
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
required by the free energy principle in

353
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,639
orbit

354
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,920
meaning that these these are the

355
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,839
prerequisites that we

356
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,320
require so for a system to

357
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,680
uh to to to display the properties

358
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,959
uh proposed by the free energy principle

359
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,200
okay but asides of that uh we interpret

360
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,160
and that the theory has some three extra

361
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,120
assumptions

362
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,560
so these are not conditions these are

363
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,560
not presuppositive but things that

364
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,360
the theory expects to happen or expect

365
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,399
to find at least

366
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,519
in some some cases and

367
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,440
and for explaining this we still

368
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,800
explained before

369
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,800
and how the theory proposed that

370
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,279
and variational free energy is involved

371
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,040
in the behavior of a system

372
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,279
so so the free energy principle proposes

373
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,519
that any system under these conditions

374
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,480
that they describe

375
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,240
can be seen as minimizing or as if

376
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,200
it's going to behave as if minimizing a

377
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,360
variational free energy

378
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,000
so for and for defining this free energy

379
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,839
we start with the surprise

380
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,279
of the blanket state so the blanket

381
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,680
state is is what an agent can observe

382
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,160
in the environment the agent uh do not

383
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
cannot access the environment directly

384
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,760
because of the essential metastructure

385
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,800
that we have

386
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,440
but only can access the blanket states

387
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,680
the sensors and the actuators

388
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,440
and and if a system is is

389
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,760
behaving as if minimizing the free

390
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,440
energy or

391
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,519
and doing variation inference assistant

392
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,880
will is going to behave

393
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,399
as if minimizing the um

394
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,959
yeah the the surprise of this this state

395
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,560
and okay but the but the system cannot

396
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,839
access this probability

397
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,360
probability distribution directly but

398
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
because it doesn't really cannot access

399
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,639
the environment

400
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,120
so instead of that by using inference

401
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,360
prescribes to use a lower bound

402
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,720
of this surprise and okay which is

403
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
called a variational free energy

404
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,160
and this variation of free energy

405
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,399
consists of on the surprise term

406
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,360
plus some divergence with some kl

407
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,720
divergence between the

408
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,480
actual probability distribution of the

409
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
environment given the blanket

410
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,880
and a model q a simplified model of the

411
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,160
environment

412
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,079
and and by ambassador inference consists

413
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,880
in finding the parameters theta of this

414
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,680
model

415
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,800
that minimize this distance so in this

416
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,720
so when this distance is minimized then

417
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,160
the agent

418
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,240
has a model of the world and is

419
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
predicting

420
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,199
the the states of the environment white

421
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,320
okay so

422
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,720
so solving the digestion inference

423
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,600
problem

424
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,399
uh so the simplest way of simplest way

425
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,519
of doing it is just

426
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,240
doing a gradient descent minimization of

427
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
this free energy

428
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
which ends up in being a gradient

429
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,560
descent of of the surprise

430
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,759
of the environment y at at the most

431
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,480
likely state

432
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,839
theta and blanket okay so so here just

433
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,600
theta just parameterizes the most likely

434
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,399
state of y

435
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,639
okay um okay so so then the the

436
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,480
frequency principle defines the most

437
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,240
likely states of the

438
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,120
uh of the system and environment peaks

439
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,320
in a blanket

440
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,600
just like the the mode or the arc max

441
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,839
but sometimes it has been proposed that

442
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,360
the mean is enough

443
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,680
for doing this and since we are going to

444
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,800
use linear systems

445
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,079
they both are going to be the same so

446
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,399
you can interpret this m as the mode or

447
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,240
as the

448
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,480
as the mean of of y and x given b

449
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,680
and then you can if you remember we have

450
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,800
these flow functions

451
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,079
f you can compute the average flow of

452
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,279
the system

453
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,800
and y for a given b and

454
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
which we saw in this assumption that can

455
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,959
be described by this matrix q and gamma

456
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,160
and the gradient

457
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,800
on the surprise so if we want to find

458
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,639
something like the gradient

459
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,519
of the surprise that we have here and

460
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,480
the

461
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,320
free energy principle proposes that we

462
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,639
have to compute the average of

463
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,880
of the flow given b and we obtain

464
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,079
something like this

465
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,000
and and we can see here that the first

466
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,759
term is just what we want is the

467
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,800
gradient

468
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,079
is sorted with the gradient of the

469
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,399
surprise but we have some extra terms

470
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,759
um and so if we have

471
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,160
so if we have some some gradient like

472
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,360
this

473
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,279
we could if we had something like the

474
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,519
first term in this equation we could

475
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,720
interpret we can use this orient

476
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,559
to perform um

477
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,240
we will use this way to perform a

478
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,559
minimization of this energy which

479
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,599
interpret if we interpret it

480
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,839
and strictly it could mean having some

481
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,280
variable theta that

482
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,839
follows this gradient oh sorry one

483
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,799
second

484
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,480
and okay and

485
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,000
okay so so if we have some okay so and

486
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,640
the effect

487
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,480
the free energy so suggest that this

488
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,000
parameters theta is going to be the most

489
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,480
likely

490
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,720
states of external or then internal

491
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,520
states

492
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,760
i'm going to do so so we have sorry we

493
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,080
have this equation here this equation 12

494
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,200
and we just need the first term so in

495
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,720
general the free energy principle

496
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,440
proposes that

497
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,320
uh the the couplings of this matrix q

498
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,600
the non di

499
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,200
um are going to be zero and

500
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,320
okay so so okay so this is uh

501
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,400
so each element in this diagonal is a

502
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,240
block can have many a number of

503
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,440
dimensions

504
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
and the free energy principle assumes

505
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,200
that

506
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,840
well one interpretation is that it

507
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,360
assumes that

508
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,280
removing these solenoidal couplings

509
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
these non-block diagonal

510
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,360
copings then we are going to remove

511
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,679
these elements that we don't want

512
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,080
and we are going to have a flow of the

513
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,120
system

514
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,200
uh equal to this gradient on the

515
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,960
surprise that is the gradient that

516
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,039
minimize the free energy

517
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,840
okay so so this is the first assumption

518
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,039
if if this

519
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,240
if these q terms are equal to zero then

520
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,360
we have an average flow that goes in the

521
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,280
direction of minimizing the free energy

522
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
and this is interesting because we will

523
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,360
have a system that points in the

524
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,600
uh in the direction of the free energy

525
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,720
and what we

526
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,200
i will explain that later and however

527
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,240
there's in some works

528
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,640
uh it is proposed that the there's a

529
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
more general form of this matrix that is

530
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,039
not

531
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,520
it's also block diagonal but not within

532
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,960
y and sna but

533
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,919
within uh autonomous and non-autonomous

534
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:08,960
states

535
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,400
and a and x and and this is has been

536
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
referred as the general case but

537
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,480
it's not for us at least it's not that

538
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,679
clear how

539
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,320
you can derive in this case and this

540
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,480
gradient of the free energy and

541
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
what it suggested that the solenoidal

542
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,840
couplings can

543
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,039
cancel out but but yeah but i

544
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,799
so we are going to consider the two

545
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,039
cases but uh considers

546
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,440
in principle just the the case of a

547
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,240
complete

548
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,520
diagonal so this first assumption means

549
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,200
that the solenoidal coatings between

550
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,160
elements

551
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,240
are or can be approximated as zero

552
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,160
okay and the second assumption

553
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,679
is the and okay so we have a flow of

554
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,760
external states that's pointing in the

555
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,080
direction of minimizing the free energy

556
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,039
but we want to interpret internal states

557
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,280
as minimizing this free energy

558
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,720
so what the free energy small purpose

559
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,480
purposes to solve this

560
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,679
so the the proposal is that there is a

561
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,880
a smooth mapping sigma that connects the

562
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
most likely internal states with the

563
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,000
most likely external states

564
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,200
so this m y is equal to sigma x

565
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,440
and and the assumption is that there's a

566
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,640
gradient

567
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,400
and of the of yeah there's a gradient or

568
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,000
there's a derivative of this mapping

569
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,440
that exists so the mapping is

570
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,679
differentiable and that it is invertible

571
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:35,440
and they propose that the sufficient

572
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
requisite for this assumption too is

573
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,960
that the mapping from b

574
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,159
to mx is injected okay and

575
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,919
so if this mapping exists then we can

576
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,280
connect the

577
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,440
external states with the internal states

578
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,360
and we know that the external states

579
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,760
about flow that points in the direction

580
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,520
of minimizing the free energy

581
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,080
and so the hope is that now internal

582
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,559
states

583
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,799
if this mapping exists are going also to

584
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,240
have a flow that's pointing in the

585
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,480
direction of the free energy

586
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,600
and the last assumption and this is

587
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,520
maybe more controversial

588
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,799
is that if one have a

589
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,799
strict interpretation of the

590
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,480
gradient descent on of a free energy

591
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,600
and the the assumption will be

592
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
that the dynamics of the most likely

593
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,159
states are approximately equal to the

594
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,159
dynamic to the average flow of the

595
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,760
external state

596
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,400
so so this is the derivative of the

597
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,440
average state

598
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,559
and the right side will be the average

599
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,799
of the derivative to some so so

600
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,320
so this is saying something like this no

601
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,080
proximity the derivative of the rate is

602
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,039
going to be

603
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,559
equivalent to the average of the

604
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,799
derivative because the flow is just the

605
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,720
the time derivative of the of the system

606
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,679
uh so and if this assumption will be

607
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,880
true then

608
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,440
not only the flow of external states

609
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,880
point in the direction of the primary

610
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,600
but also

611
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,559
the dynamics of the system of the uh are

612
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,360
minimizing the free energy

613
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,919
and and this is interesting because if

614
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:08,640
we had this

615
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,200
if this is true then we have some

616
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,159
equation like this

617
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,559
so the derivative of uh of time y is

618
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,720
equal to the gradient respect to n y of

619
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,919
this surprise

620
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,039
so the dynamics of m y are behaving as

621
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,400
if minimizing

622
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,919
the free energy so we so this equation

623
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,240
is true we know that the dynamics of the

624
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,840
behavior of the system is going to be

625
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,960
minimizing

626
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,600
actively performing a gradient descent

627
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,280
on the free energy

628
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,200
and if this is true and we have the

629
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,960
mapping that

630
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,600
assumption two proposed then we can use

631
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,799
the chain rule

632
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,480
to find a connection between between the

633
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,840
derivative of m y

634
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,440
and the derivative of n y so the

635
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,280
dynamics of the external states and the

636
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,520
dynamics of the internal states

637
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,600
just with the gradient of this sigma

638
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,559
function

639
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,320
so this is just a chain rule of the of

640
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,720
derivatives

641
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,919
and with this step then we can describe

642
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,760
the dynamics of internal states as the

643
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,240
dynamics of external states and use this

644
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,440
gradient mapping to reach this equation

645
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,640
23

646
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,600
that tells you that the dynamics of the

647
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,200
most likely internal states

648
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,280
is doing a gradient descent on the free

649
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,520
energy so this is the end of the

650
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,880
of the of the argument of the free

651
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,480
energy so so if this is true then

652
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,960
the internal states will be behaving as

653
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,640
if minimizing

654
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,880
the free energy about external states

655
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,919
and then the

656
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,360
internal state will be behaving as if

657
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,880
effectively performing uh by a budgeting

658
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,080
inference

659
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,480
okay and and well we derived that from

660
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,600
some of the

661
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,159
the steps in in these publications in

662
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,200
the

663
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,360
the monograph of a particular free

664
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,799
energy for a particular physics and the

665
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,600
most recent

666
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,240
uh paper based formats about markov

667
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,840
blankets information geometries and so

668
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,480
on

669
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,120
because they or at least it appeared to

670
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,520
us that

671
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,279
they were using the same symbol for the

672
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,960
derivative of external states and the

673
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,400
average flow

674
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,840
and because so in some equations there

675
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,679
is a connection between the any so

676
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,440
for the chain rule they use this the

677
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,039
symbol and point

678
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,320
and so so this is why we

679
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,279
interpret this in the in this way

680
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,000
however

681
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,320
and also from conversation from the

682
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,279
authors

683
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,400
uh it's proposed that the

684
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
the free energy principle is not exactly

685
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,799
proposing that the behaviors

686
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,080
so i need the presentation of the

687
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,240
principle will be that the

688
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,840
system is not doing any straight

689
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,600
creating descent as this assumption

690
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,240
three

691
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,120
that we label with this star because

692
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,000
it's

693
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,880
in part or interpretation but that the

694
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,039
an alternative to this assumption star 3

695
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,320
will be assumption star star 3

696
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,520
which is that it is not the

697
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,440
derivative of the most likely state that

698
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,200
follow the grain of the free energy but

699
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,120
that but just the flow

700
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,120
the average flow so the average flow of

701
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,159
f y

702
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,240
is just the average of the derivative of

703
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,799
y given v the conditional average with

704
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,480
the conditional distribution

705
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,559
and and the claim will be that

706
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,679
if the flow is pointing so if the

707
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,960
average derivative

708
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,400
is pointing in the right direction of

709
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,640
the free energy then

710
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,360
you can interpret that the system is

711
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,080
behaving

712
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,120
as if on average it was performing a

713
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,400
gradient descent

714
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,039
so so this assumption on star star 3

715
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,320
would be that

716
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,400
not that the system is exactly doing a

717
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,480
gradient descent on the free energy

718
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
but that it is doing on average now if

719
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,159
we will have

720
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,679
like many observations of of the system

721
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,520
then we could see that they on average

722
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,200
points to a minimization of the free

723
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,360
energy but maybe not if we just observe

724
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,600
one system individually

725
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,840
okay and then this assumption starts

726
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,960
start three will be that

727
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
yeah exactly that now if the conditional

728
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,279
average flows follow the direction of

729
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,880
uh gradient descendant on the free

730
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
energy then the behavior can be

731
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,240
described on average

732
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,159
as if minimizing the greenhouse okay

733
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,640
okay so this is the summary of the

734
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,400
different conditions and assumptions

735
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,520
of the principle in which we will have

736
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,440
competing interpretations at some points

737
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,279
like this assumption three

738
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,960
um okay um okay this is a lot of steps

739
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,360
and

740
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,559
and it is hard to intuitively

741
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,679
have an idea of of what goes

742
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,200
what yeah how we can expect from any of

743
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,240
them so

744
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,120
what we did is we try to explore these

745
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,640
different conditions and assumptions

746
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,240
in a in a very easy system to solve and

747
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,039
and and see what we can expect uh in

748
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:49,360
this

749
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,000
very simple case no so our ideas the

750
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,240
best way to really understand this

751
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,080
is to have a toy model the the same

752
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,520
place we can have

753
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,799
and and see how easy or hard

754
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,480
is for the different assumptions to

755
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,120
behold to be held by the system

756
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,679
okay so we substituted the langiban

757
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,760
dynamics that we had before

758
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,559
by just a linear language so everything

759
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,799
is the same

760
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,760
and well we have a factor for the noise

761
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,000
but this is going to be this one and

762
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,120
and we have we have uh

763
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,200
now the f function the flow is just

764
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,159
substituted by

765
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,919
a linear multiplication so we have a

766
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,679
matrix j

767
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,919
which is an invertible unreal which is

768
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,000
multiplying

769
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,039
the state of the system minus some

770
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,760
constant raw which is just going to be

771
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,559
the

772
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,720
an offset capturing the the average

773
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,960
state in

774
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,760
a steady state okay and this system is

775
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,679
going to be a non-equilibrium system

776
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,600
if and the matrix j is

777
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,799
is not symmetric okay so in that case we

778
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,080
are going to have a non-equilibrium

779
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,720
system

780
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,000
and we are going to have like for

781
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,200
example spiral flows and so on

782
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,279
and the interesting thing is that this

783
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,320
system has a

784
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,360
has a steady state if we let the system

785
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,120
run for some time it's going to have a

786
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,240
steady state that's going to be a

787
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,600
gaussian distribution because if

788
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,880
everything is linear

789
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,559
and the noise is linear eventually the

790
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,159
system is going to reach

791
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,960
a steady state gaussian distribution and

792
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,919
in the

793
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,039
limit of time time going to infinity

794
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,799
the average of this gaussian is going to

795
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,799
be just this row parameter

796
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,559
and the covariance matrix of this

797
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,799
multiplied gaussian is going to be this

798
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,840
sigma star matrix

799
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,679
and and this sigma star matrix cannot be

800
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,480
solved uh analytically but it's the

801
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,960
solution of this equation 29

802
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,360
it's an equation that involves the noise

803
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,960
the covariance of the noise gamma

804
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,480
and the couplings yeah and if

805
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,240
in equilibrium this matrix these

806
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,399
equations can be solved analytically but

807
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,480
we are interested in more generally in

808
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,640
non-equilibrium systems and

809
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,320
this this equation is called a

810
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,039
continuous line of lyapunov equation

811
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,039
and in principle it can be just solved

812
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,320
numerically

813
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,360
which is not ideal for us because we

814
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,000
want to

815
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,559
access to have the connections between

816
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,679
the parameters and

817
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,399
and the matrix but we cannot in general

818
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,960
okay so what what did we do um

819
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,799
so in order to have a solution of this

820
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,960
equation a general solution

821
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,600
we assume the following we assume that

822
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,080
and

823
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,360
the couplings of j can be defined

824
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,480
as some diagonal term i

825
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,120
and this is negative just to ensure the

826
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,640
stability of the system so if

827
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,159
if if y if i is is positive and large

828
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,039
then you will have a diverging system

829
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,360
and then we have a non-diagonal

830
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,039
couplings

831
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,080
c and we assume that these c terms

832
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,120
are small so if we have c square or

833
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,360
c to the power of three and these are

834
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,760
going to be neglectable terms

835
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,559
and in that sense we can so we have that

836
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,399
we can solve this equation

837
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,480
you know in terms of a power series

838
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,640
expansion so we can have like a

839
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,320
so this will be equivalent to a taylor

840
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,679
expansion that you can

841
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,799
see in calculus and and

842
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,840
we can have an expression of this sigma

843
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,440
the covariance matrix of the solution in

844
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,320
terms

845
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,360
of increasing powers of c

846
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,760
so we have here the linear term the

847
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,120
quadratic terms and

848
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,679
some cubic terms that we are going to

849
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:34,720
ignore

850
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,679
okay and to make things more easier we

851
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:38,880
are going to assume that the

852
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,279
noise is homogeneous so sigma is just

853
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,240
identity matrix times some constant some

854
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,919
scanner constant

855
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,600
okay so

856
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,640
okay so we choose values of so if

857
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,080
y so the conditions one and two are

858
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,120
almost automatically um true if

859
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
y is not even larger than c we have a

860
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,480
global attractor

861
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,760
and also we can define j

862
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
to have the sensory motor structure that

863
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,799
we want

864
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,240
and so we go directly to condition three

865
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,640
so condition three is the markov blanket

866
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,080
condition

867
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,120
proposing that the blanket states or the

868
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
central motor states play a very special

869
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,679
role

870
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,760
being a boundary between external states

871
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,360
and internalistics so that the

872
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,880
distributes the conditional distribution

873
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,159
is an independent

874
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,120
distribution given the blanket y and x

875
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,000
are independent

876
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,200
okay so in a gaussian distribution

877
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,320
and this condition is true if another

878
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:40,880
leaf

879
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,519
the hessian matrix which is the inverse

880
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,880
of the covariance

881
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,240
satisfies that the decision between y

882
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,919
and x decision between internal

883
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,919
and external states remember that this

884
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,919
can be a matrix if the dimensions of y

885
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,840
and x are more than one

886
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,120
it's equal to zero and okay so

887
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,720
we can very easily compute uh

888
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,399
what's the form of discretion with these

889
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,159
approximations so

890
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,679
we have the question how common are

891
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,760
markov blankets now from all the systems

892
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,960
in the world

893
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,480
and how often can we expect

894
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,960
if we have just random parameters to

895
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,600
find our

896
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,519
markov blanket okay so we want this

897
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,159
matrix

898
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,799
h which is the inverse of the covariance

899
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,240
of the steady state distribution

900
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,440
and we can express this inverse

901
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,279
again as a power series and this is

902
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,720
called a neumann series

903
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,600
for computing the inverse of a matrix

904
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,279
and

905
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,480
and it has this form we have again a

906
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,440
linear term

907
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,360
and a quadratic term and some cubic

908
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,679
terms that we are going to ignore

909
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,960
okay and so we just need to know c

910
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,559
to know how what's h and to know if this

911
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,360
corner of the matrix is equal to zero

912
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:57,840
okay

913
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,880
so so c is going to be like this because

914
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,000
we impose

915
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,320
these specific sensor motor structures

916
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,039
in which external states don't influence

917
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,799
internal and internal done influence

918
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,480
external and so on

919
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,960
and so for the first order approximation

920
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,799
we have this equation 36 okay so so you

921
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,240
yeah for a third sort of approximation

922
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,279
we just

923
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,480
keep this term of the equation and we

924
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,960
can see

925
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,519
which is c plus the transpose just

926
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,159
switching

927
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,799
rows and columns and we can see that if

928
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:31,519
we

929
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,159
sum c plus the transpose the term in the

930
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,080
corner is going to be equal to zero

931
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,720
which is what what we want so for our

932
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,039
first order approximation we have a

933
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,440
an exact markov blanket and the markov

934
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,120
blanket is always going to be true so

935
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,519
this is

936
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,880
a good news in principle and however

937
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,399
if we if we are a little what if we want

938
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,360
more precision

939
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,760
and we compute a second order so we get

940
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,919
this quadratic terms here

941
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,159
we find that the corner of the hessian

942
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,840
the one that has to be zero has this

943
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,200
form

944
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,760
so in principle this is not going to be

945
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,880
zero or is

946
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,960
going to be zero just for various

947
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,440
special cases

948
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,760
and if we look at the connectivity

949
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,119
structure of the of the system

950
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,520
so the kind of sensor motor loop that we

951
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,960
require in general

952
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,159
is this a canonical loop

953
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,119
at figure a so in principle for this

954
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:25,679
structure

955
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,199
very few systems are going to have a

956
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,520
markov blanket because this is

957
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,679
not going to be zero exactly almost

958
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,879
never

959
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,960
and however there is some other

960
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,320
configurations that are going to have a

961
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,159
mark of language if we have a circular

962
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,599
loop like this case b

963
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,760
or we have something like this a

964
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,280
structure in c

965
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,639
then uh the relevant then then the terms

966
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,560
appearing in this equation are

967
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,159
at least one of them is zero in both

968
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,159
cases and this is going to be zero so

969
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,679
v and c are going to have a markov

970
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,760
blanket in general but

971
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,599
not a and there are second order

972
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,119
approximation

973
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,079
and so under this canonical flow

974
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,000
constraint so case a

975
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,400
only a few systems are going to display

976
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,119
an exact

977
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,160
mark of blankets although about one

978
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,599
exception are going to be the circular

979
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,839
loops or the symmetric loops

980
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,599
and however we we fair we we have to say

981
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,960
that um

982
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,599
in the case of weak couplings uh the

983
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,520
markov blanket is still going to be a

984
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,079
reason

985
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,720
princeton or reasonable approximation

986
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,839
because if we have some equation like

987
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,359
this and

988
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,880
so so so the first term so so even if we

989
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,160
have something like this this is a

990
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,839
second order equation

991
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,520
and all the other elements in the matrix

992
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,359
are going to have first order components

993
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,760
that are going to be much larger so even

994
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,720
if it's

995
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,800
even if we do not have an exact markov

996
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,400
blanket this is going to be a reasonable

997
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,480
reasonable approximation

998
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,520
in most cases okay

999
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,359
so this is condition one conditional

1000
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,200
three sorry so let's go to the next

1001
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,000
the next one is assumption one uh which

1002
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,880
states that

1003
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,200
uh the solenoidal couplings between

1004
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,560
blocks of state

1005
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,680
have to be zero in order to have a

1006
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,359
flow that points in the direction of the

1007
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,760
free energy or we could relax this

1008
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,599
assumption and have this

1009
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,079
this larger blocks but also we're

1010
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,800
requiring some some zeros in here

1011
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,560
uh okay and so we can rewrite the the

1012
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,320
previous solution of the

1013
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,119
of the steady state equation uh to find

1014
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:27,680
an exp

1015
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,200
a connection between q gamma and j

1016
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,760
and we and doing that will reach right

1017
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,200
in the previous equation we can reach

1018
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,000
this equation

1019
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,160
40. and again and this is this equation

1020
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,560
can

1021
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,040
cannot be solved directly in general

1022
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,800
because it's another

1023
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,079
continuous like upon equation but

1024
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,359
assuming uh that we have j equal

1025
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,359
c minus y like and the coordinates are

1026
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,119
small as we have before

1027
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,280
we can do the same trick and have a new

1028
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,880
power series that connects

1029
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,079
q with the values of c okay and has this

1030
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:02,960
form which is

1031
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,119
similar but a little bit different than

1032
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,440
the case before

1033
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,560
um okay so but this case looks a little

1034
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,800
bit more complicated so first we just

1035
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,760
computed the

1036
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,119
the first order expansion of q

1037
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,079
and it looks like this so so this is q

1038
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,720
for a first order

1039
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,720
case ignoring this the quadratic terms

1040
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,920
of c okay and again

1041
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,119
we see that there is in principle few

1042
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:33,920
cases

1043
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,599
where then yeah where the assumption

1044
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,960
is held exactly because we are

1045
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,119
we're having you we want to make zero

1046
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,960
all these terms here

1047
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,240
and if we don't constrain the possible

1048
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,440
parameters this is going

1049
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,599
to be true only in very very special

1050
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,880
cases

1051
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,200
and we can see that one way to make zero

1052
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,960
many elements of this matrix

1053
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,400
is assuming that they are symmetric if c

1054
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,040
and y s is equal to the transpose of t

1055
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,960
so so if the connections from

1056
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,440
sensor to environment are equal to the

1057
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,119
connections of environment to sensor

1058
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,040
then this is going to be zero

1059
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,560
and in that case we obtain this matrix

1060
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,640
which has a lot of zeros but still there

1061
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,240
is these terms

1062
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,040
that we cannot get rid of so if these

1063
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,920
couplings are not zero

1064
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,640
then uh we don't have the assumption of

1065
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,640
the free energy principle and

1066
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,960
and this is important because well this

1067
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,599
is well this is this will be the

1068
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,480
the connection from actuators to the

1069
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,000
environment which in principle is

1070
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,200
something we could

1071
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,240
expect in many cases and this is the

1072
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,640
uh yeah and this is the connections from

1073
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,440
sensor

1074
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,680
to internal states which is also

1075
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,280
something we expect in most

1076
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,640
sensory motor or we intuitively expect

1077
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,960
from a cognitive system with a sensory

1078
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,400
motor loop

1079
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,040
and if we want to make these elements of

1080
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,920
the matrix

1081
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,359
equal to zero then we

1082
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,480
need to have something like this loop c

1083
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,560
in which these elements are symmetric

1084
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,000
the js

1085
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,640
the non-diagonal js are symmetric and

1086
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,440
also we

1087
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,480
remove the connections from sensor to

1088
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,440
internal states and actuators to

1089
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,720
external state which is

1090
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,000
intuitively uh a bit strange but but

1091
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
i think is in some of the literature of

1092
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,520
the friner events with this kind of loop

1093
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,960
has been used

1094
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,839
and so and it has probably and it has

1095
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,440
purpose that this could represent for

1096
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,240
example the

1097
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,200
the membrane of a cell that separates

1098
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,520
the

1099
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,680
internal and external states in this

1100
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,839
kind of symmetric

1101
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:45,040
manner although i think there is some

1102
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,720
well there's some research on cell

1103
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,240
membranes indicating that

1104
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,079
asymmetries in them in membranes are

1105
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,320
still important so this could be still

1106
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,880
a potential issue for finding systems

1107
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,440
that

1108
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,160
that that have this this zero this block

1109
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,640
that you're gonna help you

1110
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,280
and if we consider the second order

1111
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,280
approximations things become

1112
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,400
spookier and we have many many terms

1113
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,319
and we see that these elements are just

1114
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,520
going to be zero in very

1115
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,240
in a very narrow set of of cases which

1116
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,640
is

1117
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,920
potentially problematic for for

1118
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,040
uh yeah for asserting that the principle

1119
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,440
is

1120
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,000
is in general for it would yeah this

1121
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,680
assumptions will be general for

1122
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,040
for many systems and this

1123
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,160
also gives you an idea that we we are

1124
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,359
starting this very special

1125
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,640
case with very weak couplings but having

1126
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,119
a

1127
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,200
stronger couplings in principle will

1128
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,240
make things

1129
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,359
more complicated and not easier

1130
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,680
and okay so this is assumption one and

1131
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,760
we only are going to get this block

1132
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,599
diagram they're very specific

1133
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,920
circumstances and this as the only

1134
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,160
exception being this symmetric

1135
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,920
loop with this very very special

1136
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,359
structure

1137
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,960
and so so this is so imp so in

1138
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,040
conjunction the markov blanket

1139
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,079
exploration and the

1140
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,920
and the exploration of these soldiers

1141
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,119
accomplish uh will

1142
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,880
indicate that under the class of systems

1143
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,160
that we studied the

1144
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,560
the free energy principle will be will

1145
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,119
only emerge exactly for a very narrow

1146
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:21,520
set

1147
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,760
of systems okay so so this is um

1148
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,680
so interesting to think about how

1149
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,839
general the principle is or how can we

1150
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,440
expect

1151
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,560
it to be to be found in in in different

1152
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,680
classes of systems

1153
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,680
although we just restricted our analysis

1154
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,440
to these linear ones

1155
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,200
um okay so the second assumption and

1156
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,720
connected to the question of

1157
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,040
how general not not how general but how

1158
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,000
informative the system

1159
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,200
is and the second assumption is is that

1160
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,720
we have this mapping between internal

1161
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,000
external states and

1162
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,160
and if we compute the most likely

1163
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,480
international states given a blanket

1164
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,000
for a gaussian distribution we can do it

1165
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
very easily to computing a conditional

1166
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,640
average

1167
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,480
and so these are the questions you can

1168
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,760
find it in any

1169
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,280
textbook multivariate gaussians

1170
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,560
and we find that if this

1171
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,880
requires to compute the generalized

1172
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,960
inverse of some matrix

1173
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,160
and and we find that

1174
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,520
we can in linear systems and

1175
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,240
in some cases if the kernels of these

1176
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:28,720
matrix

1177
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,480
are correct and we can derive the

1178
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,480
mapping but these mappings

1179
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,319
if we have the correct dimensionality

1180
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,240
will exist very broadly

1181
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,839
so this mapping is just going to be a

1182
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,079
linear matrix multiplication

1183
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,440
of the relation between m y

1184
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,839
and mx so so this is good news and first

1185
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,520
of all this mapping exists and it can be

1186
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,880
expected to be

1187
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,440
very broad if the dimensions of these

1188
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,040
variables are are correct

1189
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,680
although maybe yeah maybe we should know

1190
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,599
that in some of the literature that

1191
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,760
some of the verbal descriptions say that

1192
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,520
this mapping

1193
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,839
and it's a consequence of the

1194
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,520
marketplace but what we found here is

1195
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,839
that

1196
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,560
they are principally independent they

1197
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,200
they could

1198
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,040
emerge even if there is not a markov

1199
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,319
blanket so

1200
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,119
at least in linear systems uh and also

1201
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:17,839
this

1202
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,520
we we discovered that this result was

1203
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,240
also found

1204
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,680
in independently but by lance the

1205
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,800
costine award

1206
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,920
that is going to be published soon and

1207
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,040
it's i think that they

1208
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,680
they got to the exact same result as we

1209
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,640
did

1210
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,640
uh okay so so going to the last

1211
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,680
assumption which is maybe

1212
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,880
the most complicated and

1213
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,800
so the last step of the free energy

1214
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,160
principle was to

1215
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,040
say that we know that the flow of

1216
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,800
external state the average flow y

1217
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,400
is pointing in the direction of the free

1218
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,079
energy and this means

1219
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,920
that the system is behaving as if

1220
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,680
minimizing the free energy

1221
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,280
and i described that there is two

1222
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,839
possible interpretations for this

1223
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,839
an extrict one and a relaxed one so

1224
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,520
let's explore first the

1225
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,400
strict gradient descent interpretation

1226
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:06,880
which would

1227
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,079
mean that the derivative of the average

1228
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,079
of the external states is equal to the

1229
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,000
average flow

1230
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,920
and we can compute that very easily in

1231
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,760
our linear system this this equation is

1232
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,480
the derivative of the average state

1233
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,119
and this equation is just the average

1234
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:23,920
flow

1235
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,000
and what we did for comparing both is

1236
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,560
just generating a dummy variable this

1237
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,839
tilde m which behaves

1238
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,119
as equally as the average flow so this

1239
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,280
this variable tilde n

1240
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,440
will be a variable that strictly

1241
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,599
minimizes the free energy

1242
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,480
right so so we have so this is the real

1243
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,200
dynamics

1244
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,000
of this of these study of these most

1245
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,040
likely states

1246
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,400
and this is what these most likely

1247
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,280
stages will do if they were exactly

1248
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,319
minimizing the free energy

1249
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,119
and under or we copied approximations we

1250
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,240
can see that we can

1251
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,880
get to simplified version of these

1252
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,000
equations

1253
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,160
and we can see that both of them are a

1254
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,359
bit different

1255
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,760
at first the real dynamics has a noise

1256
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,599
noise term because the fluctuations are

1257
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,000
going to affect the dynamics because the

1258
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,800
the observations of the blanket are true

1259
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,760
by noise

1260
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,599
so this is going to be a noisy dynamics

1261
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,040
and this is not

1262
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,800
and the second difference is that this

1263
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,599
term changes

1264
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,079
the sign here so here is positive and

1265
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,520
here is negative

1266
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,079
and this seems strange but the the

1267
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,000
reason of this is because

1268
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,599
and this so this is the real dynamics

1269
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,720
which depends on the previous state and

1270
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,680
this

1271
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,200
average flow it's his story

1272
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,440
independence in some sense it just

1273
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,920
depends on the previous state of b

1274
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,880
but it doesn't depend on the previous

1275
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,000
state of y

1276
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,200
so to speak so

1277
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,280
so in that sense the the structure of

1278
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,960
the of the

1279
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,040
flow of this variable of the dynamics of

1280
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,400
this variable is going to be different

1281
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,680
and in this case this difference is

1282
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,720
captured

1283
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,800
by this constant that has a different

1284
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,359
sign between one and the other

1285
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,880
and if we run a simulation of both of

1286
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,680
both equations we find that the behavior

1287
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,000
is

1288
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,880
is very different and so this is the

1289
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,720
behavior of the real average

1290
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,200
variables so this is a system with two

1291
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,040
dimensions

1292
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,880
and you have the symmetric forms because

1293
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,880
the the we restricted

1294
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,319
the couplings to plus minus 0.1

1295
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,359
and if we represent this tilde m so so

1296
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,839
this is

1297
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,760
the system that strictly minimizes the

1298
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,520
free energy we have this very very

1299
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,359
different behavior

1300
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,800
which has this kind of a random walk and

1301
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,119
and this is because this this variable

1302
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,200
is integrating the fluctuations of of

1303
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,400
the other one

1304
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,920
and so the so the error keeps

1305
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,680
accumulating and

1306
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,720
and the behavior is very different so

1307
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,520
in principle it's unlikely that the and

1308
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,760
and these results were similar for many

1309
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,119
combinations of parameters but in

1310
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:07,839
principle is

1311
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,560
unlikely that the dynamics of the most

1312
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,839
likely states are going to

1313
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:15,119
be um so that the average flow is going

1314
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,640
to be informative about the actual

1315
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,760
dynamics

1316
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,880
of the most likely states okay so this

1317
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,559
is the strict version of the assumption

1318
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,160
the relaxed version

1319
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,680
would be that only the average flow

1320
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,040
follows the gradient of the free energy

1321
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,480
and if we if we interpret this

1322
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,640
we find that there is two problems at

1323
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,240
least we thought that there is two

1324
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,280
problems

1325
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,760
and the first problem is that a key step

1326
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,520
of the free energy principle uses the

1327
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,280
synchronization manifold

1328
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,760
so the sigma function connected external

1329
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,880
and translates

1330
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,520
and then derives a chain rule connecting

1331
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,000
the

1332
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,559
dynamics of my with the dynamics of

1333
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,319
internal states

1334
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,000
and and this leads to saying that the

1335
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,480
flow of the internal states

1336
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,119
is following the gradient of the free

1337
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,480
energy

1338
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,240
okay and so if we say that the

1339
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,119
free energy does not truly apply to the

1340
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,240
time derivatives

1341
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,760
of the most likely state but just

1342
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,000
applies to the flow

1343
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,280
then we cannot use the sigma

1344
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,440
mapping to the right this equivalence

1345
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,280
between what the external states are

1346
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,720
doing and what the internal states are

1347
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,839
doing

1348
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,640
and so we cannot so this step becomes

1349
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,319
problematic

1350
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:35,359
and if we want to connect the flows of

1351
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,040
internal states and the flows of

1352
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,760
external states as the as the energy

1353
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,520
principle proposes

1354
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,960
then one will need a new mapping because

1355
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,760
this mapping

1356
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,160
and this mapping are not the same and we

1357
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,040
computed

1358
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,960
in nonlinear system the two mappings and

1359
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,319
we find that the

1360
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,319
the mapping has a different expression

1361
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,400
and it is different

1362
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,800
from the mapping that's the gradient of

1363
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,839
the mapping that's used in the

1364
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,119
literature

1365
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,640
so so in principle this relax

1366
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,720
interpretation will require

1367
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,359
uh a different mapping that's different

1368
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,760
than sigma because we are

1369
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,520
not interested on the flows of the most

1370
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,200
likely states but on just on these

1371
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,640
average flows

1372
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,000
and okay

1373
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,400
sorry yeah uh and well and more

1374
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,839
importantly uh

1375
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,960
another problem arises which is

1376
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,400
um yeah sorry so

1377
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,920
so if we have an a street

1378
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,359
uh sorry one second

1379
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,400
yeah if we have a strict interpretation

1380
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,000
of the

1381
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,200
uh okay sorry i lose this uh yeah if we

1382
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,880
have a strict interpretation

1383
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,079
like this like a of okay internal states

1384
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,680
are following a gradient are doing a

1385
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,200
gradient descent

1386
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,119
on the on the free energy so the

1387
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,960
derivative the temporal derivative is

1388
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,079
equal to the gradient

1389
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,960
of the so this is uh this is a

1390
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,640
definition of uh

1391
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,280
like a textbook greek in descent okay

1392
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,000
and this is fine

1393
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,680
if we have this equation we know that

1394
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,000
the system is doing a gradient descent

1395
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,319
so the question is if we just have

1396
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,839
this equation here so the average flow

1397
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,280
is pointing in the direction of the

1398
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,880
gradient

1399
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,079
can we really interpret that the system

1400
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,160
is behaving as if minimizing the free

1401
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,280
energy so

1402
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,119
how informative is this average flow

1403
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,480
about the real behavior so we try to

1404
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,280
explore this

1405
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,400
so first and so well first in the

1406
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,319
simulations we see that

1407
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,960
it may be little informant there yeah it

1408
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,720
would be little informative even if we

1409
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,400
had a different mapping

1410
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,880
and maybe this average flow has little

1411
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,760
information about

1412
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,800
what the actual dynamics is doing and

1413
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,640
for exploring this further and you can

1414
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,720
see it in the in an appendix so for

1415
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,079
for a preparant like this the second

1416
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,000
appendix uh we try to to explore what is

1417
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,319
the connection between the average flow

1418
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:11,200
and the actual dynamics of the system uh

1419
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,119
in a very simple system so we restricted

1420
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,680
our system to a bi-dimensional case

1421
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,000
with this non-equilibrium behavior this

1422
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,839
is so this the flows of the system are

1423
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:22,160
have this spiral behavior with under

1424
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,520
noise are going to be

1425
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,160
rotating in this muscle so we have two

1426
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,119
variables y

1427
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,400
and b and so this is the flow the actual

1428
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,760
flow of the system

1429
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,720
and we ask okay so in this system what

1430
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,280
is the the dynamics of the most likely

1431
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,000
states

1432
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,680
so this derivative of m y and given v

1433
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,920
and we find that we have this negative

1434
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,440
slope which is

1435
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,000
uh well you have this this pink area

1436
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,760
because this is a random variable which

1437
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,119
is going to have noise and

1438
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,200
it's going to be noisy and so on but on

1439
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,800
average we have

1440
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,079
this negative slope meaning that

1441
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,440
the system is going to be minimizing

1442
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,359
it's going to have an attractor at zero

1443
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,880
right if you

1444
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,040
study dynamical systems and have a

1445
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,599
negative slope of a derivative

1446
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,920
or at least on average you are going to

1447
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,640
minimize

1448
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,079
so if the state is negative you are

1449
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,680
going to reduce it you are going to

1450
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,720
increase it sorry

1451
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,160
and if the state is positive you are

1452
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,440
going to reduce it so you are going to

1453
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,520
have an attractor at 0 which is what we

1454
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,480
see

1455
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,839
in the actual system but

1456
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:27,520
at least for some combinations of

1457
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,200
parameters which we were like

1458
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,640
half of the possible combinations of

1459
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,720
parameters that we tried

1460
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,839
if you compute the average flow it gives

1461
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,920
you the opposite behavior here the slope

1462
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,119
is positive

1463
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,359
meaning that if you have a system that

1464
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,800
follows this slope

1465
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,359
is going to diverge to ma plus infinity

1466
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,520
or minus infinity

1467
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,720
so this is intended as an example that

1468
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,599
the average flow can be a very poor

1469
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:54,720
description

1470
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,200
of the actual behavior of a system if

1471
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,079
what you have

1472
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,160
is a stochastic dynamical system

1473
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,359
and okay so

1474
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,480
so in general we cannot assume that

1475
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,839
under all circumstances

1476
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,599
the marginal flow is going to be

1477
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,839
informative as the behavior of a system

1478
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:16,319
and if

1479
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,280
even if you can derive all the steps or

1480
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,800
of the free energy principle it might be

1481
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,640
the case that in some systems

1482
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,520
the average flow that's pointing is

1483
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,720
pointing in the direction of the free

1484
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,760
energy

1485
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,640
but the system is not behaving as

1486
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,000
minimizing the free energy you know you

1487
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,760
can see it in this example

1488
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,800
uh the system is minimizing

1489
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,079
the value of y square it's going to zero

1490
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:40,720
not the

1491
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,599
here the value of of these variables is

1492
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:44,880
going to zero but

1493
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,720
the average flow points in the opposite

1494
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,160
direction it tells you that

1495
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,880
if the average flow if you interpret the

1496
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,720
average flow as what the system is

1497
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,400
doing then you will believe that the

1498
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,400
system is maximizing

1499
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,520
the square value of y for example

1500
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,280
because it's diverging and what it's

1501
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,040
doing is just minimizing it because it's

1502
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,079
going to zero

1503
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,119
okay and so

1504
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,559
in principle if the if the dynamics of

1505
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,400
the most likely states and the

1506
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,760
and the average flow are different then

1507
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,559
uh yeah so they can they they are going

1508
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,000
to be in general difference and

1509
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,319
in that case they are not going to be

1510
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:23,520
informative what

1511
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,000
about the behavioral system except in

1512
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:26,559
various

1513
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,880
maybe very specific cases as mean field

1514
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,280
approximations or this kind of thing

1515
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,960
and and this difference is because the

1516
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,880
these marginal flows arise from a

1517
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,000
decoupling of a previous

1518
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,920
history of the system and they are not

1519
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,280
considering the effect

1520
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,319
of the effects of fluctuations and

1521
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:47,440
fluctuations okay

1522
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,440
and okay so just to finish and maybe

1523
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,319
let's give

1524
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,440
place to the discussion and

1525
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,640
when this work we explore the conditions

1526
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,680
to and the assumptions that are needed

1527
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,000
to

1528
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,280
derive the free energy principle in

1529
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,200
linear non-equilibrium stochastic

1530
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,040
systems and

1531
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,240
and some of this has been explored for

1532
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,200
specific

1533
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,079
counterexamples as a recent work by

1534
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,280
martin bill and

1535
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,559
others but i think it's interesting that

1536
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,079
we did this for a

1537
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,400
general class of systems so it's not one

1538
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,960
example that we saw numerically but we

1539
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,920
solve a family of weekly co systems and

1540
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:30,880
we see

1541
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,960
how general or not are the different

1542
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,160
assumptions

1543
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,640
and so first we explore that we explore

1544
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,440
how general

1545
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,520
are these conditions and assumptions of

1546
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,119
the principle

1547
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,520
and then we study under what conditions

1548
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,680
can we expect

1549
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,799
and the principle to be informative

1550
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,960
about the behavior of a system

1551
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,040
and first we found that the markov

1552
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,079
blanket condition

1553
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,319
emerged at least as a good

1554
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,079
approximations in the case of weak

1555
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,960
weak couplings but if the couplings are

1556
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,200
not super weak are not very weak

1557
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,440
then we maybe we cannot expect to be

1558
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,640
exact

1559
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,839
in yeah in general and

1560
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,680
however solenoidal couplings are

1561
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,520
generally present in all blocks of the

1562
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,040
system so

1563
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,520
so and they you are going to be serious

1564
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,200
in very very special cases as this

1565
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,720
symmetric loop

1566
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,839
so maybe a direction of two of the for

1567
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,599
the theory will be to

1568
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,599
yeah to explain exactly what happens

1569
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,200
when these these

1570
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,680
and coppers are not zero and and what

1571
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,640
yeah what

1572
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,079
happens in that case and

1573
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,240
and so in conclusion we see that only

1574
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,920
very specific structures are going to

1575
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,200
satisfy

1576
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,440
their requirements uh to derive the

1577
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,520
the to the right that the average flow

1578
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,200
is pointing in the direction of the free

1579
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,400
energy

1580
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,319
and the second point about how

1581
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,640
informative the principle is

1582
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,240
we saw that the connection between the

1583
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,400
free energy

1584
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,880
and the marginal flow of the system with

1585
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,559
the behave the actual behavior of a

1586
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:03,760
system is

1587
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,480
is in most cases very very weak or even

1588
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,400
contradictory as one can

1589
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,640
point in one direction and the other in

1590
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,680
the other

1591
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,079
so we found that this in general these

1592
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,079
marginal flows are not capturing the the

1593
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,079
actual dynamics of the system and

1594
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,000
and this is because the this marginal

1595
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,359
flow is ignoring the history of

1596
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:22,720
interactions and

1597
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,240
we could intuitively think about this

1598
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,559
so we will have a so we can imagine a

1599
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:29,440
system that

1600
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,760
has many trajectories and if we fix the

1601
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,520
blanket at some point

1602
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,680
it just means uh having different

1603
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,119
trajectories that are going to pass

1604
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,319
through this point

1605
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:41,040
and the average flow is just going to

1606
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,119
compute the directions or the direction

1607
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:43,680
of the

1608
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,760
most likely derivative at that point

1609
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,920
well the average derivative of the

1610
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,839
system at that point

1611
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,920
but an any individual system can have a

1612
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,599
very different behavior which is

1613
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,480
represented by black line here

1614
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,920
and so an intuitive example for this

1615
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,520
uh could be the uh to distinguish

1616
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,640
between the

1617
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:09,279
the population of an individual organism

1618
00:58:09,799 --> 00:58:11,440
organization and the world

1619
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,960
and the behavior of a population and so

1620
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,400
you could think that the

1621
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,839
on average uh a population of organisms

1622
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:20,480
is

1623
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,760
is behaving in a way that's maximizing

1624
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,520
evolutionary fitness

1625
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,280
but this can be largely an informative

1626
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,839
for describing the behavior of

1627
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,079
individual organisms not that some

1628
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,319
sometimes the kind of criticisms that we

1629
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:37,760
hear and

1630
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,839
to some proposals in a person

1631
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:41,520
evolutionary psychology and this kind of

1632
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,079
thing right

1633
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,440
so so even if i at an average macro

1634
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:45,920
level

1635
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,440
you can detect some tendencies in

1636
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,920
many cases these tendencies can be

1637
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,599
uninformative about

1638
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,559
what an individual is doing right and so

1639
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:57,599
so we think that it's

1640
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,880
interesting to to think about uh

1641
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,720
if and when and in which cases the

1642
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,119
the the conclusion the conclusions

1643
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:09,040
derived by the free energy principle are

1644
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,000
going to be

1645
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,040
informative about the behavior of

1646
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,599
an individual or or groups of

1647
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:19,440
individuals and so on

1648
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,040
still we we have to say that um

1649
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,480
even if we did this what kind of

1650
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,640
critical

1651
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:33,280
evaluation we are still we find that the

1652
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,680
the the motivation of the free energy

1653
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,640
principle is

1654
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,000
is very it's very suggestive and and

1655
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,880
we think that the the aim of connecting

1656
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,720
ideas from variational inference with

1657
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,000
the dynamics of complex

1658
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,160
self-organization system is tremendously

1659
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,119
important as

1660
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,920
it could allow to apply the machinery of

1661
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,160
magician and information theory

1662
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,480
to describe systems that are intractable

1663
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,079
in practice but

1664
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,400
but we also think that it's some how

1665
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,720
difficult to just write

1666
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,160
a theory and without a connection to

1667
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,040
specific models right that can allow you

1668
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:09,599
to

1669
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,280
to inspect in more detail some

1670
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,440
assumptions or some consequences of the

1671
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,240
assumptions that

1672
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,480
are difficult to grasp intuitively in

1673
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,079
many cases right

1674
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:21,520
and and so

1675
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,079
so in principle we find that the yeah

1676
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:27,119
that it will be interesting to

1677
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:29,520
yeah that exemplifying the steps of the

1678
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,520
theory in a specific model

1679
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,040
is very useful to to

1680
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,680
yeah it's very useful to understand the

1681
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,680
connections between steps and

1682
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,440
how likely or not are different steps

1683
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,599
and that this can this kind of exercise

1684
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:44,079
can be

1685
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:47,920
only useful too and yeah to to to do

1686
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,640
yeah it can be really useful to to and

1687
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,000
understand the kind of

1688
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,119
uh the difficulties that we face

1689
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,079
for even a theory and just one so this

1690
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:58,480
is the

1691
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,640
the preprint that we just published how

1692
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,160
particular is the physics of the free

1693
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,200
energy

1694
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,480
um thanks a lot

1695
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:10,160
thank you

1696
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,960
thanks for this awesome presentation

1697
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,839
there was

1698
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:16,799
a lot there and it was incredibly well

1699
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:18,000
presented

1700
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,240
so for those who are watching live i

1701
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,440
would invite them to

1702
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,400
write questions in the chat but first um

1703
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:25,359
chris

1704
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:28,640
i'll just pass it to you for an initial

1705
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,598
comments if you would like

1706
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,480
oh unmute then please continue

1707
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:38,720
wait chris you're admitted and then

1708
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,118
continue

1709
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,559
yeah so miguel that the we even though

1710
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,079
we we found these

1711
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,480
laws in a particular kind of technical

1712
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,480
presentation we've seen we still

1713
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,119
find that the kind of the the ambition

1714
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:53,760
of the

1715
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,000
uh uh free energy principle is laudable

1716
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,440
right and we're really it's something we

1717
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,599
really want to embrace but yet we feel

1718
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,359
that it needs uh some future

1719
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:04,079
development right so i mean i summarize

1720
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:05,280
there's two issues that

1721
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,400
miguel has presented here the first one

1722
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,280
is the problem about trying to

1723
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,039
characterize the interaction of an agent

1724
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,240
with its environment so you can do this

1725
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,280
in two ways

1726
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,440
and one typical way is to draw kind of

1727
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,960
connections and direct

1728
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,559
functional connections between an agent

1729
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,400
and environment right so the sensors and

1730
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,640
the motors and so on

1731
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,960
uh well there is a different way of

1732
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,319
understanding those interactions in

1733
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:29,200
terms of the

1734
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,440
testing or the covariance matrix which

1735
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,319
kind of describe correlation system

1736
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:36,240
rather than direct connections

1737
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,200
and i think what uh carl has done is

1738
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:39,760
kind of

1739
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,160
really work from the hessian upwards

1740
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,599
rather than considering

1741
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,359
the functional connections that underlie

1742
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:46,799
and underlie those two

1743
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:48,240
underlie those right so he wants to

1744
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,160
assume there is a markup blanket and

1745
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,680
wants to start there

1746
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,000
and and then he's not so concerned about

1747
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,599
trying to work out the class of systems

1748
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,200
that meets those conditions and i think

1749
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,480
that's a valid thing to do

1750
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,760
it might be a very special set of

1751
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,520
systems but i think carl will claim

1752
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,960
that's the kind of systems i'm

1753
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,640
interested in i'm not really interested

1754
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,319
in those other systems right and

1755
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:08,160
what we've pointed out is that we can't

1756
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,599
find those uh

1757
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,760
very generally in in the class of

1758
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,799
systems

1759
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:14,960
uh and the second major issue that i

1760
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,280
think uh miguel's work points out

1761
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,280
is this decoupling between the

1762
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,720
description of the deterministic

1763
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,680
dynamics

1764
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,680
of the system versus the average

1765
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,240
dynamics of an ensemble of systems right

1766
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,319
so in prior accounts of the free energy

1767
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:29,920
principle you actually write the

1768
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,839
deterministic dynamics into your

1769
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,680
description so when you're using for

1770
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,760
energy principle to do cognitive systems

1771
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,440
you are describing the certain

1772
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,280
deterministic dynamics directly

1773
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,799
in terms of your expectations and and uh

1774
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,200
and flows on your expectations but what

1775
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,640
the particular physics approach wants to

1776
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:47,520
do is try to

1777
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,599
try to find that deterministic dynamics

1778
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,440
within the physics right it wants to see

1779
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,240
where it

1780
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,400
where it would lie within the kind of

1781
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,160
general stochastic dynamical systems

1782
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,559
theories of physics and that's where the

1783
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,480
problems lie right so it's very hard to

1784
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,280
go from

1785
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,680
the the physics to the description in

1786
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,359
terms a good description of the system

1787
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:06,559
in terms of the kind of

1788
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:09,280
uh dynamics on expectations and and so

1789
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,400
on in that system

1790
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,280
so we find this problem of a decoupling

1791
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,000
between

1792
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,160
the description and the dynamics of the

1793
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,960
uh the the moments of a system versus

1794
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,960
the average over an ensemble of systems

1795
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,720
this is where where the problem lies

1796
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:23,280
right

1797
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,520
so the over ensemble systems the free

1798
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,880
energy might be a good description but

1799
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,000
it's not connected

1800
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,079
to the causal explanation of the

1801
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:31,920
dynamics of a specific system so you

1802
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,119
can't attribute

1803
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,520
kind of the uh the right kind of

1804
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,960
mechanistic description to that

1805
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,280
particular system that you would like to

1806
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,520
uh and yeah so i'm that's kind of my

1807
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,839
summary maybe

1808
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:45,760
thank you for the succinct summary

1809
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,319
that's very helpful for many i'm sure

1810
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,119
claren if you'd like to um unview sorry

1811
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:52,400
i heard a feedback when

1812
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,880
chris was speaking so if you can unmute

1813
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,000
or

1814
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,160
uh yep okay yeah introduce yourself and

1815
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,839
then give any comments you'd like and

1816
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,319
then i'll go to the questions

1817
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:04,720
yes bro so hi i'm ben i'm obviously an

1818
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,799
author on this and i'm currently now a

1819
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:08,240
postdoc in oxford but i worked very

1820
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,200
closely with

1821
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,520
uh chris and miguel at sussex for a long

1822
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,480
time

1823
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,640
so yeah also simon later had something

1824
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,240
else scheduling conflicts i just

1825
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,799
jumped in for the questions but yeah so

1826
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:19,440
i would just

1827
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,799
like i think chris did an excellent job

1828
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:22,559
of explaining the issue with the average

1829
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:23,359
dynamics

1830
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:25,599
versus the dynamics of the average but i

1831
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:26,880
would just like to go in and kind of

1832
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,760
reiterate to me

1833
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,039
an important thing about the markup

1834
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:31,039
blankets is really this idea that the

1835
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:31,599
markup

1836
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,760
there is a huge distinction between the

1837
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,039
sort of statistical independence

1838
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:36,160
relationships

1839
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,000
and this kind of like causal actual

1840
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,280
relationship you get if you write out

1841
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,480
the dynamics

1842
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,240
and so it's quite easy to confuse these

1843
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,680
two and indeed i think we

1844
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,280
we naturally conflated these two a lot

1845
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,240
until we started writing this paper

1846
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,079
and a lot of the literature also like

1847
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,280
conflates these two and you know they

1848
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,720
have these intuitive diagrams of you

1849
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,359
know like

1850
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:54,960
the bacteria with its cell wall and

1851
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,319
everything and that's the blanket and so

1852
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:56,720
forth

1853
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,119
but that's in this causal level of the

1854
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:00,640
description like in the things cause we

1855
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:01,599
have to pass through the blank but

1856
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,039
that's not the same at all

1857
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,119
as the statistical description which is

1858
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:06,960
you know the statistical independencies

1859
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,319
between you know the blanket and the

1860
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:10,079
intel and the external states and i

1861
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:10,720
think yeah

1862
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,240
it needs quite a lot of thinking about

1863
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,119
what extent these causal mappings

1864
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:18,319
actually hold up and sort of actually

1865
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:20,079
sustained by the statistical mappings or

1866
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:21,760
vice versa and we've found in linear

1867
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,119
systems there's a lot of cases

1868
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,400
where they don't and they don't seem to

1869
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,000
matter at all and so yeah it takes a lot

1870
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:26,559
of

1871
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,319
kind of different intuitions really i

1872
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:29,680
think need to be built about

1873
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,520
what these markup blankets mean and

1874
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,160
actuals will cause a level

1875
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,480
thanks for this comment and again people

1876
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,599
can write questions

1877
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,200
if i could just actually add something

1878
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,119
about the difference between the causal

1879
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:43,280
structure and the correlative structure

1880
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,319
you could imagine

1881
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,400
on a market there's companies that are

1882
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,000
causally related to each other but their

1883
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,880
stock prices

1884
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,000
are not correlated and similarly in the

1885
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,119
cell

1886
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:54,799
we often make networks that are based

1887
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:56,559
upon like gene co-expression

1888
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,559
so genes with correlated expression and

1889
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:00,559
then there's gene regulatory networks or

1890
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,400
protein protein interaction networks

1891
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,319
that are like proteins that touch but

1892
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,640
those proteins usually don't have

1893
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,559
correlated expression because you might

1894
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,079
up regulate one that then represses

1895
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:11,839
another so they're not expressed in a

1896
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:13,280
correlated fashion but they have causal

1897
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,319
relationships

1898
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:17,839
so and it's people slipping between oh

1899
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:19,280
gene regulatory network you know

1900
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,240
co-expression

1901
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,359
interactions certainly conflating

1902
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:26,160
the causal structure of a system with

1903
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,599
the physical structure or the

1904
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,200
correlative structure

1905
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,240
is a broad category error and i think

1906
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:32,880
your work

1907
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,599
does an incredible job at highlighting

1908
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:36,720
the difference

1909
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,119
and where slipping between these easily

1910
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:40,799
confusible modes of thinking about

1911
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:41,520
networks

1912
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,280
and then also conflating that with

1913
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,160
reality or all of reality

1914
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,440
just very well done to these points

1915
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,119
yeah thanks yeah another example would

1916
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,119
be like the difference between

1917
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:54,799
structural connectivity

1918
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:56,559
and functional connectivity and

1919
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:58,880
effective connectivity in in

1920
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,960
in the brain right you can have some

1921
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,559
structure but and then you can have

1922
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,240
statistical correlations but

1923
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,920
even then the dynamics can behave

1924
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,799
differently because you have like these

1925
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:11,599
asymmetries in in how one variable is

1926
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:12,799
connected to another and

1927
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:15,280
on the opposite end and this is also not

1928
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,040
work the relation with the solenoidal

1929
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,000
flows that

1930
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,399
capture something different than so yeah

1931
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:21,439
so it's

1932
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:24,158
you know very complicated to disentangle

1933
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:25,839
all these different levels and

1934
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:28,000
but you just justice to the office i

1935
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,120
mean i think they're aware of

1936
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,880
this difference obviously uh carl's

1937
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,560
group is very aware of this difference

1938
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,479
but they they feel that the theory sits

1939
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:36,238
above that right at the correlative

1940
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:38,158
structures and not considering

1941
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:40,479
uh those causal structures i think maybe

1942
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:42,000
some confusion might have emerged in

1943
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,080
previous papers but in recent papers i

1944
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,279
think it's very clear that they want to

1945
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:46,560
sit above

1946
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,000
the causal corrections cool

1947
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,040
so i hope that by bringing the math to

1948
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:56,319
examples of like the market evolution

1949
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:59,439
um and fmri we can hopefully have a lot

1950
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:00,319
of people

1951
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:01,920
giving their perspective so i'm gonna

1952
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,439
just go with a question from the chat

1953
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,040
and then i have some questions that i

1954
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,560
wrote down so uh first question

1955
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,880
thanks a lot i was wondering whether you

1956
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,759
would assume

1957
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:14,158
that going to non-linear systems the

1958
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:15,759
limitations that you find

1959
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:18,399
would be even stronger or would there

1960
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:19,759
may be an argument that there could be

1961
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:22,319
non-linear systems that fulfill these

1962
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,640
assumptions so what will relaxing the

1963
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,479
linear assumption do for the math that

1964
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:29,278
you described today

1965
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,158
okay well that's that's a difficult to

1966
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,399
to answer a question in general i think

1967
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:38,000
so

1968
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,719
so okay so so first is is i think it's

1969
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,238
it's difficult to well it's difficult to

1970
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:43,600
solve because

1971
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,880
uh in nonlinear systems in general

1972
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,279
we cannot find the kind of analytical

1973
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:50,960
solutions that we have here right and

1974
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,640
and even in the case of linear systems

1975
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,640
we found

1976
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,960
that we can only solve the case of weak

1977
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:57,920
copies

1978
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,960
and in the case of weak couplings

1979
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,000
we could do the trick of considering

1980
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,480
different orders of expansions

1981
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,199
and we saw that including stronger

1982
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:10,080
couplings make

1983
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,480
things more difficult rather than rather

1984
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,400
than easier

1985
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,719
okay and intuitively uh

1986
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:21,199
at least my intuition about non-linear

1987
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:22,320
systems is is that

1988
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,199
the case may be my may be similar in

1989
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:27,040
many systems right right

1990
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,080
having strong that yeah having

1991
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,360
more intricate couplings more intricate

1992
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,320
dynamical couplings could add

1993
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,760
extra turns uh to some of the matrices

1994
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,199
that we are expecting to

1995
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:44,080
be zero like in the markov blanket and

1996
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:44,640
but

1997
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,480
still this is not something we can say

1998
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,840
because or you will have

1999
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,880
i know unexpected effects from chaos for

2000
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,320
example and i think

2001
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:55,199
that's something that carl proposes

2002
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:56,239
sometimes

2003
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:59,040
and but i don't know i think maybe one

2004
01:10:59,040 --> 01:10:59,600
interesting

2005
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,880
direction of research will be doing

2006
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,199
a similar expansion to the one that we

2007
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:06,239
did

2008
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,239
to say okay we have an almost linear

2009
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:09,600
system but we consider

2010
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,159
very small effects of non-linearity and

2011
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:12,880
see

2012
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,320
what kind of terms this adds to the

2013
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,400
to the matrices that we are so this this

2014
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,760
could involve a very different

2015
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,280
analytical

2016
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,560
solution but i i think there is some up

2017
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,239
for coming work

2018
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:29,679
and from uh yeah from

2019
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:31,280
some people in cars working in that

2020
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,199
sense so so i think it's

2021
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:36,880
an open questions but but i intuitively

2022
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,199
think that in many cases this is going

2023
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:40,800
to be challenging to

2024
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,040
to continue yeah to see that

2025
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,320
non-linearity is going to

2026
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,760
be a solution um i mean you feel the

2027
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,040
intuition is that you might be able to

2028
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,080
solve it in specific

2029
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,280
systems uh but you know you start

2030
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,719
but the idea that you'll solve it in a

2031
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,719
classic non-linear system seems

2032
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:59,679
seems uh doubtful right but you might be

2033
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:00,800
able to find examples

2034
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,560
which you augment with nonlinearities

2035
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,920
that meet the criteria

2036
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,080
maybe if you constrain yourself to a

2037
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,080
particular evolved uh

2038
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,400
living system that might be okay right

2039
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,679
but if you want to say something

2040
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:13,120
more general about the emergency self

2041
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,880
organization in the classroom

2042
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,880
physical systems they perhaps run into

2043
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,199
trouble

2044
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,719
two thoughts yeah we'll go ahead and

2045
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:22,880
first

2046
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,000
yeah i agree with chris and that

2047
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,280
obviously with non-linear systems you

2048
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,120
have a much bigger space of systems

2049
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,560
and so you can probably find you know

2050
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,239
edge cases where all the conditions

2051
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:31,280
match perfectly

2052
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,719
but i mean the general intuition you

2053
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:34,800
dynamical systems is the non-linear

2054
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,480
systems are a lot harder to deal with

2055
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,880
in general and so i'm not going to

2056
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,640
probably you know if it's not satisfied

2057
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,080
in linear systems there's no obvious

2058
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,080
reason why it should be satisfied in

2059
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,280
non-linear systems

2060
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,640
and especially the issue with the the

2061
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,920
dynamics of the average versus the

2062
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,199
average of the dynamics

2063
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,400
like the case we did where you have a

2064
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,840
linear gaussian system is probably the

2065
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,440
ideal possible case for this

2066
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,640
because obviously the average is the

2067
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,960
linear operator and the for the gaussian

2068
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:57,440
case

2069
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,360
the mode and the actual average are the

2070
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,719
same and so you have all these nice

2071
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,239
properties none of which will hold

2072
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,400
in the nonlinear general case and so i

2073
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,320
think yeah in for that non-linear system

2074
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,679
is almost certainly going to be much

2075
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,679
much worse for that specific you know

2076
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:13,280
issue yeah also to to on that i think

2077
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:16,000
so so maybe so one question is is

2078
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:16,880
whether

2079
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,800
there is linear systems in which some of

2080
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,320
the problems are going to go away but

2081
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,520
maybe the

2082
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,360
the right question is what happens in

2083
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,199
the kind of non-linear systems that

2084
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:28,080
that we expect in living system right

2085
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:28,880
and

2086
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,520
and what we know from living systems

2087
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,440
often involves

2088
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:37,040
bifurcations or critical points that

2089
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,080
that lead to a long range correlations

2090
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,840
and correlations that

2091
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,159
that propagate through the whole system

2092
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:45,120
and

2093
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,800
and this kind of thing that can be very

2094
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,960
difficult so so the kind of

2095
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,560
isolation between internal and strong

2096
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,400
states can be i think can be

2097
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,520
challenging in in when this is the case

2098
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,440
right

2099
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:01,120
thanks for all these excellent points um

2100
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,360
in complexity we often talk about

2101
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,800
non-linear as being like

2102
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,280
non-elephant animals it's like all of

2103
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:07,920
them

2104
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,239
so it's even harder certainly to make a

2105
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:11,199
general

2106
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:13,280
stance and baron that was a really

2107
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,960
interesting point that as the state

2108
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,320
space of what's possible

2109
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,840
increases there may be more and more

2110
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,239
edge cases and that kind of brings it

2111
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:21,520
back to the question about

2112
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,239
evolved systems not every parameter

2113
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:25,920
combination of cells is going to be

2114
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:26,800
functional

2115
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,760
and so maybe we're only dealing with

2116
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,199
that vanishingly small

2117
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:33,360
amount or some other i'm not going to

2118
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,960
you know go into technical details

2119
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,480
on the fly but that could be one aspect

2120
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,360
and also it was such an interesting

2121
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,000
point during

2122
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,679
the discussion when you explicitly

2123
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,199
brought it back to evolution

2124
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,920
like fitness is the law of the land in a

2125
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:48,880
way

2126
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,080
at a level that doesn't explain motor

2127
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,040
behavior

2128
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,800
in the moment to moment their nested

2129
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,480
time scales and so of course there's

2130
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,080
motor behavior that's maladaptive and

2131
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,840
long run you wouldn't see that

2132
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,560
under stationary ecology and dot dot dot

2133
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,840
dot dot you start adding some

2134
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,280
assumptions in

2135
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,760
and it's just i think a very fruitful

2136
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,480
mapping

2137
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,760
that will be explored for time to come

2138
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,400
with the relationship between popular

2139
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,280
population

2140
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,520
level claims under stationary

2141
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,480
environments

2142
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,800
population level claims under dynamical

2143
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,560
environments and then individual level

2144
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,440
claims

2145
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,360
under stationary and and changing

2146
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,040
environments so it's just a lot of

2147
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:27,920
topics that come

2148
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,280
into play and to have them

2149
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:34,239
integrate these kinds of um points that

2150
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:35,199
you're raising

2151
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,520
which are often implicit errors in other

2152
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,400
areas

2153
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,239
they're being drawn together and brought

2154
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:42,320
to the forefront in a way that is

2155
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,580
quite novel

2156
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:45,840
[Music]

2157
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,480
okay again since the technical details i

2158
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,040
believe

2159
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,199
stand best in the presentation as you

2160
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,199
provided as well as in the paper

2161
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,040
we can take any questions but i think

2162
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,640
that will be the place where

2163
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,120
the discussion continues i just kind of

2164
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,480
wanted to ask a few other

2165
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,600
questions to provide a little context so

2166
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,840
for maybe whoever wants to answer how

2167
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,520
did you come to be studying

2168
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,159
the question this way were you working

2169
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:11,199
with the fep

2170
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,080
and exploring new kinds of math or did

2171
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:14,560
you

2172
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,480
have more of experience with the

2173
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,880
mathematics and then see the fep

2174
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,040
coming up onto the radar like how did um

2175
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,159
each of you come to be

2176
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:25,360
working on it this way okay

2177
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:29,280
yeah i'll go because i think i'll go

2178
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,000
over so i mean i i wrote a review a few

2179
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:32,880
years ago now

2180
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,440
of the original energy principle at that

2181
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,239
time it was

2182
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:38,960
it was quite an enigmatic uh principle

2183
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:39,840
not many people

2184
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,440
understood it i mean the reason i

2185
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,800
originally i didn't like it i didn't

2186
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,239
like the idea

2187
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:46,159
of the notion of representation seems to

2188
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:47,440
be pregnant in the idea of the free

2189
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,080
energy principle

2190
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,239
kind of representing uh generative

2191
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:51,360
models but i

2192
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,640
actually came to like it's a cognitive

2193
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,480
framework and i still do like it as a

2194
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,199
as a cognitive framework uh and i still

2195
01:16:57,199 --> 01:16:58,800
still think within the regime

2196
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,719
of describing essentially motor loops

2197
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:02,480
abstract sensing

2198
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,920
and cognitive systems it's very very

2199
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,159
useful but then obviously then there's

2200
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:07,440
been a rapid development of the free

2201
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,040
energy principle into

2202
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,920
uh into into a grander claim right to

2203
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:12,719
find

2204
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:15,120
this principle in the in physics in a

2205
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,000
class of

2206
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,080
physical systems uh and that's where

2207
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,000
kind of i started working with miguel

2208
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,159
and gail's got a real strong background

2209
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:24,239
in statistical physics and that's

2210
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,840
basically what's led us to this to kind

2211
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,120
of really go back to some of those

2212
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:27,760
assumptions

2213
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,000
so i do separate the two things i think

2214
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,199
there's the

2215
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,840
still i'm very fine the the cognitive

2216
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,120
account very appealing

2217
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,560
even though we found these problems in

2218
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,480
the in in these physics

2219
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,120
uh examples

2220
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:45,280
yeah yeah i all the uh

2221
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,280
well i for like yeah for some i think

2222
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,560
medium

2223
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,719
i started doing involved with the the

2224
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,920
principle more

2225
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,719
recently i yeah for sometimes that is

2226
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:57,120
something that i had on the radar but

2227
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,159
but actually understand it what it

2228
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:03,280
meant like it's always seen seemed kind

2229
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:03,520
of

2230
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,679
scary and challenging you know like the

2231
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:06,960
equations and

2232
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,760
and i guess that part of the motivation

2233
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:10,159
for

2234
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:13,440
doing or doing this work is is it was

2235
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,239
to as a way of understanding what what

2236
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:18,640
the theory consisted of because

2237
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,320
you could go through the mathematical

2238
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:21,679
descriptions and it's

2239
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:24,719
often really hard to know and

2240
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:27,120
what what they imply or what they mean

2241
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:27,920
exactly

2242
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,600
in the in the sense that they are

2243
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,360
complicated maths right

2244
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:34,640
and i guess that the the

2245
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,600
during my research career that the way i

2246
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:38,400
have

2247
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,840
i have a hat for for understanding

2248
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,040
complicated masses

2249
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,360
by building models and this

2250
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,360
understanding by building

2251
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,159
philosophy that i so so i think that the

2252
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:51,040
initial

2253
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,679
attempts to to build this system it was

2254
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:54,880
an attempt to

2255
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,280
to really understand okay this step i

2256
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,320
can for us

2257
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,600
mathematically more or less what it

2258
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,480
means but but let's have a model and

2259
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,320
change parameters and play with it and

2260
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,360
and so on right um so

2261
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,600
so that was more or less the the journey

2262
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,480
that and

2263
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,480
and once having that first having the

2264
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,719
model then say okay can i have something

2265
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:15,840
more general

2266
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,400
than just a some specific parameter so

2267
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,280
let's

2268
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,199
try let's see how we can have an

2269
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:22,960
analytical solution i mean

2270
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,679
and so on so so yeah so i think yeah

2271
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:26,000
this

2272
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,360
exercise is very fruitful both on a

2273
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,360
personal level and also on a scientific

2274
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,040
level because you can

2275
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,360
on your way to learning you can develop

2276
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,880
things that can be useful for the

2277
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,159
theory more in general

2278
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:43,360
awesome thank you for those answers

2279
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,719
and also and i was just getting a

2280
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:47,120
feedback right now from you

2281
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,960
miguel so just mute while baron gives a

2282
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,920
yeah okay go ahead yeah i just want to

2283
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,360
follow up on the girl's point really

2284
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,800
about just the importance of actually

2285
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,480
trying to build these models

2286
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,400
because i think from my perspective a

2287
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,000
lot of developments and problems we

2288
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,679
discovered basically came from

2289
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:05,520
actually looking at specific models and

2290
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,960
thinking hey this this doesn't quite

2291
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,000
work out

2292
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,080
as it says it should you know hey

2293
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,199
because basically things have just

2294
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:12,639
become an awful lot more clearer if you

2295
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:13,679
actually try and build them

2296
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:15,120
rather than just staring at these sort

2297
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,040
of symbols on the page

2298
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,639
and say i think that's really the key to

2299
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:20,480
it to a lot of it you're simply trying

2300
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,920
to construct a system where this works

2301
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:22,880
and then say hey you know

2302
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,400
if things aren't going quite as you know

2303
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,480
the particular physics monograph says

2304
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:30,159
they should be cool and it's so

2305
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,080
interesting and maybe even appropriate

2306
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,199
that action

2307
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:36,320
became relevant for this inference

2308
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,120
problem

2309
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,360
so it's not just conceptual because we

2310
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,320
must

2311
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,480
be engaging in the literature and

2312
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,080
conversation in the work

2313
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,960
and going through it ourselves in order

2314
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:47,760
to infer

2315
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,560
deeper we can't just wait at square one

2316
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,920
and look all the way to square one

2317
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,120
thousand we have to be

2318
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,199
working along the way individually and

2319
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:56,560
maybe as a group too

2320
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,040
so here's a question from the chat

2321
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,320
brilliant talk

2322
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:03,040
wonder if carl and others will respond

2323
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,120
to challenges presented in this paper

2324
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,440
also because the paper is written in

2325
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,199
such coherent style

2326
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:11,120
wonder what would you recommend for

2327
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,159
beginners to study in the fep nice

2328
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,480
question

2329
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:22,480
what do you wish you knew at the outset

2330
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,080
even if it's a new resource

2331
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,719
what courses or topics would you

2332
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:27,360
recommend

2333
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,000
having a familiarity with or what are

2334
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,239
the on-ramps for somebody who's not in

2335
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:32,639
this

2336
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:35,120
area of research and practice how can

2337
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,159
they best be

2338
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:39,520
on ramping themselves so i recommend

2339
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,679
baron's github he's got a nice

2340
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:43,360
repository of papers

2341
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,440
uh which go from uh very introductory

2342
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,040
papers to very sophisticated papers in

2343
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,400
nicely organized ways i don't know if

2344
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,000
you want to provide that

2345
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,600
is it public publicly accessible

2346
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,080
oh yeah publicly yeah i could post that

2347
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,600
in the chat or something if you want

2348
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,440
yeah say hello in the youtube chat and

2349
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,880
then i'll make you a moderator and you

2350
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:01,520
can post

2351
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:05,199
links so yeah yeah

2352
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:08,960
so then continue on that

2353
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,639
yeah i mean regarding the actual

2354
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,159
question about what to sort of start

2355
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:13,840
with i think that depends a lot on what

2356
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,960
you want to do

2357
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,280
so there's kind of three big separate

2358
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,560
topics in my mind

2359
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,400
is that sort of the fep there's a

2360
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,920
hardcore maths of the theory

2361
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,239
as is presented in particular physics

2362
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,199
and for that

2363
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,120
i'm not sure there is necessarily a good

2364
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,440
beginner's level resource at this point

2365
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,920
like there is essentially i mean our

2366
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,120
paper tries to go through quite

2367
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,719
straightforwardly and then they have

2368
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:36,719
you have the thomas par markup blankets

2369
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:38,560
and stochastic thermodynamics paper

2370
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,239
which sort of covers the main points but

2371
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:42,159
it's not like a tutorial kendrick states

2372
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:43,600
like this is xyz

2373
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:44,960
and then really it's just the particular

2374
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,800
physics monograph is where

2375
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,239
most of that information is like there

2376
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:50,159
isn't yet a really nice

2377
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:51,679
laying out of it and obviously we kind

2378
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:52,880
of try and do that in our paper but

2379
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:53,440
obviously

2380
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,440
we're also focused on the actual points

2381
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,560
you want to make it's not just like

2382
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,159
specifically tutorial

2383
01:22:58,159 --> 01:22:59,360
yeah i mean the other two things

2384
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,719
obviously the active influence sort of

2385
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:02,560
discrete database active inference

2386
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,560
that people talk a lot about i think the

2387
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,000
best resource for that at the moment is

2388
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,520
probably landslide the caster's

2389
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:10,560
review on that and then there's yeah

2390
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,000
just then essentially there's some

2391
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:12,560
several

2392
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,000
of carl's papers which i think i talked

2393
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,199
about in my github repository which is

2394
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:15,840
kind of

2395
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,280
going into more detail but lance's

2396
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,120
review for that is really good and then

2397
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,880
there's a sort of more continuous

2398
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,040
state space predictive coding style

2399
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,440
which i think i still i think chris's

2400
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,159
his 2017 review is is the best for that

2401
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:29,760
to be honest

2402
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:35,840
so yeah

2403
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:38,639
yeah i think chris is one is the one if

2404
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,000
you wanted to understand the whole

2405
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,520
the theory and all the math of the whole

2406
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,360
walks through very nicely where profiles

2407
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,639
like if you want to build a predictive

2408
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:46,639
coding network which works and you

2409
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:49,120
have that

2410
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:52,320
is the way to go

2411
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,560
if i can ask one note before miguel's

2412
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,480
answer when you said newer science

2413
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,679
do you see them as just historically

2414
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:02,239
juxtaposed or do you see some of these

2415
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:02,800
approaches

2416
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,960
as encompassing one another or being

2417
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,159
prerequisite to one another

2418
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:11,280
so i think the idea is that the sort of

2419
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,440
fep in the particular physics monograph

2420
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,320
encompasses

2421
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,120
all of them in that there you know the

2422
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,639
idea is that these are just specific

2423
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:20,159
models you know you have a spec have a

2424
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:21,920
specific variation identity specific

2425
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:22,960
generative model and then you work

2426
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,560
through the math and you get these

2427
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,159
these protest theories as carl calls

2428
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:27,840
them out i mean i think in practice

2429
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,600
though they stand they can stand alone

2430
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,280
away from whatever the particular

2431
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,880
physics monograph says because they

2432
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,000
obviously make you know empirical

2433
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:34,880
predictions about

2434
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,800
the brain or whatever and so you can

2435
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,239
actually test these and

2436
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,400
so even if all all particular physics is

2437
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,920
wrong then these things could be right

2438
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:42,719
and vice versa

2439
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,080
if all particular physics is perfectly

2440
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,679
right and these things could just not be

2441
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:46,719
what the brain is doing it could be

2442
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:47,840
doing something else

2443
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,520
so yeah i think they stand alone

2444
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,040
although in theory the particular

2445
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,320
physics monograph is kind of meant to

2446
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,560
subsume them all

2447
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,719
thanks for that response and miguel to

2448
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:58,159
the original question

2449
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,400
what would you recommend a beginner to

2450
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,360
be learning

2451
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,960
and looking into uh yeah i'm not so

2452
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:05,600
sorry

2453
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,120
for me so i think

2454
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:12,239
yeah i started with thomas bar paper

2455
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:13,280
about

2456
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,280
markov blankets and promising geometry

2457
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,719
and then

2458
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:20,159
going back to the to the monograph of a

2459
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:21,840
particular physics and

2460
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,520
and but but it was

2461
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,920
it was challenging because yeah it's

2462
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,120
like there's

2463
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:32,159
the maths are complex and and yeah it

2464
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:32,719
was

2465
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:35,920
and i kind of liked it was useful to uh

2466
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,159
martin bill's paper a technical critical

2467
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:39,360
of different

2468
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,080
uh yeah of the free energy principle in

2469
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:42,639
the sense

2470
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:45,360
it was very technical and formal but it

2471
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,480
was useful

2472
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,800
that they tried to encapsulate the

2473
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,719
different conditions

2474
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:52,800
in a way similar to what we do here and

2475
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,000
i think that was helpful

2476
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,800
to try to to differentiate different the

2477
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:57,199
different

2478
01:25:57,199 --> 01:26:00,239
steps which are not always so clear in

2479
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:00,719
the

2480
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:04,000
in the literature so so yeah i think

2481
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,159
yeah i think there is at least for the

2482
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:08,400
part regarding the free energy principle

2483
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:08,880
as

2484
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,840
described in the in in a particular

2485
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,120
physics it's

2486
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,679
and yeah we need maybe better tutorials

2487
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:16,480
and

2488
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,560
better yeah more materials that are

2489
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,760
focused to

2490
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:23,360
us introductions here thanks for these

2491
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:24,159
responses

2492
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:28,000
and i know in our acting lab and in many

2493
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,840
other associated efforts that

2494
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,239
the focus on accessibility and

2495
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:33,679
communicating these

2496
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:35,440
ideas in a way that's going gonna be

2497
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,440
helpful to people from many backgrounds

2498
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,880
is a top priority so way back in the

2499
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:43,840
introduction you know 120 time steps ago

2500
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,960
you talked about new visualizations and

2501
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,400
it's definitely the case that

2502
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,480
paper after paper will use some

2503
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:51,440
classical

2504
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,480
figures um let's just say and

2505
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,880
i'm excited by visualizations and so was

2506
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:57,760
curious

2507
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,880
just maybe whoever wants to go in for it

2508
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:04,080
what would the new representations do or

2509
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:04,960
be

2510
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,480
communicate what style or what made you

2511
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,440
just wanting to explore visually and how

2512
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:14,879
is that in feedback with the research

2513
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,560
okay yeah i think that's interesting i

2514
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,159
like at some point i keep looking

2515
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:21,600
through the literature and it's

2516
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,920
paper after paper the same the same

2517
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:24,960
graph about the

2518
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,560
brain sensor motor logo and so on

2519
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,520
and yes sir so at some point it stops

2520
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,080
being

2521
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,719
useful right there because the like some

2522
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:36,960
like its visualization can give

2523
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,280
unique intuitions to some extent right

2524
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,239
and

2525
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:43,600
so and at some point i uh yeah

2526
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,920
i wanted to know more about so so it was

2527
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,719
not

2528
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:48,400
it's not always straightforward okay

2529
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:49,760
there's an arrow but what

2530
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,440
does it mean or why is this

2531
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,960
bi-directional or

2532
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:56,000
and and yeah part so so the the

2533
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:56,719
different

2534
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:59,600
figures that we have where we developed

2535
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,880
them with the idea of

2536
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:03,920
okay how can we intuitively and

2537
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:07,199
ex express these very complex uh

2538
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:10,239
assumptions and ask how do you

2539
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,320
have a figure of a solenoidal flow all

2540
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,280
right

2541
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,880
um this is really challenging and i

2542
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,400
think i i i don't

2543
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,320
i'm not sure if we did a good job there

2544
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,920
but i think it's

2545
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,960
in no that i think many intuitions about

2546
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,120
the free energy principle are are really

2547
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,320
hard to capture

2548
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:29,040
because they are quite complex and i

2549
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,880
think it's interesting to try to put in

2550
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,239
the directions of

2551
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:34,800
of having new images that try to at

2552
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,159
least try to capture that

2553
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:38,320
that intuitions and and what do they

2554
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,239
mean or how to

2555
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:43,520
yeah yeah because often i think you have

2556
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,480
to

2557
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,360
to read the theory based on your

2558
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,520
intuition or covering with intuitions

2559
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,280
the part that you don't understand yet

2560
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,719
especially if you're learning and

2561
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:54,960
this kind of thing i think is incredibly

2562
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:58,880
useful in general in science right

2563
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,679
chris or baron would you like to add on

2564
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:03,199
that point

2565
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:05,120
uh no i mean i just that we found it

2566
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,639
hard right i mean

2567
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:08,400
because there is some these so many

2568
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,400
different types of interactions we want

2569
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,920
to represent i mean typically

2570
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,719
monolithic arrows between agent and

2571
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:16,560
environment seems to dominate everything

2572
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,080
right but when you start drilling down

2573
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:18,800
into this

2574
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,239
you have the difference between causal

2575
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:22,239
and functional obviously people like

2576
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:24,000
pearl and stuff i've done this in the

2577
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,440
philosophy right they've been very clear

2578
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,800
about different types of interaction but

2579
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:27,600
i think in

2580
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,320
uh especially modeling work it's it's

2581
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:30,880
become

2582
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,440
a bit uh clouded in lots of locations

2583
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,960
especially in the area of the free

2584
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:35,920
energy principle

2585
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,920
but yeah i don't know whether uh i think

2586
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,920
miguel did a really good job but

2587
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:42,080
it does look complicated the the final

2588
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,920
product is complicated looking right but

2589
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,560
it does do justice uh to these different

2590
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:47,920
types of interaction

2591
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:51,360
yeah baron anything on that or no

2592
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,840
yeah go for it yeah no i i would just

2593
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:54,639
say that

2594
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,480
i agree like i'm not naturally a visual

2595
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,080
person who actually looks at the figures

2596
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:58,639
but

2597
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:00,800
i think just what miguel did was

2598
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:01,760
actually really good and it's

2599
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,040
something that if you actually look at

2600
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,880
them and try and understand them it will

2601
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,800
yield a lot of dividends in terms of

2602
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,639
quickly getting to grasp on precisely

2603
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:10,639
what's being said what's not being said

2604
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:11,760
because yeah it's very easy to have into

2605
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,679
this sort of hazy interaction without

2606
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:14,239
knowing

2607
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:17,840
what that really means it's the same

2608
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,520
again as a geneticist it makes me think

2609
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,679
of oh you know nodes are genes and edges

2610
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:23,040
are interactions

2611
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:26,080
which kind of those multiple classes and

2612
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,400
does one paper use it one way and go to

2613
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,000
the methods and it's one way in this

2614
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,520
paper and it's another one in another

2615
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:32,480
way but it's

2616
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,400
being cited and so it takes a lot of

2617
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,639
subtlety to pull back to that question

2618
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:38,719
about what kind of interactions

2619
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:41,199
are being discussed and then chris what

2620
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:42,719
you just said there's like

2621
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:46,159
um it's a high praise

2622
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:48,239
for the work that it does justice

2623
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:49,679
because that's what we

2624
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:53,520
hope the bleeding edge does for the rest

2625
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,760
of the knife and the handle is represent

2626
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,080
visually on a manifold that doesn't

2627
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,120
deceive

2628
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:04,239
it's not drawing hard lines where none

2629
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:05,120
exists

2630
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:08,080
it's not making false positive or false

2631
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,199
negatives or

2632
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:11,600
false claims visually because visual

2633
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,239
rhetoric

2634
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:14,960
is how many people will learn and think

2635
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,320
about these things

2636
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,239
and so that's all it makes all the

2637
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:19,199
difference whether there's a

2638
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:20,639
bi-directional arrow

2639
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:23,600
graphically or not because people are

2640
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,199
going to unpack it especially if they're

2641
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:26,800
not going to go into the

2642
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,480
nth level of math they're going to

2643
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,320
unpack it literally

2644
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,000
and with the knowledge that that's what

2645
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,520
the expert represented

2646
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:36,800
in their um aim so yeah i really do

2647
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,239
think it's particularly important

2648
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:39,440
for this field because there is a

2649
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,679
separation between this technical morass

2650
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:43,600
that sits at the bottom

2651
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,280
and obviously the the ambition and what

2652
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,960
it promises so so many people are

2653
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:47,760
attracted

2654
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,840
to this particular theory and then but

2655
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:53,040
not not everyone's got time to go in and

2656
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,120
decipher that so that there's looking at

2657
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,639
the level of these figures

2658
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:58,000
and and trying to make you know

2659
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,679
discourse and so on at that level so

2660
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:00,159
it's

2661
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:02,639
vital that those figures become very

2662
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:03,840
clear and very

2663
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:04,960
pointed in what they tried to

2664
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,960
communicate and any kind of

2665
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:08,960
lack of clarity is just going to send

2666
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,239
the whole community off in the wrong

2667
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:11,679
direction particularly if you

2668
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:12,800
you're not the kind of person who wants

2669
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,159
to go in and do the statistical physics

2670
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:14,880
you want to do

2671
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:17,760
more of the philosophy or or cognitive

2672
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,520
science of these systems so it's vital

2673
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,400
that we get them right

2674
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:21,760
in this particular field particularly i

2675
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,920
think yes

2676
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,800
it's uh i think there's an xkcd cartoon

2677
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,080
you know about where the fields are

2678
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:28,960
arranged

2679
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,639
but especially when working with the

2680
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:32,080
theory itself

2681
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:35,280
it should be lean and as

2682
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,440
low dimensional as possible and not

2683
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,560
anymore

2684
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,800
because otherwise it will be unpacked in

2685
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,000
ways that are just going to be

2686
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,280
completely discordant

2687
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:45,120
but if it can be represented in sort of

2688
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,320
like a build in

2689
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,639
or like an opt-in at this level instead

2690
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:50,239
of trying to explain backwards from what

2691
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:51,440
we could do in the future

2692
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:54,080
in the math we need to start with the

2693
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:56,719
axioms and clarify what they are

2694
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:59,120
and then unpack those and then it's like

2695
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,800
just like with any other area of theory

2696
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,960
did you disagree with the axioms or did

2697
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,880
you disagree with how they were applied

2698
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,560
because those are the areas where

2699
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:08,960
there's sort of controlled space

2700
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,360
for discussion but then something like i

2701
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:12,880
don't think it would work that way

2702
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,280
in a human computer interface it's it's

2703
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,960
neither here nor there

2704
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,199
for the level of rigor that you approach

2705
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:23,839
the questions with today

2706
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:28,400
um so i can ask any other questions or

2707
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:29,440
we can see if anyone else

2708
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,880
posts in the chat but that was actually

2709
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,880
one of my questions was are those all

2710
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,080
the axioms

2711
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,560
how do we represent axioms or how do we

2712
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:37,600
even know

2713
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,000
what those axioms are without getting

2714
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,760
into like too much of a whole you know

2715
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,639
incompleteness thing what are the axioms

2716
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:46,239
were they what you put in a paper and

2717
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:47,199
nothing else

2718
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:48,800
those are necessary insufficient or is

2719
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,880
there some other stuff happening

2720
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,560
actually it's our ambition just to say

2721
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,080
before i think i'll let michelle answer

2722
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:54,800
that but

2723
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,639
the the we have an ambition to write a

2724
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:58,320
kind of more accessible version of this

2725
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:58,880
paper

2726
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,400
which hopefully we done in the next few

2727
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,000
months so we want to do exactly that we

2728
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,600
want to draw away from the

2729
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,120
heart statistical physics and have this

2730
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,639
paper underneath it but

2731
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:09,760
then even be more even more clear

2732
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,840
about the kind of overall narrative of

2733
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,360
what we're suggesting here

2734
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,280
uh and we'll we can answer those

2735
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:16,560
questions that you asked very directly

2736
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:17,600
hopefully but

2737
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,679
for the specific case i'll let miguel uh

2738
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:22,000
answer

2739
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,800
up on you and then continue thank you

2740
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:32,719
yeah yeah

2741
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:34,400
yeah i think that the the pre-energy

2742
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,320
principle is um no it has been an

2743
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:37,120
evolving

2744
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,440
theory and there is different versions

2745
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:40,560
of eating

2746
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,560
through the different papers in the 10

2747
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,719
years that it has been

2748
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:48,480
been proposed propulsion and

2749
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:51,600
at least for me it was uh uh a difficult

2750
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,119
job to to try to

2751
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:55,600
get to to someone to summarize the

2752
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,000
theory in that way or to

2753
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,159
have the exact connections of steps

2754
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:01,679
because also sometimes

2755
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:04,880
the some descriptions are verbal but uh

2756
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,080
and yeah i think that's yeah that's uh

2757
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,639
important yeah an important avenue for

2758
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:11,840
continuing

2759
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:15,040
the research in this field is try to to

2760
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,119
do more accessible

2761
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:20,239
descriptions or more or try to

2762
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:23,920
encapsulate them in in this way or try

2763
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:24,639
to yeah

2764
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:27,360
to solve this sequence more clearly or

2765
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,000
at least for

2766
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,840
an introductory purpose right yeah it's

2767
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,920
been it's been very much a very uh

2768
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:33,600
a living theory the french people i

2769
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,199
found this when i wrote the

2770
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:37,040
review back in the day which is that

2771
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,400
there is this development that's very

2772
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,679
clear in the uh

2773
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:41,520
in the series of publications that comes

2774
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,199
out and i think things

2775
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:46,159
things have changed obviously as the as

2776
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:47,280
they develop so

2777
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:49,679
trying to see the consistency across

2778
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:50,960
those types of things

2779
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,719
um which is the fundamental action which

2780
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:54,880
is later introduced and so on

2781
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,639
is very difficult actually and again i

2782
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,239
don't think it's a i don't i don't

2783
01:35:58,239 --> 01:35:59,520
criticize the office of this because i

2784
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:00,639
think it is a living theory it's

2785
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:02,320
something that's kind of really evolved

2786
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,679
in the literature it's very complex one

2787
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:05,920
so it had to be like that but yeah

2788
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,840
hopefully as we go forward in the next

2789
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,239
few years we can become more clear about

2790
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:11,760
uh these things and we'll be more and

2791
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,199
more people doing reviews and more

2792
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:14,639
critical evaluations like

2793
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:17,520
miguel's done which will will you know

2794
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,800
further ground

2795
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,960
uh this theory in a place where we can

2796
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:24,960
all agree on and agree on the axioms

2797
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:29,199
baron and then miguel okay yeah i just

2798
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:30,000
want to say that yeah we should

2799
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,199
definitely not consider

2800
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:33,040
all the axioms and the free energy

2801
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,560
principle at the moment to be completely

2802
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,840
sort of fixed in stone

2803
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,360
like i feel this is still living and

2804
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,440
still evolving in many ways and there's

2805
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,400
you know some cases where there's

2806
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:41,760
questions about do we actually need this

2807
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:42,320
axiom

2808
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,679
can it be more general than this can it

2809
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:45,760
be less general than this and stuff so i

2810
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:46,960
think there's going to be a lot of more

2811
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,320
foundational discussion

2812
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,159
around the actual axioms underlying it

2813
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:52,400
so and you know now the people are just

2814
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:53,920
really just starting to tackle in a

2815
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:55,920
particular physics in a really deep way

2816
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,199
that i think that there will over the

2817
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:58,480
next few years be lots of discussion

2818
01:36:58,480 --> 01:36:59,679
about this and hopefully

2819
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:00,960
in a couple of years we'll have a much

2820
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,199
more precise statement of you know what

2821
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:04,880
the fop says what is needed

2822
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,040
what isn't needed and you know how

2823
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:08,159
everything fits together but at the

2824
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:09,040
moment it's still in

2825
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:11,520
a fair bit of flux like because really

2826
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:12,239
deep critique

2827
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:13,840
outside of karl's group on particular

2828
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,119
physics is kind of just really starting

2829
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:17,520
in the last year or so

2830
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:20,400
thanks for that miguel yeah yes i also

2831
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,000
always want to add that

2832
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,760
okay so so we focus on on the free

2833
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,280
energy principle and and this claim that

2834
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,119
dynamical systems or self-progressing

2835
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:30,880
systems behave as minimizing the primary

2836
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,159
but i think that's

2837
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:34,320
only yeah one part of the universe of

2838
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,360
the

2839
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,119
clearance investment you have the active

2840
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:38,480
inference you have

2841
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,560
the design of systems that explicitly

2842
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,000
minimize the free energy and that's a

2843
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,679
completely different field and

2844
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:45,920
and often this is also mixed and not

2845
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:46,800
sure

2846
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,440
and yeah and there's sometimes a mix

2847
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:50,080
between

2848
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,400
so which is the the actions that i

2849
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,880
invented in specifically papers no but

2850
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,719
where are you where you are sitting in

2851
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:58,639
your work is not always

2852
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:00,840
clear for for anyone because of this

2853
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,960
evolving

2854
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,040
this evolution of the theory and these

2855
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:06,639
interconnections and so on

2856
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:10,159
and but i i think that yeah like uh

2857
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:12,000
becoming more mature as they feel

2858
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,600
becomes more mature this will be clear

2859
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:14,880
because

2860
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,280
sometimes this leads to confusion about

2861
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,920
what the theory means no uh

2862
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,679
when people say okay the free energy

2863
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:23,360
principle shows that the every living

2864
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,360
system is minimizing print oh okay

2865
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:29,679
but um it's yeah so so it's different

2866
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:30,719
when you

2867
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:33,600
think of agents that do do it by by

2868
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,239
design

2869
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:36,480
or when you try to extend the claim to

2870
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,239
other systems

2871
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:40,080
so there is these different points of

2872
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,840
view and these different sides of the

2873
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,360
theory that

2874
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:46,400
that yeah i i hope yeah i imagine that

2875
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,119
they are going to evolve into more

2876
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:53,520
comparative corpora compartmentalize

2877
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:56,320
or even if they are interconnected but

2878
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:57,920
in a way that they earthly area the

2879
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,840
borders of the different planes and so

2880
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,119
on

2881
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:04,719
it's going to be uh an fep metaverse

2882
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:07,440
that is appropriate for the online age

2883
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:08,320
honestly

2884
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,560
because when i think about how the

2885
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,719
needle was pushed here github

2886
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:14,960
and interactive computational notebooks

2887
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,040
pre-prints like yours

2888
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,639
live streams like the one that we're on

2889
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:20,239
a discord server

2890
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:21,679
you know a reading group that was

2891
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:24,239
arranged by maxwell and others

2892
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:26,239
10 years ago 20 years ago it would have

2893
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:28,080
been like what

2894
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,360
and it certainly wouldn't have been

2895
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,280
accessible globally

2896
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:34,239
so to see how the material and the

2897
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:36,000
informational culture

2898
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,040
and also social culture is changing

2899
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,280
in a time when participatory science and

2900
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:42,960
open science and all these kinds of

2901
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,400
transdisciplinary

2902
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,600
ideas are coming to the fore

2903
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:51,360
it's just an awesome contribution so

2904
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,840
um i'll offer any final thoughts from

2905
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:55,840
the chat and each of you a final

2906
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,639
um word but just to say from the lab

2907
01:39:58,639 --> 01:39:59,520
that we really

2908
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,520
appreciate your willingness to you know

2909
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,119
jump on on short notice

2910
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:05,280
and work on it and share it in this way

2911
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,280
and also with these exciting

2912
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:08,960
directions that you've planned out and

2913
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:11,440
expect

2914
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,239
i'm actually going to say i completely

2915
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:15,440
agree with you and i have to you know

2916
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,119
shout out to people like maxwell ramstad

2917
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:17,679
who

2918
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:19,360
organized these discord servers which

2919
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:20,800
are you know really

2920
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:23,040
promulgating this debate uh and why

2921
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,639
communities which are really valuable

2922
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:25,280
for

2923
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,280
uh as infrastructure for us people like

2924
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,400
us to come in and do this type of

2925
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:29,360
research so yeah

2926
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,280
i completely agree with that this this

2927
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:32,480
new infrastructure there is really

2928
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:35,520
important for this type of stuff

2929
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:38,239
aaron any last comments and then miguel

2930
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:38,880
of course yeah

2931
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:41,679
final word you know i just want to echo

2932
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:42,960
what chris said really about just

2933
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,400
the sheer importance of the reading

2934
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,320
group max were organized because i think

2935
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,360
that's where you know i

2936
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,560
i learned an awful lot about how

2937
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:50,239
particular physics works and you know

2938
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:50,560
how

2939
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,920
everything goes through in that

2940
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:53,600
monograph and i think a lot of people

2941
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:55,280
did there as well like i think

2942
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:56,639
that reading would have really built up

2943
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:58,560
enough expertise to you know make papers

2944
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:59,760
like this and obviously similar to

2945
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,119
modern stuff and just generally

2946
01:41:01,119 --> 01:41:02,239
get everything together probably lots of

2947
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:04,480
stuff in the next year or so coming out

2948
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:05,679
actually made all of that possible

2949
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:08,400
really and so yeah also this is a family

2950
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:09,199
like if

2951
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:10,719
you're interested in learning more about

2952
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:12,960
the fop like email maxwell because he

2953
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,719
has recordings of all the reading group

2954
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:15,600
meetings

2955
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:16,719
and so that's probably going to be a

2956
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:19,520
really good for a good another lockdown

2957
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:20,719
i think

2958
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:22,639
yeah so yeah a lot of records will be

2959
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:24,000
lots of material there

2960
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,760
yeah if you want to really drill down

2961
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,360
into technicalities and those recordings

2962
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:28,480
will probably be really good

2963
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:34,080
as well great and um

2964
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,520
miguel if you would like to give any

2965
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,520
last comments

2966
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:41,119
um yeah yes well yes yes

2967
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:44,800
as you said as i think yeah um partly as

2968
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,520
chris and bryan say that i i cannot join

2969
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:48,239
late

2970
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:50,000
to the group and just attend to the last

2971
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,440
sessions but it was really

2972
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:54,159
helpful to to dig through the some of

2973
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:55,600
the discussions that

2974
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,840
took place there and i think in general

2975
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,239
what so

2976
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:03,520
i think in general yeah like what could

2977
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,239
make the field advance is to to make

2978
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:08,880
things successful in different ways and

2979
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:11,199
and this can be through resources

2980
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:12,719
through communities

2981
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:16,159
and also through more transparent

2982
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:20,400
models or more easier to follow guides

2983
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,239
through the maps and i think the part of

2984
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:23,520
the difficulties in the field is that

2985
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,480
there is

2986
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,480
this a disconnection between people that

2987
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:27,760
is doing mathematical work and people

2988
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:29,760
that is doing philosophical work

2989
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,760
and not only here but i think in

2990
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,159
cognitive science in general or

2991
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:37,199
or even more deeper

2992
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:39,760
abuse of systems biology and so right

2993
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:40,639
and

2994
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:43,280
and that this multi level yeah i think

2995
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:45,679
it's very valuable this this efforts in

2996
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:47,600
in in trying to make things more

2997
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:50,000
accessible and easier to follow

2998
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,560
from yeah for people for from multiple

2999
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:53,280
disciplines

3000
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,040
i think that's a very valuable effort

3001
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,400
that we should try to do

3002
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:59,520
collectively because that's the only way

3003
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:02,000
and thanks a lot for hosting the session

3004
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:02,639
thank you

3005
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:05,679
we always talk about tools ideas and

3006
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:06,480
people

3007
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:08,719
they're a triple helix and so thanks for

3008
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:10,000
making it happen with all those

3009
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:15,520
today thank you very much for that peace
