1
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,176
Hello and welcome everyone

2
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:16,082
to the ActInfLab
Guest stream number 7.1 - Double-O-Seven point One, actually.

3
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,317
Very nice number.

4
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:20,153
It's May 28th, 2021.

5
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:23,523
And we have some
very special guests on today

6
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,659
who I will let themselves
introduce themselves

7
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:31,431
and then we'll go into a presentation
followed by a discussion.

8
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:36,269
So any and all questions and comments
just put into the live chat

9
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,804
during the presentation

10
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,507
and I'll be compiling those
so that we can make sure to ask them.

11
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:43,109
So please, Miguel, go for it.

12
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:48,381
Okay then, I'm Miguel Aguilera. I'm working

13
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:52,252
as a post-doc for a year now
at the University of Sussex

14
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,489
in the UK.

15
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,624
Okay.

16
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:58,224
Yeah.

17
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,526
So, so basically

18
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,460
I'm a lecturer

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,130
at the University of Sussex
in both the Sussex Neurosciences Sussex

20
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,834
I groups are interested
in sensory motor control in general.

21
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,136
Cool.

22
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,872
So Michael, share your screen.

23
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:16,009
I'll resize
and then we'll have a presentation.

24
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,677
Take as long as you'd like.

25
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,779
Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot for the hand.

26
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:21,514
Yeah, for the invitation.

27
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,850
Really happy to present our work here.

28
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,120
It's been really kind of fast
because we just released the preprint

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,093
between this I go about it's good for
people to get a lot of discussion online.

30
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,361
So okay, let's see.

31
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:36,963
Okay. Can you see this key?

32
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,765
Yep. So resize it now.

33
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,100
So go for it.

34
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:41,301
Okay.

35
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:41,701
Okay.

36
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,871
So, okay, so this is this work.

37
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:45,805
So this is super brain

38
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,908
that we have just published science
and you've got like Liora and, and

39
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,846
we wrote it
erotically and familiar to Alex and said

40
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,981
Alex understands Christopher Buckley

41
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,218
from all from Sussex Montaigne.

42
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,020
What's acceptable for us now also.

43
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:07,026
Um, so then so they work this to focus on

44
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:10,096
some of the recent publications
about the free energy principles.

45
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,399
I guess most people watching
know that the free inadmissible is

46
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,970
was conceived
originally as a unified brain theory

47
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,708
integrating experimental data
into this tool. Yet

48
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:25,812
describe the relationship between action,
perception and learning and so on.

49
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,583
And more recently, the theory has evolved

50
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,020
and tried to become more general,

51
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,590
stating
that any non-equilibrium dynamical system

52
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,327
under some special conditions
can be interpreted as performing

53
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:42,795
by using an inference.

54
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,064
And this will be

55
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:50,303
broader the theory of leaving system
or a way to describe

56
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:55,041
how certain
living systems gave using the tools from.

57
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,944
But this an inference and

58
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,582
okay so so this is standard
so in principle this

59
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:06,586
this kind of schema of a brain
is predicting

60
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:07,120
an environment

61
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,057
could be using different systems
like cell or different between being sun

62
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:15,094
and what I imagine anyone familiar with
with the primary principle

63
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:20,099
in this kind of pictures
are lots and lots until to

64
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:24,003
to the different one sun so that being
so I think it's maybe it would think to

65
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,674
to to try to visualize things
in a new ways

66
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,109
because this one's happier
probably than than so many things.

67
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,110
Okay.

68
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,281
So so the idea is
so we are interested in in exploring this

69
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:39,419
the the point that different assumptions
behind the principle because

70
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,655
and in theory the primary principle

71
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,658
applies to very diverse systems.

72
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,527
But in practice

73
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:52,098
there has been very few attempts
to explore it, to explore all the steps

74
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:56,836
of the theory in specific systems
on what we want to do here is just not

75
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:01,307
and we want to understand
if we interview principle

76
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:05,311
on its mathematical assumptions
in the simplest system

77
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,914
and the simplest non-equilibrium system
that we can find on

78
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,851
this is a linear dynamics
that will span later

79
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,588
on under an assumption of the assumptions
that the coping between

80
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,656
elements are weak.

81
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,359
And in this very special case,
we can compute all the relevant

82
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,627
variables analytical line.

83
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,129
And this will be a very

84
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,799
this is a very interesting case
for studying in depth

85
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:30,303
all the mathematical limits and

86
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,542
okay so the the work in pretending today
is related to the latest publications

87
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:42,315
around the ideas of the FIP
and the monograph approach

88
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:46,352
and argue for a particular physics
on the most recent more recent paper

89
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,322
by Thomas Larson Carl

90
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:53,126
about Michael blankets the information
geometry and source thermodynamics

91
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,397
and specifically
we want to focus on on two questions.

92
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,868
The first question is is
how general is the free energy principle

93
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:06,272
that is from all the systems that we can
imagine

94
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:10,009
can top two aspects of the legal systems.

95
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:13,980
How many of them conform
to the assumptions that

96
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,083
that the the principle requires?

97
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,218
And the second question is

98
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:22,755
how informative is the principle
about the behavior of our system.

99
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:26,559
So if if our system

100
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,129
if the first one closed so if I is, then

101
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,166
conforms
to all the requirements of the principle,

102
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,336
then how much
how much do we know about the system?

103
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,937
Right. How much

104
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:43,943
the principle is able to inform us
about the behavior of this organism,

105
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,313
okay, so, so on.

106
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,449
And lose this we find choices.

107
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,318
But I will explain later in detail.

108
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:56,656
One is that and some of the requirements
of the principle

109
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:02,462
and are make it challenging
to find systems in the class of systems.

110
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:07,500
We explore that that find that
that much the required assumptions.

111
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,872
And on the second issue we found
is that one important step

112
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,142
in connecting the behavior

113
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,277
of the system to the

114
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,914
to the gradient of the free energy
to the free and in principle

115
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:26,786
involves the coupling from the history
of interaction of a system.

116
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,255
And this creates problems in the

117
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:33,059
interpretation of a system
behaving as if minimized in a free.

118
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,595
And I will explain that.

119
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,697
So so before starting.

120
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:41,701
Yes, one quick
note on the on the notation we are using,

121
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,203
which is bit different
from from the papers

122
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:48,841
on the on some of the literature
we are describing external sense

123
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:52,645
or octave on internal as it would be C
which is composed by some other states

124
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:57,750
Y sensory states
as active states A states x

125
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,087
also differently
than in the in the papers.

126
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,657
Both symbols
represent a vector on lattices.

127
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,927
So on expectations instead,

128
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:12,231
which were bold in
some of the papers here are represented

129
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:18,004
by these and variables like
and why am is sensible on some things.

130
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:21,841
The theory uses conditional expectations
given a blanket state and in this case

131
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,443
then the blanket states.

132
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,711
The conditional state
is going to be a parenthesis.

133
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:29,649
So this is the mean of why
the domain of external states even b

134
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:35,855
I know so we can compute the
these are useful and we will look

135
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,225
in marginal flows are this F variables
that they would describe later.

136
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:40,293
Okay.

137
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,330
So, so first we try to summarize
the different conditions

138
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,867
and assumptions that one needs to derive
the free energy principle.

139
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:54,474
And I want to make a summary
which will be just refer later.

140
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,442
So first we the free energy

141
00:07:56,442 --> 00:08:00,179
principle assumes that we have a system
that we can describe as a line,

142
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,381
given
the stochastic differential equation

143
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:06,185
and this is just coming
non and always therm this omega

144
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,121
which is just random
and uncorrelated the white noise

145
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:14,393
on some flow function
f that could be any potentially

146
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:18,764
nonlinear function that describes
this time derivative, this evolution,

147
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:23,836
this deterministic part of the evolution
of of a variable C and in principle the

148
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,973
omega single center and its curious

149
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,443
is the matrix gamma

150
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,080
and because all the noise is independent
between elements.

151
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:38,351
Okay, so the first condition
that the free energy promise of a rise

152
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:43,322
is that the flow function decouples
what the theoretical autonomous

153
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:47,760
and non autonomous states
meaning that internally states x

154
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:51,564
are not going to influence
external and sensory states

155
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:56,903
on external states are not going to
influence active internal states on this.

156
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,337
So this is what

157
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:03,342
and what we generally expect
from my sensorimotor loop in an agent.

158
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:06,345
And so if we have and we represent

159
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,048
this evolution of this system
like a nebula or integration,

160
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,219
so the external states do not influence
active,

161
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:17,990
internal and internal states
do not influence external sensor itself.

162
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,627
So we are going to require restrict
or analysis system system.

163
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:26,098
But this sensorimotor system,

164
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:30,670
the second condition of the principle is
that this system has a global attractor.

165
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,739
That is that the the probability
distributions of the state

166
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,109
of our system compared to some specific
probability distribution,

167
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:43,516
which is called P on this P
and it can be described by this reprise,

168
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,752
which is the negative logarithm
of this, of the probability,

169
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,723
which is how surprising
or how unlikely is a state.

170
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:56,228
And on this condition, we proposes that

171
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,766
and this global attractor
or this a steady state,

172
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,803
the distribution can be described
by the composition, are

173
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,306
helpful, holds the composition
or what on a or the composition

174
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,208
which

175
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:13,112
relates the flow function
with this or price by yeah.

176
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,715
To mitosis. Q and gum and gamma.

177
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,382
We saw it before.

178
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,584
It was just the covariance of the noise.

179
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:23,723
You is a matrix capturing
what's you call this

180
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:28,127
so I know that it flows in the system
on you some it's symmetric

181
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:33,299
on this solenoid outflow
so this is the mean mean that a

182
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,970
to the non-equilibrium influences
in the system.

183
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,273
If a system is at
thermodynamic equilibrium,

184
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,710
then Q is going to be zero
for all elements.

185
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,381
But if the system has an exchange
of matter or energy

186
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,851
or have some asymmetry in the interaction
between the parts

187
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,988
two is going going to be non-zero.

188
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,025
And okay, so we are going to have these

189
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:03,262
distribution terms, gamma
which are these this the of lines

190
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,332
then we are going to have gold links
between elements with this solenoid

191
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,268
all influences that are captured by these

192
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,773
blue arrows here
this one with the arrows.

193
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,541
Okay,
so that this is going to the condition

194
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,611
and the last condition that the friend
or even for who Christ is

195
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,979
the Marco blanket condition.

196
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,881
This may be very well known

197
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,017
which requires that

198
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,454
so that the sensorimotor states
based on they

199
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,490
and which are generally called
blanket state.

200
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,260
But we are going to be compressing
the two.

201
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,164
So the condition requires
that this variable

202
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,534
are going to play a very special role.

203
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,804
The coupling internal and states
in the following way.

204
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:49,642
And they are going to if we complete
our conditional distribution

205
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:54,313
picks and be on off
into extremely different states,

206
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,316
this is this is going to be independent
for our peaks to be.

207
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,986
So they are not independent in general,
but they are independent for a specific

208
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,022
one state.

209
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,824
Okay. So can yeah.

210
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:08,327
So these are those are condition
are statistical dependencies.

211
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,831
They are given B,
we have Y and X, but they are not

212
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:16,402
and they are not statistically correlated
for a given B, okay.

213
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:20,806
And so on in this sense
that this blanket states are going to be

214
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,409
like are a boundary or a barrier

215
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,579
between external and internal states.

216
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:28,247
Okay.

217
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,051
So, so these are the conditions required
by the free energy principle in real

218
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:37,623
meaning that we said these are
the prerequisites that we require.

219
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:42,361
So for a system to and to, to,

220
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,664
to display the properties
proposed by the three in, then

221
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:47,733
okay.

222
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,703
But outside of that a we interpret

223
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,840
and that the theory has some
three extra assumptions.

224
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:58,310
So these are not conditions,
these are not restricted by things that

225
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,113
the theory expects to happen or expect

226
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,949
to find that this in some some cases

227
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,420
on the for explaining this
it will still explain before

228
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,957
and how the theory proposed that

229
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:17,096
and variational pre introducing
both in the behavior of our system.

230
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:21,667
So so the free energy principle proposes
that any system under these conditions

231
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:26,305
that they describe
can be seen as minimizing or RC.

232
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:30,676
It's going to behave
as if minimizing operational free energy.

233
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,181
So for I'm for defining this free energy,
we start with this

234
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,949
price of the blanket states.

235
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,653
So the blanket state, this is what
an agent can observe in environment. They

236
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,722
do not cannot access the environment

237
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,392
directly because of the sensorimotor
structure that we have,

238
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,528
but only can access the blanket states,

239
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,364
the sensors on the actuators and

240
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,534
if our system is is

241
00:13:55,534 --> 00:14:01,173
behaving as if minimizing the free energy
or and doing by using inference,

242
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,810
I should think with this one to behave
as if minimizing the

243
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:09,315
and yeah, this reprisal of this
this is that

244
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,752
and okay but

245
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,120
but the system cannot access

246
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,656
this probability,
the probability distribution directly,

247
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,161
but because it doesn't really
cannot access the environment

248
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,998
so and so that by this
an inference prescribes

249
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,334
to use a lower bound of this or price.

250
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,504
Okay,
which is called Operation Free Energy.

251
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,941
And this Operation Free Energy
consists on the short price term

252
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:40,045
plus some divergence
with some real divergence

253
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,215
between the actual probability
distribution of the environment.

254
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:47,486
Given the blanket on the model
to a simplified model of the environment

255
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,589
and on by.

256
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,559
But is an inference consists
in finding the parameters

257
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:57,663
out of this model
that minimize these this instance.

258
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,666
So in this
so when this distance is minimized,

259
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:05,037
then the agent runs
a model of the world and is predicting

260
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,641
the the
states of the environmental right.

261
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:13,245
Okay so so solving the
but you see an inference problem.

262
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,849
So the simplest way
the simplest way of doing

263
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:21,487
it is just doing a reading descent
minimize mutation of these free energy

264
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,591
which ends up in being not reading
descent of of the of

265
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,260
of the environment.

266
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,730
Why but at the most likely states
data on the blank.

267
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,533
Okay, so, so here I guess that yes.

268
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:39,204
Parameter
is the most likely state of what.

269
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:39,805
Okay.

270
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,473
Okay.

271
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:45,477
So, so then the free entry
principle defines the most likely states

272
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,981
of the end of the system
on the environment.

273
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,349
Peaks in a blanket.

274
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,385
Yes. Like the the mode or the arc max.

275
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:58,524
But sometimes it has been proposed that
the mean it's a no fault for doing this.

276
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,626
And since we are going
to use the systems,

277
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,027
the both are going to be the same.

278
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,064
So you can interpret this as the mode
or as there

279
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:09,835
and as the mean of of Y and Z and B,

280
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:14,740
and then you can if you remember,
you will have the flow functions.

281
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:18,777
If you can compute
the average flow of the system

282
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,214
and why for a given B on

283
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:26,218
which we saw in this assumption
that can be described by these models

284
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:29,088
you on game
on the gradient on this price.

285
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,256
So if we want to find something

286
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:34,493
like the gradient of this or price
that we have here

287
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,298
and the fact that if we get this loop
proposes that we have to compute

288
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:43,669
the average of of the flow given B
and we obtain something like this

289
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,072
and we
can see here that the first term is the

290
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:50,676
what we want is the gradient is sorted
with the gradient of this price.

291
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,212
But we have to make certain

292
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,814
and so if we have

293
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,550
so we have some, some grading like these,

294
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,588
we could if we had something
like the first column in this equation,

295
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:06,792
we could interpret
and we can use this orient

296
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:10,796
to perform.

297
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,264
We could use this way to perform.

298
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:16,835
I mean, you may see some of these energy
would say interpret if we interpret it

299
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,205
and strictly
it could mean having somebody

300
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,375
that follows this gradient.

301
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,177
I'm sorry. 1/2.

302
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,446
Okay.

303
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:31,550
And okay, so so if we have okay.

304
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,754
So on the that this also yes,
that this part of the city is going to be

305
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:39,158
the most likely states of external
or internal states.

306
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,928
And again, this so so we have
so we have this equation here,

307
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:46,098
this solution 12
and we just need the first term.

308
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,635
So in general,
the free energy principle proposes that

309
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,205
the couplings

310
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:57,643
of this matrix to the non by the
and are going to be zero

311
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:03,482
and okay so so okay
so this is our so each element in

312
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,952
this is a block
I'm have many a number of dimensions

313
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,923
on the free energy
principle assumes that okay

314
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:16,261
well at one interpretation this could be
is that it assumes that a removing this

315
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,832
or you know they'll coupling this non
block diagonal groupings

316
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:23,001
then we are going to remove
these elements that we don't want

317
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:28,907
and we are going to have a flow of
this is then equal to this gradient

318
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,244
on this replace that is the gradient
that minimize the free energy.

319
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:33,979
Okay.

320
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,148
So, so this is the first assumption.

321
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,817
If this if this few terms

322
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:42,321
are equal to zero,
then we have an average flow

323
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,390
that goes in the direction
of minimizing the free energy.

324
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,027
And this is interesting because we will
have a system that points and

325
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,130
in either

326
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,932
the screen again what we
it was inadequate

327
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,002
in some works

328
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,372
it is proposed that there's
some general form of this matrix

329
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:04,710
that is not is also blocked diagonal
but not within Y and Aswany.

330
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,880
But we think they are autonomous
or none of them.

331
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,249
So what I mean is on an X

332
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:16,021
and this is the case,
but it's not a possibly

333
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,791
this is not a clear
how you can derive in this case.

334
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:23,729
And this gradient of the free energy
and what it's suggested that

335
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,665
the sorry noodle copies can run sellout.

336
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,367
But but yeah.

337
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,303
But so
who are we to consider the two cases?

338
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,972
But of course it is in principle, yes.

339
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:37,976
The case of complete.

340
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:41,280
So this first assumption
means that the cocoons between

341
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,383
elements are
or can be approximated as sirup.

342
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:46,718
Okay.

343
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:51,790
And the second assumption
and is therefore in.

344
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,993
Okay, so we have a flow of extra states
that's

345
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,529
pointing in the direction
of minimizing the free energy.

346
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,935
But we want to interpret internal states
as minimizing this free energy.

347
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,238
So what if a slope proposes
to solve this?

348
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:12,878
So the proposal is that there is a smooth
mapping sigma that connects

349
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,681
the most likely improvement states
with the most likely standard state.

350
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,817
So this and Y is equal to sigma x

351
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:24,323
and on the assumption
is that there's a gradient in both the

352
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:28,827
our of there's a gradient or distributive
anybody this mapping that exists.

353
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,830
So the mapping is differentiable
and that it is similar to what

354
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:34,333
we proposed.

355
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,369
The bias that we see on request requisite
for this assumption too

356
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,606
is that the mapping from B to an x
is injected.

357
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,475
Okay, so this mapping exists.

358
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:47,579
Then we can connect the external states
with the internal states

359
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,448
and we know that the external states

360
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,951
of uphill that point in the direction
of minimizing the penalty.

361
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,622
And so the hope is that now
internal states,

362
00:20:56,688 --> 00:21:00,392
if this mapping exist, are going also
to have a flow that's pointing in the

363
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,493
direction of the free energy

364
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:05,264
and the loss of function.

365
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,735
And this is maybe a more controversial
is that if we work off

366
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,171
on strict interpretation of the

367
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,909
gradient descent on of opinion or D

368
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,647
and the the assumption will be

369
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:25,984
that the dynamics of the most likely
states are approximately equal

370
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:29,121
to the dynamic to the average flow
of the external states.

371
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:33,492
So, so this is the derivative
of their average two states

372
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:38,430
on the right side will be the average
of the relative to some sort.

373
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,966
So, so this is saying something like this
and approximately

374
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,802
the derivative of their rate
is going to be equivalent

375
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,705
to the average of the derivative
because it flows yesterday.

376
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:51,476
But the derivative of the, of the system.

377
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,379
So if this assumption will be true, then

378
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:58,350
not only the flow of external states
point in the direction

379
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,887
of the free entity, but also the dynamics
of the system of the

380
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,824
are minimizing the free energy.

381
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,528
And this is interesting
because if we had this if this is true,

382
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,264
then we have some equation like this.

383
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:17,536
So the derivative of y is equal to the
gradient respect to m y of this or price.

384
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:23,342
So the dynamics of y are being achieved
minimizing the free entity.

385
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,078
So we so this was in 20.

386
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,213
So we know that the dynamics,

387
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:31,717
the behavior of the system
is going to be minimizing actively

388
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,687
before gradient descent on the free
pre and on

389
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:40,325
if this is through and we have
the mapping that a assumption to propose,

390
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,162
then we can use the chain rule
to find that connection between

391
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,265
between the derivative of y
on the derivative of in white.

392
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:50,869
So the dynamics of the external states
on the dynamics of the internal states,

393
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:54,706
just with the gradient
of the sigma function.

394
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,042
So this is just a ten
rule of the, of derivatives.

395
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,546
And with
this a step, then we can describe

396
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,083
the dynamics of internal states,
of the dynamics of external states,

397
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:09,521
and use this gradient
mapping to read this equation.

398
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:15,193
23 that tells you that the dynamics
of the most likely internal states

399
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,763
is doing
the gradient descent on the free entity.

400
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,333
So this is the end of the of the
of the argument of the free energy.

401
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:25,871
So, so if this is true,
then the internal states

402
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:30,942
will be behaving as if minimizing
the free energy about external states.

403
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:36,748
On then the internal state will be
the behaving as if effectively performing

404
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,185
by and by an inference.

405
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,386
Okay.

406
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:46,324
And on with the write out
from some of the states

407
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:50,762
in in this publication in the
and the monograph of that particular

408
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,397
property, which

409
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:56,701
this is on the most recent paper based
almost about microblogging.

410
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,938
So for instance your mothers
and so on because they they are

411
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:03,008
and this it appears to us
that they were using the same symbol

412
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,677
for the derivative of external states
and the average flow

413
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,316
because so in some equation
the recycle is

414
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:14,219
so for the change room
they use this symbol and

415
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,689
and so so this is the way

416
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:20,258
we interpret this in the in this way.

417
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:24,963
However, also from commercials
and from the offers

418
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:29,301
it's proposed that the the
the free energy

419
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,504
principle is not exactly proposing
that they receive.

420
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:37,943
So I think that the result would be that
the system is not doing on a straight

421
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:41,847
Caribbean descent as this assumption
three that we label with this is thorough

422
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,450
because it's in part or interpretation.

423
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,620
But that the alternative
to these assumptions

424
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,989
that are three will be
assumptions are free,

425
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,326
which is that it is not.

426
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,362
And the derivative
of them of likely state

427
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,664
but follow the green of the energy
about that.

428
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:03,401
But yes, the flow, the average flow
so the average flow of it

429
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:06,638
Y is just the average
of the derivative of Y,

430
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:11,977
you repeat the conditional average with a
so this on

431
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:17,215
and the claim will be
that if the flow is pointing

432
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,984
so that if the average derivative

433
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,219
is pointing in the right direction
of the free energy,

434
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,057
then you can interpret
that the system is behaving

435
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:29,861
as if on average
it was performing a brilliant descent.

436
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,832
So so this assumption starts on three
would be that

437
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:37,202
not that the system is exactly doing that
gradient descent

438
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,238
on the free energy
but that it is doing on average.

439
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:45,710
Tonight we will have like
many observations of the system.

440
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,282
Then we will see that they on average
point do.

441
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,650
I mean,
it really starts with free energy,

442
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,654
but maybe not if we just observe
one system the beginning.

443
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:59,057
Okay, then
this assumption of three will be that.

444
00:25:59,090 --> 00:25:59,658
Yeah, exactly.

445
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,793
You know, if,
if the condition average flows

446
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:05,463
follow the direction of gradient descent
on the free energy,

447
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:09,634
then the behavior can describe on average
as if minimizing the green.

448
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:11,269
Okay.

449
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:12,571
Okay.

450
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,607
So this is
the summary of the different conditions

451
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:20,645
and assumptions of the principle in which
we will have competent interpretation.

452
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:24,783
At some points
like this assumption of three.

453
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,084
Okay, okay.

454
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:30,121
This is a lot of steps on on
it is hard to into intuitively

455
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,359
have an idea of what the goal is,
what yeah.

456
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,529
How we can expect from any of them.

457
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,532
So what we did is we tried to explore

458
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,835
these different conditions
and assumptions in our inability

459
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:48,707
to use this system to solve on
and on, see what we can expect

460
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,509
in this very simple case
and also our ideas.

461
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:55,614
The best way to really understand
this is to have a model.

462
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,249
The simplest we can have

463
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,885
and see how easy or hard

464
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:04,189
is for the different assumptions
to recall that we felt by this.

465
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:05,523
Is that okay.

466
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:08,827
So we substituted the large abundance
that we had

467
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,997
before by yes, a linear range abundance.

468
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,231
So everything is the same

469
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,936
and whether
we have a factor for the noise,

470
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,270
but this is one to read this one.

471
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,173
And we have we have

472
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,476
know the f function.

473
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,545
The flow is substituted
by a linear multiplication.

474
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:31,383
So we have a matrix
de which is saying Barcelona real,

475
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:35,520
which is multiplying
and the state of the system

476
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,223
minus some constant row

477
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:41,459
which is going to be the an offset

478
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:46,097
capturing the average state in
and in a steady state.

479
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:47,098
Okay.

480
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:50,101
And this system is going to be
our non-equilibrium system if

481
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:54,973
and the matrix j is is not symmetric.

482
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:55,940
Okay.

483
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,476
So in that case, we are
we have a non-equilibrium system

484
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,780
and we are going to have,
for example, spiral floors.

485
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,747
And so

486
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:08,153
the interesting thing
is that this system offers a steady state

487
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:11,990
if we let this is now run for some time
is when you have a steady state that's

488
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,258
going to be about in this direction.

489
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,594
Because if everything is linear on
the noise is linear, eventually

490
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:20,398
the system is going to wait
a steady state and thousands to watch it.

491
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,636
And in that
the limit of time can going to infinity,

492
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:27,806
the average of this Gaussian
is going to be yes, these are what

493
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,776
parameter on the cabana's
matrix of this multivariate Gaussian

494
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:37,348
is going to be this sigma star matrix.

495
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:40,218
And this Sigma
Star Matrix cannot be solved

496
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,053
analytically.

497
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,788
But is the solution of this equation?

498
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:47,192
29 is an equation
that involves the noise,

499
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,994
the coordinates of the noise, gamma
and the see

500
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,364
if in equilibrium

501
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:56,367
this model,
this equation can be solved analytically,

502
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:01,172
but we are interested in more generally
in non-equilibrium systems on these.

503
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:04,342
These equations are continuous
like the one off equation,

504
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,812
and in principle
it can be solved numerically,

505
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:12,650
which is not ideal for us
because we want to access

506
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:16,488
to the hub, the connections
between the parameters on the X,

507
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:21,559
but we cannot in general.

508
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,129
Okay, so what, what did we do?

509
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:28,199
And so in order to have a solution
of this equation, our general solution.

510
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,268
So we assumed the following.

511
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,870
We assumed that

512
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,839
the couplings of J can be defined

513
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,976
as some term I

514
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,280
and this is negative just to ensure
the stability of the system.

515
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,819
So if the Y, if I is positive and larger,
then you will have our debugging system

516
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,587
and then

517
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,656
we have a non that you're going to call

518
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,828
a C and we assume
that these C terms are small.

519
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:00,498
So if we have C, A square
or C to the power of three

520
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,234
and these are going to be
negligible terms.

521
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:08,006
And in that sense, we can see if we have
that we can solve this equation,

522
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:12,410
you know, in terms of up
over 36 functions so we can solve like R

523
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,648
so this would be equivalent to our Taylor
expansion that you can see in calculus

524
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:21,986
and we can have an expression of this
sigma,

525
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:27,692
the coordinate matrix of the solution
in terms of increasing followers of C so

526
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,629
then the linear of the quadratic terms
on some

527
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,133
terms that we are going to know. Okay.

528
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,068
And to make things more

529
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:40,805
easier, we are going to assume
that the noise is somewhat homogeneous.

530
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:45,343
So Sigma, is this a density matrix times?

531
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,979
Some constant. Some constant.

532
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,981
Okay. So

533
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,251
okay, so we choose value.

534
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:57,322
So and so if y
so the conditions one and two are

535
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,758
almost automatically true.

536
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:04,195
If y is now dependent on C
and we have a global attractor

537
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,165
and also we can define J

538
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,301
A to have
the sensorimotor structure that we want.

539
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,605
So we will need to condition three.

540
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,375
So condition
three is the mark blanket condition

541
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,445
and proposing that they blanket

542
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,548
the states or the central
and other states play a very special role

543
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,885
being a boundary
between external states and domestic,

544
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,020
so that the distributes
the condition of distribution

545
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,391
is an independent distribution
given the blanket way unexciting.

546
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:34,792
Okay.

547
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:39,464
So in our Gaussian distribution
and this condition is true,

548
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:44,402
if I leave the same matrix
which is the inverse of the covariance,

549
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:48,406
satisfies that the definition between Y

550
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,709
and X, the chasm between internal
and external states a little bit.

551
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,944
But this can be a matrix.

552
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:57,015
If the dimensions of Y and Z are
more than one, then it is equal to zero.

553
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:01,419
Okay, so we can very easily compute

554
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:05,223
and what's the form of discussion
with these approximations?

555
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,526
So we have the question
how common are Markov blankets?

556
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,029
Not for them.
All the systems in the world.

557
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:15,433
And how often can we expect
if we have. Yes.

558
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,403
Run the parameters to find the Markov
blanket.

559
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:20,738
Okay. Okay.

560
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:24,876
So we want this matrix H
which is the inverse of the covariance

561
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:28,012
of this steady state distribution

562
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:33,017
and that we can express this
inverse again I suppose serious

563
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:36,421
and this is called a new monster
is for completing the inverse optimizer

564
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,791
and so on.

565
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,858
It has this form.

566
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:44,762
We have again
a linear term on a quadratic term.

567
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,765
And so in terms of the way I to ignore,

568
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:52,437
okay,
so we just need to know, see to know how

569
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:57,508
what's it and to know this
corner of the matrix is equal to zero.

570
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:02,547
Okay, so, so C is going to be like this
because we impose these

571
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:05,650
specific sensorimotor other structures in
we to excellent on stage.

572
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,721
So an influence internal and internal
don't influence experiments on.

573
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,992
And so for the first order approximation

574
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,996
we have this equation 36

575
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:18,463
Okay.

576
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:23,468
So yeah, for some of that approximation
we use this term of the equation,

577
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,504
we going to see which is C plus

578
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,240
the transpose
and just switching rows and columns.

579
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:34,779
We can see that if we sum C plus
and transpose the term in the corner

580
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,848
is going to be equal to zero,
which is what?

581
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,182
What do we want?

582
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,919
So for our first order approximation,
we have an exact

583
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:45,056
mark of blanket on the mark of Lang
if this were always going to be true.

584
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,425
So this is what we wouldn't
use in principle.

585
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:51,295
And if we if we are,

586
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:55,166
what if we want more position,
we compute the second or third.

587
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,335
So we get this quadratic term here.

588
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,272
We find that the corner of the Hessian,
the one that has to be

589
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:03,241
zero, has this form.

590
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:06,210
So in principle,
this is not going to be zero

591
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,014
or is going to be C
or just for very special cases.

592
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,284
And if we look at the

593
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:16,754
connectivity structure of the
of the system, so that kind of system

594
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:22,193
with a loop that we require in general,
is this a canonical loop?

595
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:26,764
a3a So simple for this, a structure,
very few systems

596
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,833
are going to have an Oracle blanket
because this is

597
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,103
not going to be C or exactly
almost never.

598
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,706
And however,
there is some other configurations

599
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,108
that are going to have a mark of blanket.

600
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:41,145
If we have a it will have looked like
this is B or we have something like this,

601
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,381
a structure in C,

602
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,783
then the relevant then

603
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,987
then the terms appearing in this equation
are at least one of them is zero

604
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,823
in both cases
and this is going to be zero.

605
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:56,594
So we actually are going to have a markov
blanket in general, but not a

606
00:34:56,794 --> 00:35:02,133
and there are second order approximation
on so under this canonical flow

607
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,102
constraints is a

608
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:08,172
only a few systems are going to display
and accept Markov blankets,

609
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:12,009
although but one exception
are going to be this circle of loops

610
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:16,781
or these symmetric loops on
however we, we, we felt

611
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:21,185
we we have to say that
the in the case of weak couplings

612
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:22,353
the macro blanket

613
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:26,090
this is still going to be a R
is in somewhat reasonable approximation

614
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:33,631
because if we have some equation
like this on a so so the first term

615
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,401
so even if we have something like this,
this is our second order, that equation

616
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,204
on all the other elements in the matrix,
I want to have

617
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,907
two components
that are going to be much larger.

618
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:47,278
So even if this even
if we do not have an exact or blanket,

619
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:51,516
this is going to be a very somewhat
reasonable approximation in most cases.

620
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,251
Okay.

621
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,219
So this is condition one one.

622
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,087
These are three. Sorry.

623
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,689
So let's go to the next
and the next one is assumption one,

624
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,692
which states that

625
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:05,963
they're so copious
between blocks of states have to be zero

626
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:10,668
in order to have a flow that points
in the direction of the free energy.

627
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:15,106
Or we could relax this assumption
on how these this get relaxed.

628
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:18,075
But those sort of worry
requiring some some students in here.

629
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,313
Okay and so we can drag right

630
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:25,917
the previous solution of the
of the steady state equation

631
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:30,955
to find a connection
between Q Gamma and J

632
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,624
and we would not it's sort

633
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:36,460
right in the previous question
we can read this equation quarter

634
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:39,797
and again this is

635
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,833
this equation cannot cannot be solved
directly in general

636
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,904
because each another on a continuous
reliable equation.

637
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:51,175
But assuming that we have j equal

638
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,712
Siemens Y like and the openness are small
as we have before.

639
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,914
We can do the same trick

640
00:36:56,914 --> 00:37:00,418
for a new power series
that connects to with the values of C.

641
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:01,419
Okay.

642
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:05,423
And has this form which is similar
but a little bit different than the

643
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:06,057
case before

644
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:11,729
and so but this case looks a little bit
more complicated.

645
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:15,666
So first, we just completed
the first order expansion of

646
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:21,372
it looks like this
so so this is Q for our first order

647
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,742
and case ignoring this

648
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,278
the quadratic terms of C

649
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:32,950
okay again
we see that there is in principle

650
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,020
few cases where and then

651
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:41,626
yeah, where the assumption is exactly
because we are having

652
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:44,462
we want to make zero
all these things here

653
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,866
if we don't constrain the possible
parameters,

654
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:52,136
this is going to be true
only in very, very special cases.

655
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,474
We're going to see that the one way
to make so many elements of this

656
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:59,076
matrix
is assuming that they are symmetric.

657
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:03,180
You see, y is equal
to the transpose of these.

658
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,385
Let's see if the connections from sensor
to environment are equal

659
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,388
to the connections of environment
to sensor, then this is going to be zero.

660
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:16,527
And in that case we obtain this matrix
which has a little zeros by the still

661
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,764
there is these terms
that we cannot get rid of.

662
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,366
So if this code names are not zero,

663
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,638
then we don't have the assumption
the friend responsible.

664
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:31,742
And this is important
because this is all this is

665
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:37,214
this will be the the connection
from actuators to the environment,

666
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:40,651
which in principle is something
we will expect in many cases.

667
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,154
And this is the yeah.

668
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,724
And this is the connections
from sensor to internal states,

669
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:52,129
which is also something we expect in most
sensorimotor or we intuitively expect

670
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:56,400
from our cognitive system
with our sensorimotor loop.

671
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,871
And if we want to make these elements
of the matrix equal to zero,

672
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:05,376
then we need to have something like this.

673
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:08,646
Look, see
in which these elements are symmetric,

674
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:11,816
the JS and the non use are symmetric.

675
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,852
And also we removed the connections

676
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:20,224
from sensor to internal states
on actuators to external state,

677
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,761
which is intuitively
a bit strange about it.

678
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:26,497
But I think this is somewhat
the literature of the French.

679
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,332
And so what
this kind of look has been used

680
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,202
so unexpectedly

681
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,002
and because

682
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:35,806
proposed that this would represent,
for example, the the membrane of a cell

683
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:40,778
that separates the internal and
external states in this kind of symmetric

684
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:42,747
manner.

685
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:47,418
Although I think there is some well,
there is some research on cell membranes

686
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,821
indicating that asymmetries in them in
memory are still important.

687
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:54,992
So this is still a potential issue
for finding systems.

688
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:58,763
But that this
this cedo this look that you going to

689
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:04,502
and if we consider
the secondary approximations, things

690
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,872
become spookier
and we have many, many theorems

691
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,075
and we see that these elements
are just going to be zero

692
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:14,145
in very, very narrow set of cases,

693
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:19,150
which is potentially problematic for poor
and yeah.

694
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,554
For asserting that the principle is,
is to hold for it.

695
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,791
This assumption will be generated
for for many systems.

696
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,528
And this also gives you an that

697
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:35,433
we are saying this very specific case
with very weak opinions.

698
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,701
But I mean, this stronger

699
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:41,405
couplings in principle
will make things more complicated.

700
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,073
I'm not this here.

701
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:44,475
Okay.

702
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:47,311
So this is assumption one.

703
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,381
We only are going to get this general

704
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,150
and there are very specific circumstances
on this.

705
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,886
The only exception being this symmetric.

706
00:40:56,053 --> 00:41:00,624
A look with this very,
very specific structure.

707
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,661
So so this is so in some connection

708
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:06,764
the Michael Blunkett exploration on them

709
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,000
on the exploration of this,

710
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,703
I will indicate that

711
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:15,039
in the class of systems

712
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,741
that we studied,
the free energy principle will be

713
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:22,279
will only emerge exactly
for our very narrow set of systems.

714
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,550
Okay, so,
so this is crystalline, so interesting

715
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:30,421
to think about how general
the principle lives or how can we expect

716
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:31,922
it to

717
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:35,793
be found
in, in, in different classes of systems

718
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:40,264
although we just restricted or
and I see students learning there once.

719
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:44,568
Okay so this second assumption
unconnected to the question

720
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:45,703
of how general

721
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:49,440
not not how general about how informative
this is in this assumption

722
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,476
is, is that there
we have this mapping between

723
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,712
internal and states

724
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,749
and if we compute
they're not likely interesting

725
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,451
going to states even a blanket.

726
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:03,954
If I go to any situation, we can do it
very easily to compete in our condition.

727
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:04,889
Elaborate.

728
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:10,094
And so these are the equations
of findings in textbook and multivariate.

729
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:15,399
Gaussians
And we find that if this requires

730
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:18,469
to compete
with the generalized birth of some matrix

731
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:24,108
and we find that
and we can in linear systems

732
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:27,945
and in some cases
if that the governments of

733
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:31,015
this model are correct,
then we can derive the mapping.

734
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,616
But this mapping,

735
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,986
if we have the correct them inside,
they think exist very broadly.

736
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:40,424
So this mapping is just going to be
linear matrix multiplication of

737
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:44,261
and the relation between and why am x

738
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:47,131
so so this is one this
and this might be an easy slide.

739
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:52,202
It can be expected to be very broad
if the dimensions of these variables

740
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:56,206
are correct.

741
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,641
Although maybe yeah, maybe it wasn't.

742
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,777
Not that in some of the literature the,

743
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,047
some of the verbal descriptions
say that this mapping

744
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:06,550
and it's a consequence
of the macro blanket,

745
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,553
but what we consider is
that they are in principle independent.

746
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:13,524
They they will emerge
even if there is not a markov blanket,

747
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,693
sort of at least in linear systems.

748
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:17,928
And so this

749
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:22,299
we and we discovered
that this result was also found

750
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:26,236
independently by by Lancelot Goldstein.

751
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:29,340
That work
that is going to be published soon.

752
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:33,944
And it's I think that they they got to
the exact same result as we did.

753
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:35,512
Okay.

754
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:39,883
So, so long to the last assumption,
which is maybe the most complicated.

755
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:44,888
And so the last step of the free energy
principle was to say that

756
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:49,727
we know that the flow of external state,
the average flow way, is pointing in the

757
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,196
direction of the free energy.
And this means

758
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:55,265
that the system is behaving
as if minimizing the free energy.

759
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:58,435
And I disagree that there is two possible
interpretations

760
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:01,639
for this and one for relaxed one.

761
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,476
So let's explore first
the strict gradient

762
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:09,446
descent interpretation,
which will mean that the derivative

763
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:14,685
of the average of the Eastern states
is equal to the average.

764
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,820
We can complete that very easily,
not linear system.

765
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,392
This this equation is the derivative
of the origin state.

766
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:25,663
This equation is just the average flow
on what we did for comparing

767
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:29,667
both is the US generating dummy
variable distiller m

768
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:34,471
which behaves
as equally as the average flow.

769
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:38,475
So this this variable to the end
will be a variable

770
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:42,012
that strictly minimizes
the free energy, right?

771
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:45,883
So, so we have
so this is the real dynamics of this,

772
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,719
of these state, of these
most likely states.

773
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:52,089
And this is what these most labile

774
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:56,727
states will do if they were exactly
minimizing the free energy

775
00:44:59,096 --> 00:44:59,563
on there.

776
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:01,165
Or we could do an approximation.

777
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:05,602
We're going to see that we can get to
a simplified version of these equations

778
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:09,006
and we can see that
both of them are a bit different.

779
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,644
At first, the real dynamics has a know
noise theorem because the fluctuations

780
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:16,113
are going to affect the dynamics
because they're

781
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:19,383
the observations of the blanket
are driven by noise.

782
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,919
So this is going to be a noisy dynamics.

783
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:23,520
This is not on.

784
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,892
The second difference
is that this them changes this sign here.

785
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:31,028
So the here is positive
and here is negative.

786
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:35,566
And this seems to strange
but the reason of these is because

787
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,702
and these so this is the real dynamics

788
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,772
which depends on the previous state

789
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,742
on this and average flow

790
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:48,979
a its history independent in some sense

791
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:53,884
it just depends on the previous estate of
B, but it doesn't depend on the

792
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:58,856
previous state of why, so to speak.

793
00:45:58,856 --> 00:45:59,623
So assume.

794
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:03,427
But since the structure of the of the low

795
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,563
of these variable, the dynamics of this
variable is going to be different.

796
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,866
And in this case,
this difference is captured

797
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:12,402
by this constant that has the difference
between one on the on the other

798
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,571
on if we're

799
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:18,308
on a simulation
of both of of both equations,

800
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:20,944
we find that the behavior
is is very different.

801
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:25,382
And so this is the behavior
of the real average variables.

802
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:27,918
So this is a system with two dimensions.

803
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:31,989
And you have these symmetric forms
because the, the

804
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:36,393
we restricted the couplings to plus -0.1.

805
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:40,531
And if we represent this builder and so,
so this is the system

806
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:42,332
that strictly minimizes the free energy.

807
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,835
We have this very,
very different behavior

808
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:48,705
which has this kind of weird
random walk on.

809
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,040
And this is because this

810
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,944
this variable is integrating
the fluctuations of the other one.

811
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:56,814
And so so there keeps accumulating

812
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:00,017
on the behavior is very different.

813
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:05,422
So in principle, it's unlikely
that the and these results were similar

814
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:08,625
for many combinations of parameters,
but in principle it's unlikely

815
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:12,262
that the dynamics of the
most likely states are going to be

816
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,166
so the
average flow is going to be informative

817
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,969
about the actual dynamics of the
most like you states.

818
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:23,807
Okay, so this is the sixth version
of the assumption that a relaxed version

819
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:26,977
would be that only the average flow

820
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,847
follows the gradient of the free energy.

821
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,250
And if we if

822
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,220
we interpret this,
we find that there is two problems,

823
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,789
or at least we feel that
that there are two problems.

824
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:41,391
And the first problem is that a key

825
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:45,362
step of the free energy principle uses
their synchronization manifold.

826
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,097
So the sigma function connected,

827
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:51,134
external and states
and then the rights are taking root,

828
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:55,472
connecting the dynamics of NY
with the dynamics of internal states

829
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,009
and this leads

830
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:01,678
to saying
that the flow of the internal states

831
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:05,616
is following
the gradient of the free energy.

832
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,584
Okay.

833
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:13,523
And so if we say that to the pre energy
does not really apply to the time

834
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:17,527
derivatives of the most likely states,
but this applies to the flow.

835
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:23,967
And then we cannot use the sigma mapping
to derive this equivalence between

836
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:27,104
what the external states are doing
and what the internal states are doing.

837
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,373
And so we cannot.

838
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,475
So this step becomes problematic.

839
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:36,246
And if we want to connect the flows
of internal states

840
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:40,951
on the flows of external states
as the US, the principal proposes,

841
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:43,921
then one would need a new mapping

842
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:47,391
because this mapping
and this mapping are not the same.

843
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,294
We computed in our system.

844
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:54,331
The two mappings that we find out there,
the mapping has a different expression

845
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:57,434
on it is different from the mapping.

846
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,570
That's the gradient of the mapping
that's using the literature.

847
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:04,574
So so in principle,
this relaxed interpretation will require

848
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,712
a different mapping that's different
than Sigma, because we are

849
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:12,249
not interested
on the flows of the most likely states.

850
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:17,521
But yes, on this average flows
and and on.

851
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,692
Okay, so on

852
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:25,462
what I'm more importantly
and another problem arises,

853
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:29,232
which is and yeah, certain

854
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:32,903
so so if we have an on this strict

855
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:37,708
the sort of 1/2.

856
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:37,941
Yeah.

857
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:41,111
If we following a strict
interpretation of the

858
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,614
sorry and what this.

859
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:45,015
Yeah.

860
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:48,618
If we're following the strict
interpretation like this like okay

861
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:52,556
internal states are following
a gradient, are doing a gradient descent

862
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:55,692
on the, on the free energy
so that they re but

863
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:58,562
the temporal derivative
is equal to the gradient of the.

864
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:00,030
So this is,

865
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:04,735
this is a definition of our textbook
gradient descent.

866
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:05,402
Okay.

867
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:06,136
And this is fine

868
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:09,272
if we have this equation, we know that
the system is doing a gradient descent.

869
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,341
So the question is,

870
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:16,680
if we just have this equation here,

871
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,850
so the average flow is pointing
in the direction of the gradient.

872
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,953
Can we really interpret

873
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:26,690
that the system is behaving
as if minimizing the free energy?

874
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,259
So how informative is this

875
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,496
average flow about the real behavior?

876
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:35,332
So we try to explore this.

877
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:38,101
So first and so

878
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:42,572
first in these simulations, we see that
it's maybe little improvement there.

879
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:45,976
Yeah, it would be little informative
even if we have a different mapping

880
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:50,147
and maybe this average flow
has little information about what

881
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:54,184
the actual dynamics is going on
for exploring this further.

882
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,486
And you can see it in the appendix.

883
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:58,021
So for

884
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:02,692
or for a preprint like this
and the second appendix

885
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,930
we tried to to explore
what is the connection between

886
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:12,369
the average flow and the actual dynamics
of the system in our very simple system.

887
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:15,038
So we restricted our system
to a bi dimensional case

888
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:18,241
with these and non-equilibrium behavior
or this is

889
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:21,311
so the flows of
this is not from this spiral behavior.

890
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:25,382
We under noise
are going to be rotating in this.

891
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:27,651
This is so
we have two variables, Y and B.

892
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:31,388
So this is
the flow, the actual flow of the system.

893
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,591
We ask, okay, so this thing,

894
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,661
what is the
the dynamics of the most likely states?

895
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,431
So this derivative of M, Y and even V,

896
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:44,968
and we find that
we have this negative slope, which is

897
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:49,673
where you have this distinction here,
because this is a random variable,

898
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:52,442
which is noise
and it's going to be noisy and so on.

899
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:56,379
But on our we have this negative slope,

900
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,916
meaning that the system is going to be

901
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:03,720
minimizing, is going to have an attractor
at zero, right?

902
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,891
If you study dynamical system,
some have a negative slope

903
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:12,762
of a derivative or at least our rates
you are going to minimize.

904
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:14,998
So if this state is negative,
you're going to reduce it,

905
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:16,833
you are going to increase it. Sorry.

906
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,969
And if the state is positive,
you are going to reduce it.

907
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,972
So you are going to have an attractor a0
which is what we see

908
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:24,574
in the actual system, but

909
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:28,178
for at
least for some combinations of parameters

910
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:32,149
which were like half of the possible
combinations of parameters that we tried.

911
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:37,621
If you compute the average flow, it gives
you the opposite effect behavior here.

912
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:41,925
This log is positive, meaning that
you have a system that follows.

913
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:46,396
This slope is going to diverge
to plus infinity or minus infinity.

914
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:51,902
So this is intended
as an example that the average flow

915
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:56,673
can be a very poor description
of the actual behavior of our system.

916
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,910
If what you have is are stochastic

917
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:03,780
dynamical system and.

918
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,883
Okay, so, so in general,

919
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:12,455
we cannot assume that
under all circumstances they might, you

920
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:15,959
know, flow is going to be informative
as the behavior of our system.

921
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:20,130
And even if you can derive
for all the steps of the free energy,

922
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:24,134
basically it may be the case
that in some systems the average flow

923
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:27,270
that this thing is pointing
in the direction of the free energy.

924
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:31,508
But the system is not behaving
as minimizing the free.

925
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:35,579
And, you know, you can see it
in this example and the system is

926
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:40,917
minimizing the value of Y Square
is going to zero, not the behavior.

927
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:44,187
The value of one of these variables
is going to zero,

928
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,457
but the average flow points
in the opposite direction.

929
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:51,761
It does do that if there is flow,
if you interpret the average flow

930
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:54,931
as what the system is doing,
then you will believe that the system is

931
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:58,134
maximizing the square value

932
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:01,137
of Y, for example,
because it's diverging on

933
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,707
what it's doing is just minimizing it
because it's going to zero.

934
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,243
Okay.

935
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,812
And so in principle, if the

936
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:12,716
if the dynamics
of the most likely states on the on

937
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:16,753
the average flow are different,
then yeah.

938
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:18,255
So they, they,

939
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,957
they are going to be in general different
in that case,

940
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:23,093
they are not going to be informative.

941
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,463
What about the behavior of our system
except in very,

942
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:28,231
maybe very specific basis?

943
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,667
I mean, feel approximations
of this kind of thing.

944
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,372
And and this difference
is because the these

945
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:39,142
marginal flows arise from the decoupling
of a previous history of the system.

946
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:43,113
And we are not considering the effect
of the effects of preparations

947
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,248
of operations.

948
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:45,982
Okay.

949
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:49,052
Okay.

950
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:53,556
So just to finish on,
maybe let's give place to the discussion

951
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:59,362
and we in this work,
we explore the conditions to

952
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:03,366
on the assumptions
that are needed to derive the free energy

953
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:08,371
principle in linear or non-equilibrium,
stochastic systems and

954
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,207
some of this has

955
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:14,277
been explored for specific examples.

956
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:17,881
This work by Martin Bieler and others,

957
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:23,653
but I think it's interesting that we did
this for a general class of systems.

958
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,855
So it's not one example
that we solve numerically,

959
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:29,893
but we solve
a family of weekly persistence

960
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:33,530
and we see how general or not
are the different assumptions

961
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:37,801
or software software explore that we saw
how general are

962
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:42,472
the conditions and assumptions
of the principle and then we studied.

963
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,674
Under what conditions can we expect

964
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:50,347
and the principle to be informative
for the behavior of our system?

965
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:54,718
And we found that
the Michael Blanket condition emerged

966
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:59,089
at least as a good approximations
in the case of weak couplings.

967
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:02,792
But if the problems are not super weak,
are not very weak,

968
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:10,967
then we maybe we cannot expect
to be exact in our and however so removal

969
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,972
couplings are generally present
in all blocks of the system, so, so on.

970
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,407
They are going to be sealed.

971
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:20,076
Yes. In very,
very specific basis of this metric loop.

972
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:25,982
So maybe aberration two of the
for the theory will be to Yeah.

973
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:30,019
To explain
exactly what happens when these are not

974
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:33,390
sit on of what's what happens in the

975
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:37,227
so in

976
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,697
conclusion we would say that only very
specific structures are going to satisfy

977
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:44,768
their requirements to the right thing and

978
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:49,305
the to the right that the average flow
is pointing in the direction of the pre.

979
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:54,144
And the second point
about how informative the principle is,

980
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,113
we saw that the connection
between the free energy

981
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:01,584
and the marginal flow of the system
with the behave,

982
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:03,820
the actual behavior of our system is

983
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,524
is in most cases
very, very weak or even contradictory

984
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:11,127
as one can point in one direction
on the other end in the other.

985
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,964
So we found that this in general
that this marginal flows

986
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:17,734
are not capturing the actual
than only the system.

987
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:22,038
And this is because this marginal flow
ignoring the history of interactions

988
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:25,308
and we could intuitively think about this

989
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:26,876
so we can

990
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:30,847
have so we can imagine a system
that has many trajectories.

991
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:34,584
And if we fix the blanket at some point,
it just means

992
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,921
having different trajectories that
they are going to pass through this point

993
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:42,392
and the average flow
is going to complete the directions

994
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:45,829
or the direction of the
most likely derivative at that point.

995
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:48,932
Well, then the average derivative
of this system at that point.

996
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:53,203
But on any individual system
it'll have a very different behavior

997
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:55,371
which is represented by block length here

998
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,041
and so on.

999
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:01,644
And with this example for
this could be the end

1000
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:07,417
to distinguish between the population
of an individual organism

1001
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,387
and then of the organism and the rules

1002
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,791
and their behavior,
behavior of a population.

1003
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,260
So you can think that on average

1004
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:21,631
a population of organisms
is, is behaving in a way

1005
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:24,968
that and maximizing
the evolutionary fitness.

1006
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:29,205
But this can be largely uninformative

1007
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:33,643
for describing the behavior
of individual organisms, not that some

1008
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:39,182
sometimes of the kind of criticisms
that we hear and to some proposals

1009
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,851
in evolution, evolutionary psychology
and this kind of thing.

1010
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:42,118
Right.

1011
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:48,024
So, so even if at an average macro level,
you can detect some tendencies,

1012
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:50,994
in many cases, these tendencies

1013
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:55,198
can be uninformative about,
what an individual is doing.

1014
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:55,532
Right.

1015
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:59,402
And so so we think that it's interesting
to think about

1016
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:03,139
and if and when and in which cases

1017
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:08,011
the the and the conclusion
the conclusions derived by the

1018
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:14,250
of principle are going to be informative
about the behavior of an individual or

1019
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:19,589
or groups of individuals and so on.

1020
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:23,626
Still, we have to say that and even if

1021
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:27,230
we did this, what kind of political

1022
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:31,167
evaluation we are still in,

1023
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:35,772
we find that the day to day
motivation of the free energy

1024
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:38,942
principle is is very
is very suggestive on.

1025
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:44,347
And we think that the the aim
of connecting ideas from participating

1026
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:48,751
for us with the dynamics of complex
arising system is tremendously important

1027
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:53,222
as it will allow to apply the machinery
of what you see on an information

1028
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:57,160
theory to describe systems
that are intractable in practice.

1029
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,297
But but we also think that it's somehow
difficult to yes.

1030
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:05,568
The right in a theory
and without connections

1031
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:09,739
to the specific models right
that can allow you to

1032
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:13,376
to inspect in more detail
some assumptions or some consequences

1033
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:16,346
of the assumptions
that are difficult to grasp intuitively.

1034
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:19,048
In many cases. Right. And

1035
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:24,187
so so we find that the Yeah.

1036
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:27,457
That it would be interesting to Yeah.

1037
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:30,960
That exemplifying the steps of the theory
in a specific model

1038
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:35,398
is very useful to to Yeah.

1039
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:39,335
To is very useful to understand
the connections between the steps on,

1040
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:42,538
the how likely or not are different steps
and that this,

1041
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:46,776
this kind of exercise
can be really useful tool and yeah.

1042
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,712
To talk to the
yeah it can be really useful to

1043
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:53,282
to then understand the kind of

1044
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:57,754
the difficulties that we face
when having a theory and just learning.

1045
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:00,456
So this is the preparation
that we published,

1046
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:03,993
particularly the physics of the energy

1047
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:04,293
things.

1048
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:04,927
So let's.

1049
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:10,333
Thank you.

1050
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,368
Thanks for this awesome presentation.

1051
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:17,440
There was a lot there
and it was incredibly well presented.

1052
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:21,110
So for those who are watching life,
I would invite them

1053
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,246
to write questions in the chat.

1054
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,515
But first, Chris,

1055
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:29,752
I'll just pass it to you
for in initial comments if you would like

1056
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,692
unmute and then please continue

1057
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:41,464
by Chris your minute and then continue.

1058
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:41,664
Yeah.

1059
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:46,502
So Miguel, they we even though we
we finally put

1060
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:49,639
a particular
kind of technical presentation, we see

1061
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:53,843
we still find that
the kind of the ambition of the

1062
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:56,312
British press was laudable. Right.

1063
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:59,282
And we really something
we really want to embrace or yet

1064
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:02,018
we feel that it needs some future
development.

1065
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:02,685
Right.

1066
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:08,024
So I mean, I summarized those two issues
that go as presented in the first one

1067
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:12,061
is the problem
about trying to characterize

1068
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,896
the interaction of an agent
with this environment?

1069
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,465
So you can do this in two ways.

1070
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:18,868
And one cynical way
to draw kind of connections and direct

1071
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,437
functional connections between an agent
and the environment, right?

1072
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:23,639
So the sensors in the motors and so.

1073
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:27,577
On. Look,
there is a different way of understanding

1074
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:31,314
those interactions in terms
of the testing or the covariance matrix,

1075
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:36,085
which kind of great correlation system
rather than direct connections.

1076
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:40,490
And I think what Carl is doing
is kind of really work

1077
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:43,392
from the hat in awkward
rather than considering

1078
01:02:43,726 --> 01:02:47,597
the connections that underlie underlie
those to underlie those.

1079
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:47,797
Right.

1080
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:51,234
So he wants to assume there is a
mark up on it and wants to stop that.

1081
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:55,805
And then he's not so concerned
about trying work out the cost of systems

1082
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:58,407
that meets those conditions. And
I think that's a probably thing to do.

1083
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:00,476
Might be a very special set of systems.

1084
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:03,513
I think Kyle claims
that this kind of systems I'm interested

1085
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:06,149
in, I'm not really interested
in the those of assistance. Right.

1086
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:08,985
And what we've pointed out
is that we can't find those

1087
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:12,421
very generally in the cost assistance.

1088
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:17,160
And the second major issue
that I think Miguel's work points out

1089
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:21,531
is this decoupling between description
of the deterministic dynamics

1090
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:25,768
of the system versus
the average of an ensemble of systems.

1091
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:26,302
Right?

1092
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:29,005
So in there, in prior
accounts, the free energy principle,

1093
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:32,642
you actually write the deterministic
dynamics into your description.

1094
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,611
So when you're using for energy principle
to do composite systems,

1095
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:38,748
you are describing the extent
deterministic dynamics

1096
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:41,617
directly
in terms of your expectations and

1097
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:46,189
and flows on your expectations
or what the particular physics

1098
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:46,956
approach wants to do

1099
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:50,960
is try trying to find out the terms
that omics within the physics, right.

1100
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,063
It wants to see where it looks,
where it would like within

1101
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:57,333
the kind of general stochastic
dynamical system series of physics.

1102
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,735
And that's where the problems lie, right?

1103
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:04,207
So it's very hard to go from the physics
to description in terms

1104
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,007
a good description

1105
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:08,744
of the system, in terms
of the kind of dynamics on expectations.

1106
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:12,148
And so in that system,
so we can find this problem

1107
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:15,985
of a decoupling between description
in the dynamics of the

1108
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:21,123
the moments of assistant versus
the average over an ensemble of systems.

1109
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:23,426
This is where the problem lies, right.

1110
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:25,895
So there are over
an ensemble systems of free energy

1111
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:28,097
might be a good description,
but it's not connected

1112
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:31,801
to the causal explanation
of the dynamics of the specific system.

1113
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:36,239
So you attribute
kind of to the right kind of mechanistic

1114
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:38,875
description to that particular system
that you would like to.

1115
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:42,979
And so that's kind of my summary of.

1116
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:45,882
Thank you for the succinct summary.

1117
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,451
That's very helpful for many, I'm sure.

1118
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:52,154
Very if you'd like to unmute sorry,
I heard a feedback

1119
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:53,489
when Chris was speaking.

1120
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:56,425
So if you can unmute or.

1121
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:57,126
Yep, okay.

1122
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:58,227
Yeah. Ourself

1123
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:02,465
and then give any comments you'd like
and then I'll go to the questions.

1124
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:03,833
Yes, sir. Hi, I'm Ben.

1125
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:07,703
I'm obviously an author on this and I'm
currently now a postdoc in Oxford,

1126
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:11,974
but I work very closely with Chris
and Miguel at Sussex for a long time.

1127
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:14,176
So yeah, all of the time

1128
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:17,546
that I have some scheduling conflicts,
I jumped in for the questions.

1129
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,584
But yes, so I would just like,
I think an excellent job of explaining

1130
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:25,054
the issue with the average dynamics
of dynamic to the average.

1131
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:27,823
But I would just like to go in
and kind of try to meet.

1132
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,125
The important thing about the Michael

1133
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:33,195
Blankets is really this idea
that the mock there is a huge distinction

1134
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:37,333
between the statistical independence
relationships and this kind of like

1135
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:40,002
causal actual relationship
you get if you have the dynamics.

1136
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:42,772
And so it's quite easy
to confuse these two. Indeed.

1137
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:43,706
I think we

1138
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:46,742
we naturally conflate these two alike
until we start writing this paper.

1139
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:50,880
And a lot of
the literature also like conflate these

1140
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:54,784
and they have these intuitive diagrams
of like the bacteria with its cell

1141
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,919
wall and everything
and that's the blanket and so forth.

1142
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:59,755
But that's in this
because the level of the description

1143
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:01,657
like in the things
cause we have to talk to the black,

1144
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:04,660
but that's not the same at all
as the statistical description,

1145
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,063
which is, you know,
the statistical interdependencies

1146
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,598
between the blanket and the internal
and the external states.

1147
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:13,002
And I think it needs quite
a lot of thinking about to what extent

1148
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:17,206
these causal mappings
actually hold up and sort of

1149
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,710
actually so sustained by the statistical
mappings or vice versa.

1150
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:23,279
We found that linear systems
with lots of cases

1151
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:25,081
where they don't
and they don't seem to match at all.

1152
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:28,351
And so yeah, it takes
a lot of kind of intuition to really,

1153
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:32,021
I think need to be built about what
these Michael blankets mean on an actual

1154
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:32,855
causal level.

1155
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:35,758
Thanks for this comment.

1156
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:37,760
And again, people can right questions.

1157
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,962
If I could just actually add something
about the difference

1158
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:43,165
between the causal structure
and the correlative structure.

1159
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:46,969
You can imagine on a market,
there's companies that are closely

1160
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:50,072
related to each other, but
their stock prices are not correlated.

1161
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:53,242
And similarly in the cell,

1162
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:57,213
we often make networks that are based
upon like gene co expression, so genes

1163
01:06:57,213 --> 01:07:00,516
with correlated expression
and then there's gene regulatory networks

1164
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:03,819
or protein protein interaction networks
that are like proteins that touch.

1165
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:07,289
But those proteins
usually don't have correlated

1166
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:10,659
expression because you might upregulate
one that then represses another.

1167
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:11,761
So they're not expressed

1168
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:14,030
in a correlated fashion,
but they have causal relationships.

1169
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:17,967
So, so and it's people slipping
between oh,

1170
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,137
gene regulatory network,
you know, co expression interactions,

1171
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:27,410
certainly conflating the causal structure
of a system with the physical structure

1172
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:31,547
or the correlative structure
is a broad category error.

1173
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:36,419
And I think your work does an incredible
job highlighting the difference

1174
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:41,490
and we're slipping between these easily
confused modes of thinking about networks

1175
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:45,227
and then also conflating that with
reality or all of reality,

1176
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,097
just very well done to.

1177
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,298
These points.

1178
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:50,399
Yeah, thanks.

1179
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,803
I know that example would be like
the difference between structural

1180
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:57,840
connectivity, functional connectivity
and effective connectivity

1181
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:01,844
in the brain
that you can have some structure about

1182
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:03,679
and then you can have
a statistical correlations.

1183
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:04,914
But even then

1184
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,850
the dynamics can behave differently
because these you have like these

1185
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:10,853
asymmetries in

1186
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:13,823
how one variable is connected
to another on on the opposite end

1187
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:17,493
and this is also in the work,
the relation with the solenoid flows

1188
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:19,562
that a couple of something
different then.

1189
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:20,563
So yeah.

1190
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:21,297
So it's

1191
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:25,634
not very complicated to disentangle
all the all these different levels one.

1192
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:28,037
But two to just do justice to the office.

1193
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:29,972
I mean,
I think they're aware of this difference.

1194
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:31,006
Obviously, Carlos

1195
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:34,944
Creek is very aware of this difference,
but they feel that the theory sits above

1196
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:39,648
the correlated structures and they're not
considering those causal structures.

1197
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:42,918
I think maybe some confusion
might emerge in previous papers,

1198
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:45,988
but in recent papers I think it's
very clear that he wants to sit above

1199
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:47,923
the causal reactions

1200
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:50,126
pool.

1201
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,762
So I hope that by bringing the math
to examples

1202
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:56,132
of like the market evolution

1203
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:01,403
and fMRI, we can hopefully have
a lot of people giving their perspective.

1204
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,572
So I'm going to just go
with the question from the chair

1205
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:06,041
and then I have some questions
that I wrote down.

1206
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:09,245
So first question, thanks a lot.

1207
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:14,083
I was wondering whether you would assume
that going to nonlinear systems,

1208
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:17,586
the limitations that you find
be even stronger?

1209
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:20,856
Or would there maybe be an argument
that there could be nonlinear systems

1210
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:22,925
that fulfill these assumptions?

1211
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:26,562
So what will relaxing the linear
assumption do for the math

1212
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:30,933
that you describe today?

1213
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:31,634
Okay.

1214
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:35,171
But that's a
that's a difficult to to answer question.

1215
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,373
Yeah, I think so.

1216
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:43,012
So so first is I think is is difficult
to well, it's difficult to solve because

1217
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:46,248
in nonlinear systems in

1218
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:50,252
general, we cannot find the kind
analytical solutions that we have.

1219
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:50,920
Right.

1220
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:56,292
And even in the case of linear systems,
we found that we can only solve

1221
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:59,828
the case of weak objects
and in the case of weak openings.

1222
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:02,898
And we will do the trick

1223
01:10:02,898 --> 01:10:05,935
of considering
different orders of expansions.

1224
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:09,805
And we saw that,
including stronger couplings,

1225
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:13,142
make things more difficult
rather than rather than easier.

1226
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:14,843
Okay.

1227
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:17,246
And intuitively,

1228
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:21,750
I think my intuition
about nonlinear systems

1229
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:26,021
is that the case may be
it may may be similar many systems.

1230
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:26,522
Right.

1231
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:32,561
That having strong yet
having more intricate couplings

1232
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:35,531
more intricate dynamical coupling
school odd

1233
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:38,500
extra terms

1234
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:41,804
to some of the mattresses
that we are expecting to see zero

1235
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:44,139
like in the blankets

1236
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:46,976
but this is not something
we're going to see because of

1237
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:51,480
or you will have unexpected effects
from chaos, for example.

1238
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:55,851
I think that's something that
for a purpose is sometimes.

1239
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:58,320
But I don't know.

1240
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,757
I think maybe one interesting
direction of research will be

1241
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:05,561
doing a similar expansion
to the one that we did

1242
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:09,431
to say, okay, we have an almost
linear system, but we can see

1243
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:14,303
there are very small effects of non
linearity and see what kind of currents

1244
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:17,740
these knots to the to the matters
is that we are.

1245
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:21,910
So this this will involve
a very different analytical solution.

1246
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:25,648
But I think there is some up
for coming work

1247
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:31,687
and from a yeah from some people
can kind of sloping in that sense.

1248
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,590
So I think it's an open questions but

1249
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:40,362
but I do think that in many cases
this is going to be challenging to

1250
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:43,766
to to compare yet to see that linearity

1251
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:47,303
is going to be assumption.

1252
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,171
I mean you feel the intuition
is that you might be able to

1253
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:50,739
solve in specific systems

1254
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,642
what you used to.

1255
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:56,211
The idea that you'll solve it
in a classic nonlinear system

1256
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:59,181
seems seems doubtful. Right.

1257
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:01,383
But you might be able to follow examples
that we see

1258
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:03,786
augment with nonlinear actions
that meet the criteria.

1259
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,822
Maybe if you constrained yourself
to a particular

1260
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:10,092
evolved living system,
that might be okay, right?

1261
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:13,862
But if you want to say more general
about the emerging self-organization

1262
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:17,333
in a classroom is inconsistent
and perhaps run into trouble.

1263
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:21,103
Due to when will go ahead very first.

1264
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:25,240
That I think yeah I agree with Kristen
but obviously with nonlinear system

1265
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:29,244
see how much bigger space of systems
and so you can probably find edge cases

1266
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:32,681
where all the conditions not perfectly
but I mean the general intuition

1267
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:33,716
these dynamical systems

1268
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:37,052
the is the nonlinear systems
are a lot harder to deal with in general.

1269
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:41,457
And so I'm not going to probably
if it's not satisfied in any systems,

1270
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:42,991
there's no obvious reason

1271
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:46,261
why it should be satisfied
in nonlinear systems and especially issue

1272
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:49,098
with the dynamics of the average versus
the average of the dynamics

1273
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:52,267
like the case we did, we have a linear
Gaussian system is probably the ideal

1274
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:56,138
possible case for this because obviously
the average the linear operator in the

1275
01:12:56,138 --> 01:12:59,775
in the Gaussian case, the mode in
the actual average is the same.

1276
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:00,376
And so you have

1277
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:03,712
all these nice properties, none of which
will hold in the nominee general case.

1278
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:08,417
And so I think in that nonlinear system
almost certainly can much much worse

1279
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:10,519
so that specific issue.

1280
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:15,391
Yeah those talk to and that I think so
so maybe so one question is

1281
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:19,428
is whether there is linear systems
in which some of the problems

1282
01:13:19,428 --> 01:13:20,295
are going to go away.

1283
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:23,465
But maybe the
the right question is what happens in

1284
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:27,903
the kind of nonlinear systems
that that we expect in a living system.

1285
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:32,541
Right on on what we know
from living systems that often involves

1286
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:39,415
a bifurcation and so are critical points
that in that lead to a long range

1287
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:44,286
correlations on correlations slots
that propagates through the whole system

1288
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:47,289
and and this kind of that
can be very difficult.

1289
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:51,193
So so the kind of isolation between
internal and strong states can be,

1290
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:55,831
I think, can be challenging in
when this is the case right.

1291
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:59,968
Thanks for all these excellent points

1292
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,438
in complexity.

1293
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:06,442
We often talk about nonlinear
as being like non animals.

1294
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,010
It's like all of them.

1295
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:11,780
So it's even harder
certainly to make a general stance.

1296
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,484
And Bear now was a really interesting
point that as the state space

1297
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:18,654
what's possible increases,
there may be more and more edge cases.

1298
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:22,591
And that kind of brings it back
to the question about evolved systems.

1299
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:26,495
Not every parameter combination of cells
is going to be functional,

1300
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,798
and so maybe we're only dealing with

1301
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:32,568
that vanishingly small amount
or some other.

1302
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:33,735
I'm not going to, you know,

1303
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:37,339
go to technical details on the fly,
but that could be one aspect.

1304
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:41,810
And also it was such an interesting point

1305
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:45,314
during the discussion when you explicitly
brought it back to evolution,

1306
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:48,450
like fitness is the law of the land
in a way

1307
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:51,653
at a level that doesn't explain

1308
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:55,591
motor behavior in the moment to moment
there nested timescales.

1309
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:58,660
And so, of course, there's motor behavior
that's maladaptive and long run.

1310
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:03,065
You wouldn't see that under a stationary
ecology and da da da da da da da.

1311
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:05,300
You start adding some assumptions in

1312
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,437
and it's just,
I think, a very fruitful mapping

1313
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:13,442
that will be explored
for time to come with the relationship

1314
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:17,613
between population, population
level claims under stationary

1315
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:21,483
environments, population
level claims under dynamical environments

1316
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:26,121
at an individual level, claims under
stationary and unchanging environments.

1317
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:29,791
So it's just a lot of topics
that come into play and

1318
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:32,995
to have them integrate these kinds of

1319
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:37,165
points that you're raising,
which are often implicit errors

1320
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:39,935
in other areas,
they're being drawn together

1321
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:45,941
and brought to the forefront
in a way that is quite novel.

1322
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:46,742
Okay.

1323
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:50,946
Again, since the technical details,
I believe, stand best in the presentation

1324
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:54,850
as you provided as well as in the paper,
we can take any,

1325
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:57,920
but I think that will be the place
where the discussion continues.

1326
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:02,658
I just kind of want to ask a few other
questions to provide a little context.

1327
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:05,761
So for maybe whoever wants to answer,

1328
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:09,231
how did you come to be studying
the question this way?

1329
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:13,235
Were you working with
the FP and exploring new kinds of math,

1330
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:16,371
or did have more of an experience

1331
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:20,242
with the mathematics and then see the FP
coming up onto the radar?

1332
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:24,947
Like, how did each of you
come to be working on it this way.

1333
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:25,347
Okay.

1334
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:29,017
I'll go because I think I

1335
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:29,818
can follow.

1336
01:16:29,818 --> 01:16:32,588
So, I mean,
I wrote a review of a few years ago

1337
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:36,091
now of the original principle
at that time it was,

1338
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:40,495
but it was quite
an enigmatic principle and understood it.

1339
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,664
I mean, the reason
I originally I didn't like it.

1340
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:46,802
I didn't like the of the notion
of representation, thinking pregnant

1341
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:50,772
and the idea of the screening principle
kind of representing generative models.

1342
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:52,307
But I actually came to like it

1343
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:55,677
as a cognitive framework and I still do
like is as a cognitive framework

1344
01:16:56,745 --> 01:17:00,782
and I still still think within the regime
of describing sensory motor loops,

1345
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:04,486
abstract sensing and cognitive systems,
it's very, very useful.

1346
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:08,290
But then obviously there has been
a rapid development of this principle

1347
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:11,493
into, into into a grander claim.

1348
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:16,932
I find this principle in the physics
and in the course of physical systems,

1349
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:20,435
and that's where I started
working with the young girls,

1350
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:24,139
got a real strong background
in statistical physics.

1351
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,141
And that's basically
what's led us to this, to kind of

1352
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:27,943
really go back
to some of those assumptions.

1353
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:29,544
So I do separate the two things.

1354
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:34,916
I think there's still a very fine,
the cognitive account very feeling,

1355
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:38,120
even though we find these problems
in these physics

1356
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,523
examples.

1357
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:44,259
Yeah. Yeah. I make this all then.

1358
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,562
Well yeah for some I think when

1359
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:53,969
I started to be involved
with the principle more recently I yeah.

1360
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:56,772
For some things that is something
that I had on the radar but,

1361
01:17:57,406 --> 01:18:02,611
but actually understand it
what it meant like it's always seemed

1362
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:06,548
it seemed kind of scary
until I didn't did the equations on

1363
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:11,920
and I guess that's part of the motivation
for doing this work is

1364
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:15,691
it was to as a way of understanding what

1365
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:19,628
what the theory consisted of
because then you could go

1366
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:23,265
through the mathematical descriptions
and it's often really hard to know

1367
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,202
what the what they imply
or what they mean

1368
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:30,672
exactly in the in the sense
that they are complicated math.

1369
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:31,239
Right.

1370
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:34,743
And I guess that they're there

1371
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:37,979
during my research career,
the way I thought,

1372
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:43,118
how I had four or understanding
complicated masses

1373
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:48,557
by building models on this understanding
by building philosophy that's how you

1374
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:53,161
so so I think that the initial attempts
to to build this system

1375
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:56,398
it was an attempt
to really understand okay

1376
01:18:56,398 --> 01:19:00,001
this is step I can grasp mathematical
more or less what it means.

1377
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,203
But, but

1378
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:05,040
let's have a model since parameter
there's something with the and so right

1379
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,777
so so that's the lesson or lesson

1380
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:13,381
the journey that I'm on the once
having that having the model then say,

1381
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:18,353
okay, I'll make up something more general
than just some specific parameters.

1382
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:23,558
So try to see how we're going to have
an ideological solution and so on.

1383
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:25,160
So, so yeah.

1384
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,930
So I think, yeah,
this exercise is very fruitful,

1385
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:31,800
both on a personal level
and also in a scientific level.

1386
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:35,771
Because you've been on your way
to learning, you can develop things

1387
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:38,707
that can be useful for the very boring,
you know.

1388
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:40,976
Awesome thing.

1389
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:45,347
All of those answers are very transparent
and also and also just if you like.

1390
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:47,883
Now, that's why, you know, Miguel.

1391
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:52,220
So just mute while Walburn
gives a different book driver.

1392
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:56,525
To action to follow up on the point
really about just the importance

1393
01:19:56,525 --> 01:20:00,462
of actually trying to build models,
because I think my perspective

1394
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,532
a lot of the of developments and problems
we discovered basically came from

1395
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:05,333
actually looking at specific models

1396
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:08,970
and then thinking, hey, this, this
doesn't quite work as it says it should,

1397
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:11,106
because basically things

1398
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:13,108
just become an awful lot more clearer
if you actually try

1399
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:17,179
and build them, rather than just staring
at these sort of symbols on the page.

1400
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:19,581
And so I think that's really the key
to it, to a lot of it

1401
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:22,651
is simply trying to construct a system
where it's working and say, hey,

1402
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:24,519
it's things aren't getting quite
as you know,

1403
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:27,155
the particular physics
monograph says they should be.

1404
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:29,257
Cool.

1405
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:33,228
And it's so interesting
and maybe even appropriate that action

1406
01:20:33,228 --> 01:20:36,865
became relevance
for this inference problem.

1407
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:41,269
So it's not just conceptual
because we must be engaging

1408
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:45,106
in literature and conversation
in the work and going through it

1409
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:48,310
ourselves in order to infer deeper.

1410
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:52,480
We can't just wait at square one
and look all the way to square 1000.

1411
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,251
We have to be working along the way
individually and maybe as a group too.

1412
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:59,120
So here's a question from the chat.

1413
01:20:59,120 --> 01:20:59,855
Brilliant talk.

1414
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:05,193
I wonder if Carl and others will respond
to challenges presented in this paper.

1415
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:08,897
Also, because the paper is written
in such coherent style.

1416
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:13,201
Wonder What would you recommend
for beginners to study in the AVP?

1417
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:19,808
Nice question.

1418
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:22,510
What do you wish you knew at the outset?

1419
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:26,581
Even if it's a new resource,
what courses or topics

1420
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:31,152
would you recommend having a familiarity
with or what are the on ramps for

1421
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:34,623
somebody who's not in this area
of research and practice

1422
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:37,292
how can they best
be on wrapping themselves?

1423
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:40,595
So I recommend Baron's hope

1424
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:45,901
he's got a nice repository of papers
which go from very introductory papers

1425
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:49,838
to very solid state papers in nicely
organized ways to provide their own.

1426
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:51,773
Is it public at publicly accessible?

1427
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:54,276
But we've.

1428
01:21:54,309 --> 01:21:55,343
Publicly accessible.

1429
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:57,979
Yeah, I could post that in the chat
or something if you want. Yes.

1430
01:21:57,979 --> 01:22:00,782
Say hello in the YouTube chat
and then I'll make you a moderator

1431
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:02,317
and you can post links.

1432
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:04,452
So I'll. Yeah.

1433
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,021
So then.

1434
01:22:06,021 --> 01:22:08,423
Okay, I'll continue on that.

1435
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:09,324
Yeah.

1436
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:12,527
I mean regarding the actual question
about what to sort of start with,

1437
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:14,696
I think that depends a lot
on what you want to do.

1438
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:18,333
So there's kind of three
big topics in my mind

1439
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:21,870
is that so if the step is a hardcore
math of the theory

1440
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:25,807
as it's presented in particular physics,
and so that I'm not sure

1441
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:29,010
there is necessarily a good beginner's
level results at this point,

1442
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:32,580
like there is essentially
when our paper tries

1443
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:35,583
to get to a quite straightforwardly
and then they have you have to Thomas

1444
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:40,121
Blanket since the catechism is a paper
which covers the main points

1445
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:43,758
but it's not like a tutorial
that states like this is x, y,

1446
01:22:43,758 --> 01:22:46,594
and then really it's just
the particular physics monograph is where

1447
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:51,032
most of that information is like this
and yet a really nice laying out of it.

1448
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:51,900
And obviously we

1449
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:55,603
try and do it on our paper, but obviously
we're also focused on the actual point

1450
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:57,739
you want to make. It's
not just like specifically tutorial.

1451
01:22:58,239 --> 01:22:58,473
Yeah.

1452
01:22:58,473 --> 01:23:00,542
I mean the other two things,
obviously the active

1453
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:03,778
sort of discrete state based active
inference that people talk a lot about.

1454
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:05,981
I think the best resource for that
at the moment

1455
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:08,550
is probably Lancelot,
the cost review on that.

1456
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,652
And then there is yeah,

1457
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:11,686
just then essentially

1458
01:23:11,686 --> 01:23:13,922
there's some several calls papers
which I think

1459
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:16,891
I talk about my GitHub apology, which is
kind of getting into more detail.

1460
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:18,927
But Lance's review for
that is really good.

1461
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:21,596
And then there's
a sort of more continuous state based

1462
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:25,500
predictive coding style,
which I think I think Chris is out.

1463
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,703
His 2017 review is
is the best for that to be honest.

1464
01:23:29,904 --> 01:23:32,140
So yeah, are

1465
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:35,844
honorable.

1466
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:40,015
Yeah, I think Chris is one is the one
if you want to understand the whole

1467
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:43,018
the theory and all the methods
of how this works very nicely.

1468
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:44,352
I was like, if you want to build

1469
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:48,156
a predictive coding network which works
and you have that sort of more more

1470
01:23:48,156 --> 01:23:52,961
focused on the neuroscience,
I would say that the way to go.

1471
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:53,928
If I can ask one now

1472
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:57,932
before Michael's answer, when you said
neuroscience, do you see them

1473
01:23:57,932 --> 01:24:02,871
as just historically juxtaposed
or do you see some of these approaches

1474
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:08,276
as encompassing one another
or being prerequisite to one another?

1475
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:11,346
So I think the idea is that the sort of

1476
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:15,050
in the particular physics
monograph encompasses all of them

1477
01:24:15,283 --> 01:24:19,120
and that that the idea is that
these are two specific models.

1478
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,556
You know, you have a specific
have a specific vibrational density,

1479
01:24:21,589 --> 01:24:22,624
specific generative model.

1480
01:24:22,624 --> 01:24:24,659
And then you work through the mathematics
at these

1481
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:26,728
these process theories is called
close them out.

1482
01:24:27,028 --> 01:24:30,632
I mean, I think practice to the extent
they can stand alone away from whatever

1483
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:33,301
the particular physics monograph says,
because they are with you

1484
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:35,970
making their empirical predictions
about the brain or whatever.

1485
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:37,972
And so you can actually
totally test these.

1486
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:40,842
And so even if all of particular
physics is wrong,

1487
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:43,611
then these things could be like invites
of ascertained objectivity,

1488
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:46,614
if you like, and these things
could just not be what the brain is doing

1489
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:47,982
between something else.

1490
01:24:47,982 --> 01:24:50,452
They I think they stand alone,
although in theory

1491
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:53,221
the particular physics monograph
is kind of meant to subsume them all.

1492
01:24:54,722 --> 01:24:55,890
Thanks for that response.

1493
01:24:55,890 --> 01:25:00,295
And Miguel to original question,
what would you recommend a beginner

1494
01:25:00,295 --> 01:25:03,865
to be learning and looking into.

1495
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:05,700
And yeah, I'm not so sure.

1496
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,570
For me.

1497
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:13,741
So I think, yeah, you started
with the Thomas Spar paper about Marco

1498
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:18,246
blankets and promising geometry
and then going back to the

1499
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:23,885
to the monograph
of a particular physics on the.

1500
01:25:24,252 --> 01:25:28,022
But but it was,
it was challenging because yeah, it's

1501
01:25:28,857 --> 01:25:32,594
it wasn't complex on and yeah it was

1502
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:37,665
and I kind of like it was useful
to Martin be this paper are technical

1503
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:41,436
critical of the front end
yeah the free energy principle

1504
01:25:41,936 --> 01:25:45,206
in the sense
it was very technical and formal but

1505
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:48,710
it was useful that they tried
to encapsulate

1506
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:52,780
the different conditions
in a way similar to what we do here.

1507
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:56,818
And I think that was helpful
to try to to differentiate different,

1508
01:25:56,818 --> 01:26:01,589
the different steps which are not always
so clear in the, in the literature.

1509
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,591
So, so yeah.

1510
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:07,996
I think, yeah, I think there is at least
for the part regarding the free energy

1511
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:12,667
principles describing there
in, in particular physics, it's

1512
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:16,137
and yeah,
we need to maybe get our tutorials on

1513
01:26:16,638 --> 01:26:20,842
but yeah, more materials
that are opposed to this introduction. So

1514
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,212
thanks for these responses.

1515
01:26:24,212 --> 01:26:29,450
And I know in our active lab
and in many other associated efforts

1516
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:34,956
that the focus on accessibility and,
communicating these ideas in a way that's

1517
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:38,893
going to be helpful to people from
many backgrounds is a top priority.

1518
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:42,764
So way back in the introduction,
you know, 120 times

1519
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:46,501
steps ago,
you talked about new visualizations.

1520
01:26:46,801 --> 01:26:51,339
And it's definitely the case that paper
after paper will use some classical

1521
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:56,377
figures, let's just say,
and I'm excited by visualizations.

1522
01:26:56,377 --> 01:27:00,381
And so I was curious,
just maybe whoever wants to go in for it,

1523
01:27:00,848 --> 01:27:05,887
what would the new representations
do or be communicate?

1524
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:11,259
What style or what made
you just wanting to explore visually?

1525
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:14,696
And how is that in feedback
with the research?

1526
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:17,332
Hmm. Okay.

1527
01:27:17,332 --> 01:27:18,466
Yeah, I think that's interesting.

1528
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:19,400
I like at some point

1529
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:23,304
I kept looking through the literature
and it's paper up there, paper the same,

1530
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:26,841
the same graph of what in our brain
since Rome with the logo.

1531
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:27,809
I see this as a non.

1532
01:27:29,544 --> 01:27:31,145
Yes. So at some point it

1533
01:27:31,145 --> 01:27:35,450
stops being useful to write there
because they're like some but it's this

1534
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:41,856
realization can give unique intuitions
to some extent, very and so on.

1535
01:27:41,856 --> 01:27:43,691
At some point I yeah.

1536
01:27:43,691 --> 01:27:45,159
I wants to know more about that.

1537
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:46,928
So it was not,

1538
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:49,397
it's not always a straightforward,
okay, there's an arrow about

1539
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:50,431
what does it mean?

1540
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:55,637
So why is this by their external or I'm
yeah so so

1541
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:59,941
the difference here is that we have
where we developed them

1542
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:03,011
with the idea of okay
how can we intuitively

1543
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:07,282
express these very complex

1544
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:12,220
assumptions and ask
how do you feel that flow?

1545
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:15,323
Or This is sort of challenging
or an idea?

1546
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:18,693
I don't I'm
not sure if we did a good job there, but

1547
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:24,232
I think it's in that
I think any intuition about the principle

1548
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:28,236
are are really hard to capture
because they are quite complex.

1549
01:28:28,236 --> 01:28:31,606
And I think it's interesting
to try to put in the directions

1550
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:35,943
of, of having new images
that try to at least try to capture

1551
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:39,347
that, that intuition of some
and what they mean or how to them.

1552
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:40,848
Yeah.

1553
01:28:41,282 --> 01:28:42,450
Yeah. Because of them.

1554
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:45,787
I think you have to do with the theory

1555
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:50,191
based on your intuition
or cooperating with intuitions, that part

1556
01:28:50,191 --> 01:28:53,461
that you don't understand yet, especially
if you're learning this kind of thing,

1557
01:28:53,461 --> 01:28:56,931
I think is incredibly useful
in general in Central

1558
01:29:00,068 --> 01:29:00,601
pressure.

1559
01:29:00,601 --> 01:29:03,604
Bear And
would you like to add on that point?

1560
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:05,740
No, just that we found it hard.

1561
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:10,311
I mean, because it's so,
so many different types of interactions

1562
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:13,481
we want to represent
typically monolithic arrows

1563
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:16,651
between agent and environment
seems to dominate everything.

1564
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:16,884
Right?

1565
01:29:16,884 --> 01:29:18,986
But when you start drilling down
into this,

1566
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:21,122
we have the difference in causal
and functional.

1567
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:24,826
Obviously people like Perl and I stuff,
I've done this in the philosophy, right?

1568
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:26,794
And be very clear
about different types of interaction.

1569
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:29,497
But I think it
and especially modeling work

1570
01:29:30,098 --> 01:29:33,368
is become a bit clouded and location

1571
01:29:33,568 --> 01:29:35,803
especially in the area of the free energy
principle.

1572
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:36,771
But yeah, know

1573
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:41,309
whether I we got in a really good job
but it does look complicated.

1574
01:29:41,309 --> 01:29:45,046
The final product is complicated
looking right but it does do justice

1575
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:48,282
to these different
types of interaction. And.

1576
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:51,452
Baron anything on that or no.

1577
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:53,020
Yeah, go for it then.

1578
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:55,256
I would just say that I agree.

1579
01:29:55,256 --> 01:29:56,891
Like I'm
not naturally a sort of visual person

1580
01:29:56,891 --> 01:30:00,795
who actually looks at the figures,
but I think just the what we gathered

1581
01:30:00,795 --> 01:30:01,562
was actually really good.

1582
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:03,631
And it's the of thing
that if you actually look at them and try

1583
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:07,301
and understand them, it will yield
a lot of dividends in terms of quickly

1584
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:10,405
getting to grasp on precisely
what's being said, what's not being said,

1585
01:30:10,805 --> 01:30:13,207
because yeah, it's very easy
to having to sort of hazy interaction

1586
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:16,544
without knowing what that really means.

1587
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:19,781
It's The same again as a geneticist,
it makes me think of,

1588
01:30:19,781 --> 01:30:24,485
oh, you know, nodes are genes and edges
are interactions which kind of those

1589
01:30:24,485 --> 01:30:29,190
multiple classes and does one paper
use it one way and go to the methods.

1590
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:30,525
And it's one way in this paper

1591
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:33,327
and it's another one in another way,
but it's being cited.

1592
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:36,731
And so it takes a lot of subtlety
to pull back to that question

1593
01:30:36,731 --> 01:30:40,101
about what kind of interactions
are being discussed.

1594
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:43,204
And then, Chris, what you just said,
there's like

1595
01:30:43,204 --> 01:30:45,640
it's a high

1596
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:50,278
praise the work that it does justice
because that's what we hope

1597
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:54,682
the bleeding edge does
for the rest of the knife.

1598
01:30:54,682 --> 01:30:57,351
And the handle is represented

1599
01:30:57,785 --> 01:31:00,721
visually on a manifold
that doesn't deceive.

1600
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:04,892
It's not drawing hard lines
where none exist.

1601
01:31:05,226 --> 01:31:10,498
It's not making false positive or false
negatives or false claims visually,

1602
01:31:10,765 --> 01:31:14,669
because the visual rhetoric is
how many people will learn

1603
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:16,437
and think about these things.

1604
01:31:16,437 --> 01:31:20,641
And so that's it makes all the difference
whether there's a bi directional arrow

1605
01:31:20,675 --> 01:31:24,612
graphically or not,
because people are going to unpack it,

1606
01:31:24,612 --> 01:31:26,113
especially if they're not going to go

1607
01:31:26,113 --> 01:31:30,151
into the and level of math,
they're going to unpack it literally

1608
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:35,423
and with the knowledge that that's
what the expert represented in their aim.

1609
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:38,893
So I really do think it's
particularly important in this field

1610
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:42,897
because there is a separate between this
technical morass that sits at the bottom

1611
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:45,967
and obviously the ambition
and what it promises.

1612
01:31:45,967 --> 01:31:49,170
So, so many people are attracted
to this particular theory.

1613
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:53,941
And then but not not everyone has got
time to go in and design for them.

1614
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:56,410
So the thing is
the level of these figures

1615
01:31:56,677 --> 01:31:59,647
and trying to make this course
and so on that level.

1616
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:01,749
So it's vital that those figures

1617
01:32:01,749 --> 01:32:05,486
become very clear and very pointed
in what they try to communicate.

1618
01:32:05,486 --> 01:32:10,057
And any kind of lack of clarity is
is going to send the whole community off

1619
01:32:10,057 --> 01:32:11,092
in the wrong direction, particularly

1620
01:32:11,092 --> 01:32:13,261
if you, you know,
the kind of person who wants to go in

1621
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:15,263
and do the fiscal physics
and want to do more

1622
01:32:15,263 --> 01:32:18,799
the philosophy
or cognitive science of these systems.

1623
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,302
So it's vital that we get them right
in this particular field,

1624
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:22,036
particularly, I think.

1625
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:24,539
Yes, it's

1626
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:27,642
I think there's an xkcd cartoon,
you know, about where

1627
01:32:27,642 --> 01:32:31,846
the fields are arranged, but especially
when working with the theory itself,

1628
01:32:32,146 --> 01:32:36,918
it should be lean
and as low dimensional as possible

1629
01:32:36,918 --> 01:32:38,653
and not any more,

1630
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:42,123
because otherwise it will be unpacked
in ways that are just going to be

1631
01:32:42,123 --> 01:32:43,457
completely discordant.

1632
01:32:43,457 --> 01:32:47,261
But if it can be represented
in sort of like a build in or like an opt

1633
01:32:47,261 --> 01:32:50,331
in at this level, instead of trying
to explain backwards from what

1634
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:54,802
we could do in the future in the math,
we need to start with the axioms

1635
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:58,573
and clarify what they are
and then unpack those.

1636
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:00,775
And then it's like
just like with any other area of theory.

1637
01:33:00,975 --> 01:33:04,645
Did you disagree with the axioms or did
you disagree with how they were applied?

1638
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:08,883
Because those are the areas
where there's sort of controlled space

1639
01:33:09,116 --> 01:33:10,351
for discussion.

1640
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:12,987
But then something like
I don't think it would work that way

1641
01:33:12,987 --> 01:33:14,855
in a human computer interface.

1642
01:33:14,855 --> 01:33:18,559
It's neither here
nor there for the level of rigor

1643
01:33:18,559 --> 01:33:22,563
that you approach the
questions with today.

1644
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:22,830
Yeah.

1645
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,869
So I can ask any other questions
or we can see

1646
01:33:28,869 --> 01:33:30,438
if anyone else posts in the chat.

1647
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:33,908
But that was actually one of my questions
was are those all the axioms?

1648
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:39,380
How do we represent axioms or
how do we even know what those axioms are

1649
01:33:39,647 --> 01:33:43,184
without getting into like too much of a
whole, you know, incompleteness thing?

1650
01:33:43,551 --> 01:33:47,088
What are the axioms where they what
you put in the paper and nothing else,

1651
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:48,723
those are necessary and sufficient.

1652
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:51,359
Or is there some other stuff happening?

1653
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:54,362
It's Our ambition
just to say before let me go on to that.

1654
01:33:54,362 --> 01:33:57,331
But then we have an ambition
to write a kind of more

1655
01:33:57,331 --> 01:34:00,701
accessible version of this paper, which
hopefully be done in the next few months.

1656
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:02,103
So we want to do exactly that.

1657
01:34:02,103 --> 01:34:05,539
We want to draw away from the hostage
cycle physics and have this paper

1658
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:09,577
underneath it
and then even be more even more clear

1659
01:34:09,844 --> 01:34:13,080
about the kind of overall narrative
of what we're suggesting here.

1660
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:17,051
And we can answer those questions
to ask very directly, hopefully

1661
01:34:17,752 --> 01:34:20,221
for the specific
case of let me go answer.

1662
01:34:24,592 --> 01:34:26,627
Up. A new book and then continue.

1663
01:34:26,627 --> 01:34:29,597
Thank you.

1664
01:34:29,597 --> 01:34:30,364
Yeah, yeah.

1665
01:34:30,364 --> 01:34:35,403
The two ideas that the yeah,
I think that the core principle is one

1666
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:39,607
has been an evolving theory
and there is different versions

1667
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:43,010
of teaching with a different person
and that then yes,

1668
01:34:43,077 --> 01:34:46,380
nothing has been being proposed on

1669
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:49,350
least for me.

1670
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:52,219
It was a difficult job to

1671
01:34:52,253 --> 01:34:56,424
to try to get to that, to somewhat
to summarize the theory in that way

1672
01:34:56,424 --> 01:35:00,294
or to add up
the exact connections of the steps.

1673
01:35:00,294 --> 01:35:04,231
Because until sometimes the
some descriptions are better, but then

1674
01:35:05,633 --> 01:35:08,769
yeah,
I think that's, yeah, that's important.

1675
01:35:09,303 --> 01:35:09,537
Yeah.

1676
01:35:09,537 --> 01:35:14,308
An important avenue for continuing
the research in this field is try to

1677
01:35:15,176 --> 01:35:18,212
do more accessible descriptions

1678
01:35:18,212 --> 01:35:21,549
or more or try to encapsulate them in

1679
01:35:22,349 --> 01:35:25,820
and in this way
or try to get just to show this sequence

1680
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:29,323
more clearly, at least
for an introductory conference, right?

1681
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:29,890
Yeah.

1682
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:34,261
It's been it's been very much a very
living, very different from this one.

1683
01:35:34,261 --> 01:35:38,132
I wrote that review back in the day,
which is that there is this development.

1684
01:35:38,132 --> 01:35:41,769
It's very clear in the in the series
of publications that comes out.

1685
01:35:41,769 --> 01:35:46,941
And I think things things have changed,
obviously, as they as they as develop.

1686
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:50,878
So trying to see the consistency
across those types of things,

1687
01:35:51,312 --> 01:35:54,782
which is the fundamental axiom
which is later introduced and so on,

1688
01:35:54,949 --> 01:35:56,283
is very difficult actually.

1689
01:35:56,283 --> 01:35:59,386
Again, I don't think it's a I don't
I don't criticize the authors of this

1690
01:35:59,386 --> 01:36:00,688
because I think it is a living theory.

1691
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:01,155
It's something that's

1692
01:36:01,155 --> 01:36:03,758
kind of really evolved in
the literature is a very complex one.

1693
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:04,358
So it had to be,

1694
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:06,861
but yet hopefully

1695
01:36:06,861 --> 01:36:10,030
as we go forward in the next few years,
we can become more clear about

1696
01:36:10,564 --> 01:36:12,533
these things
and we'll be more and more people doing

1697
01:36:12,533 --> 01:36:15,503
reviews and more critical evaluations
like the Goldstone

1698
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:19,907
will further ground this theory

1699
01:36:19,907 --> 01:36:23,077
in in the place where we can all agree
on and agree on the axioms.

1700
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:24,912
And then I'll say.

1701
01:36:24,912 --> 01:36:26,714
And I just to say.

1702
01:36:27,148 --> 01:36:28,382
Baron and then Miguel.

1703
01:36:28,382 --> 01:36:31,285
Okay, guys, I want to say that, yeah,
we should definitely not consider

1704
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:35,389
all the axioms and but the principle
at the moment to be completely terrific.

1705
01:36:35,389 --> 01:36:39,326
Then like I feel this is still living
and still evolving in many ways

1706
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:42,296
and there's some case to have questions
about do we actually need this axiom

1707
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:45,733
kind of be more general in this kind of
be less general than this and stuff.

1708
01:36:45,733 --> 01:36:46,433
So I think there's going to be

1709
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:50,237
lots of more foundational discussion
around the actual axioms underlying it.

1710
01:36:50,771 --> 01:36:53,808
And now the people are
just really just starting to tackle

1711
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:56,076
and in particular physics
and really deep way

1712
01:36:56,076 --> 01:36:56,911
that I think that that

1713
01:36:56,911 --> 01:36:59,013
will over the next few days
be lots of discussion about this.

1714
01:36:59,013 --> 01:37:02,817
And hopefully in a couple of years
we'll have a much more precise statement

1715
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:04,084
of what the FIP says,

1716
01:37:04,084 --> 01:37:08,022
what is needed, what isn't needed,
and how everything fits together.

1717
01:37:08,022 --> 01:37:10,825
But at the moment
is still in a bit of flux, like because

1718
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:14,562
really deep critique outside of Karl's
grip on particular physics is kind of

1719
01:37:14,562 --> 01:37:15,996
just really starting
in the last year or so.

1720
01:37:17,698 --> 01:37:19,600
Thanks for that, Miguel.

1721
01:37:19,733 --> 01:37:22,169
Yeah, yes. So it's on to other.

1722
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:22,436
Okay.

1723
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:26,207
So so we focus on the free energy
principle and on this claim that

1724
01:37:26,774 --> 01:37:30,544
these dynamic systems
or operating systems behave as minimizing

1725
01:37:30,544 --> 01:37:34,348
the free energy, but they think that's
only one part of the universe.

1726
01:37:34,448 --> 01:37:39,687
The reality is you have the active
in front, you have the design of systems

1727
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:43,691
that explicitly minimize the free energy
and thus are completely forbidden.

1728
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:46,527
And often this is also mix and not so.

1729
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:50,130
And yeah,
and there's some things are mixed between

1730
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:54,001
so which is the the axioms
in the beginning the specific repair.

1731
01:37:54,001 --> 01:37:56,637
So what, what are you,
what are you actually doing.

1732
01:37:56,637 --> 01:38:01,609
The in your work is not always clear for
for anyone because these have all been

1733
01:38:02,042 --> 01:38:06,480
that is separation of the theory
and this interconnections and so on.

1734
01:38:07,615 --> 01:38:09,083
But I think that

1735
01:38:09,083 --> 01:38:12,987
yeah like are becoming more mature
as their field becomes more mature.

1736
01:38:12,987 --> 01:38:14,922
This should be clearer because

1737
01:38:14,922 --> 01:38:18,459
sometimes this leads to confusion
about what the theory means.

1738
01:38:18,459 --> 01:38:21,795
It's not when people say, okay,
the free trade

1739
01:38:21,795 --> 01:38:24,531
principle shows that every living system
is minimizing.

1740
01:38:25,065 --> 01:38:28,702
Okay, but, and it's yeah.

1741
01:38:28,702 --> 01:38:33,374
So, so it's different
when you think of aliens that do it by,

1742
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:37,878
by design or when you try to the claim
to other system non.

1743
01:38:38,312 --> 01:38:42,349
So there is this different points of view
on the different sides of the theory

1744
01:38:42,349 --> 01:38:46,420
that, that, yeah, I, I,
I hope that the a mind

1745
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:50,724
that we are going to evolve into a more
or an open

1746
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:53,527
compartmentalized and

1747
01:38:54,828 --> 01:38:57,731
they are interconnected,
but the way that they are clear

1748
01:38:57,731 --> 01:39:00,034
and the borders of the
different planes and so on.

1749
01:39:01,201 --> 01:39:02,603
It's going to be in.

1750
01:39:02,603 --> 01:39:04,772
FP Metaverse.

1751
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:08,175
That is appropriate
for the online age, honestly,

1752
01:39:08,475 --> 01:39:12,579
because when I think about how the needle
was pushed here, GitHub,

1753
01:39:12,746 --> 01:39:16,550
an interactive computational preprints
like yours,

1754
01:39:17,151 --> 01:39:20,754
live streams like the one
that we're on a discord server, you know,

1755
01:39:20,754 --> 01:39:25,259
a reading group that was arranged
by Maxwell and others ten years ago.

1756
01:39:25,259 --> 01:39:27,628
20 years ago,
it would have been like, what?

1757
01:39:28,228 --> 01:39:30,831
And it certainly wouldn't
have been accessible globally.

1758
01:39:31,298 --> 01:39:35,569
So to see how the material
and the informational culture

1759
01:39:36,036 --> 01:39:41,308
and also social culture is changing
in a time when participatory science

1760
01:39:41,308 --> 01:39:44,044
and open science
and all these kinds of transdisciplinary

1761
01:39:44,411 --> 01:39:46,981
ideas are coming to the fore,

1762
01:39:47,614 --> 01:39:50,551
it's just an awesome contribution.

1763
01:39:50,551 --> 01:39:55,656
So I'll offer any final thoughts
from a chat and each of you a final

1764
01:39:56,757 --> 01:39:57,458
word.

1765
01:39:57,458 --> 01:40:01,295
But just to say from the lab that we
really appreciate your willingness

1766
01:40:01,295 --> 01:40:05,265
to, you know, jump on at short notice
and work on it and share it in this way,

1767
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:08,969
and also with these exciting directions
that you've planned out

1768
01:40:08,969 --> 01:40:12,673
and expect.

1769
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:13,173
I'm out,

1770
01:40:13,173 --> 01:40:15,409
but I say I completely agree with you
and I have to, you know,

1771
01:40:15,609 --> 01:40:19,246
shout out to people like Maxwell Rand
study organizes this course service,

1772
01:40:19,246 --> 01:40:23,751
which are now really
this debate in Y communities.

1773
01:40:23,751 --> 01:40:25,686
And you're really valuable for

1774
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:28,856
an infrastructure for people like this
to come in and do this type of research.

1775
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:30,624
So yeah, I completely agree with that.

1776
01:40:30,624 --> 01:40:34,928
This this new infrastructure is
really important to this type of stuff.

1777
01:40:35,662 --> 01:40:38,732
Erin, any last comments
and then Miguel, of course.

1778
01:40:38,799 --> 01:40:39,466
Yeah, final word.

1779
01:40:40,768 --> 01:40:42,302
And I just want to echo what Chris said

1780
01:40:42,302 --> 01:40:46,106
really about just the sheer importance
of the reading actually organized this.

1781
01:40:46,173 --> 01:40:48,375
I think that's why, you know,
I learned an awful lot

1782
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:51,512
about how particular physics works
and how everything goes through

1783
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:52,646
in that monograph.

1784
01:40:52,646 --> 01:40:54,281
And I think a lot of people did
that as well.

1785
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:56,850
Like,
I think that we didn't really build up

1786
01:40:56,850 --> 01:41:00,454
enough expertize to make papers like this
and obviously similar to modern stuff

1787
01:41:00,454 --> 01:41:03,757
and to get anything together, probably
lots of stuff in the next year or so.

1788
01:41:03,757 --> 01:41:05,859
Coming out
actually made all of that possible.

1789
01:41:06,493 --> 01:41:07,761
And so, yeah, all of that.

1790
01:41:07,761 --> 01:41:11,432
This is a family like if you're
interested in learning more about the FP

1791
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:13,734
like email Maxwell
because he has recordings

1792
01:41:13,767 --> 01:41:15,736
of all of the reading group meetings.

1793
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:17,871
And so that's probably going to be
a really cool thing.

1794
01:41:17,871 --> 01:41:20,941
For a good into the lockdown
I think know.

1795
01:41:21,141 --> 01:41:24,244
History
I can recall lots of material there

1796
01:41:24,411 --> 01:41:26,814
if you want to really drill down
into the technicalities

1797
01:41:26,814 --> 01:41:31,018
and those recordings
will probably be really good as well.

1798
01:41:31,018 --> 01:41:32,352
Great and

1799
01:41:34,221 --> 01:41:36,457
now if
you would like to give any last comments

1800
01:41:37,591 --> 01:41:39,093
and. Yeah, yes.

1801
01:41:39,093 --> 01:41:41,228
Well, yes, yes.

1802
01:41:41,228 --> 01:41:45,265
As you said,
I think we're on partly as Chris

1803
01:41:45,566 --> 01:41:48,902
Burns said, I,
I can often relate to the group.

1804
01:41:48,902 --> 01:41:52,639
And yes, I think the two last sessions
by the it was really helpful to to dig

1805
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,443
through the some of the discussions
that took place there.

1806
01:41:56,443 --> 01:42:01,548
And I think in general
what's so I think in general, yeah.

1807
01:42:01,982 --> 01:42:05,552
What's cool feel advances too

1808
01:42:05,686 --> 01:42:08,455
to make things accessible
in different ways and

1809
01:42:08,989 --> 01:42:14,895
and this can be through resources
through communities and also through more

1810
01:42:14,895 --> 01:42:17,464
transparent models or more

1811
01:42:18,065 --> 01:42:21,201
and easier
to follow guides through the maps.

1812
01:42:21,201 --> 01:42:23,804
And I think that is part of the
difficulties in the field is that there

1813
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:27,608
is this disconnection between people
that is doing mathematical work

1814
01:42:27,608 --> 01:42:29,810
and people like this
doing philosophical work.

1815
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:33,780
And not only here, what I think
in cognitive science in general or

1816
01:42:34,381 --> 01:42:36,850
or even the more and deeper

1817
01:42:37,584 --> 01:42:40,187
use of systems, biology
and so on, right on

1818
01:42:40,721 --> 01:42:44,158
and that this new level
now I think is very valuable.

1819
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:48,962
This is efforts in in in trying
to make things more accessible and easier

1820
01:42:48,962 --> 01:42:53,200
to follow from, you know, for people
from multiple disciplines.

1821
01:42:53,534 --> 01:42:56,303
I think that's a very valuable effort
that we should try to do

1822
01:42:56,537 --> 01:42:58,772
collectively because that's the only way.

1823
01:42:59,706 --> 01:43:02,109
And thanks a lot
for hosting this session.

1824
01:43:02,109 --> 01:43:02,709
Thank you.

1825
01:43:02,709 --> 01:43:06,313
We always talk about tools, ideas
and people.

1826
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:08,048
They're a triple helix.

1827
01:43:08,048 --> 01:43:11,919
And so thanks for making it happen
with all of those today.

1828
01:43:11,919 --> 01:43:13,620
Thank you very much for that. Peace!
