1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,440
hello

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,080
and welcome to the active inference lab

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,559
today

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,480
is april 14th 2021 and we're here in

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,279
guest stream

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,480
number 4.1 with elliot murphy so this is

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,520
going to be a really

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,199
interesting talk and elliot we

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,880
appreciate you coming on

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,519
so i'll just pass it to you to introduce

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,320
yourself

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,480
introduce the topic and then share some

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,960
slides so anyone who's watching live

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,280
or i guess later in the comments just

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,280
ask questions and we'll have time during

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,879
this presentation and at the end

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,320
to go over some comments but thanks

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,000
again elliot and looking forward to

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,840
hearing

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,559
yeah thank you very much and so i am a

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,239
postdoc working at ut health

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,360
uh in houston texas i work on

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,600
intracranial recordings of

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,399
epilepsy patients doing a bunch of

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,920
language tasks trying to explore the

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,280
neural basis of language

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,520
and today i will i'm going to present uh

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,199
some slides kind of reviewing

29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,959
um a recent preprint that is currently

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,720
in review

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,200
on active inference and the free energy

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,159
principle

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,479
so i'm going to share my screen

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,640
yep looks good okay so yeah i'm going to

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,479
give you an introduction to the topic

36
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,320
and then talk a bit about linguistics

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,000
and then try and wrap up um

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,360
you know we'll make this more of an

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,280
obvious conversation uh comments

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,920
questions

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
uh objections obviously uh more than

42
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,439
welcome from anybody

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,360
so yeah like i said this is the preprint

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,920
that's currently uh in review

45
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,759
uh with emma holmes uh carl first and

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,000
ucl uh the argument is that natural

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,360
language syntax complies

48
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,200
in some degree with the free energy

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,799
principle

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,040
so just um outlining some kind of really

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,840
cool

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,799
uh you know basic principles i want to

53
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,439
make this

54
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,040
conversation a little bit more

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,119
philosophical than than normal

56
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,439
and obviously this is this this lab is i

57
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,479
have influence lab so

58
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,079
i want to kind of introduce some

59
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,920
linguistic topics more than the

60
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,759
fap topics and because the audience

61
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,200
might be less familiar with the kind of

62
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
synthetic theory so to begin with

63
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,318
natural language syntax

64
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,239
yields what linguists then call an

65
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,760
unbounded array of hierarchically

66
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,879
structured expressions

67
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,239
unbounded meaning that they can

68
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,000
potentially go on forever there's no

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,200
upper bound on the limit

70
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,120
of a sentence length right you can

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,800
always make any sentence longer by

72
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,760
simply adding

73
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,360
john said that at the beginning of it

74
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,120
and it gets longer the only thing that

75
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,599
stops sentences going on forever is

76
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,239
the working memory the age of the

77
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,000
average human being and indeed the age

78
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,440
of the universe you know sentences can't

79
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,239
go on forever

80
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,480
they have to stop at some point and but

81
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,760
the generative component

82
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,599
in principle could do that so that's the

83
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,800
interesting part about language the fact

84
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,160
that you could in principle generate an

85
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,000
unbounded array of expressions

86
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,400
so i kind of argued in this paper that

87
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,319
these are used in the surface of active

88
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:48,879
inference

89
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,480
which is in turn in the code with the

90
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,920
community principle

91
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,599
so the general goal is to kind of align

92
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,040
certain concerns of linguistics

93
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,959
with those of the normative model for

94
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,319
organic system behavior

95
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,879
associated with the fpp so i'm going to

96
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,640
be relying on theoretical linguistics

97
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:02,959
with

98
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,760
special analysis on syntax which is the

99
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,440
system that look that determines the

100
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,720
kind of order that words

101
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,920
and go in the structure and organization

102
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,440
relation the organizational relations

103
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,280
between words and sentences

104
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
so a lot of these design principles are

105
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,560
kind of um

106
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,480
general to the biological component of

107
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,000
language not just for specific

108
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,319
instantiations of language

109
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,680
so they're not specific to english but

110
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,040
french or swahili they're kind of

111
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,640
general design principles

112
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,200
um about how the language system seems

113
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,680
to be

114
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,480
like organized and so like i said i want

115
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,319
to kind of emphasis emphasize more

116
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,040
on the linguistics and uh topic more

117
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,440
than

118
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,200
active inference just reverb to the

119
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,640
exposition

120
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,159
and although the pre-print itself has

121
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,680
all the kind of relevant details if

122
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,840
you're interested in reading more

123
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,680
but um yeah but kind of the brief

124
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,200
historical background here is that

125
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,799
since around the 10th century about

126
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,239
20-25 years ago

127
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,159
lingus has basically been and developing

128
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,080
theories of linguistic computation

129
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
and which invoke economy principles so

130
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,439
um

131
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,120
basically the idea is that when you pass

132
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,959
an instructor sentence there are certain

133
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,640
computations that enter into that

134
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,599
process

135
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,439
and it's not just a single kind of chunk

136
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,799
that you memorize or produce

137
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,080
you do it in discrete operations

138
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,200
and yeah for some reason there's

139
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,880
currently no means of grounding or

140
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,320
motivating these ideas through more

141
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,560
general non-linguistic domains

142
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,079
so recently proposed principles of

143
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,840
economy um such as

144
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,600
minimal search or least seven criteria

145
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,960
which i'll explain and give you

146
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,240
definitions up soon

147
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,080
and i i argue that they adhere to the

148
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,280
ftp

149
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,639
and if this can be shown then this

150
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,320
permits a greater degree of explanatory

151
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,160
power to the fbp with respect to higher

152
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,600
language functions

153
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,040
and also presents the language of the

154
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,400
first principle grounding of notions

155
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,320
pertaining to computability and so on

156
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,560
so in other words the idea is this um

157
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
natural language syntax is a system it's

158
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,919
an organic system it's a formal system

159
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,120
it can be described

160
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,479
using the the language of uh theory of

161
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,320
recursive functions and computability

162
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,080
imported from computer science and

163
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,160
all the rest of it but there's a problem

164
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,320
and all of these principles of

165
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,080
economy and language design in the

166
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,000
literature are unsurprisingly kind of

167
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,840
language focused right they have a very

168
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,320
kind of

169
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,120
linguistically encoded background and so

170
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,320
there's a bit of paradox because one of

171
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,000
the original goals of this program was

172
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,039
actually to see

173
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,039
okay let's see how much of language is

174
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,720
actually uh

175
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,199
can arise through the kinds of formal

176
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,080
principles

177
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,199
that govern the organizing uh shape of

178
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,960
you know snowflakes or the mythology of

179
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,720
lightning blocks and so on kind of just

180
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,440
general

181
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,120
um uh domain general uh laws of nature

182
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,400
essentially that can give rise in

183
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,560
different ways across different domains

184
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,800
and yet the linguist the the teacher is

185
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,840
still kind of

186
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,320
uh encoding these in language specific

187
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,880
terms

188
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,160
rather than relating them to more

189
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,320
general principles of brain organization

190
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,600
or mental computation

191
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,600
so that's the kind of background and

192
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,360
so many historical insights into syntax

193
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,720
i argue are kind of consistent with the

194
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,440
fbp

195
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,360
which provides a novel perspective under

196
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
which the principles governing syntax

197
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,479
are not limited to language

198
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,000
but they actually reflect domain general

199
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
processes that underpin a variety of

200
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,280
positive computations

201
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,880
this is also consistent with a strain

202
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,319
within theoretical linguistics that

203
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,319
explores how syntactic computation

204
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,240
may adhere to general principles that

205
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,400
may well fall within extra biological

206
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,360
natural law

207
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,880
in particular considerations of minimal

208
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,880
computation such that certain linguistic

209
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,240
theories might be engaging

210
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,000
with general properties of organic

211
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,680
systems that impact language design so i

212
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,960
think that's kind of a beautiful idea

213
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,919
the idea that

214
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,400
and the language that we speak english

215
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,199
french german

216
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,199
not only are they biologically grounded

217
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,560
but actually the rules that kind of

218
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,039
govern

219
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,960
the uh what you can say what you can't

220
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,280
say and and indeed how you how your

221
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,680
brain computes in parts of sentences

222
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,840
part of that process you kind of get for

223
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,280
free if you just assume

224
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,400
um extra biological natural law one of

225
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,840
which you can you can argue is is the

226
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,280
french principle so that's the kind of

227
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,840
background here

228
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,080
so um the structuring influence of the

229
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,840
fb can be detected in language

230
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,840
and not only has been argued recently at

231
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
the complex level so the um kokkerson

232
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,039
and his colleagues have published a

233
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,160
bunch of papers in the last

234
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,880
year or two mainly in 2020 arguing that

235
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,599
and

236
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,160
active inference can relate to narrative

237
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,039
comprehension

238
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,560
interpersonal dialogue like when two

239
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,800
people talk um cooperative intentional

240
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,080
communication

241
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,240
and speech segmentation and but i'm

242
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,360
going to kind of argue that

243
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,840
all of these things rely on something

244
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,479
much more

245
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,280
lower down and that syntax if you can't

246
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,680
um

247
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,120
synthetically construct the phrase if

248
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,400
you can't put two words together and

249
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,360
form a phrase

250
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,479
you're not going to get very far right

251
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,319
you at least need to do that in order to

252
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,120
engage in

253
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,840
um you know intentional uh cooperation

254
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,400
and

255
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,199
narrative and storytelling and speech

256
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,000
segmentation

257
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,599
you at least need to be able to form a

258
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,000
phrase right if you can't do that

259
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,080
you can't do anything to do language so

260
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
i'm i'm kind of arguing that and

261
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,639
you know all of the all of the ways that

262
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,240
the fep can be related to

263
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,639
all of these things here is arises from

264
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,919
all kind of fundamental lower level

265
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:54,800
consideration

266
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,440
to do with the way that phrasal

267
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,560
computations are executed

268
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,240
um have you changed any slides we can't

269
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,599
see any slides changing

270
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,720
just okay

271
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,840
uh yeah i have changed a few slides just

272
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,599
maybe unshare and reshare

273
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,639
but it stands alone

274
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,560
what you've said as well but it will be

275
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,560
also good to have the visual

276
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,680
you see okay how about this

277
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,120
so we see your mouse and then just

278
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,800
advance like on the left bar

279
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,759
like click on to your next slide yep

280
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,800
perfect

281
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,240
okay what about now no

282
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,279
okay oh i see my bad my bad okay um

283
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,640
well i might have to

284
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,839
like window in focus yeah

285
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,680
this just as a non-linguist was really

286
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,760
interesting that you appealed to like

287
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,720
kind of

288
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,399
bigger laws than linguistics

289
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,160
like complex systems theory or

290
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,399
snowflakes and lightnings like you said

291
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,640
and then yeah just pointing out that

292
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,160
you're kind of

293
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,440
bringing linguistic level rules or

294
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,880
patterns into a bigger

295
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,519
scope okay cool so we see it with the

296
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,959
chomsky now

297
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,200
perfect perfect okay well um i've only

298
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,040
skipped like five slides so everything

299
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,000
i've just said

300
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,080
is so yeah i show the the paper here's

301
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,040
the paper

302
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,160
and i simply bring it to this i exercise

303
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,800
this

304
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,839
all of these things i've already read

305
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,279
out so yeah if you heard what i said

306
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,000
then

307
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,720
that's good great okay so can you see

308
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,000
slide number eight yep

309
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,040
cool awesome okay uh

310
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,760
okay so um if the process of

311
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,279
constructing hierarchically organized

312
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,880
sets of linguistic features into words

313
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,839
and phrases and sensors

314
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,519
can be shown to adhere to principles of

315
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,360
efficient computation then this process

316
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,880
must also operate within saying

317
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,040
fundamental constraints on your dynamics

318
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,200
such as those implied by the fpp to

319
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,880
which the homeostatic brain minimizes

320
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,760
the dispersion

321
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,399
of intraceptic and heteroceptic states

322
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,160
the ffp can also allow us to understand

323
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,080
how natural language complies with the

324
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,519
constraints imposed on worldly

325
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,480
interactions

326
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,000
deriving certain features of language

327
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,440
from first principle so again at the

328
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,640
moment this is all this is a little

329
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,760
pretty abstract

330
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,120
and i'm going to give you some much more

331
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,519
like concrete examples so i apologize if

332
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,880
it's a little bit philosophical

333
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,760
at the moment and so a number of robust

334
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,120
findings from theoretical linguistics

335
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,480
can be used to support the image of the

336
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,079
brain as a constructive organ

337
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,600
assembling and unfairing linguistic

338
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,519
representations in the sense of surprise

339
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,440
minimization and related goals

340
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,040
those syntactic structures are not minor

341
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,720
external entities they're not the kind

342
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,000
of thing that a physicist could easily

343
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,800
examine

344
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,399
but they're rather actively inferred by

345
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,040
the brain uh seemingly with the help of

346
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,959
endogenous slow frequency activity

347
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,640
coordinating cross-court organic

348
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,079
itemization of linguistic features

349
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:40,720
according to

350
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,000
a bunch of recent models of neural

351
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,279
linguistics which i'm going to get back

352
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,000
to at the end

353
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,920
um so in other words we have a general

354
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,519
framework for how syntax is implemented

355
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,480
at the abstract level

356
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,160
and we also maybe have a kind of a

357
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,279
decent understanding of how that's

358
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,399
implemented in the brain

359
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,240
so that's the kind of the long vision of

360
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,760
this presentation at the end we're gonna

361
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,120
i'm gonna try and wrap it all up by

362
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,560
returning to the brain

363
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,800
um but for now uh i'll give you a more

364
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,079
kind of concrete example

365
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,760
so i said that syntactic structures have

366
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,920
to be unfair they're a form of inference

367
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,680
they're they're inference generation

368
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,519
they're not just um passive

369
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,240
um perception so um if you have a

370
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,519
structure like

371
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,519
we watched a movie with jim carrey that

372
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,800
can mean two things

373
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,720
and it can either mean um the movie

374
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,800
stars jim carrey

375
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,399
the truman show say we watch the truman

376
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,399
show or you actually watch the movie

377
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:24,959
whilst

378
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,000
um sat next to jim carrey it depends on

379
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,440
how you pass it right it depends on

380
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,320
um how which phrases get merged with um

381
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
in in which order basically

382
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,880
and so there's a kind of general roof uh

383
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,079
schematic here

384
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,440
um that you can kind of find a

385
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,360
collaboration of in the pre-print paper

386
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,320
that i mentioned

387
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,600
but the basic idea is that there's

388
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,440
structural ambiguity that arises from

389
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,120
syntax so therefore the whole process of

390
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,079
syntax has to be

391
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,079
an inference process it's not given to

392
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,320
us uh on a spoon we have to kind of

393
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,760
we have to do some homework in order to

394
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,760
construct every possible pass

395
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,120
so that poses the problem how does the

396
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,040
brain do that and it is an inferential

397
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,760
process

398
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,200
so what are the operations involved in

399
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,040
that so here's a

400
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
kind of a standard what called free

401
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,240
structures and linguistics

402
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,839
there's there's two different ways of

403
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,920
passing the sentence and you can either

404
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,880
shoot an elephant

405
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,639
who's wearing your pajamas which is

406
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,320
definitely possible or you can shoot an

407
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,079
elephant whilst wearing grandpa jumps

408
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,079
and it depends how you in which order

409
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,600
you merge the phrases right in which

410
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,120
which hierarchical relationship

411
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,760
is exhibited if that makes sense so uh

412
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,959
there's kind of a lot of theoretical

413
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,240
background here in linguistics that i

414
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,440
won't go into because that's a whole

415
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,720
other you know the whole whole different

416
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,959
lecture um but the basic idea is that

417
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,440
there's a

418
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
ambiguity in structure generation it's

419
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,279
not always a language is not

420
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,279
um a system of beads on a string it's a

421
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,639
it's a structure

422
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,040
so along along that kind of theme i'm

423
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,079
also assuming

424
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,920
a distinction in linguistics between

425
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,160
what's called i language and e language

426
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,360
and this is a really crucial extension

427
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,880
to get clear so i want to make sure that

428
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,440
um

429
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,839
this makes sense to everybody so an eye

430
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,800
language is

431
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,920
um the actual internal knowledge that an

432
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,760
individual human being has in their mind

433
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,560
brain

434
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,959
i stands to individual internal and

435
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,480
intentional intentional with an s

436
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,360
meaning meaning

437
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,720
that which literally means meaning

438
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,399
generating meanings on the other hand

439
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,680
you have um what i call

440
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,920
the e language perspective and that is

441
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,800
actually

442
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,959
arguably not really a vulnerable or

443
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,040
coherent it's the idea that language is

444
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,320
a kind of external

445
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,720
um a system behind external an extra

446
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,000
mental system

447
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,760
like the english language is somehow out

448
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,519
there in the world and when we learn the

449
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,120
english language we kind of approximate

450
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,800
some kind of mind external system

451
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,320
and we all have something in common i.e

452
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,519
we all approximate to the english

453
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,720
language in different ways

454
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,040
but the island perspective assumes that

455
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,079
when we actually communicate

456
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,839
with each other and the reason why we

457
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,360
can successfully communicate

458
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,959
is not because we share an e language in

459
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,800
common it's because our languages

460
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,279
successfully and sufficiently overlap to

461
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,399
the degree that we can actually

462
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,600
communicate

463
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,519
with so everybody's our language is

464
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,360
different it's often said that there's

465
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,720
you know seven thousand languages on the

466
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,240
planet but that's actually not not true

467
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,959
there's actually

468
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,079
you know however many people that are on

469
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,440
the planet i can't remember it's like

470
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,320
seven billion

471
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,160
or something less than half and that's

472
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,360
how many languages there are

473
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,199
and every human being has a different

474
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,800
language faculty and it's set

475
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,480
that parameters are set differently we

476
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,639
all have different um idiotics different

477
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,920
understandings and so on and that kind

478
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,279
of sounds really obvious right when you

479
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,480
think about it it's like obviously

480
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,440
that's true

481
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,880
but um the implications for the study of

482
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,560
language are actually pretty uh

483
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,040
kind of natural in other words when we

484
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,959
study um linguistic confidence we are

485
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:19,440
studying

486
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
like a mind internal computational

487
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,519
system and we're not studying

488
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,040
something outside so the english

489
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,480
language is not something that lingua is

490
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,839
actually study we don't know that's not

491
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,199
a coherent concept

492
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,279
uh it's like the concept of culture or

493
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,720
um community or whatever it's

494
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,920
these are not things that physicists

495
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,920
could you know identify and that's not

496
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,199
to say that we can't say things about

497
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,279
them you know we can't abstract

498
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,360
the human mind count stroke theories of

499
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,720
e-languages i guess you know you can

500
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,079
talk about

501
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,000
the english language you're changing

502
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,199
over the decades

503
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,839
which is you know kind of definitely way

504
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,120
to talk about language and you can study

505
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,000
in that way

506
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,519
but from a naturalistic perspective from

507
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,600
a biological perspective that's not use

508
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,519
the only way we can study it is based on

509
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,040
what an individual mind brain is doing

510
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,160
so to give another example here um if

511
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,279
you take a recent film

512
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,800
that ign released a trailer for

513
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,120
yesterday hitman's wife's bodyguard

514
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,959
and the defining property of language is

515
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,800
said to be this unbounded

516
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
array of hierarchical organized

517
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,320
expressions via location

518
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,839
so radication is a defining property of

519
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,760
natural language syntax but it turns out

520
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,199
to be distributed unevenly across the

521
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,880
world's languages

522
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,240
so some people have argued that certain

523
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,320
languages don't exhibit embrocation at

524
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,959
all

525
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,320
and but this actually tells us nothing

526
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,320
about the actual biological language

527
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,680
so in other words speakers of these

528
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,199
languages can easily learn portuguese

529
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:33,600
right

530
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
so the idea is that and language can

531
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,519
easily and readily be exhibited by most

532
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,040
of the world's languages again when i

533
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,880
say words languages i mean a kind of

534
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,120
convenient description of every

535
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,240
individual's

536
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,040
fixed language faculty so most germanic

537
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
languages only allow a single pronoun

538
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,199
and genitive limited to proper nouns but

539
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,279
german doesn't allow recursive embedding

540
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,240
that possesses

541
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,519
though in german you can say john's

542
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,759
house beyonce john's sister's friend's

543
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,800
house

544
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,639
um so the above movie when it's released

545
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,079
in germany ashu is going to have to be

546
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,040
called something like

547
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,079
the bodyguard of hitman's wife which it

548
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,759
has a slightly different tone to it

549
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,240
so the idea is that um this fundamental

550
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,759
capacity of language to

551
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,079
execute location and you can find it all

552
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,519
over the place you can find it in

553
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,600
uh phrase embedding center embedding

554
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,800
phrases the way that we actually convert

555
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,360
phrases

556
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,120
or you can find it in other ways like in

557
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,600
this example here

558
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,639
so um relating this back to the fbp

559
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,399
while the mpp is a variational principle

560
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,680
of least action

561
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,040
such as those that describe systems

562
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,160
we've considered one of these a

563
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,759
relatively recent program in linguistics

564
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,800
has suggested that natural language

565
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,480
syntax adheres to principle principles

566
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,000
of least action and minimal search

567
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,120
engines

568
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,399
so modern theoretical linguistics

569
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,240
remains comparatively remote from other

570
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
fields in cognitive science

571
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,600
but certain postulates from this field

572
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,839
resonate with the fep and it's the

573
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,399
proper

574
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,920
so many biological and cognitive

575
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,360
principles of efficiency might be

576
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,040
special cases of a variational principle

577
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,000
of free energy

578
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,440
pursuing this assessment should allow

579
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,120
researchers from distinct disciplines to

580
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,639
re-evaluate their hypotheses

581
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,320
and empirical evidence in terms of lower

582
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,360
level free energy which is the kind of

583
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,000
goal

584
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
i have in mind here but we should also

585
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,599
stress as a recent paper does that the

586
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,679
fap can be used as a methodological

587
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,319
heuristic

588
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,240
for research and but it's not a theory

589
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,599
of everything it's just a framework

590
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,199
and actually i find this very similar to

591
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,039
a framework in linguistics called the

592
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,240
minimalist program

593
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,559
which is a program it's not a coherent

594
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,520
not yet at least

595
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,359
it has a couple of theories working

596
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,039
theories but it's not a coherent body of

597
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,400
doctrine at the moment it's an ongoing

598
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,760
research program with a particular

599
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,039
ideology and framework

600
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,640
and that's exactly what the what the f

601
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,480
is right it's a formal principle

602
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,360
which yields that i can contribute to a

603
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,280
discrete individual and separate

604
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,640
and sort of theories depending on what

605
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,720
domain you're looking at and

606
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,120
so i kind of like the idea they're both

607
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,000
programmatic

608
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,240
notions and and you can implement them

609
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,200
in different ways

610
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,720
so uh so we'll be working here with the

611
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,600
fab

612
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,440
and the paper in question doesn't work

613
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,200
on the fpp so much it's not an applied

614
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,720
approach to the fpp

615
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,799
and so the fab has been argued to be

616
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,000
more of a kind of conceptual

617
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,520
mathematical model for self-organized

618
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,720
systems

619
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,880
and as a recent review by andrews makes

620
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,320
clear there's a number of ways that the

621
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,400
fbp has served as an aid to scientific

622
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,280
work without

623
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,360
constituting like falsifiable stations

624
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,640
about the state of nature

625
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,960
it's a it's program it's it's a way of

626
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,320
usefully describing

627
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,520
uh certain uh joints of nature without

628
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,039
necessarily carving them

629
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,559
so while we argue that natural language

630
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,559
syntax and so when we argue that natural

631
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,919
language syntax complies with the free

632
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,799
entry principle

633
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,240
i'm not necessarily implying that the

634
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,480
fap you know necessarily bears

635
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,240
specific direct predictions from the

636
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,640
behavior it's rather way of motivating

637
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,840
the construction of neural

638
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
novel conceptual arguments for how some

639
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,200
property of organic systems

640
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,880
might be seen as realizing with those

641
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,960
so as i said uh repeating their language

642
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,480
language distinction and focusing on

643
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,080
knowledge which is internal to the mind

644
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,039
of the speaker

645
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,640
exploring their apparent competence

646
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,080
rather than you know what they happen to

647
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,320
produce

648
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,919
so one example of what you can think of

649
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,600
immediately is the existence of

650
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,799
syntactic structures

651
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,400
can contribute to a unique form of

652
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,320
episode encouraging through maximizing

653
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,080
model evidence and minimizing surprise

654
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
and variation of energy the actual paper

655
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,760
in question that i'm i'm citing here

656
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,960
kind of goes into more detail but the

657
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,000
basic idea is that

658
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,840
the highly restricted uh set of

659
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,000
syntactic projections while called

660
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,240
um the way that you can categorize a

661
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,160
phrase and nouns and verbs and

662
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,679
complement as a brace and so on that

663
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,640
restricted set

664
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,400
that finite set of ways that you can

665
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,160
define a particular phrase as being a

666
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,679
bit of phrasal vampires

667
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,840
and achieves that goal so you can also

668
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,880
assume that languages

669
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,200
and language users during comprehension

670
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,559
select the phrase structure that's least

671
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,000
surprising from the perspective of the

672
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,520
hierarchical gender model

673
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,280
again this goes back to the um we

674
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,039
watched a movie with jim carrey example

675
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,080
it's a prediction and uh uh plays a

676
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,280
pretty big role here

677
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,640
so our search for a structure building

678
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,320
can be cast as an internal action it's

679
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,360
an actual internal

680
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,200
action that an individual does in the

681
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,720
sense of the active inference framework

682
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,080
that selects someone competing

683
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,400
hypotheses i.e syntactic

684
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,240
structures you can pass it this way you

685
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,520
can pass it another way

686
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,200
and also the same goes for lexical

687
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,120
semantics not just syntax

688
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,799
and in other words you can you can you

689
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,240
know interpret an individual way of one

690
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,880
by one

691
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,919
and i'm going to give some examples

692
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,760
later so pretty much all of language

693
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,919
from individual words up to sentences

694
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,480
and are inference generated

695
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,880
and also a little side point here and

696
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,559
relating more directly to existing work

697
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,400
on active inference and communication

698
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,919
and it's i think it's pretty interesting

699
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,520
to know that the recursive combinatorial

700
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,240
apparatus of

701
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,919
syntax has been argued to facilitate

702
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,679
recursive theory of mind right

703
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,320
so the ability your ability to know that

704
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,919
someone else knows that she knows like

705
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,440
you know this and so on

706
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,200
and it could be seen there for his

707
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
deriving or piggybacking in some way

708
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,960
and active influence-based properties of

709
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,039
higher order linguistic communication

710
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,360
and which in turn serves to unveil the

711
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,720
latent or hidden states that are other

712
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,679
people's mental states

713
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,360
which is the kind of standard assumption

714
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,440
and theory of mind active inference

715
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,200
research but i think it can be related

716
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,120
much more directly to language once we

717
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,000
understand

718
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,360
that the extended kind of uh uh

719
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,760
use of our theory of mind in language is

720
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,720
it comes directly from this because

721
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,840
recursive property right

722
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
okay so i mean i'm going to move on to

723
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,840
kind of the more concrete examples

724
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,120
everything i've said so far is pretty

725
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,400
philosophical and pretty

726
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,600
abstract but i want to kind of give you

727
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,840
some actual concrete examples here so it

728
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,840
makes a bit more sense

729
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,400
so free energy provides additional

730
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,840
constraints on what a computational

731
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,360
system can be physically realized as

732
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,559
which is very useful

733
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,640
so take the first three principles in

734
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,320
classical recursive function theory

735
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,480
which allow functions to compose

736
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,559
substitution primitive recursion and

737
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,559
minimization these are all designed in a

738
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,679
way that you might think of as

739
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,120
computationally efficient

740
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,559
they reuse the output of earlier

741
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,640
computations uh so for instance

742
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,159
substitution replaces the argument of

743
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,159
function with a function primitive

744
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,000
recursion defines a new function on the

745
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,159
basis of repairs of call to itself

746
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,760
bottoming out and a previously defined

747
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,919
function and minimization produces the

748
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:52,960
output of a function

749
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,559
with the smallest number of possible

750
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,080
steps

751
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,000
so the notion of minimizing surprise can

752
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,520
be used to ground observations from

753
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,799
theoretical linguistics pertaining to

754
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,400
the grammar's propensity to

755
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,320
reduce the search space during syntactic

756
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,480
derivations permit no tampering of

757
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,320
objects during spectacular derivations

758
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,240
so it restricts the number of resources

759
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,559
able to be combined in a given moment so

760
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,919
in other words this is very

761
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,440
kind of an abstract example but i'm

762
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,320
going to give you some more concrete

763
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,200
ones soon

764
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
uh during any particular part of a sense

765
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,039
you don't just search the lexicon and

766
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,559
extract a new unit just because you

767
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,480
can't you only do so if you need to

768
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,400
if the current and number of lexical

769
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,760
items that you've already said so that's

770
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,400
gone for

771
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,919
and suffice to generate a given

772
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,960
interpretation then you don't need to

773
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
search for more items that's sufficient

774
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,799
right so in other words don't just do

775
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,840
don't do more search when less search is

776
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,000
possible

777
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,159
and also relates to the grammar

778
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,440
principle to limit the range of

779
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,799
representation of resources

780
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,320
able to be called upon during any given

781
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,919
stage of comprehension

782
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,440
so examining some core principles of

783
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,039
occasion natural language

784
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,440
clearly exhibits minimization right

785
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,960
while binary branching of structures

786
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,039
limits redundant computation so binary

787
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:57,760
branching

788
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,280
uh calls back to that slide i showed a

789
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,880
few minutes ago where you have these uh

790
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,880
binary branching pre-structures so i

791
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,039
shot an elephant in my pajamas

792
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,080
and that all uh relates to that can will

793
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,200
be derived through successive

794
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,720
implementations of a binary branching

795
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,080
operation that simply puts two things

796
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,039
together and gives it a second identity

797
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,039
so natural language syntax also exhibits

798
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,799
discrete units obviously there's

799
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,039
individual words and which leads to a

800
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,360
discreteness continuity

801
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,039
so syntax is driven by closeness of

802
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,360
computation so objects x and y

803
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,240
form a distinct object x and y its

804
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,919
objects are also bounded so there's

805
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,080
a fixed list so there's nouns verbs

806
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,760
adjectives adverbs prepositions

807
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,799
converses

808
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,120
uh tense objects uh little nouns and

809
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,840
little verbs

810
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,520
aspectual elements and so on all these

811
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,279
different particular functional

812
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,440
and content related notions their

813
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,880
hierarchical ordering is based on a

814
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,440
specific

815
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,919
functional sequence as well and which

816
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,120
imposes direct restrictions of

817
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,000
combinatorics

818
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,600
these objects can be combined into

819
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,919
cycles so recursive embedding

820
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,600
which can be extended to form non-local

821
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,520
dependencies so an example of that is

822
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,440
you have like number um plurality

823
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,159
marketing

824
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,679
so you can say the keys to the old

825
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,000
wooden cabinet are on the table

826
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,760
um not the keys to the old wooden

827
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,120
cabinet is on the table because

828
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,640
obviously it is those are keys

829
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,400
that they have to mark but they have to

830
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
agree in the number feature right

831
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,080
so that's an example where you have a

832
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,240
non-local and dependency between two

833
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,799
elements

834
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,960
so you have to hold it in memory uh even

835
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,000
though they cross

836
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,159
phrase boundaries so syntax still keeps

837
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,400
on generating new structures

838
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,080
but you have to associate one element

839
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,640
with a new element further down the road

840
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,240
and so these properties are in turn

841
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,840
guided by principles of minimal search

842
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,799
unleashed effort

843
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,880
which i'll show in a minute fulfilling

844
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,320
the goal of active imprints to destroy

845
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,840
meaningful representations as efficient

846
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,120
as possible and i think that's really

847
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,600
what

848
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,440
it comes down to that's the kind of core

849
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,799
crucial message here

850
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,799
and if it can be shown that the the

851
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,240
language system

852
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,440
uh constructs meaningful representations

853
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,360
as efficiently as possible then

854
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,120
therefore it must be on accord

855
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,960
with the fdp and again that contributes

856
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,840
to surprise minimization amongst other

857
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,799
goals

858
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,200
so from the perspective of fep and the

859
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,320
range of possible

860
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,840
structures available to comprehenders

861
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,760
provide alternative hypotheses

862
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,000
that generalize as such preclude

863
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,679
overfitting sensory data

864
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,120
so if the complexities of linguistic

865
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,960
stimuli can be efficiently mapped to a

866
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,559
small series of regular

867
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,799
and regularized in the sense of blend

868
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,919
syntactic formats

869
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,760
this contributes to the brain's more

870
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,600
general goal of restricting itself to a

871
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
limited number of characteristic states

872
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,720
so in other words only change you

873
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,919
believe about things if you have to

874
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:28,720
right

875
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,559
and by mapping syntactic structures to

876
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,720
language external conceptual interfaces

877
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,400
now that's a kind of a key thing

878
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,840
language external

879
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,159
interfaces what that means is you have a

880
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,760
narrow

881
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,679
component of language the kind of narrow

882
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,039
what's called the narrow faculty of

883
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,320
language we can call it whatever you

884
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,000
like it's just the capacity to construct

885
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,799
phrase structures

886
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,880
but then you have the language external

887
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,159
mental modules

888
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,279
and memory systems and what have you and

889
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,440
attentional control systems uh in the

890
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,039
mind that are located across different

891
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:57,600
political

892
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,840
surfaces you know it's it's the kind of

893
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,279
standard the standard modular framework

894
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,400
i guess

895
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,960
and so by mapping these structures that

896
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,679
i've been generating

897
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,840
language to these language external

898
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,720
interfaces

899
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,159
in a minor adhere into principles of

900
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,000
economy language can be seen as engaging

901
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,360
in a series of questions and answers

902
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,279
with sensory data

903
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,559
specific so all the recent work in

904
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,159
theoretical semantics assumes that there

905
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:20,720
are

906
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,240
and there are fetable concepts that

907
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,400
language can interface with

908
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
and they're also non-fetchable concepts

909
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,080
so in other words that there are systems

910
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,320
that

911
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
there are properties of human thought

912
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,440
that the language

913
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,480
system seems pretty keen on um and

914
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,559
it likes to use and exploit but there

915
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,760
are other uh

916
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,000
modules of cognition that for some

917
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,760
reason um can't be linguistically

918
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,799
encoded as easily

919
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,159
that's kind of a weird property right

920
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,919
like why should we why should we be able

921
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,440
to linguistically encode

922
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,520
and communicate about certain thoughts

923
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,640
from others

924
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,400
and so one example is many of the

925
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,679
world's languages again

926
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,679
when i say words languages i mean that

927
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,880
in quotation marks

928
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,640
and what i really mean is many of the

929
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,559
individual human beings

930
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,919
they make use of quantification or

931
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,840
numerosity often you know

932
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,679
typically seen as via this frontal

933
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,880
parietal

934
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,720
uh quantification network which is

935
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,480
interestingly closely linked

936
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,600
uh to major language sites so that might

937
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,039
be one of the reasons why

938
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,520
it makes use of it and but they make

939
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,360
little use of color

940
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,720
despite color featuring just as

941
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,640
prominently an ordinary experience right

942
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,120
our sensorian is filled with colours

943
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,880
um and this might be due to the

944
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,399
remoteness of occipital visual regions

945
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,120
in the brain

946
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,799
maybe maybe not uh that's one

947
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,159
explanation maybe it's wrong

948
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,080
but it's one possible reason so for

949
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,200
instance one might imagine some

950
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,399
functional morphine

951
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,080
um encoding brightness or shade of

952
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,679
coloration in language you can imagine

953
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,440
it like if you were to invent a new

954
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,600
language you could you could encode

955
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,320
color

956
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,480
uh features somehow or some kind of

957
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,679
inflectional

958
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,120
but that doesn't seem to be the case

959
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,880
even though like i said that color is a

960
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,760
pretty important part of

961
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,840
your life at the same time language

962
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,120
seems to make considerable use of

963
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,720
certain contentful concepts like

964
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,919
eventuality

965
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,159
but not others like worry if you're like

966
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,039
you know no

967
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,480
things mark how concerned somebody is

968
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,000
about something i'm very concerned i'm a

969
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,039
little bit concerned i'm not very

970
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,240
concerned

971
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,080
which seems to be making potentially

972
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,159
neurally efficient use of specific

973
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,520
access easily accessible

974
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
representational resources rather than

975
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,000
less

976
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,559
easily accessible cognitive modules

977
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,120
right

978
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,600
to map complex meaning onto natural

979
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,760
language expressions

980
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,360
so it's fairly observed that language

981
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,880
acts as an artificial context

982
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,320
which helps constrain what

983
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,919
representations are recruited

984
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,679
and what impact they have on reasoning

985
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,840
and inference so words themselves are

986
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,799
highly flexible

987
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,960
and metabolically cheap sources of price

988
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,320
throughout the neural hierarchy this is

989
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,440
a really cool idea that i'm going to

990
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,320
expand on

991
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,559
in a few moments of time so to give you

992
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,679
some more examples of

993
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,520
again writing this back to active

994
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,279
imprints and take

995
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,279
the second ball second blue ball to the

996
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,480
left of the large box

997
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,399
that's a pretty simple spatial direction

998
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,840
but it can only be encoded

999
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,000
via natural language syntax right you

1000
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,880
need that kind of

1001
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,320
hierarchically organized phrase

1002
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,240
structure to generate that particular

1003
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,760
thought it's a very simple thought

1004
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,520
very simple direction but you can only

1005
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,880
generate inferences about it through

1006
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,000
using the recursive

1007
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,159
um combinatorial apparatus of language

1008
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,679
similarly you have structures like

1009
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,919
the young happy eager either going to

1010
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,600
oxford cambridge pleasant man

1011
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,520
this involves unbounded unstructured

1012
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,039
coordination involving

1013
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,880
disjunction too so the disjunction is

1014
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,159
you know x or y

1015
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,840
uh which is a highly complex structure

1016
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,200
to compute it's a highly complex

1017
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
conceptual structure and your language

1018
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,039
users can easily do it and readily infer

1019
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,720
it but it also um opens the

1020
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,880
the door for a whole new species of

1021
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,159
inferences to be generated

1022
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,600
new thoughts about the world new

1023
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,279
possible hidden states new things that

1024
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,320
you can think about

1025
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,559
and one of the examples of jerry photo

1026
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,919
or the philosophies together

1027
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,360
and uh he said you know if you take a

1028
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,080
a a pen and a piece of paper you can

1029
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,200
easily draw

1030
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,520
a man you can easily draw a zebra but

1031
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,320
it's kind of

1032
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,559
difficult to draw the thought that there

1033
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,159
is not a zebra next to you

1034
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,919
right so if you try and conceptualize

1035
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,840
the thought there is not a zebra next to

1036
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,159
me

1037
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,000
how can you draw that how can you depict

1038
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,760
the fact that there is no zebra next to

1039
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,080
me

1040
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,120
that's kind of weird it's kind of

1041
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,039
difficult to do i suppose you could draw

1042
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:03,520
like

1043
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,520
a man and then a zebra and a line

1044
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,799
through the zebra well

1045
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,240
that's kind of weird that still

1046
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,919
presupposes that there's a zebra next to

1047
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,279
him that you reject

1048
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,320
um so language uh generates a whole new

1049
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,200
species of

1050
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,880
a new format for thought basically it

1051
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,640
generates a new format for thought

1052
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
and which seems to be unique in other

1053
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,000
words not readily

1054
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,559
and translatable into other domains like

1055
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,200
visual

1056
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,440
representations or so these rapid

1057
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,520
inferences are our properties and states

1058
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,960
hidden states can be generated

1059
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,720
relatively effortlessly by language

1060
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,240
and like i said no other computational

1061
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,760
system and human cognition

1062
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,919
can achieve with this well that's the

1063
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,600
idea

1064
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,039
so a number of economy principles have

1065
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,440
been proposed in theoretical linguistics

1066
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,799
these are all very you know kind of

1067
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,360
technical um syntax related notions so

1068
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,480
i'm not going to explain too many of

1069
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,720
them but i will give some examples

1070
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,559
and these have all been framed like i

1071
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,080
said at the beginning they've all been

1072
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,840
framed exclusively within a linguistic

1073
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,480
context

1074
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,640
invoking highly domain specific notions

1075
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,320
despite a core part of the intended

1076
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:00,960
project

1077
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,480
of modern theoretical linguistics being

1078
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,240
to embed linguistic theory within

1079
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,399
principles general to cognition right

1080
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,760
so for example the inclusiveness

1081
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,519
condition maintains that no new elements

1082
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,399
can be introduced

1083
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,159
in the course of a particular syntactic

1084
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,840
derivation so once you integrate once

1085
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,200
you're passing a particular sentence and

1086
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,159
you're deriving

1087
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,080
a particular representation of that

1088
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,200
you're not just going to randomly

1089
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,360
introduce a new lexical item or a new um

1090
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,960
hidden element just just for the sake of

1091
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,080
it you're only going to do it if it

1092
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,320
contributes to immediate interpretation

1093
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,480
and so only existing elements can be

1094
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,000
rearranged restricting available

1095
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,880
resources

1096
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,399
but it's also unclear to what extent

1097
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,000
this computational principle finds

1098
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,760
analogous examples in non-linguistic

1099
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,000
domains right

1100
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,279
so one way of motivating these

1101
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,080
language-specific and generalizations

1102
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,640
by making direct reference to the fpp

1103
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,200
will

1104
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,360
not only foster i think uh more crucial

1105
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,399
relationships between

1106
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,760
their theories of hypocrision and

1107
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,840
neurobiology but will also broaden the

1108
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,519
explanatory scope for the existence and

1109
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,960
prevalence of particular syntactic

1110
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,320
phenomena

1111
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,840
and but what's interesting to know is

1112
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
that linguists readily admit to lacking

1113
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,200
a specific theory of computational

1114
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,159
appreciative language

1115
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,279
like i said at the beginning it's kind

1116
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,960
of a program right it's a programmatic

1117
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,600
notion

1118
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,679
so in a recent paper galeo and chomsky

1119
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,679
point out to be sure we do not have a

1120
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:10,960
general theory of computational

1121
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,600
efficiency

1122
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,960
but we do have some observations that

1123
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,159
are pretty obvious and should be part of

1124
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:14,720
that period

1125
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,159
right that's basically the state of the

1126
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,000
field uh linguists have very

1127
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,120
um uh well uh theories of uh

1128
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,760
language specific uh efficient uh

1129
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,399
efficiency

1130
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,200
uh criteria but they're translating that

1131
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,799
into kind of more domain general

1132
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:33,279
uh gold areas has not been so successful

1133
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,720
but we can at least suppose that

1134
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,559
whatever definition will be forthcoming

1135
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,320
will be related to more generic notions

1136
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,640
of economy like hamiltonian notions

1137
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,320
or minimizing energy expenditure during

1138
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,159
language processing uh shortening the

1139
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,080
description of your minimal description

1140
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,159
uh reducing pomegranate complexity and

1141
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,519
the degree of necessitated belief

1142
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,799
updating again like i said you know

1143
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,919
requires one's belief

1144
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,600
if needed and more happy

1145
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,200
so one of these uh so-called

1146
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,919
minimal computational procedures is uh

1147
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,919
what's called relative rise minimality

1148
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,679
so this is the principle that states

1149
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,600
that given a particular configuration

1150
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,960
x z and y a local relation cannot

1151
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,519
connect

1152
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,799
x and y if z intervenes and z fully

1153
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,200
matches the specification of x and y

1154
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,799
in terms of the regular features i'll

1155
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,320
give an example of that so in other

1156
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,159
words if x and y attempt to establish a

1157
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,919
syntactic relation if you go if you call

1158
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,279
back to the long distance dependency

1159
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,320
thing i mentioned

1160
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,640
and put some element into beans and

1161
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,799
provide and can also provide a super set

1162
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,279
of extra particular features ie x's

1163
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,799
features plus some other features

1164
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,200
this box of relation that sounds

1165
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,000
extremely abstract

1166
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,159
so i do apologize for that but this is a

1167
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,519
more concrete example

1168
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,679
so in the sentence you haven't won and

1169
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,600
which game provides a subset

1170
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,840
of the features um hosted by howe

1171
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,320
which results in unacceptability but the

1172
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,919
equivalent does not obtain in two

1173
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,360
and so a relationship between both

1174
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,120
copies of which game can obtain

1175
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,440
licensing interpretation uh and the

1176
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,159
strikethrough

1177
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,919
denotes the originally made position

1178
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,760
after uh after movement has taken place

1179
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,440
so it's originally merged down here

1180
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,039
and then you move the structure to the

1181
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,719
beginning of the sentence in order

1182
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,800
to form a question so question formation

1183
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,199
often uh involves just moving all in

1184
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,639
uh in the middle of the end of the

1185
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,679
sentence the beginning to form a

1186
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,800
question

1187
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,879
and so if you say how do you wonder

1188
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,560
which game to play

1189
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,639
that sounds pretty ungrammatical but if

1190
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,679
you say which game

1191
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,679
do you wonder how to play which has the

1192
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,440
same approximate interpretation that's

1193
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,079
okay

1194
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,599
and the reason why is because uh uh

1195
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,839
howe hosts only a queue feature a

1196
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:34,800
question feature

1197
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,599
and as it searches down the structure um

1198
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,239
it

1199
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,879
encounters which game now which game

1200
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,879
bears a cue feature because of which

1201
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,040
but it also has a now feature because of

1202
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
game and so therefore it can't reach its

1203
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,000
final destination

1204
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,359
the final destination being it's

1205
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,280
originally made position after play

1206
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,719
which only has a queue feature

1207
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,879
on the other hand if you move uh which

1208
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,960
game to work do you wonder

1209
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,160
and you leave howe in situ then which

1210
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,320
game carries these two features here

1211
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,880
and it skips over how because how does

1212
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,079
does not satisfy

1213
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,079
the full feature specifications of which

1214
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,320
game right so it needs to search further

1215
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,400
and then only when it searches back and

1216
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,680
reaches to its originally merged

1217
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,400
position

1218
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,160
does it interpret it so this mean what

1219
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,440
this means is when you say

1220
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,000
which game do you wonder how to play

1221
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,520
you're interpreting which game at the

1222
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,880
position of play

1223
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,240
because you're not into you're not

1224
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,000
definitely that edition of wonder you're

1225
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,599
not asking which game

1226
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,160
do you wonder how you wonder you're

1227
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,520
asking which game do you wonder how you

1228
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,079
play

1229
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,560
it's all about the question is about the

1230
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,599
plays on it

1231
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,440
and so this has been argued to emerge

1232
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,119
directly from minimal search

1233
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,480
uh allowing this higher level

1234
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,839
representational principle to make

1235
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,119
directly from properties of official

1236
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,720
computation this is one example where

1237
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,160
you have a kind of a

1238
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,440
rhetorically kind of gross higher order

1239
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,880
uh principle in linguistics being

1240
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,200
reduced to a lower level and more simple

1241
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,240
kind of element

1242
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,160
so translating that into minimal search

1243
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,520
you cannot even consider

1244
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,680
as i just said when you search the

1245
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,200
structure for matching your features in

1246
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,000
two

1247
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,599
the minimal stage procedure would simply

1248
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,440
skip out but it will find the original

1249
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,400
copy of which game

1250
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,880
because it's searching in across the

1251
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,839
full structure

1252
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,560
so another example of economy can be

1253
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,760
found in the principle of full

1254
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,800
interpretation

1255
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
which simply states and that there are

1256
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,240
no superior symbols allowed

1257
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,240
at the two linguistic interfaces so

1258
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,599
these interfaces are assumed to be the

1259
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,440
conceptual and sensory window systems

1260
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,720
so in other words the two things you can

1261
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,560
do with a linguistic structure is you

1262
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,440
can interpret it

1263
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,040
or you can externalize it you can

1264
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,400
produce it you can you can say it you

1265
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,280
can sign it

1266
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,359
uh you can translate it into braille and

1267
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,920
so on and or you can simply think it so

1268
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,440
this ensures that the system need not

1269
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,800
compute symbols that are ultimately

1270
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,320
subverted to the goals of either

1271
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,480
interpretation or externalization

1272
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,560
so for instance in three this has an

1273
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,240
argument that does not have a semantic

1274
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:50,640
role

1275
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,320
so therefore it's unacceptable so you

1276
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,680
can imagine um

1277
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,359
the sentence walt gave jesse a gun

1278
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,200
that's fine all the semantic roles

1279
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,400
are filled there's an agent there's a

1280
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,000
patient and there's an instrument being

1281
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,359
involved the particular tool

1282
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,280
but then if you add to saw there's an

1283
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,480
additional kind of location

1284
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,320
preposition and being marked there but

1285
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,680
it doesn't have a semantic role

1286
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,599
so it can't be interpreted and that

1287
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,280
sounds kind of trivial right like most

1288
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,079
people when you

1289
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,200
when you give them these examples they

1290
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,640
say well yeah obviously that's kind of

1291
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,760
not a very deep thing

1292
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,280
but actually it's it's a pretty puzzling

1293
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,359
like phenomenon it demands actually it

1294
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,160
has to be explained somehow

1295
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,079
and so one of the operations that's been

1296
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,920
involved in this uh

1297
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,079
minimal computational procedure is

1298
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:28,960
called mage

1299
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,040
so the operation image simply takes x

1300
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,800
and y and forms the set x y

1301
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,920
it just puts two things together and

1302
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,359
this constructs the binary branching

1303
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,480
structures that i mentioned

1304
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,800
but merge itself can also derive some

1305
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,720
core uh separated properties of

1306
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,839
linguistic relations

1307
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,240
such as membership uh dominate team off

1308
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,520
and so on these different hierarchical

1309
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,720
relations between nodes

1310
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,359
and in a tree uh you know one one uh

1311
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,800
branch of a tree being higher

1312
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,119
or more deeply embedded than another one

1313
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,079
and as well as

1314
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,000
other relations see what's called c

1315
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,760
command we can put that aside

1316
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,079
and so in brief much of the complexities

1317
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,240
of syntactic relations and can be

1318
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,760
derived from successive instances of

1319
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,000
this simple marriage computation

1320
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,079
and reducing complex visibles to simple

1321
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,920
invisibles

1322
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,839
so for instance if you the example i

1323
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,880
gave here with which game

1324
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,079
you can imagine uh the set a b being

1325
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,040
constructed

1326
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,960
and then if you take the same element b

1327
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,640
and you merge it with the set again

1328
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,119
you get b a b and then you can delete

1329
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,960
the first appearance of b

1330
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,800
and then you simply get the linear order

1331
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,160
would be b a

1332
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,400
right rather than the actual set being

1333
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,200
interpreted as b

1334
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,800
a b and this seems to be what's

1335
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,119
happening here where you have a b

1336
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,599
over here which game and then an a the

1337
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,560
whole structure

1338
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,720
and then b again being originally

1339
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,680
measured

1340
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,920
so all of these kind of con

1341
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,280
superficially complex

1342
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,800
linguistic phenomena which on the

1343
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,240
surface seem very complicated and very

1344
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,880
elaborate

1345
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,480
they can all be boiled down to a very

1346
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,920
simple operation which is just

1347
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,440
take two things and put them together uh

1348
00:38:59,440 --> 00:38:59,760
and

1349
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,800
what's interesting about this is that

1350
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,960
related when i'm not like a junction uh

1351
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,320
do not involve modification of the

1352
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,000
semantic content of the structure the

1353
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,599
adjunct is a candidate room so an

1354
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,200
adjunct is something like uh

1355
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,440
like a prepositional object like in the

1356
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,280
path or to the beach

1357
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,400
and so for instance if you think a

1358
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,720
structure like john and mary talked in

1359
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,839
the bar

1360
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,599
the fact that they talked in the past

1361
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,200
doesn't change the fact that they talk

1362
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,800
right so the actual original

1363
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,400
interpretation the syntactic structure

1364
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,240
of the integrity and the meaning of john

1365
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,280
and mary talked

1366
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,839
is not changed by adding an adjunct so

1367
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,760
you can add an adjunct in the park

1368
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,440
but that doesn't change the fact that

1369
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,119
john and mary still talk right

1370
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,560
again that sounds like a very trivial

1371
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,320
property it's obvious

1372
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,320
right but again it demands explanation

1373
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
it has to be a reason for that and the

1374
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,400
reason why is it turns out that and

1375
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,280
when you add an adjunct you simply um

1376
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,040
you simply linearly add it to the end

1377
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,119
you don't change the actual identity of

1378
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,240
the phrase itself

1379
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,160
uh there's no what's called labeling

1380
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,359
there's no labeling involved

1381
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,880
in prepositional major merging so you

1382
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,320
don't change the identity of the pocket

1383
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,000
rates

1384
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,839
so the ftp has been equated with the

1385
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,359
principle of least effort

1386
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,359
and its process theory is active

1387
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,440
inference so strictly speaking the fpp

1388
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,880
basically is a computational principle

1389
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,359
right

1390
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,880
uh the probabilistic beliefs it's

1391
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,880
concerned with are directed absolutely

1392
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,160
namely external states of a

1393
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
self-organizing system and in in a

1394
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,200
similar way that the entity is a

1395
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,720
researcher is that

1396
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,160
so too is much of recent theoretical

1397
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,760
linguistics guided by programmatic

1398
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,200
concerns right like i said it's a

1399
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,000
program it's an ongoing kind of ideology

1400
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,960
on the other hand linguists have

1401
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,480
developed theories of syntactic least

1402
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,599
effort like i said

1403
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,440
um but the process theory is a little

1404
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,119
bit less clear right how it's actually

1405
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,160
implemented

1406
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,640
is slightly less clear and what i would

1407
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,400
argue may become more clear

1408
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,839
if it can be accommodated within

1409
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,680
existing frameworks and knowledge

1410
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,599
that the active infrastructure can bring

1411
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,800
with it to help

1412
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,680
solve the puzzle of how a language is uh

1413
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,000
implemented in the brain

1414
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
so here's another example for you and

1415
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,800
routinely poems that rhyme evaporate

1416
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,240
so in this instance routinely

1417
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,720
exclusively modifiers evaporate

1418
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,160
so the wave routinely goes with

1419
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,760
evaporate that's how they're injected

1420
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,240
so it can't modify rhyme even though

1421
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,160
this word is closer in terms of linear

1422
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,599
distance to routinely right

1423
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,480
so ryan comes one two three words after

1424
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,000
but evaporate comes one

1425
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,680
two three four in terms of linear

1426
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,040
distance so they're more

1427
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,520
they're more linearly remote and yet in

1428
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,720
terms of interpretation

1429
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,280
they go together and the reason is and

1430
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,560
the matrix predicate

1431
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,480
evaporate is closer in terms of

1432
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,000
structural distance to routinely

1433
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,960
and the reason why is um that rhyme is

1434
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,000
embedded within

1435
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,400
the phrase headed by poems so it has

1436
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,920
it's on it exists on a different

1437
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,680
hierarchical plane if you like it's kind

1438
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,280
of lower down in the hierarchy

1439
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,280
and evaporate and so language computes

1440
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,280
over structural distance and not linear

1441
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,280
distance

1442
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,960
so sensors are not simply beads on a

1443
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,599
string they're not linear objects

1444
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,839
and they have to be linear objects in

1445
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,359
terms of centromere externalization

1446
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,240
because we live

1447
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,319
in the universe we live in we can't we

1448
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:57,599
can't speak in parallel we can only

1449
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,480
speak in

1450
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,200
linear linearization although there is

1451
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,079
some evidence that

1452
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,480
uh sign languages uh can communicate

1453
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,319
somewhat to some degree in parallel

1454
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,480
like you sign one uh element with one

1455
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,000
hand and then another word

1456
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,200
so there's some evidence that sign

1457
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
language might be able to

1458
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,280
defy the laws of physics but it turns

1459
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,800
out it's that's probably exaggerated to

1460
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,079
an extent

1461
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,839
it is still a form of linearization but

1462
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,119
just kind of a

1463
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,560
co-linearization development so language

1464
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,000
prioritizes the demands of the syntax

1465
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,200
semantics interface over other

1466
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,839
subsystems like

1467
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:31,280
morphophonology so while two structures

1468
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,440
might exhibit different linear orders

1469
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,960
they may exhibit the same underlying

1470
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,400
hierarchy so here's a really good

1471
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,000
example in english and fast

1472
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
the verb direct object dependencies are

1473
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,680
the opposite but the interpretation is

1474
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,280
concerned

1475
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,839
so john has read the book you have john

1476
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,440
then auxiliary then the

1477
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,079
then the object and in basque you have a

1478
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,040
different order

1479
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,880
you have john then the book then the

1480
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,240
verb and then the auxiliary

1481
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,839
and yet they mean the same thing they

1482
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,359
have the same interpretation right

1483
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,000
so this suggests that um a kind of more

1484
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,960
fundamental

1485
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,960
uh operations going on here namely

1486
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,040
syntax encodes the verb and direct

1487
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,599
object

1488
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,920
as an abstract phrase which omits the

1489
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,240
subject so in other words in the syntax

1490
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,160
in english and basque you have the same

1491
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,599
underlying syntax which is

1492
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,520
subject and then verb and direct object

1493
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,680
being merged so you merge the b and do

1494
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,240
first

1495
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,160
and then you accommodate the subject and

1496
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,760
then when you linearize that

1497
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,040
when you you know communicate it in the

1498
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,040
externally and you do it in different

1499
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,200
ways in english you do it one way

1500
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,960
in past you do it another way and but

1501
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,400
the basic idea is the same you have the

1502
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:32,720
same

1503
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,400
underlying interpretation that also

1504
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,839
accounts for something pretty obvious

1505
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,440
mainly the fact that you can translate

1506
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,560
you know one sentence into another

1507
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,520
language right

1508
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,359
that's that's a fairly obvious thing

1509
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:42,960
that you can do with language and so

1510
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,079
therefore there has to be some kind of

1511
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,200
commonality somehow

1512
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,359
but the commonalities might be much more

1513
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,599
deeper down than most people kind of

1514
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,760
appreciate

1515
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,200
so through the various stages of

1516
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,960
language development as well innocent

1517
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,599
children

1518
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,359
don't typically produce expressions that

1519
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,119
deviate from general grammatical

1520
00:43:59,119 --> 00:43:59,920
principles

1521
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,280
pertaining to the structure dependence

1522
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,119
of rules even when they produce

1523
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,240
so-called mistakes

1524
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,240
so there's been a lot of research on a

1525
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,880
child language development

1526
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,640
so in other words when children do make

1527
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,400
mistakes they seem to make mistakes

1528
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:12,800
which

1529
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,640
accord with the grammatical rules of

1530
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,720
their language which suggests that and

1531
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,680
sensitivity to

1532
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,160
um structure dependence uh forms a core

1533
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,520
part of language design

1534
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,200
so corpus studies of infinite language

1535
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,720
exposure reveal that there are actually

1536
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,760
very few diagrams let alone trigrams so

1537
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,440
statistical procedures can help

1538
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,960
but there seems to be some more kind of

1539
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,240
innate sensitivity to structure

1540
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,200
dependence

1541
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,319
which seems necessary and as a recent

1542
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:38,160
paper also reviews human learners

1543
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,240
prepare to induce hypotheses that have a

1544
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,079
shorter description length and logic

1545
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,760
with simplicity preferences possibly

1546
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,079
being a governing principle

1547
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,319
uh of uh cognitive systems all in the

1548
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,000
code of what the fpp would predict

1549
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,560
so simplicity-based preferences i've got

1550
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,480
a range of formal language models too

1551
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,760
relating to the notion of minimal

1552
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,400
description and you know you might also

1553
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,040
invoke

1554
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,760
principles of minimum redundancy so this

1555
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,440
is kind of a really important idea

1556
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,079
uh minimal computational efficiency

1557
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,440
seems to be a really general

1558
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,960
cognitive goal of the brain and there's

1559
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,640
a couple of recent papers one of them in

1560
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,079
text i think that came out

1561
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,760
maybe last year or maybe this year i

1562
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,560
can't remember um i think was called

1563
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,400
memory as a computational resource

1564
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,319
which showed that um across a bunch of

1565
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,240
domains human memory in its various

1566
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:24,960
guises

1567
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,119
also exhibits uh an adherence to

1568
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,400
principles of efficiency

1569
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,720
so i think it's not too surprising to

1570
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,160
when linguists come along and say

1571
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,520
you know language also adheres to

1572
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,599
principles or efficient computation

1573
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,440
so all of these ideas seem to be you

1574
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,200
know out there at the moment

1575
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,960
and everyone's kind of coming to more or

1576
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,319
less the same conclusions but

1577
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,160
just using different language just using

1578
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,440
different background assumptions

1579
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,760
but the general idea i think is is kind

1580
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,480
of

1581
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,920
they all mesh well together so as i said

1582
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,200
linguistic computation seems to be

1583
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,560
optimized for the generation of

1584
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,920
interpretable structures

1585
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,280
rather than for the generation of

1586
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,200
maximally communicative messages

1587
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,599
on specifics so in other words and

1588
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:02,880
whenever there's a conflict between

1589
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,319
principles of computational efficiency

1590
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,599
on the one hand

1591
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,359
and principles of communicative clarity

1592
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,520
on the other performer typically wins

1593
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,960
now this is not to say that when we do

1594
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,400
communicate with each other as we're by

1595
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,839
first and then

1596
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,079
when we do communicate we do do it in an

1597
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,599
efficient way but that's a separate

1598
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,480
question from wherever

1599
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,400
the language system is designed in a way

1600
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,520
as to maximize

1601
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,280
that communication so the normal

1602
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,800
functioning syntax seems to lead the

1603
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,079
instances which reduce

1604
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,560
communicative efficiency and prioritize

1605
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,079
inference generation

1606
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,680
so that so the goal of the language

1607
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,440
system is to generate

1608
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,400
particular inferences and

1609
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,920
representations about the environment in

1610
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,680
an efficient way so here's a pretty

1611
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,119
clear example of this right

1612
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,040
if you take the sentence you persuaded

1613
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,200
saul to sell his car

1614
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,960
the individual and the object can both

1615
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,119
be questioned but questioning the more

1616
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,720
deeply embedded object

1617
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,400
in terms of the hierarchical structure

1618
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,839
forces the speaker to produce a more

1619
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,520
complex safe locution

1620
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,680
right so you can say uh who did you

1621
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,200
persuade to sell what

1622
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,880
but you can't say what did you persuade

1623
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,480
who to sell even though they mean the

1624
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,200
same thing

1625
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,680
right same word same interpretation all

1626
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,480
it means is

1627
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,079
you know what is the individual and

1628
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,599
what's the object that's it

1629
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,599
just just tell me who the individual is

1630
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,880
and what your objectives

1631
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,200
but you can only say it if you construct

1632
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,000
it in

1633
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,960
the most computationally efficient way i

1634
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,800
search for the first possible element to

1635
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,520
question

1636
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,440
right if you search for the more deeply

1637
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,559
embedded object

1638
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,040
can't do it and so the structures in 11

1639
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,240
involve the same words same

1640
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,119
interpretations

1641
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,400
yeah the more computationally costly

1642
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,319
process can't be licensed so this is a

1643
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,280
pretty good example and there's plenty

1644
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,319
of examples like this by the way i've

1645
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,079
written a paper about it in gloucester

1646
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,680
plenty of examples in which there is a

1647
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,440
clear conflict between um

1648
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,920
syntactic uh priorities of just

1649
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,680
generating a meaningful structure

1650
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,559
and generating possible structures that

1651
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:47,520
would actually aid

1652
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,720
communicative efficiency and

1653
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,960
communicative flexibility that's not a

1654
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,880
priority of language

1655
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,079
so other examples show that the

1656
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,440
acceptability of sentences can be

1657
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,960
impacted based on the extent

1658
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,640
to which the construction makes and it

1659
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,079
contributes to a novel

1660
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,040
non-redundant contribution to one's

1661
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,480
mental models beliefs again this is

1662
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:04,960
really

1663
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,240
directly in the core of what active

1664
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,079
entrance would predict uh rather than

1665
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,280
those of course specifics

1666
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,800
again reinforcing the role of syntactic

1667
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,240
processing and inference generation

1668
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,599
rather than communication

1669
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,640
so the greater acceptability in 12b that

1670
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,079
the real by the way the reason why these

1671
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,400
are number 12 13 is that's that's that's

1672
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,559
the numeration in the in the paper

1673
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,200
so the reason why 12b uh seems degraded

1674
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,400
relative to 12a

1675
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,760
seems to then from the fact that the

1676
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,520
speakers are unlikely to be ignorant of

1677
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,040
the relevant content right it's kind of

1678
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,160
a pragmatic reason

1679
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,839
so kim knows where the soul's in bed

1680
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,680
that sounds okay but kim knows whether

1681
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,480
i'm in bed

1682
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,400
sounds kind of weird even though it's a

1683
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,240
technically grammatical sentence

1684
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,839
uh it sounds weird because you would

1685
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,440
never say it it doesn't contribute

1686
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,720
meaningfully to

1687
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,800
revising or contributing to once mental

1688
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,640
models or beliefs about the world

1689
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,559
so therefore the language system doesn't

1690
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,160
like it which again

1691
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,000
brings in closer contact uh language

1692
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,680
design with the fdp

1693
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,240
and also cases such as 13 real how even

1694
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,480
processes such as contraction

1695
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,319
are sensitive to hierarchical structure

1696
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,319
and can't be executed over any other

1697
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,720
and any random word boundary so you can

1698
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,720
say source taller than chemist

1699
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,319
but you can't say source taller than

1700
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,960
kins and the reason is because there's a

1701
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,559
invisible phrase boundary between those

1702
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,880
two elements

1703
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,920
other examples that related to it are in

1704
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,440
14 and 15 you can say

1705
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,280
what do you want to do and you can

1706
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,119
contract and say what do you want to do

1707
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:26,640
but if you say who do you want to read

1708
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,720
the book and you can't contract that to

1709
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,359
generate

1710
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,640
dude you want to read the book that

1711
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,839
sounds a bit weird i mean you

1712
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,040
technically can't say it

1713
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,559
right and if you say that to me i would

1714
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,240
know what you mean i know

1715
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,440
you mean straight away there's no

1716
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,760
problem but it sounds a bit more awkward

1717
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,040
again the idea is that there's an

1718
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,800
invisible phrase behind you there but

1719
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,319
commits that stops contraction

1720
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,800
uh efficient computation uh or at least

1721
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,240
structured dependence actually i should

1722
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:50,800
say

1723
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,480
is also exhibited in more classical

1724
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,839
examples in the literature

1725
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,319
so if you say the man is happy you can

1726
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:57,359
uh question that

1727
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,079
that structure by moving the auxiliary

1728
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:00,640
to the front

1729
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,040
and saying is the man happy and so you

1730
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,720
might be forced to conclude well maybe

1731
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,240
to form a question you simply search the

1732
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,280
structure and take the first possible

1733
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,839
element but that turns out not to be

1734
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,640
sufficient

1735
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,400
so you can say the man who is tall is

1736
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,480
happy but you can't say is the man who

1737
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,599
tall is happy

1738
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,000
uh because who is tall is again similar

1739
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,200
to poems like ryan

1740
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,160
routinely is embedded more deeply in the

1741
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,079
the man-headed phrase

1742
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,800
is that the the question uh is happy

1743
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,240
which is higher of the hierarchy and

1744
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,760
easier to search for

1745
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,359
so therefore you have to say is the man

1746
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,200
who is tall happy because it is

1747
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,960
is actually closer to the element you're

1748
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,480
questioning in terms of structural

1749
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,119
distance

1750
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,160
than the ears in who is tall so again

1751
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,240
syntax cares about structural proximity

1752
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,040
and i'm not linear proximity

1753
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,319
and there are also constraints on this

1754
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:50,240
as well and so you can say john a

1755
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,920
chicken and bread for lunch

1756
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,480
um and you can question the whole uh

1757
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,000
phrasal conjunct chicken and bread you

1758
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
can say what did johnny punch

1759
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,720
but if you want to efficiently question

1760
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,000
one element

1761
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,359
that's how you already knew that giant

1762
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,040
chicken but you're not sure what else he

1763
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,359
ate

1764
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,960
you can't say what did johnny chicken

1765
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,720
and lunch which

1766
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,920
there's no reason why you can't do that

1767
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,359
right like why can't you say that it's a

1768
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,640
terribly fine thought

1769
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,319
and you already know that i ate chicken

1770
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:15,440
you know someone just told you ate

1771
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,640
chicken and something else

1772
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,559
um but you can't say what the giant

1773
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:19,680
chicken had for lunch

1774
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,280
because the whole the syntax respects

1775
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,880
the integrity of the phrase chicken and

1776
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,359
bread

1777
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,839
it's it's it has a phrasal identity that

1778
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,040
syntax respects

1779
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,920
and you can't violate it you can't just

1780
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,440
violate the phrase boundary and only

1781
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,079
interrogate while

1782
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,079
other examples relate across phrase

1783
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,440
boundaries and confidence boundaries not

1784
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,240
just within them

1785
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,240
so you can say sam gave a guitar to me

1786
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,599
and loaned a trumpet to you

1787
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,880
and you can question both elements you

1788
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,480
can say what did sam give to me and loan

1789
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,040
to you

1790
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,720
but you can't say what did sound give to

1791
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,319
me and loan the trumpet to you

1792
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:49,760
even though again in terms of

1793
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,680
communicative efficiency that's a pretty

1794
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,040
simple structure to generate you already

1795
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,720
know that he loaned the trumpet to you

1796
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,960
you want to figure out what sam gave to

1797
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,520
me right

1798
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,440
and again these uh relations of

1799
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,720
hierarchy

1800
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,800
you can find them all over the place uh

1801
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,559
so pronoun uh

1802
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,880
reference is a pretty good example you

1803
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,400
can say mary said that he has a lot of

1804
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:10,880
talent

1805
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,559
and that peter should go far in which

1806
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,400
case the pronoun he is being connected

1807
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,680
with peter

1808
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,240
uh in which case you have the pronoun

1809
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,200
here

1810
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,000
coming before the actual element peter

1811
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,520
but then when you simply take that

1812
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,400
phrase and question it and unstate it

1813
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,680
it's no longer acceptable

1814
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,280
you can't say he has a lot of talent and

1815
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,880
peter should go far that sounds a bit

1816
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,359
strange

1817
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,319
he should refer to someone like john and

1818
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,839
and the reason why is because when you

1819
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:36,480
embed

1820
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,400
that structure in one a large structure

1821
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,240
it changes the actual identity of the

1822
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:40,880
conjunct

1823
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,760
so the conjunct that headed by that is a

1824
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,960
compromised phrase

1825
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,040
whereas the conjunct headed by he and

1826
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,000
peter are simply tense phrases tv

1827
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,079
and other puzzles exist here as well so

1828
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,280
you can say john

1829
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,200
you can say john said he is proud of his

1830
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,480
house in which case

1831
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,480
he goes with john but it sounds weird to

1832
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,000
say in john's house he organized a

1833
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,280
meeting

1834
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,000
and when he refers to john again you can

1835
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,359
kind of pass it you can force it but it

1836
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:06,480
sounds a bit more awkward

1837
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,079
it's more natural for he to refer to

1838
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:09,839
peter if you say in john's house you

1839
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:10,800
know someone else

1840
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,640
that organized anything and the reason

1841
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,400
why is because code reference

1842
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,000
via this phenomenal phrase blunting is

1843
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,599
bad since syntax preserves

1844
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,280
interpretation across movement so the

1845
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,960
original structure that's generated

1846
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,800
is uh john said is he's in john's house

1847
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,599
he organized a meeting right um that's

1848
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:28,160
that's

1849
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,400
generated from a more original structure

1850
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,680
uh he organized the meeting of john's

1851
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,160
house

1852
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,559
in which case you have uh he uh coming

1853
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,000
before john in the same kind of

1854
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,280
tense-free structure that i mentioned

1855
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,480
earlier

1856
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,160
so in other words syntax seems to win

1857
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,880
over linear precedence

1858
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,240
although kind of quick examples like

1859
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,599
this too so you can say i gave her the

1860
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,280
book that sarah always wanted

1861
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,640
but if you say i gave her the book that

1862
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,480
sarah wanted but again that sounds

1863
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,680
slightly strange

1864
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,040
changing the syntax by adding the

1865
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,040
adverbial element changes the actual

1866
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,760
uh content of the phrase itself which

1867
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,440
allows more easier co-reference

1868
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,760
so um stepping back a little bit this

1869
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,520
this whole framework of like merging and

1870
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,040
generating hierarchical structures

1871
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,400
has been argued in the literature to

1872
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,240
kind of uh boil down

1873
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,440
from a more domain general lower level

1874
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,280
uh computational procedure so some

1875
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,800
people have called it the universal

1876
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,920
generative faculty

1877
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,920
which is just the ability to construct

1878
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,680
hierarchical structures and map onto

1879
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,880
different interfaces

1880
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,839
so the idea is that and when we have our

1881
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:26,960
system of moral

1882
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,800
judgment formation which involves agents

1883
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,160
patients events and so on

1884
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,440
that still requires some kind of

1885
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,119
combinatorial apparatus to generate

1886
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,240
those judgments

1887
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,839
same with music it's been known since

1888
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,599
the 70s that um

1889
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,359
musical structures have a kind of higher

1890
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,359
up correlation to them

1891
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,440
and then also with a numerosity with

1892
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,720
numbers you can imagine that it's been

1893
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,160
hypothesized by chomsky

1894
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,760
that if you restrict this operational

1895
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,599
mage to a single element and simply

1896
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,440
reapply it you can kind of generate the

1897
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,280
natural numbers right so you can kind of

1898
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,960
form the empty set and then merge it

1899
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,400
with itself and then merge it with that

1900
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,160
object and so on and that kind of gives

1901
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,079
it uh you can call it zero and then call

1902
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:00,960
the next one one

1903
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,480
and call the one after that too that

1904
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,160
gives you the natural numbers but

1905
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,359
the general idea is that you have an

1906
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:07,680
underlying generative and faculty

1907
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,280
that can interface with different

1908
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,200
subsystems so in interfaces with the

1909
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,240
sound system you get

1910
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,480
music when it interfaces with whatever

1911
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,000
morality is theory of minds

1912
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,839
structures or judgment formation or

1913
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:19,680
whatever you get moral

1914
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,680
judgments uh when it interfaces with the

1915
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,440
system of quantification and numerosity

1916
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,079
you get

1917
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:25,520
the natural numbers and then when it

1918
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,200
interfaces with the lexicon whatever

1919
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,040
that is even more mysteriously you get

1920
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,480
language

1921
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,079
which is exactly what the album i'm

1922
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,000
saying right here so huge

1923
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,880
f major sound music and so on and but

1924
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,640
interestingly only language seems to

1925
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,480
attribute to these most elements

1926
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,119
an independent identity so with

1927
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,240
quantification

1928
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,880
music and morality you simply involve a

1929
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,079
generation of

1930
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:49,839
a chunk some kind of chunking that's

1931
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,520
happening but with a natural language

1932
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,359
you seem to get an additional operation

1933
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:55,040
you don't just chunk things you chunk

1934
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,880
them and then you give it an additional

1935
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,240
identity right you give it

1936
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,119
a kind of the the um the sum is greater

1937
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:02,400
than the parts i guess you can call it

1938
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,640
that that way

1939
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,920
so and what's interesting is that you

1940
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,520
can use that merge structure to then

1941
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,319
call it again

1942
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:10,240
so kind of you can kind of treat it as

1943
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,599
an independent object

1944
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,599
independent of its constituent parts

1945
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:14,880
whereas you can't you don't really seem

1946
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,319
to be able to do that in music or

1947
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:17,119
language

1948
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,160
uh sorry uh non-music domains so there's

1949
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:20,960
also um

1950
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,079
a recent paper uh by stan duhain who

1951
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:25,119
argues that this

1952
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,640
capacity to generate nested tree

1953
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,960
structures um is a human specific

1954
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,520
kind of species property right and it

1955
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,960
gives a bunch of different um

1956
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,760
neurobiological instantiations with this

1957
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,280
and but the basic idea is that you know

1958
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,440
only humans have language

1959
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,160
uh along alongside that you get an

1960
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:42,880
interest in

1961
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,040
a unique level of tool complexity

1962
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,960
possibly due to this linguistic capacity

1963
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,960
so for instance um spheres are

1964
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,799
constructed from a rock and a shaft

1965
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,480
but it's not just a sphere it's not just

1966
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,400
a rock plus a shaft right a sphere is a

1967
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,599
rock muscle shaft

1968
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,680
with an additional abstraction the

1969
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,359
functional use of it the utility

1970
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:00,400
i'm going to come back to that in a

1971
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,079
couple of minutes but uh language seems

1972
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:03,119
to be uniquely

1973
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,119
concerned with functional abstractions

1974
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,640
like use not just form

1975
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:12,000
and then on top of that it seems that

1976
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,520
only humans have what chomsky has

1977
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,240
loosely called

1978
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,799
the science bombing faculty so only

1979
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,160
humans are scientists

1980
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,319
not surprisingly um we can do things

1981
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:21,599
like peace and abduction or

1982
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,319
non-deductive complex infant generation

1983
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:25,839
where you get you know some weird event

1984
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,079
ear cares but then we posit that if

1985
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,799
a is true and then yeah e would simply

1986
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:31,760
follow naturally

1987
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,559
right so we assume a and then of course

1988
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:35,920
on top of that we have the other example

1989
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,520
i mentioned theory of mind boxes by a

1990
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,799
hierarchical language you know i know

1991
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:39,920
that you know that tune

1992
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,079
so there's all these kinds of weird

1993
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,000
human specific cognitive traits

1994
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,920
all of which can potentially maybe be

1995
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,839
boiled down to or connected to

1996
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,799
some linguistic capacity so here's a

1997
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:52,240
good example that the hane gives

1998
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,319
and these are five different types of

1999
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,640
sequence sequences that you can generate

2000
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,559
only human beings seen capable of

2001
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,160
generating nested tree structures

2002
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,119
as i've argued here and in the paper and

2003
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,640
we generate tree structures not just

2004
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,280
randomly

2005
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,559
we don't just do it because we feel like

2006
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,040
it we do it efficiently and in the

2007
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,760
for the explicit purpose of active input

2008
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,720
generation

2009
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,680
so transition and timing chunking

2010
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,799
ordinal knowledge

2011
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,240
algebraic patterns these are all

2012
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,640
non-human uh capacities too

2013
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,720
bonobos macaques fade song they all

2014
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,000
exhibit these forms of things

2015
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,920
it's only humans that can do uh option

2016
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,680
number five the nested true structure

2017
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,440
business

2018
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,200
so again this is this is the idea that

2019
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,119
when you merge car factory

2020
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,520
you don't just manage two nouns right

2021
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,480
car and factory

2022
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,240
you actually create a noun phrase a

2023
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,520
structure that's bigger than the two

2024
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,160
parts

2025
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,680
so in other words the factory is not in

2026
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,000
our phrase and car is not a nanophrase

2027
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,520
you need both of them to create a noun

2028
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,040
phrase and then you can use that noun

2029
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,960
phrase as an independent unit

2030
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,720
um with a certain kind of computational

2031
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,760
identity so this leads to a kind of a

2032
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,319
more

2033
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:58,240
um important question i think which is

2034
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,079
what is language

2035
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,440
all human beings have language we all

2036
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,559
have very strong opinions about what

2037
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:03,520
languages

2038
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,680
and but consider the fact that geometry

2039
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,960
was originally the study of land

2040
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,680
measurement

2041
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,760
right back in the back in the day but

2042
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,200
developed a sufficiently rich body of

2043
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,280
knowledge to abstract away from original

2044
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,200
its original object of inquiry and

2045
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,640
departed also from common sense

2046
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,680
intuition

2047
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,200
so our common sense intuitions about

2048
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,040
what languages actually have no place in

2049
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:21,920
science

2050
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,520
uh data for common sense notions of you

2051
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,760
know massive energy of physics

2052
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,240
so mit and professor ed federenko

2053
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,920
recently conducted a mechanical tech

2054
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,880
survey a study asking ordinary people

2055
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,480
what they thought language's primary

2056
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,599
function was

2057
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,599
uh now most of them said communication

2058
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,359
uh in line with common sense

2059
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,839
and she used this um this data to

2060
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:42,640
criticize

2061
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,680
the uh idea from a saying part of

2062
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,839
linguistics that language isn't

2063
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,119
basically an instrument before

2064
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,440
its primary purpose is to contribute to

2065
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,440
conceptualization

2066
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,119
and but a physicist obviously wouldn't

2067
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:56,559
conduct a mechanical

2068
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,799
survey randomly asking people what they

2069
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:00,079
thought the nature of light is

2070
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:01,520
and a biologist wouldn't concern

2071
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,799
themselves with people's intuitions

2072
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,319
about how hearts and livers were

2073
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,240
um and so natural language syntax i

2074
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,599
think should be investigated using the

2075
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:07,920
same

2076
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,839
standards of scientific inquiry as any

2077
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,440
other object in the organic world right

2078
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,640
there's no reason why people's

2079
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,079
intuitions about language

2080
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:15,839
um should we need it right in fact if

2081
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,359
that were the case would just there's no

2082
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,720
need for linguistic departments let's

2083
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,280
just

2084
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,400
ask a bunch of random people on the

2085
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,640
street uh that's that's all we need to

2086
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,079
do

2087
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,319
so on top of syntactic phrase generation

2088
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,920
and we can also frame this as

2089
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,440
contributing to policies

2090
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,280
uh used to perform particular free and

2091
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,720
free energy minimizing actions and not

2092
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,000
just generating you know

2093
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,799
uh linguistic objects so the rapid and

2094
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,720
reflexive identification of objects

2095
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,760
states and the reds in the in the

2096
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,520
external world through simple linguistic

2097
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,240
means

2098
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,079
uh can yield complex flexible

2099
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,680
interpretations for some of the most

2100
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,520
common nominal nominals is just a fancy

2101
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,000
word for

2102
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,079
nouns aiding in the successful

2103
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,520
generation of internal models of the

2104
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,160
environment

2105
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,200
using a limited number of resources and

2106
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,720
so objects in the world have to be

2107
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,000
identified and they have to be

2108
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,040
identified now

2109
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,040
immediately right in order to be

2110
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,960
successful in in navigating the world

2111
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,240
you have to understand things straight

2112
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:04,640
away

2113
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,760
and rapidly identify things that's kind

2114
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,799
of obvious

2115
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:11,040
and but at least the certain puzzles are

2116
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,720
so for instance complex forms of what's

2117
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,480
called palisami personally just means a

2118
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,280
weird having

2119
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,160
multiple senses and and politically also

2120
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,359
turns out to be much more widespread

2121
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:20,319
than most people think

2122
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:22,960
it turns out i am almost i remember i

2123
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,440
think half the way is in the oadlessness

2124
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,079
and complex forms of i think was 46

2125
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:29,200
percent

2126
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,880
uh complex forms of policily generated

2127
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,400
via multi-wave constructions

2128
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,160
allowed for a more precise and exact

2129
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,920
localization in conceptual space

2130
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,440
than discrete symbols science and

2131
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,520
gestures right with natural language

2132
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,960
syntax allowing the generation

2133
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,040
of a more accurate unveiling of hidden

2134
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,000
states in the world

2135
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,400
so natural language syntax allows us to

2136
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,240
more accurately position ourselves

2137
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,040
in conceptual estate space right again i

2138
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,720
gave the example of the second blue box

2139
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,839
to the left well here's another example

2140
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:54,640
for you

2141
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,640
you can say the poorly written newspaper

2142
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,160
that i held this morning

2143
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,160
has been sued by the government that's a

2144
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,359
perfectly fine sense

2145
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:02,880
but it's referring to three different

2146
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,200
senses of a simple word like newspaper

2147
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,520
so a newspaper can simultaneously be a

2148
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,559
piece of information

2149
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,640
it can be a physical object it can be an

2150
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,079
abstract organization

2151
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:13,520
and we can also call upon all of these

2152
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,839
senses at once and yet notice that

2153
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:17,680
this sentence cannot possibly refer to

2154
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,079
anything in the world right there's

2155
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:21,520
nothing this is not a kind of thing that

2156
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,119
a physicist could explore

2157
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:24,799
and something that's poorly written

2158
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,319
something that you hold something that

2159
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:29,280
can be sued it's not a coherent entity

2160
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,079
and yet language allows this um simple

2161
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,039
policymaker's word

2162
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:35,440
one single lexical item to generate a

2163
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,559
very rich

2164
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:38,319
range of perspectives to interpret

2165
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,480
experience which is exactly what you

2166
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,760
would expect from the active

2167
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,119
infrastructure

2168
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:44,960
and so since there can't possibly be any

2169
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,640
object in the external world that

2170
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,480
complex business word like newspaper can

2171
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,039
index

2172
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,039
a one-to-one mapping with another

2173
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:53,520
framework we are developing here

2174
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,440
lexical items could partially be seen as

2175
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,599
hypotheses about the structure of likely

2176
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,000
co-occurring sensory input right or

2177
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,039
hypotheses about

2178
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:03,200
ontological and meteorological relations

2179
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,880
between objects and states in the world

2180
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,799
so in other words a word is not simply

2181
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:08,480
something that has a conceptual meaning

2182
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,960
a word does not simply fetch concept and

2183
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,400
a word is basically an upper eye

2184
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,280
hypothesis

2185
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,440
about what the world is what we can

2186
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,640
interpret experience to be

2187
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,559
in any given moment and we basically

2188
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:19,760
test the hypothesis

2189
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,839
so we use the word newspaper as a

2190
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,160
hypothesis about what's going on outside

2191
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,880
and maybe it fails maybe it succeeds it

2192
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,400
depends on the context it depends on our

2193
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,119
state of mind

2194
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,200
and also depends on our interests and

2195
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,160
our concerns

2196
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,079
i'll give some more examples uh in a

2197
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:36,880
second just to kind of illustrate that

2198
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,960
so a recent paper by paul christian's

2199
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,280
lab headed by the amica setter

2200
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,520
2020 in the paper in frontiers they note

2201
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,720
that from the perspective

2202
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,359
of active inference things only exist as

2203
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:48,319
a label

2204
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,720
or hypothesis or inference about hidden

2205
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,760
states

2206
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,680
so the contention that i'm kind of

2207
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,359
presenting here is that forms of complex

2208
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:55,839
meaning

2209
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:57,760
derive from natural language semantics

2210
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,520
form a core component of this

2211
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,839
labeling mechanism in active interest so

2212
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,280
linguists like to talk about you know

2213
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,480
lexical items

2214
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,720
both book table walk and so on these are

2215
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,480
basically just hypotheses composed from

2216
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,119
distinct

2217
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:11,440
core knowledge systems in the mind so

2218
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,200
our sense of geometry our sense of place

2219
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,559
our sense of social relations

2220
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,319
which can elucidate environmental

2221
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,079
regularities essential to active

2222
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:19,920
inference

2223
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,160
so here's some more examples and again a

2224
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,039
nice little quote from

2225
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,359
that they make us the labeling quote and

2226
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:26,640
let's take the

2227
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,280
notion of vagueness so i was once an

2228
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,160
infant

2229
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,799
um but i'm no longer an infant but i'm

2230
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:33,440
still me

2231
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,440
right and the boundary between infancy

2232
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,680
and childhood and childhood and adults

2233
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,119
there are legal terms for that but

2234
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:41,520
that's kind of a just arbitrary choice

2235
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,359
the actual concept of infancy is an

2236
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:44,640
arbitrary boundary

2237
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,200
uh um some philosophers do actually

2238
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,480
think that there is a specific

2239
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,280
nanosecond

2240
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,359
which transitions you from infancy to

2241
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:52,559
childhood but

2242
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,559
you know i i think that's unlikely i

2243
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:55,599
think applying

2244
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:58,720
fixed quantified uh uh notions like that

2245
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,359
to uh

2246
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,599
intentionally an inherently vague notion

2247
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,280
like infancy is kind of a paradox it's

2248
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,000
meaningless

2249
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,599
you know infancy is just infancy it's

2250
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:07,440
not meant to be a precise boundary

2251
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,960
uh unless you're a legal scholar in

2252
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,640
which case that's fine you can define

2253
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,200
legal

2254
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,400
legal boundaries between things but

2255
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,760
that's kind of irrelevant for cognitive

2256
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,960
science

2257
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,960
so consider something like infancy you

2258
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,640
also have things like pile

2259
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,799
so we say there's a pile of sand and you

2260
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:22,319
keep taking uh

2261
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,799
bits of sand off at what point um how

2262
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,400
many grains of sand are sufficient for

2263
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:26,799
to

2264
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,240
to make a pile right that's called the

2265
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,000
serotonin paradox

2266
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,640
and the notion of the vague notion of

2267
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,559
pile is great for active inference it's

2268
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:35,599
great for generating

2269
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,160
rapid inferences and assessments well

2270
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:38,960
you know as soon as you're actually

2271
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,559
interrogated sufficiently

2272
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,400
the system becomes exposed the systems

2273
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,680
flows become exposed once you're

2274
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,039
actually subjected to all that much

2275
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:46,079
scrutiny

2276
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,559
and then same for things like book

2277
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:50,319
imagine you're going to a library

2278
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:52,240
and there's let's say a thousand

2279
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,200
physical books but there's only um 800

2280
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,799
kind of actual abstract books in the

2281
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,480
sense that you know every library has

2282
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,640
multiple copies of different books

2283
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,000
so the library will have you know 10

2284
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,079
copies of the bible uh ten copies of the

2285
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:05,280
quran and so on

2286
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,000
and let's say john goes into the library

2287
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,240
and he reads every book in the library

2288
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,160
and he leaves the library and because

2289
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,280
he's fed up and all the books are

2290
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,000
rubbish

2291
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,839
so he just assisted decides to ban it

2292
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,520
down in that case

2293
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,520
uh you can say john banned every book in

2294
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,440
the library or john read and burnt

2295
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,280
every book in the library in which case

2296
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,119
he banned more books than he read

2297
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:27,920
right he actually bans a thousand books

2298
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,079
but he only reads 800 books

2299
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:33,039
so the phrase every book does not pick

2300
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:34,480
out a fixed quantity

2301
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,000
there's nothing in the external world

2302
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
actually and exhibits a one-to-one

2303
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,520
relation in terms of quantification it

2304
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,880
could be 800 it could be a thousand

2305
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,640
it depends on our perspective and that's

2306
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,839
the crucial thing about even simple

2307
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,440
words like book they generate these very

2308
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,200
rich pelicans perspectives

2309
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,720
that you can use to integrate experience

2310
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,240
but have an unnecessary component to

2311
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,440
them

2312
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,680
another example is something like a city

2313
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,280
so you can say london burned down

2314
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,760
and was rebuilt 50 miles up the thames

2315
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,319
and

2316
01:06:58,319 --> 01:06:59,839
london can still be london even though

2317
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:01,200
it's physically completely changed it's

2318
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,559
in a different location

2319
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,680
all the londoners are dead and so on uh

2320
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,200
london has a very complex place in a

2321
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:07,680
sense

2322
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,160
that you can decompose into organization

2323
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,280
sense uh local

2324
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,039
location sense uh population centers and

2325
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:14,640
so on government institution

2326
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,119
and but the single word london does not

2327
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,559
refer to anything in the world so

2328
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,240
in other words there's no such thing as

2329
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,240
london that's just a kind of

2330
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,839
convenience it's a convenient

2331
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,520
abstraction that we use to interpret

2332
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,000
experience and but there's nothing that

2333
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,039
there's nothing in the world that the

2334
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,400
word london refers to

2335
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,559
right coherently uh you can use the word

2336
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:34,160
london to refer but that's an action

2337
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,520
it's an act of human will

2338
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,039
to actively do that and choose to do

2339
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,200
that so it's a choice and it's an action

2340
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,240
again

2341
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,680
while in the code of active entrance you

2342
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,440
can choose to voluntarily and willfully

2343
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,200
refer to one specific component

2344
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,280
of your representation of a city to

2345
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,960
refer to something in the external world

2346
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,359
well that's a context by context case

2347
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,119
the idea that london invariantly

2348
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:55,680
refers to a particular structure is just

2349
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:56,400
not

2350
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,520
not it's not true so

2351
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,839
by committing a more refined accurate

2352
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:03,680
positioning in conceptual space

2353
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,520
natural language syntax aids agents in

2354
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,760
the formation of novel policies

2355
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,839
uh to navigate and make inferences about

2356
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:10,880
the environment

2357
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,920
so cognition is an ongoing process of

2358
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,760
dynamic interaction between an organism

2359
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,759
and its environmental niche

2360
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:19,920
uh yet notions like event are also not

2361
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,920
predefined external entities

2362
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,679
but are actively generated and partially

2363
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,120
divided language system

2364
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,279
and so again events are not things in

2365
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:28,479
the world and events

2366
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,000
are things of the mind their

2367
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,158
construction

2368
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,560
so consider also that simple electrical

2369
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,439
items like city

2370
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:37,040
have properties that go way beyond the

2371
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,799
somatic complexity of other atomic

2372
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:39,920
representations

2373
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,839
so you can say the large school with

2374
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,520
large windows next to the river

2375
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,279
starts at 9am and has a strict

2376
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:47,759
headmaster on unruly students

2377
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:49,040
so there's nothing in the experimental

2378
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,279
world that could possibly be a location

2379
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:53,520
an artifact an event a social group

2380
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,439
right surely not

2381
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:57,198
absolutely that that's not an ontology

2382
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:59,198
and also using these kinds of sentences

2383
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:00,560
surely doesn't commit us to the belief

2384
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,000
that there are such things in the world

2385
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,120
it's a convenient

2386
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,880
abstraction it's a fiction right it's

2387
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,439
basically a picture a useful fiction

2388
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:09,120
that is used in the service of active

2389
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,640
inference and it does a very good job

2390
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,799
it's very it's very successful and the

2391
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,719
fact that it's so successful is

2392
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:16,719
evidenced by the fact that philosophers

2393
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,799
have only just begun to really

2394
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:20,158
investigate this phenomenon this this

2395
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:21,839
phenomenon is called complex gallism

2396
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:23,520
and it's taken centuries of inquiry to

2397
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,279
actually realize that some of

2398
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:28,158
our most basic common nominals uh do not

2399
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:29,040
have reference

2400
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,238
to things in the world they're just

2401
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:32,080
convenient fictions

2402
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,080
so take another sentence the average man

2403
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,439
is concerned about wage cuts

2404
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,520
because he needs to afford insurance

2405
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,960
does language commit to the belief that

2406
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,560
the world is made of things like average

2407
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,238
men and wage goods and relations of

2408
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:43,040
concern

2409
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,399
right that's not surely not something

2410
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:46,238
that we're committed to

2411
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:47,920
london can be as i said lonely can be

2412
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,198
fun and polluted and burned down and

2413
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:49,920
rebuilt

2414
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,520
we will 10 miles up the river and

2415
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,040
silvico london

2416
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,719
uh so these nested tree structures i

2417
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,239
mentioned earlier are widely considered

2418
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:57,199
to be abstract

2419
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,120
or even simple words exhibit

2420
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,560
considerable abstraction

2421
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,360
so in other words the the the the paper

2422
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,080
i've written

2423
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,400
with fristen and holmes focuses on

2424
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,760
nested truth structures

2425
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,440
and but it's also worth pointing out

2426
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,440
that even simple ways themselves

2427
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,440
uh exhibit a considerable degree of

2428
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,440
abstraction

2429
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,800
and perhaps just irrelevant here is

2430
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,040
between richard's invitation to consider

2431
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,960
a blind physicist who knows all the

2432
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,320
physics right in some kind of

2433
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,199
hypothetical

2434
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,520
physics complete scenario so what is it

2435
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,040
that a sighted person knows that the

2436
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,280
blind physicist doesn't know

2437
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,199
if this physicist knows everything

2438
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,719
certain experience of content surely

2439
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:34,000
right so what it's like to see the color

2440
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,640
red

2441
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,159
that's not part of the blind physicist

2442
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:38,000
knowledge so therefore physics can only

2443
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:38,480
capture

2444
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,480
the causal skeleton of the word we can

2445
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,760
at least conclude from this

2446
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,360
that my experience of seeing the color

2447
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,679
red simply is a property of the world

2448
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:47,120
but one that we can't provide any

2449
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,640
naturalistic account for and the reason

2450
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:49,600
why i mentioned that is because i think

2451
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,040
that may also be the case

2452
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,960
for words like london and city and book

2453
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,280
these abstractions are considerably

2454
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,040
uh much more detailed much more

2455
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,719
intricate and much more complex than

2456
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:01,920
we usually give them credit for uh

2457
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,159
our minds have managed to achieve an

2458
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,159
analysis of the concept of number

2459
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,560
right number theory is very rich a very

2460
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,440
serious uh

2461
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,520
field in mathematics about about number

2462
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,800
theory um

2463
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,560
but there isn't really much of an analog

2464
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,880
in linguistics so lexical semantics

2465
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,800
is nowhere near us nowhere near as

2466
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,920
detailed and nowhere near as

2467
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,920
sophisticated as number theory

2468
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,000
okay less cosmetics is pretty much the

2469
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:24,960
meaning of water

2470
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,040
is you know the set of all things that

2471
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,560
are water that's basically if you pick

2472
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,159
up a semantics textbook

2473
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,600
semantics textbooks are pretty much just

2474
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,600
that like the meaning of the meaning of

2475
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,640
it is raining

2476
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,719
just means uh you know it's raining

2477
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:37,760
right that's it just like a

2478
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:38,800
redescription

2479
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,199
and so in other words linguists are very

2480
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:43,120
far from actually having a serious

2481
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,239
naturalistic account

2482
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:46,800
for even some of the most simplest ways

2483
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:47,440
um

2484
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,199
which again might be just might just

2485
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:50,480
simply be because of our

2486
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,320
uh cognitive limitations right we can't

2487
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,280
construct theories for these objects

2488
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,480
um so one of the other kind of ways to

2489
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,159
exhibit this rich politically

2490
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:01,360
is by looking into the philosophy

2491
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,960
literature so in the philosophy

2492
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:03,679
literature

2493
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:05,679
um there's something called externalism

2494
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:07,040
which is the position i've just been

2495
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,040
critiquing which is the idea that

2496
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,520
words can have a kind of one-to-one

2497
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,080
reference

2498
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,400
with uh things in the external world and

2499
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,600
there was a survey convicted not too

2500
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,239
long ago

2501
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:17,520
which showed that the majority of

2502
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,840
philosophers are externalists they they

2503
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,199
do believe in fact that you know the way

2504
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:23,679
the water refers to h2o or whatever

2505
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:25,679
so consider this famous um thought

2506
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:26,719
experiment which i think

2507
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:28,080
contributes to our understanding of

2508
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,840
active inference as i'll show

2509
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,000
in a few slides in some parallel

2510
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,960
universe

2511
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,679
it said that water is not made of h2o

2512
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:37,199
but rather some other substance right

2513
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:37,920
xyz

2514
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,000
so in the parallel universe planet f2

2515
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,719
the exact same as planet f1 except water

2516
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:45,600
is not made of h2o it's xyz so the

2517
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,040
question is can the inhabitants of this

2518
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:47,920
twinner

2519
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,480
use water to refer to the substance so

2520
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,760
externally saying no

2521
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,520
extenders say the meaning of water can't

2522
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,960
be applied to the substance

2523
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,480
and on the other hand in contrary in

2524
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,840
contrast to the externalists there's

2525
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,440
what's called the internalist position

2526
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,960
which says that the meaning of words is

2527
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,960
simply a conceptual structure

2528
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,120
and that's it there's no there's nothing

2529
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,239
in the external world

2530
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:10,159
that these things refer to so the

2531
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:11,520
internals obviously say yes of course

2532
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:11,920
they can't

2533
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,040
use it it's just a concept and so the

2534
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,040
term water seems to be polissimous

2535
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,800
between some more kind of common

2536
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,199
function based sense and a more concrete

2537
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:23,600
like technical sense so you can imagine

2538
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,480
that um

2539
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,920
let's let's say one of the examples that

2540
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,719
numerous given is imagine that there's a

2541
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:29,520
tea factory

2542
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,320
that kind of explodes and some of the

2543
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,840
tea leaves in the factory

2544
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,480
get into the local water system and so

2545
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,080
what comes out someone's tap

2546
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,400
is chemically identical to the cup of

2547
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,239
tea that they're making in the kitchen

2548
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:43,520
and yet one of them one of the

2549
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,600
substances is water and one of the

2550
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,480
substances is tea

2551
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,080
even though they're chemically identical

2552
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,679
right chemically the same thing and you

2553
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:50,880
know one of them's water

2554
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,360
and one of them is t and the reason why

2555
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,480
is because it doesn't set one of them

2556
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,719
satisfies the functional based criteria

2557
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,840
and the other one violates it indeed you

2558
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,159
can imagine another parallel universe

2559
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:04,159
so then paul petrovsky offers what he

2560
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,520
calls paternal earth

2561
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,520
where doppelgangers of our scientists

2562
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,800
discover that when

2563
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,719
um what they've all been loosely calling

2564
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:13,440
mud in fact has a deep uniform structure

2565
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,000
so obviously on planet f r planet f and

2566
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,360
there's no uniform structure to mode

2567
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,280
right mud can be anything

2568
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,640
returns all that in this parallel

2569
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,960
universe uh all of their

2570
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,440
uh examples of substances of mud

2571
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,480
actually exhibit a uniform structure xyz

2572
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,480
and so the argument is that they can use

2573
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,400
the concept mode to refer successfully

2574
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,040
to all

2575
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,640
physical structures of mud okay that's

2576
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,840
good for them right they could

2577
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:36,880
successfully

2578
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,400
use the way the mode to just refer to

2579
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,560
xyz what does it follow

2580
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,840
from this that the inhabitants of

2581
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,840
fraternal earth could not then travel to

2582
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:44,800
our universe

2583
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,640
and use the word mud to refer to our

2584
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,320
chemically diverse samples

2585
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,760
right if they if they came to a black

2586
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,600
hole and i think the answer is no the

2587
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:52,960
externalists would say yes

2588
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,400
right the externs would say well their

2589
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,000
meaning simply refers to

2590
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,640
xyz and since we don't have xyz in our

2591
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,920
universe

2592
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,679
when these people jump in a black hole

2593
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:03,840
and come to us and when they talk about

2594
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:04,960
they have to be speaking of something

2595
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:05,840
else

2596
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,360
but that surely violates the actual

2597
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,280
meaning of the term word it's conceptual

2598
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,880
representation it's not a physical

2599
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,719
structure so the idea that

2600
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:15,120
their natural kind of forming use of mud

2601
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,719
could not readily be extended to a

2602
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:17,600
policymaker sense

2603
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,120
doesn't really seem to be well supported

2604
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,320
and it's just not a good description of

2605
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:21,520
what language actually is or what it

2606
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,400
cares about

2607
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,520
language doesn't really care about the

2608
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,520
world it's it's it cares about when i

2609
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:25,920
say

2610
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,800
you know it doesn't care about the

2611
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,280
external world as actually is it's not

2612
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,800
it's that's what science tries to do

2613
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,159
science tries to achieve direct

2614
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:33,679
reference to things in the world but the

2615
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,360
language system just cares about

2616
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,960
active inference just cares about making

2617
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,560
sense of the work that's it

2618
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,080
it doesn't actually care if water is

2619
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,360
made of pastry oil right that's not

2620
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,400
relevant

2621
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,000
so we can use simple words like water in

2622
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,679
wood to access multiple concepts

2623
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:47,760
and then use those concepts in the sales

2624
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,679
of active inference

2625
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:51,440
in fact the trustee goes further and he

2626
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,520
shows that using government statistics

2627
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,800
u.s government statistics

2628
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,800
he notes how diet coke has a high

2629
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,159
percentage of h2o

2630
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:00,000
than stuff from my world in fact i'm

2631
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,080
drinking uh a bottle of dr pepper

2632
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,280
i'm not sure it actually has that

2633
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:06,320
information but dr pepper has

2634
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,920
almost definitely a greater content or

2635
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,080
pastoral and stuff from uh the world

2636
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,320
in your backyard and in fact that it's

2637
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,760
bright and good so there are even more

2638
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,719
like h2o

2639
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:16,640
and yet they're not deemed water for

2640
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,920
reasons purely to do with intended

2641
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:18,880
purposes right

2642
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,760
so i think a cup of tea is like 99.7 or

2643
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,679
99.5 percent h2o

2644
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,360
and yeah it's called a cup of tea right

2645
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,559
it's not water it's tea

2646
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,320
so moving even further away from this

2647
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,800
consider that even scattered entities

2648
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,080
forget about water let's talk about

2649
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,679
scattered identities scatter identities

2650
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:37,360
can be taken to be a single physical

2651
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:37,920
object

2652
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,760
under some conditions so imagine a

2653
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,040
picket fence with brakes

2654
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,920
or a colder mobile right the latter is a

2655
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:44,320
thing

2656
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,239
i'm a column mobile it's called a thing

2657
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:47,679
whereas a collection of leaves on a tree

2658
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:48,880
is not a thing

2659
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,320
and unless of course these leaves are

2660
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,520
placed for like the purposes of

2661
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,280
decoration or art installation

2662
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,880
and so the reason seems to be that the

2663
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,560
mobile is created by an act of human

2664
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:56,880
will

2665
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,480
again the functional ocean is important

2666
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,040
here so here's the question

2667
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,560
how are these human specific notions of

2668
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,640
function and intention coded into the

2669
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,320
lexicon and how are they coded as part

2670
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,600
of any genetic model

2671
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,120
under active inference that's a really

2672
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,640
tricky question right

2673
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:14,400
and and indeed

2674
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,080
going beyond this too between russell

2675
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,520
and famously claim that objective is

2676
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,679
based on spatial chemical continuity

2677
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,199
uh but it also seems to be not

2678
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:23,440
sufficient so the four legs of a dog can

2679
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,360
be seen as a single object under many

2680
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,719
conceivable contacts

2681
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:28,000
such as if they were you know cut off

2682
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
tied together and used as a doorstep but

2683
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,520
they could still be understood by its

2684
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,120
user as part of the dog

2685
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,040
so abstract objects do not bear causal

2686
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,560
relationships and they're also not

2687
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,000
spatially temporarily located

2688
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,760
so an object is usually understood to be

2689
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,360
a concrete thing hence the confusion you

2690
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,719
know when someone denied

2691
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,800
space temporal relations so an object is

2692
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,000
an object if we deem it so

2693
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,280
and in addition i think it's important

2694
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,960
to note that a psycholinguistic lens is

2695
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:51,679
needed too

2696
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:53,199
so when philosophers talk about

2697
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:54,960
externalism on internalism they often

2698
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,080
just talk about

2699
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,360
language without actually knowing

2700
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,040
anything about linguistics which is kind

2701
01:17:59,040 --> 01:17:59,440
of like

2702
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,120
a philosopher physicist like a

2703
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,880
philosopher a philosopher of physics

2704
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,920
trying to do philosophy or physics

2705
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,360
without knowing anything about physics

2706
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,640
that's kind of strange right

2707
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,520
if you want to do philosophy of

2708
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,280
linguistics philosophy of language you

2709
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,880
should really know about linguistics

2710
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,199
so here's one particular paradox in the

2711
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:14,560
philosophy literature the following

2712
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,080
contrast has been called a paradox like

2713
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,600
a problem

2714
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,040
so you can say batman fights more

2715
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,960
mobsters than bruce wayne and but we

2716
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,480
also know that bruce wayne

2717
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,640
just is batman right so therefore we

2718
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,239
should be able to say batman fights more

2719
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:27,520
monsters than batman

2720
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:28,800
right but we can't say that because it

2721
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,800
sounds weird and the reason why is

2722
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,239
is due to linguistics it's not because

2723
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:33,840
of philosophy so that there's a

2724
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,520
constraint on discourse interpretation

2725
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,239
in language

2726
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:37,520
through which whenever there's two

2727
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,520
referential expressions in a clause

2728
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,960
they're default interpreted as

2729
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,199
non-identical okay and this feeds into

2730
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:43,600
non

2731
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,840
redundant computation which again feeds

2732
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,280
back to efficient computation

2733
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,199
and the such reference is objective so

2734
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:50,719
we have two instances of batman

2735
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:52,719
there's a problem so the sentence in b

2736
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:54,159
forces us to search for different

2737
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:54,719
reference

2738
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,000
even though we know is the same

2739
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,840
reference right

2740
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,199
so this paradox and philosophy of

2741
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:00,880
language is not due to

2742
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,960
mind world relations it's just due to

2743
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,719
linguistics it's just a psycholinguistic

2744
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:05,280
phenomenon

2745
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,960
that's all it is it's pretty simple

2746
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,880
and again one of the problems here is

2747
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,080
that a lot of these

2748
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,400
uh quotes of language demand

2749
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,520
interrogation and they're not

2750
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,800
immediately obvious they kind of

2751
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,239
language is very good at constructing

2752
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:19,760
an illusion that we kind of become

2753
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,080
susceptible to we like to think that

2754
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,719
the things we talk about uh are really

2755
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,320
really existing in the world

2756
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,400
but in fact you know language use i like

2757
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,920
to think it was kind of a fairy tale

2758
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,600
you know using language is kind of more

2759
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,280
akin to the constructing a fairy tale

2760
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,000
than it is

2761
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,600
science because we're just constructing

2762
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,880
concepts and using them in a kind of

2763
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:37,920
loose freaking sony

2764
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,920
language game sets so here's another

2765
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,280
example uh what are called escher

2766
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,640
sentences

2767
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,880
so there's the famous staircase painting

2768
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,960
of essa the endless staircases go round

2769
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,560
and round and round

2770
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,719
so the the visual system doesn't care

2771
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,400
about that the visual system just sees

2772
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,440
what it sees

2773
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,040
if the world if that turns out to be a

2774
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,719
physically impossible construct

2775
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:58,800
that's not relevant to the visual system

2776
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,320
we just see whatever it sees

2777
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,760
and it's the same with language too so

2778
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,440
language also has things

2779
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,120
like analogous things what are called

2780
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,360
lesser senses so if you say more people

2781
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,600
have been to russia than i have

2782
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,080
or in michigan and minnesota more people

2783
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,760
found mr bush's ads negative than they

2784
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:14,719
did mr carries

2785
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:16,000
that's actually a meaningful sentence it

2786
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,600
doesn't mean anything right more people

2787
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,520
have been to russia than i have

2788
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,760
is a meaningless sense it kind of sounds

2789
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,560
like it makes sense

2790
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,000
but it's completely meaningless right

2791
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,840
because you're trying to compare a fixed

2792
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,400
finite quantity like 50 to a simple

2793
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,159
binary yes or no right you've ever been

2794
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:31,600
to russia yes or no

2795
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,080
and more people means five or six people

2796
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:34,800
right

2797
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,880
so it's it's syntactically legal but

2798
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,040
it's semantically incoherent

2799
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,159
and there's plenty of sentences like

2800
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:41,679
that where it's kind of the language

2801
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:44,880
system is very good at

2802
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,040
generating the illusion of meaning or

2803
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,159
generating the illusion

2804
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:49,920
of our structure when in fact if you

2805
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,520
interrogate it there's no

2806
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,280
there's no meaning and again this feeds

2807
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,440
into the idea of a efficient computation

2808
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,520
of influence generation doesn't you know

2809
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,800
the language system doesn't want to

2810
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,560
interrogate too deeply it just wants to

2811
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,600
generate an inference

2812
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,440
right what is this person trying to say

2813
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,639
here okay

2814
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:06,080
on the other hand it also generate it

2815
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,360
also appears into the idea of like

2816
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,480
anti-reference

2817
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,960
so this sentence sounds uh meaningful

2818
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,159
but there's nothing in the external

2819
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,159
world i can refer to so there's no real

2820
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:15,440
comparisons being made here

2821
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,440
between more people and me being uh

2822
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,239
beating through yes or no

2823
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:22,400
so in conclusion it seems that any

2824
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,400
object is much more than its material

2825
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,520
constitution

2826
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,760
or its function and we can also use his

2827
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,440
origin so thomas hobbs talked about

2828
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,120
rivers his famous example was

2829
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,960
a river can be maybe defined by its

2830
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,480
origin and they can kind of scare and

2831
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,000
diverge and and

2832
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,360
go into different paths and maybe

2833
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,600
converge again and but also a sense of

2834
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,960
continuity

2835
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,880
so john locks the personhood was that

2836
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,480
you know a person is defined by a sense

2837
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,080
of continuous identity

2838
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,560
and not physical constitution and so

2839
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,040
when a child watches a cartoon of a you

2840
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,880
know the handsome prince getting kissed

2841
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,880
he turns into a frog and then he turns

2842
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,080
into uh

2843
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,920
uh you know a human again once he's

2844
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,360
kissed again or whatever

2845
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,880
there's a chaos and then and something

2846
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:02,560
happens the child knows that's the same

2847
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,719
person right the child watching the tv

2848
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,239
knows that it's the same entity it's the

2849
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:08,320
same person uh that the prince being

2850
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:11,840
turned from a human to a frog

2851
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,920
and yet again that's got enough to do

2852
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:14,960
with reference there's nothing that

2853
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:15,360
could

2854
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,080
be coherently uh existed in that sense

2855
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:18,800
so all these

2856
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,120
uh representations seem to inspire and

2857
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,400
in addition we also have a kind of a

2858
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,280
fifth element

2859
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,560
so we can kind of call this extra

2860
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,880
linguistic biases the shaping objective

2861
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,040
so that pertains to one example there

2862
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,639
are lots of examples but one example is

2863
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:33,600
default marking of object services

2864
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,040
so if you say john painted the house

2865
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,199
brown this implies that he painted the

2866
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:38,560
external surface brown

2867
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,400
not the internal surface because we seem

2868
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,320
to have a sense of objects as being

2869
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,719
concave objects and think of scenes at

2870
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:46,080
all like scenes events are kind of you

2871
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,760
know we're inside scenes or outside

2872
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:48,400
scenes

2873
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,239
so we seem to have a kind of visually

2874
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:52,639
imposed sense of what are houses

2875
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:55,199
so if john and mary are both stood five

2876
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:56,960
meters from the surface of the house

2877
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,120
but mary's inside the house and john's

2878
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:00,000
outside it

2879
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,239
uh john is near the house but mary's not

2880
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:03,440
near the house

2881
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,800
mary's inside the house even though

2882
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,480
they're both equidistant the actual

2883
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,400
physical structure of the house so the

2884
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,880
house is again a functional notion

2885
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,239
it's not just a physical object it's

2886
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:14,239
also a kind of a functional based

2887
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:17,280
interpretation um so in other words

2888
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,679
at least these five components they all

2889
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:20,960
contribute to active inference they all

2890
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,560
contribute to generating structures

2891
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,000
but at least these five components are

2892
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,679
somehow encoded in language and i

2893
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:26,639
consider that to be

2894
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:29,199
uh one of the biggest mysteries how are

2895
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:31,360
these things encoded in the lexicon

2896
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,800
and how are these how are these networks

2897
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,400
across the brain interpreted and

2898
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,080
activated during language comprehension

2899
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,040
that's an extremely

2900
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,080
problematic issue because like i said

2901
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:41,840
when we talk about schools being

2902
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,440
having strict headmasters and being

2903
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,960
large and near the river

2904
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,239
and uh etc and we're using pretty much

2905
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:49,600
all of these concepts at once

2906
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,760
and we're doing it effortlessly and yet

2907
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,679
somehow how they're actually implemented

2908
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:56,239
is kind of a mystery but there is

2909
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:57,600
interestingly precedence in

2910
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,040
recent active imprints literature for

2911
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,639
these suggestions so in a recent paper

2912
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:02,560
perhaps that they'll argue that the fap

2913
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:03,600
is most compatible with an

2914
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:04,639
instrumentalist theory

2915
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:06,639
of mental representations in which

2916
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:08,560
representations are useful fictions

2917
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,239
for explanatory goals right which is

2918
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:11,520
exactly what i've just been saying about

2919
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,560
linguistics

2920
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,800
and this is also compatible with certain

2921
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,080
models in philosophy of language

2922
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,159
the endless perspective which assume

2923
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:19,920
that lester items have no one-to-one

2924
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,679
direct reference in the external world

2925
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:23,360
but are basically useful fictions

2926
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,719
they're composites of distinct

2927
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:26,080
representational domains that are used

2928
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,040
for successful

2929
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,719
efficient interpretation and ultimately

2930
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:30,960
agent survival right

2931
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,639
and it's also compatible with continuous

2932
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:34,239
models of markov blankets

2933
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:35,520
uh which have been argued to be

2934
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,520
performed kind of neil canton and help

2935
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,280
help launching the cancer cognition

2936
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,960
whereby the boundaries of cognition are

2937
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,159
diluted by the school

2938
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:44,159
emphasizing the interactive constructive

2939
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:46,000
nature of higher cognition

2940
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,760
and generating intellectual actionable

2941
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,440
concept right again the crucial concept

2942
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:49,760
of

2943
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,679
actionable concept it's a useful concept

2944
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:53,679
it's something that you can you know use

2945
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:56,960
in some meaningful way so the long-term

2946
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,520
storage

2947
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,920
of frequently generated lexical

2948
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,760
characters and the combinatorial

2949
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,120
rules underlying their creative

2950
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,719
deployment in language production and

2951
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:05,600
comprehension

2952
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,120
all of this seems to allow speakers to

2953
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,960
categorize novel sensory data

2954
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,040
into a discrete set of object hood and

2955
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,560
event good representations

2956
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,400
so there are a few events that cannot

2957
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,679
actually be passed through the

2958
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:18,159
simple and unique schemes provided by

2959
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:19,679
which increases the likelihood of

2960
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:20,560
speakers

2961
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,639
avoiding surprising states but more

2962
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:23,679
efficiently and readily

2963
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:25,520
you can pass a particular situation as

2964
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,040
an event then

2965
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,600
that leads to the surprise minimization

2966
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,520
right

2967
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,520
so another recent paper notes that the

2968
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,120
active inference model of the brain

2969
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,360
assumes an imperative to find the most

2970
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,560
accurate explanation

2971
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,000
for sensory observations that is

2972
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,920
minimally complex which has been

2973
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,679
recruited in barlow's exploration of

2974
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:44,880
minimum redundancy

2975
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,120
and which seems to accord with how the

2976
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,480
language system provides

2977
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,840
the most computationally efficient

2978
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,760
format for solving the problem

2979
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,320
of mapping linear sensory input right so

2980
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,360
linear sentences

2981
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,560
to hierarchical interpretations

2982
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,400
so from the perspective of inference

2983
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,480
individuals need to minimize the effort

2984
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,880
involved in meaning making so we propose

2985
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,800
that there is increasing evidence from

2986
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,080
theoretical linguistics and natural

2987
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,360
language syntax

2988
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,520
and that this structure exhibits design

2989
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,639
principles in keeping with this criteria

2990
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,560
so another recent paper by christian

2991
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,679
christian's group proposes that the

2992
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:18,239
goals

2993
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:21,040
of speech does documentation and all

2994
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,000
sampling data

2995
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,760
in a way that requires the most faster

2996
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,520
memories degree of belief updating

2997
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,840
in a prologue with principle so we've

2998
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,440
basically extended these claims to the

2999
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:32,320
domain of natural languages

3000
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,320
and indeed active imprints have only one

3001
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,920
underlying imperative to minimize

3002
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:36,480
generalized

3003
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,480
energy or uncertainty i'm much work in

3004
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,159
psycholinguistics so things like eye

3005
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:40,719
tracking

3006
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:42,080
you know tracking people's eye movements

3007
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,760
during their reading senses

3008
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,840
uh during fully gap dependencies uh you

3009
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,679
know long distance species and sentences

3010
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:49,360
where kind of elements have to relate or

3011
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,800
agree within features

3012
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,199
um it shows that phrase structures are

3013
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:54,719
generated predictably

3014
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:56,639
in anticipation of optimistic guide in

3015
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:58,239
fact it turns out that even something as

3016
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:00,480
simple as adjective noun phrases

3017
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,239
are constructed predicted so things like

3018
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:04,080
red boat symbol two-word phrases

3019
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:07,280
they involve rich prediction

3020
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,280
so maybe i should just stop there for a

3021
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:12,639
second to evaluate and

3022
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,920
this has been a uh awesome learning

3023
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:16,560
experience

3024
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,120
as a non-linguist there's a few

3025
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:19,920
questions

3026
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:21,199
from the chat and there's also just a

3027
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:23,040
few other things i wrote down but a lot

3028
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,880
of the questions have to do with

3029
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,040
how things happen in the brain so maybe

3030
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,040
it's worthwhile for you to just um

3031
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,560
share however much more you'd like to

3032
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,080
share and then hang out

3033
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,520
as long as you'd like to answer some

3034
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,120
questions and you're always welcome

3035
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,040
back so you know no worries just

3036
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,639
whatever's comfortable today let's talk

3037
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:39,040
through

3038
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:42,000
and then we'll continue the discussion

3039
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:42,400
cool

3040
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,000
all right well yeah this is the final

3041
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,520
section just to kind of wrap it all up

3042
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:46,480
together so

3043
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,800
um only a few a few a few slides more

3044
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,400
but yeah the question of how all this

3045
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,199
relates to the brain

3046
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:54,320
is absolutely essential and so

3047
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,880
i'll try and explain that so just to

3048
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,159
begin with that framework

3049
01:27:58,159 --> 01:27:59,679
uh yeah so so far i've kind of just

3050
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:01,679
outlined the kind of basic philosophy of

3051
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:04,159
how language is implemented in in in a

3052
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:04,800
kind of

3053
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,960
computational theory and how it seems to

3054
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,400
be involved in efficient computation and

3055
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:08,960
so on

3056
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,199
how it might on a cognitive level

3057
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:13,199
contribute to inference generation

3058
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:15,280
uh but what about actual neural

3059
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,639
implementation

3060
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:17,840
so that's that's that's the kind of the

3061
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,840
next frontier so there's the recent

3062
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:20,400
paper

3063
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:24,000
by embargo and arguing that

3064
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,159
what makes a good theory is not just

3065
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:28,000
generating testable predictions

3066
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,920
it's invoking plausible possible

3067
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,920
mechanisms mechanisms that are plausibly

3068
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:32,960
realized in nature

3069
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,719
either in your biology or genetics or

3070
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:36,560
physics right it's kind of a nice

3071
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,000
framework the idea is that

3072
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,159
uh theory is not just there just because

3073
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:41,360
they can generate

3074
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,120
um you know true testosterone

3075
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:44,560
predictions it's

3076
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,000
it's to generate things that are

3077
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,679
plausible

3078
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:49,440
and i think that's a very important

3079
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:52,000
point so what's your current um

3080
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,400
uh the neurobiology language involves

3081
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,719
quite reasonably testing some hypotheses

3082
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:59,120
um and then generating poorly available

3083
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,560
explanations for results

3084
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,400
so you'll read the results section uh

3085
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:03,760
which shows like let's say

3086
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,520
for example theta power increases

3087
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,360
automatically coherent sentences maybe

3088
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,520
just choose a random example and so the

3089
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:10,719
explanation is just kind of a

3090
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:12,239
redescription of the results in the

3091
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:13,440
discussion section

3092
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,239
so it'll be like you know we've found a

3093
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:17,760
hippocampal theta increases

3094
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,960
in xyz um so therefore semantically

3095
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,239
coherent sentences are indexed by a

3096
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:23,920
hypothetical okay it's kind of a

3097
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:24,960
redescription

3098
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,320
but then what we need is really a

3099
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,080
pre-existing mechanistic understanding

3100
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,920
of the possible computational properties

3101
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,600
of hippocampal theta so what is civil

3102
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,360
capital theta in the first place right

3103
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:34,560
otherwise what's the point i'm looking

3104
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,080
at there's no point looking at some

3105
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,440
neural response

3106
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,800
if you don't understand the

3107
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,560
computational capacities of that neural

3108
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:41,920
response what is that property what is

3109
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,280
that lower level mechanism

3110
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,960
and indeed there might be there usually

3111
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,120
are multiple mechanisms

3112
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:48,400
multiple possible mechanisms for

3113
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,159
realizing that particular signature that

3114
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:51,120
you get through

3115
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:54,239
brain data and what if your if your

3116
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:55,679
simple output is to simply do the

3117
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:56,320
experiment

3118
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,400
and then redescribe the results using

3119
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,360
different rhetoric

3120
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,679
then that's not contributing to um you

3121
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:03,040
know conceptual

3122
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:06,400
uh progress so a lot of these ideas are

3123
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,840
uh outlined in the recent book of mine

3124
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,600
the isolatory nature of language

3125
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,600
and so i'm kind of just gonna tease them

3126
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,440
apart but if you're interested in more

3127
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,320
of the details you

3128
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,000
know free to contact me and i'll send

3129
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,360
you a copy

3130
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,800
so one can derive some elementary

3131
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,400
properties of linguistic computation

3132
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:20,800
through

3133
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,960
a direct line of communication from the

3134
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:23,840
fpp

3135
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,760
through to endogenous oscillatory

3136
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,080
synchronicity and linguistic behavior

3137
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,840
which kind of comes out of the output

3138
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:33,199
so under the fpp endogenous oscillations

3139
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:35,040
are the type of dynamics brain dynamics

3140
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,800
that neurons would expect to encounter

3141
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,159
since they have genetically encoded

3142
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:39,920
beliefs that the cause of

3143
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:42,159
excitatory postsynaptic potentials

3144
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:44,159
follows the same pattern

3145
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:46,080
so active imprints can synthesize

3146
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,080
various and silicone neurophysical

3147
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,920
responses via a gradient descent on free

3148
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:50,639
energy

3149
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:52,800
such as the mismatched negativity phase

3150
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,800
procession theta sequences place cell

3151
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:55,520
activity

3152
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,760
uh feed the camera uh phase amplitude

3153
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:58,639
and so on

3154
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:00,480
um and the reason why that's important

3155
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,600
with all these mechanisms have been

3156
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:02,239
involved

3157
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:05,280
and implicated in language so moving

3158
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,639
forward with these concerns neuronal

3159
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:08,320
dynamics and plasticity appear to

3160
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:09,120
minimize

3161
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,120
variational free energy under a simple

3162
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:12,159
genetic model

3163
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:13,920
which entails prior beliefs that

3164
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,080
pre-synaptic inputs are generated by an

3165
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:18,159
external state with a quasi-periodic

3166
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:18,719
orbit

3167
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:20,480
recent paper showed this so the

3168
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,719
implication is that ensembles of neurons

3169
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:24,480
make inferences about each other

3170
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,480
while individual neurons minimize their

3171
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:27,679
own free energy

3172
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:29,679
so generalized synchrony kind of comes

3173
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:30,880
for free

3174
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,400
it's an amazing property of free energy

3175
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,560
minimization desynchronization is

3176
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,360
induced by

3177
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:37,840
exogenous input explaining event related

3178
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:38,800
synchronization

3179
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,400
and structure learning images in

3180
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,840
response to causal structure

3181
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:44,080
in exogenous explaining the functional

3182
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:44,880
segregation

3183
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,920
of neuronal clusters so an external like

3184
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,360
neuron external state with a

3185
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,280
quasi-periodic orbit is assumed to

3186
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,120
generate the presynaptic inputs of a

3187
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,480
given neuron

3188
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,920
and what's interesting for me is that

3189
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,440
low-frequency phase synchronization

3190
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,440
emerges directly from this assumption

3191
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:00,719
and also the coupled assumption that

3192
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:02,960
neural dynamics maximize variation free

3193
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,239
energy

3194
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:05,840
so the reason why that's important for

3195
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,920
language is that

3196
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,600
one particular implication is that

3197
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,760
models of syntax synthetic computation

3198
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,280
grounded in these dynamics so

3199
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,280
yeah the the model that i have in my

3200
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,199
book but also some other recent models

3201
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:18,639
from guru grafeld and

3202
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:21,520
uh savannah can be said to comply with

3203
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,440
foundational principles of the fat

3204
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,520
so for instance endogenous low frequency

3205
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,760
delta delta phase trapping of syntactic

3206
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:28,400
nodes

3207
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,800
could be seen as emerging as a direct

3208
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:31,840
function of

3209
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,600
generative belief updating in accordance

3210
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,440
with vacuum imprints supplementing the

3211
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:36,960
association of delta oscillations with

3212
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,400
the cortical computations

3213
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,239
responsible for creating hierarchical

3214
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:41,679
linguistic structures so what that means

3215
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:42,000
is

3216
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,840
whenever you get a particular phrasal

3217
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,840
node and you have phrase boundary

3218
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,280
you seem to get some kind of unique low

3219
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,199
frequency response so the details can be

3220
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:49,840
found in

3221
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,280
the actual papers but there's basically

3222
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:53,040
some kind of unique low frequency

3223
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,120
signature which seems to code okay this

3224
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,880
is a phrase here's another phrase here's

3225
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:57,679
a little phrase

3226
01:32:57,679 --> 01:32:59,920
and that kind of goes beyond the uh

3227
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,760
level of abstraction

3228
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,760
uh contributed by syllables and words so

3229
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,440
it was kind of a phrase-specific

3230
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,600
signature and so the active inference

3231
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,600
brainwave provides clear predictions

3232
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,440
about the neural dynamics of language

3233
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:12,960
and can help bring together research

3234
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,480
programs that are presently pursued

3235
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:17,520
independently so exploring the possible

3236
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,800
neurobiological basis

3237
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,719
of a core feature of language a recent

3238
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:22,880
paper argues that feta gamma phase after

3239
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:23,840
coupling in language

3240
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,760
which codes syllable recognition and

3241
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,280
also predicted coding

3242
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,960
and physical covenants been associated

3243
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,159
with predictive coding for a little

3244
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:30,880
while now

3245
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,560
can be brought together so this theta

3246
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,920
gamma coupling has been applied to

3247
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:34,800
silver passing

3248
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,280
modeling theta chemical dialogue as well

3249
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,960
which appears to form part of

3250
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,600
belief updating fact of imprints whereby

3251
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,199
beliefs are simultaneously updated at

3252
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:43,679
high

3253
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:46,080
fast levels but also low slower levels

3254
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,040
um also

3255
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,639
their feeds uncovering has been applied

3256
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:50,639
to a constraint well it's been

3257
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:51,920
assumed to be a constraint in working

3258
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,120
memory so for instance the idea is that

3259
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,400
the number of items you can hold in

3260
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,480
working memory is based on the number of

3261
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,840
gamma cycles you're going to bed

3262
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:02,560
in a given theta phase and there's a

3263
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,480
kind of trade-off between fidelity

3264
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,480
if you want to have uh hold more items

3265
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,400
in memory then you can indeed

3266
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,239
increase the number of gamut items to

3267
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:11,679
you know seven or eight gamma cycles

3268
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,040
within the theta circuit about seven or

3269
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:13,360
eight

3270
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,120
but then that lowers the actual

3271
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,560
resolution

3272
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,320
and in fact uh it's been shown that

3273
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,280
there's a relationship between a number

3274
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:20,480
of items hell

3275
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:23,360
and uh uh physical causal manipulation

3276
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:25,199
of plato chemically in people's

3277
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,440
skulls using some kind of extra you know

3278
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:29,679
attacks or tms

3279
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:31,199
and their actual performance in working

3280
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:33,440
memory desk so here the gamma doesn't

3281
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,120
practice because implicated in just

3282
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:35,920
constructing

3283
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,320
sets in working memory um which i think

3284
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,760
is kind of a cool idea

3285
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:41,440
so in this particular model phrase level

3286
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,360
inferences generate words contained

3287
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,000
within the

3288
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,560
phrase before lower levels reset for the

3289
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:47,520
next phrase right

3290
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,520
manifested as repeater through the phase

3291
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:50,719
alignment

3292
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:52,320
so each transition at the higher level

3293
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,000
is accompanied by a resetting at the

3294
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,119
lower level status

3295
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:57,280
so this is in line with the suggestion

3296
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,440
that low frequency phase can coordinate

3297
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,360
the bundling of lexical features indexed

3298
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:02,719
by class gamma cycles

3299
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:04,639
within the given description via forms

3300
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:06,000
of crosstreatments equal length namely

3301
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:06,880
base amplitude

3302
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,040
and also phase phase coupler ensuring

3303
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,960
serial readout are features alongside

3304
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,239
the transfer of syntactic

3305
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:14,159
identities to language external systems

3306
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:15,679
so there's the kind of top-down

3307
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:17,840
information between uh different types

3308
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,119
of based on food coupling this is kind

3309
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:19,920
of elaborated

3310
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,400
in my book but the basic idea is that

3311
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,000
low frequency phases

3312
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,560
coordinate and set the identity of

3313
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,239
whatever discrete representations are

3314
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:29,199
being fetched

3315
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:32,159
and linearized and combined and chunked

3316
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,040
via these

3317
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:36,159
uh faster gamma cycles cross-courtedly

3318
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:38,159
uh prescottically just means whatever

3319
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:39,199
part of the brain happens to be

3320
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:40,080
responsible for storing the

3321
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,600
representations that you care about

3322
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,040
again language is very good at talking

3323
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:45,280
about extracting fetching concepts from

3324
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,719
different domains so that will yield

3325
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:47,760
predictions for which

3326
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,600
clausal services are being extracted and

3327
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,440
kind of spoken to by this

3328
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,840
uh low frequency phase coordination

3329
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,080
operation

3330
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,679
so theta chemical going has also formed

3331
01:35:57,679 --> 01:35:59,760
part of recent models of scheduling and

3332
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:00,400
updating

3333
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,080
the list of syntactic semantic features

3334
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,520
being associated with a given chunk of

3335
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:04,639
linguistic stimuli

3336
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:07,199
with ghana cycles indexing distinct data

3337
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:07,840
structures

3338
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,440
being coordinated by database data

3339
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:10,719
structures just means linguistic

3340
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:12,400
features so semantic or syntactic

3341
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,280
features right

3342
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:15,679
like first person number gender features

3343
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:16,719
what have you

3344
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:18,000
so these proposals are potentially

3345
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,679
analogous from an euro computational

3346
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:20,400
perspective

3347
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,360
so you have the same lower level generic

3348
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,280
algorithm newer computational algorithm

3349
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,440
that's simply fetching discrete domain

3350
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,440
specific representations

3351
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,600
which also kind of feeds back into the

3352
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,440
hanes idea i mentioned earlier

3353
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,040
where you have these different systems

3354
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,480
morality music

3355
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,639
mathematics language where the

3356
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:39,600
computation

3357
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,119
seems to be analogous but the

3358
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:42,719
representations are different

3359
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:44,800
so the same computation operating over

3360
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,679
different representational domains

3361
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:49,679
so through specifying a process theory

3362
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,520
that explains neuronal responses during

3363
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:52,639
perception and action

3364
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:54,159
neuronal dynamics have previously

3365
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:55,679
encountered the gradient flow on free

3366
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:56,400
energy

3367
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,159
so that's to say any neural process can

3368
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:00,080
be formulated as a minimization of the

3369
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,679
same quantity used in approximate phase

3370
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:02,320
imprints

3371
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:03,760
so the brain seeks to minimize free

3372
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,119
energy which is mathematically

3373
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:07,360
equivalent to maximizing but evidence

3374
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:08,960
and so this view of neural responses can

3375
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,719
be conceived uh with respect to

3376
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:12,320
hamilton's principle of least action

3377
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:13,760
right so all these ideas kind of

3378
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,719
weave together in fact recently a deep

3379
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:18,560
temper model for communication

3380
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,159
was developed based on a simulated

3381
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:21,840
conversation between two synthetic

3382
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:22,639
subjects

3383
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:24,400
uh showing that certain behavioral and

3384
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:25,760
neurotheological correlates of

3385
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,639
communication

3386
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:28,400
arise under variational messenger

3387
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,320
passing in particular theta chemical

3388
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,239
right so feta gamma coupling arose from

3389
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:35,280
this particular synthetic dialogue

3390
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,880
so the model of syntax i've assumed in

3391
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,880
the paper assumes that syntax

3392
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,199
sorry in this particular paper assumes

3393
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:43,040
that syntaxes are sequences of states or

3394
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:43,600
words

3395
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,360
with a terminal node at the end of every

3396
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,880
sentence so a kind of phrase boundary

3397
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,719
like a wrap-up effect right like a

3398
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:51,199
consolidation period and with each form

3399
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:53,440
of syntactic structure being limited to

3400
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,440
questions and answers in a game of 20

3401
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:56,880
questions in this particular

3402
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:59,360
paper and but the conclusion this paper

3403
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:00,639
are pretty much in keeping with core

3404
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:02,080
assumptions in linguistics concerning

3405
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:02,880
the inherently

3406
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,600
constructive nature of language so

3407
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,199
elementary syntactic units

3408
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:08,639
which are highly robust and considered

3409
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:10,320
across speakers of the same language

3410
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,800
provide specific and belief structures

3411
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,080
that are used to reduce

3412
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,679
uncertainty about the world through

3413
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:17,760
rapid and reflective categorization of

3414
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,119
events states and objects and their

3415
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:19,679
relations

3416
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:21,920
again in compliance with the fpp uh

3417
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:23,199
sentential representations can be

3418
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:24,639
thought of as structures designed

3419
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:26,080
partially

3420
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,239
to consolidate and appropriately frame

3421
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:29,119
experiences

3422
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:30,960
and to contextualize and anticipate

3423
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,560
future experiences

3424
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:34,080
so the range of possible syntactic

3425
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,600
structures available to comprehend us

3426
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,520
provides alternative alternate

3427
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,600
hypotheses that afford past harmonious

3428
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,199
explanations for sensory data

3429
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:43,520
and as such they preclude overfitting so

3430
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:44,800
if the convexity of the

3431
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,639
linguistic stimuli can be efficiently

3432
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:48,560
mapped to a small series of regular

3433
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,320
syntactic formats

3434
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:51,679
this contributes to the brain's goal of

3435
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:52,960
restricting yourself to a number of

3436
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,199
states as i mentioned earlier

3437
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:56,560
and again by mapping syntactic

3438
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,400
structures to conceptual systems in a

3439
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,639
manner adhering to principles of economy

3440
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:02,239
language can be seen as engaging in a

3441
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:03,600
series of questions and answers with

3442
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:04,800
sensory data itself

3443
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,320
right but also non-linguistic mental

3444
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,840
states and

3445
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:10,400
only through natural language can we

3446
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,159
generate the full complexity of

3447
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:13,760
wh questions you know the questions i

3448
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,280
mentioned before cross serial

3449
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:17,199
dependencies long distance dependencies

3450
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:18,960
where different elements across

3451
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,159
different structures depend on each

3452
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:20,719
other

3453
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:22,719
uh fully gap dependencies and so on

3454
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:24,639
which permit an expansion of what kinds

3455
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:25,360
of querying

3456
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,040
the brain connects to you over sample

3457
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:28,480
data

3458
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,000
so in a word only with natural language

3459
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,400
syntax can the brain

3460
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:35,280
execute these particular type of queries

3461
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:36,880
and generate influences

3462
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,480
so all the ways that language centered

3463
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,400
aspects again if you recall what i meant

3464
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,119
at the beginning

3465
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:42,639
or other ways that language-centered

3466
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:44,159
aspects of human cognition

3467
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:46,239
can be motivated through conformity to

3468
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:47,760
the fbp and act of imprints

3469
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,119
so things like communication and

3470
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:50,800
narratives all of that can actually be

3471
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,080
further be derived

3472
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,760
from a more elementary focus on

3473
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:56,960
synthetic computational complexity

3474
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:58,239
and in fact there was a paper published

3475
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:00,480
a couple of days ago and by again by

3476
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:01,440
kristen's lab

3477
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,119
which showed that neural dynamics under

3478
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:04,880
active imprints are metabolically

3479
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,159
efficient and suggest that neural

3480
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:07,440
representations

3481
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,199
in biological agents may evolve by

3482
01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:11,280
approximating steepest descent

3483
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:12,880
in the information space towards the

3484
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,400
point of optimal inference

3485
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:17,040
and again there's a pretty no that's not

3486
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,560
a bad idea to pursue in connection to

3487
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,560
neuro-linguistics in terms of the

3488
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,960
optimal inferences afforded by not just

3489
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,400
synthetic structures but again also

3490
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,000
lexical semantics so individual words

3491
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,639
that i mentioned before

3492
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:29,920
so just moving to a couple of

3493
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,679
conclusions from the slides

3494
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:33,360
and i've tried to show that natural

3495
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,040
language syntax renders meaning making

3496
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,159
and pioneer order imprints a

3497
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:38,159
computationally efficient process

3498
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:39,679
and it seems we makes it work right for

3499
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:41,440
what the cost etel call

3500
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,679
as a key question for future research

3501
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:44,719
for active imprints

3502
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:46,320
which is how biological organisms

3503
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,719
effectively search large policy spaces

3504
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:50,719
when filing into the future so

3505
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:51,920
regardless of whether

3506
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:52,800
you know you're actually issuing

3507
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,040
particular economy conditions uh x y or

3508
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:55,840
z

3509
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:57,679
my motivation's been kind of more

3510
01:40:57,679 --> 01:40:58,880
general

3511
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:00,480
it's just meant to consider how the fbp

3512
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,400
can in principle provide a novel

3513
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:03,679
explanation for the prevalence of

3514
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:04,800
efficiency encoded

3515
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,320
linguistic rules and indeed other

3516
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,159
linguists might disagree with me and

3517
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:09,360
disagree with the actual framing and

3518
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:10,800
maybe the other linguistic frameworks

3519
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:11,199
like

3520
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:12,639
maybe ray jack and up spring back with

3521
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:14,800
parallel architecture that might be more

3522
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:16,000
appropriate too depends on your

3523
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,080
background assumptions so it's

3524
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:20,400
specifically natural language syntax

3525
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,400
and its capacity for sentence complexity

3526
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,400
that allows language users to expand the

3527
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:25,600
scope of their predictions

3528
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,199
about their future positions in state

3529
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:29,520
space they can think of more possible

3530
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:31,199
future scenarios right on platform

3531
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:33,440
recording

3532
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:34,719
so we've arrived at a number of

3533
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:36,239
suggested explanations for the way

3534
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:37,440
language implements

3535
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:38,719
the construction of hierarchical

3536
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:41,040
syntactic objects namely to minimize

3537
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,639
insanity about the causes of sensory

3538
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:43,360
data

3539
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,760
to unveil a species unique format of

3540
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,119
external hidden states

3541
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:51,440
to adhere to at least epic principle um

3542
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:54,239
and in fact in some cases this involves

3543
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:56,320
externalization but not always

3544
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,080
so exploring our and disposal

3545
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,080
empirically made demand a more mature

3546
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:01,199
development of the science of

3547
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:04,480
computational capacity in the brain

3548
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,000
so i basically argue that all the ways

3549
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,280
that language sent backwards and

3550
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:07,920
permission

3551
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:10,000
can be motivated for the ffb can simply

3552
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
be grounded through syntax

3553
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,360
so in other words narratives are strong

3554
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,119
candidates for constructs adhering to

3555
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:16,159
active immigrants

3556
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:17,520
and but the generation of synthetic

3557
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:19,199
praise structures is a necessary feature

3558
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:20,960
of any narrative right you need to at

3559
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,560
least construct a phrase to generate a

3560
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,320
narrative

3561
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,000
so i've reviewed how the fep that

3562
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,199
underwrites active imprints is an

3563
01:42:27,199 --> 01:42:28,960
expression of the principle of induction

3564
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:30,159
which is additionally a principle

3565
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:32,159
implemented in models of syntax

3566
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:34,560
so ultimately both the fpp and synthetic

3567
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,639
theory are empirically and conceptually

3568
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:38,159
well supported constructs

3569
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:39,840
and as i've argued they share a number

3570
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:42,239
of intriguing commonalities

3571
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:44,239
so while the ftp has produced formal

3572
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:45,840
simulation supported models of many

3573
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,679
complex cognitive mechanisms like action

3574
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:49,280
perception learning and attention

3575
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:51,360
and also communication on the other hand

3576
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:52,719
models of syntax

3577
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:55,679
have explained grammaticality tuitions

3578
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:57,360
certain poverty of stimulus issues are

3579
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:58,800
how kids acquire language

3580
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,560
and the pervasive organizational role

3581
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,080
the hierarchy has in language so

3582
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:03,360
hierarchies just seems to

3583
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:04,800
pretty much organize and determine

3584
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:07,360
almost all linguistic scriptures

3585
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:09,119
whether language is not a is not the

3586
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:11,360
only domain which exhibits economy right

3587
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,040
and suggesting a deeper grounding of

3588
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,560
this bias in natural law

3589
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:16,960
other domains include concept learning

3590
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,159
cause of reasoning

3591
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:19,920
centrifugal learning and also as i said

3592
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,560
before memory

3593
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:23,920
so importantly at the conference has

3594
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:26,239
been used to account for also creative

3595
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:27,040
functions

3596
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:28,639
that have to do with exploration and

3597
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:29,840
novelty and the reason why that's

3598
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:30,800
important is because

3599
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,400
linguists have also long argued that the

3600
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,480
hallmark of natural language is actually

3601
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:36,080
its creative aspect

3602
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:37,920
the ability to freely construct an

3603
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,920
unbounded array of hierarchy organized

3604
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:40,800
expressions

3605
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,320
with novel interpretations so you can

3606
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,639
say sentences that have never been said

3607
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:46,400
uh linguistic creativity can be framed

3608
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,239
in terms of adherence to physical

3609
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:50,159
thermodynamic conservativity if it does

3610
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:52,320
so to minimize uncertainty undeveloped

3611
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,080
in states within an individual models of

3612
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,320
external states

3613
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,320
so in other words the more efficiently a

3614
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,239
language user can internally construct

3615
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:00,960
meaningful

3616
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,719
hierarchically organized structures and

3617
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:04,239
more readily they can use these

3618
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:04,880
structures

3619
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,320
to contribute to the planning and

3620
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,639
organization of action consolidation

3621
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:10,400
microsoftness and endogenous monitoring

3622
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,400
and adaptive environment

3623
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:13,760
i think it's worth recalling gregor

3624
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,000
mendel's application of complex algebra

3625
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,920
at the barney

3626
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,679
at the time this was deemed by many

3627
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:21,360
people to be kind of weird

3628
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:23,760
and more surreal and but in fact the

3629
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:24,639
same may be true

3630
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:27,040
double conceptual directions um for

3631
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:28,560
natural language syntax and semantics

3632
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:28,960
right

3633
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:31,360
unconventional approaches that are often

3634
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:32,080
soon antenna

3635
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:35,040
into the new normal uh only time can

3636
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,480
tell how far these directions can

3637
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,480
actually be pursued though

3638
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:41,519
all right thank you for listening

3639
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:45,600
awesome you can unshare and then

3640
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:49,840
i hope we can ask a few of the questions

3641
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,679
yeah do you want to unshare your screen

3642
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:53,440
oh great okay awesome

3643
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:56,159
all right i will um just jump right in

3644
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:57,040
with the first question

3645
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,760
i again as a non-linguist was like

3646
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,040
looking up a bunch of words

3647
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:03,679
learning a lot so really fascinating the

3648
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:04,560
first question

3649
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,719
was um and i think it was related to

3650
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:08,080
when you said uh

3651
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:10,159
that language is not just about

3652
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:11,760
communication despite that being a

3653
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,199
common conception

3654
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,040
so potentially it's about the structure

3655
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,880
of thought or the structure of thinking

3656
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,880
so the question was it would be great if

3657
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,080
elliot could define

3658
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:22,480
what is his definition of thought and

3659
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:24,560
what is potentially the contribution

3660
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:27,600
of the intracranial language research

3661
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,800
towards answering the hard problem

3662
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,520
wow so you started with the easy

3663
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:34,639
question okay

3664
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:36,639
and yeah that's a really good question

3665
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:38,639
so um i i like to think of

3666
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:41,840
thoughts as um i do any other language

3667
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,360
it's kind of like a metaphor

3668
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:47,280
so and you know in in some languages and

3669
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:50,320
when a a human being does

3670
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:53,600
a long jump they only jump so in english

3671
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:54,960
they we just say they jump

3672
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:58,000
in japanese they actually allow flying

3673
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,080
so in in if a long jumper in the

3674
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:01,440
japanese linguist

3675
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,360
is at the olympics and they see someone

3676
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:04,560
do high jump or long jump

3677
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:05,520
they could technically say they're

3678
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,520
flying um but it's just a metaphor it's

3679
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:07,760
a

3680
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:09,199
i think it's the same with thor as well

3681
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:10,800
so thought is just a metaphor i don't

3682
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:13,360
think we have any uh it's not a

3683
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:15,679
well-defined scientific natural kind

3684
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:16,480
it's kind of a

3685
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:18,800
useful convenience so but you know that

3686
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,239
said i think

3687
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:22,639
the way i see it is natural language

3688
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:24,480
syntax allows us to fetch

3689
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:26,480
particular domain-specific

3690
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:27,600
representations

3691
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,119
from all sorts of different document

3692
01:46:29,119 --> 01:46:30,880
domains and then construct them into

3693
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,719
novel interpretations

3694
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:34,560
the important thing is that all of this

3695
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:35,840
is outside language

3696
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:38,320
so the interpretation process is an

3697
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:40,480
extra linguistic process the actual only

3698
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:40,960
the only

3699
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:42,480
linguistic specific process is just

3700
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,080
combining a phrase they're just

3701
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:44,719
combining

3702
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:46,400
items putting them together and then

3703
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,920
shipping them off to an external

3704
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:48,639
interface

3705
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:50,639
for interpretation and so that's the

3706
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:51,760
thought process

3707
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:54,480
and i don't have any deep particular

3708
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,000
reflections on it i think the best

3709
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,520
the the best book about this is paul

3710
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:59,440
batroski's uh conjoining meanings that

3711
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:00,639
came out in 2018

3712
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:03,760
um which is the idea that what language

3713
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:05,280
contributes to thought

3714
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,360
is kind of what i said here today like i

3715
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:08,480
kind of

3716
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,239
uniquely encodes a kind of functional

3717
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:12,639
abstraction and whereas different

3718
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:14,560
cognitive subdomains like the visual

3719
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,719
system or the olfactory system i guess

3720
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:19,280
you know the

3721
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,520
sense of and nonsense or geometric

3722
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,679
reasoning these all contribute distinct

3723
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:26,080
sub representations of a given uh

3724
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:26,880
sentence

3725
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,480
but language seems to uniquely care

3726
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,639
about function so abstract function

3727
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:32,239
so i guess i would say that if

3728
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:34,080
linguistic thought

3729
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,760
can be defined at all it's almost

3730
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:38,000
definitely going to closely approximate

3731
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
human specific interests and concerns

3732
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,199
and needs and things like that

3733
01:47:41,199 --> 01:47:42,320
which is kind of surprising because a

3734
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,719
lot of people just think of language as

3735
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:46,960
kind of um

3736
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:49,920
you know in an unbiased way

3737
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:51,040
communicating with

3738
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:52,960
um the conceptual structures like

3739
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,320
thought like language is the kind of

3740
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:55,119
thought system

3741
01:47:55,119 --> 01:47:56,320
but i don't really see it that way i

3742
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:58,080
kind of see as language does seem to

3743
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:58,960
bring with it

3744
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:01,679
some unique conceptual contributions uh

3745
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:02,320
namely

3746
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:04,960
it seems to encode these human specific

3747
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:05,840
functions

3748
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,440
um which is why i said you know if you

3749
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:09,520
look at water water cannot simply be the

3750
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:10,400
finest hazel

3751
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,239
it's way too simplistic it's the the

3752
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:14,000
actual meaning of water is way beyond

3753
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:14,560
that

3754
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,080
and and then with respect to

3755
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:19,360
intercranial stuff

3756
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,960
i'm not too sure like so uh

3757
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:22,639
entrepreneurial research is fantastic

3758
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:25,119
actually uh examining in real time

3759
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:27,280
actual neural responses right so again

3760
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:29,280
really down to integrity it depends on

3761
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,639
the type of electrode that you have

3762
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:33,119
it's resolution it's a listening radius

3763
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:34,480
how much of cortex you can actually

3764
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:35,280
sample

3765
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:36,639
and there's also something called the

3766
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:38,159
sparse sampling problem in in

3767
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:39,440
independent research where

3768
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:42,159
you have very great coverage of specific

3769
01:48:42,159 --> 01:48:43,280
cortical loci

3770
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:44,719
but then of course each patient will

3771
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:45,840
have different electrodes in different

3772
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:46,560
parts of the brain

3773
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,159
there's no patient that has electrodes

3774
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:49,760
everywhere they only have electrodes

3775
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,199
where their epilepsy is supposed to be

3776
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:51,760
targeted

3777
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:53,360
so for research purposes obviously it

3778
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,119
brings limitations so i don't think

3779
01:48:55,119 --> 01:48:56,880
we'll ever be able to have a coherent

3780
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:59,679
global whole grain in you know intra

3781
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:00,719
patient understanding

3782
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:02,480
what we do is we submit we combine

3783
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:03,840
across all these different patients

3784
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,520
and generate a more kind of average

3785
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,280
brain response if that makes sense

3786
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:10,159
and so in that sense um it can

3787
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:11,199
contribute just

3788
01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:13,840
the same way any other um energy or

3789
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:14,320
extra

3790
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,400
extra cranial ehg can do it depends on

3791
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:18,239
the paradigm it depends on

3792
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:19,920
the analysis i think the real crucial

3793
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,360
point here is conceptual

3794
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,440
innovation so what we really need is we

3795
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:24,800
have tons of data

3796
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,520
and from natural language experiments we

3797
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:28,480
have loads of data

3798
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:30,400
but we don't have all that much uh

3799
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:31,520
conceptual

3800
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:34,719
uh novelty so linguists are very good at

3801
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:36,800
coming up with very smart paradigms for

3802
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,639
you know very well carefully controlled

3803
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:39,920
experiments

3804
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:41,920
but then when it comes to actual novel

3805
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:43,360
conceptual frameworks

3806
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:44,960
for how these things actually map onto

3807
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,560
brain processes i think we need much

3808
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:47,280
more of that

3809
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:48,960
so i think actually um intracranial

3810
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:50,639
research will not be as

3811
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:53,679
uh useful as uh conceptual

3812
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:57,119
theoretical um you know that changes i

3813
01:49:57,119 --> 01:49:58,320
think that's much more important

3814
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:01,360
actually yeah well

3815
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:04,159
one area of utility that you didn't even

3816
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:05,840
go into at all would be

3817
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:08,239
machine learning and the long time

3818
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:10,320
challenge of natural language parsing

3819
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:11,520
and generation

3820
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:13,679
and the recent approach has been throw

3821
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:15,360
the big neural network at it

3822
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:17,760
with the gpt and just large-scale text

3823
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:18,560
modeling

3824
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:20,159
and then that reminded me of what you

3825
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:21,920
said about multi-scale models how we

3826
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:22,560
don't over

3827
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,199
fit the semantics even when we hear a

3828
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:26,960
ton of syllables i really really really

3829
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:28,400
really really am hungry

3830
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,239
and then um you know a computer might

3831
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:31,520
just spin out a p value

3832
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:33,119
it's kind of like over sampling but we

3833
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:34,800
don't want to over sample semantically

3834
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:35,760
so there's

3835
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,679
gonna be really interesting space for

3836
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:39,440
active inference models

3837
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:42,400
okay here's the awesome absolutely okay

3838
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:43,199
i'll go

3839
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:46,560
to the next question um can

3840
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:49,119
free energy principle and this syntactic

3841
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:50,320
theory framework

3842
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,639
help explain how and why the brain

3843
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:54,320
computes inner speech

3844
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,480
the way that it does and provide the

3845
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:58,320
possibility to predict what's about to

3846
01:50:58,320 --> 01:50:59,920
be computed in the future so how do we

3847
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:00,400
think about

3848
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:03,040
externalizing speech like vocalization

3849
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:03,760
versus our

3850
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:06,880
inner experience of speech

3851
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:08,880
are those structured are those in our

3852
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:11,119
voice like what is happening

3853
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:12,480
i think that's a really cool question

3854
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:14,320
and well i think that i think there's

3855
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:15,599
also a lot of like misconceptions about

3856
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:16,800
this so i actually don't see

3857
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:19,040
so so most people think that and you

3858
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,639
know external speech

3859
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:23,040
is kind of crude and you know it has

3860
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,560
nothing to do with thoughts

3861
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:26,560
but internal speech is like some kind of

3862
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,560
angelic platonic space

3863
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:31,440
and like a plate like plato's cave but

3864
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:32,480
actually i think that's the opposite i

3865
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:33,520
think they're both the same

3866
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:37,280
so an internalized speech is basically

3867
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:39,840
internalized externalized speech so when

3868
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:40,400
you speak to

3869
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:41,920
when you listen to yourself speaking in

3870
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:43,440
your in in a monologue

3871
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:45,440
you're doing it in the form of external

3872
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,800
speech you're not doing it in a

3873
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,320
different format it's not as if

3874
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:50,239
it's not as if in a speech has a

3875
01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:51,440
different structure and a different

3876
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:52,159
encoding

3877
01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:53,440
and then external speech is something

3878
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,280
different when i think to myself

3879
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:56,639
when i wake up in the morning i still

3880
01:51:56,639 --> 01:51:58,159
think to myself in english i think to

3881
01:51:58,159 --> 01:51:59,760
myself in linear sentences

3882
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,040
right that's that's how the thought is

3883
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:03,520
is externalized so it's

3884
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:04,960
this is why i said about the interface

3885
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:07,119
between language and conceptual systems

3886
01:52:07,119 --> 01:52:08,880
what's happening in inner speech

3887
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:11,040
is that you are externalizing in your

3888
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,159
own head so

3889
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:13,760
that so in a switch is basically a form

3890
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:15,760
of externalization okay

3891
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:17,520
not all forms of externalization involve

3892
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:18,880
me literally saying things

3893
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:20,320
you're still externalizing it you just

3894
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:22,320
externalize it to yourself

3895
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:25,119
so in other words actual linguistic

3896
01:52:25,119 --> 01:52:25,760
thought

3897
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:29,119
is is pre-conscious it's subconscious

3898
01:52:29,119 --> 01:52:30,880
and that's why we need linguistics

3899
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,159
departments kind of figure out you know

3900
01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:33,920
what are these subconscious operations

3901
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:34,639
that are happening right

3902
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:36,159
so we have a bunch of subconscious

3903
01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:38,080
marriage operations that are happening

3904
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:39,599
but we don't have direct conscious

3905
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:41,760
access to those

3906
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:43,040
and why should we there's no reason why

3907
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:44,960
we should do right but we do have direct

3908
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:45,679
access

3909
01:52:45,679 --> 01:52:49,280
to the externalized output in our um

3910
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:51,520
kind of self-generated auditory encoding

3911
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:52,880
of that structure

3912
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:55,119
so um i've got i can't remember what the

3913
01:52:55,119 --> 01:52:56,840
question was sorry but uh

3914
01:52:56,840 --> 01:53:00,080
yeah that reminds me of thinking through

3915
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:01,280
other minds

3916
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:03,920
um a recent paper in our you know active

3917
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:05,840
inference community and then also

3918
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:09,360
um yeah there's just so many interesting

3919
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:10,880
aspects about how you

3920
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:13,119
really pointed to these domain general

3921
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:14,880
attributes of language

3922
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:18,320
and yes i'm rethinking

3923
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:20,080
language and some of the ways that we

3924
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:21,679
even communicate

3925
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:23,599
on the stream because you'll see people

3926
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:25,679
say i'm just not sure how to say it

3927
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:27,679
it's like but are you sure how to how to

3928
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:28,960
think it oh

3929
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:31,280
no yeah because actually if we think

3930
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:32,639
through it and then we have

3931
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:35,040
feedback writing and we can it's like

3932
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:36,239
stigma g we're

3933
01:53:36,239 --> 01:53:38,239
making these meaning marks and then

3934
01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:40,159
we're reinterpreting that and so

3935
01:53:40,159 --> 01:53:42,560
it's going to be quite interesting there

3936
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:45,760
here's a third question

3937
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:47,840
thanks great talk given that the

3938
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:49,040
sequences are

3939
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:50,960
generated in nested hierarchical

3940
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:52,159
structures

3941
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:54,560
where would linear externalization fit

3942
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:55,199
in here

3943
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:57,119
can we say that they're bound by linear

3944
01:53:57,119 --> 01:53:58,800
externalizations and then maybe if

3945
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,639
that's a linguistics term

3946
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:02,320
what does that mean yeah it is yeah yeah

3947
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,719
okay great

3948
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:06,400
where do linear externalizations fit

3949
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:08,480
into here um

3950
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:11,920
uh that's a really good question um

3951
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:13,520
i'm not quite sure what the question is

3952
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:15,040
is trying to ask

3953
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:16,480
i kind of understand what they're saying

3954
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:18,320
um

3955
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:21,040
so i guess okay okay so it's typically

3956
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:22,719
assumed that um

3957
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:25,520
linear externalization is like the

3958
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:26,719
output of this of

3959
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:28,800
this detected system and that it turns

3960
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:30,800
out upon better analysis

3961
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:33,760
that most of the world's languages uh

3962
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:35,119
differences the way that the world

3963
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:35,760
languages

3964
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:38,480
differ is based on more phonological

3965
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:39,760
differences so in other words

3966
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,840
the way that morphemes and sounds are

3967
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:43,440
produced but the actual sciences and

3968
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:44,000
syntax

3969
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,239
is kind of fairly linear so in other

3970
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:47,520
words all the universal things about

3971
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:48,080
language

3972
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,920
i kind of care early on and all the

3973
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:51,599
differences in the world's languages

3974
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:53,840
occur very late on so late in the

3975
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:55,280
interpretation process

3976
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:57,040
so when you generate a structure that

3977
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:58,800
you want to say you at least need to

3978
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:00,080
have the syntax first

3979
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,119
because that's the most uniform

3980
01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:02,880
structure now once you've got the syntax

3981
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:03,679
in place

3982
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:06,719
you then go about doing you know filling

3983
01:55:06,719 --> 01:55:08,239
in all the sound details

3984
01:55:08,239 --> 01:55:09,440
but the sound details are kind of

3985
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:13,440
irrelevant for language that's just

3986
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,840
an annoyance basically right so i gave

3987
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,440
you the example of english and basque

3988
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:18,960
so english and basque have the same

3989
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:20,639
underlying phrase structure

3990
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:22,639
but they linearize it in different ways

3991
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:24,800
so um they just happen to linearize it

3992
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,440
based on

3993
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:26,880
you know whatever arbitrary conventions

3994
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:28,880
haven't do arisen in those different

3995
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:29,440
cultures

3996
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:31,440
but the actual interpretation is exactly

3997
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:32,880
the same so i would say whatever

3998
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:34,320
whatever linearization

3999
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,000
uh whenever it happens happens late

4000
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,480
stage and it happens as an inconvenience

4001
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:40,880
to the language system

4002
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:42,639
interesting and sometimes people will

4003
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:44,400
point to different languages or

4004
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:46,560
a word that appears unique to even a

4005
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,000
cultural experience

4006
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,840
but it's sort of the other side of that

4007
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:51,440
coin is the

4008
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:54,480
truly 99.9

4009
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:57,040
that's structured functionally like that

4010
01:55:57,040 --> 01:55:58,480
can be translated

4011
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:00,239
and so it is the exception that proves

4012
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:01,520
the rule just like

4013
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:04,080
when we we violate syntax sometimes to

4014
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:06,159
make a point like repeating a word

4015
01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:08,000
and then in our internal monologue maybe

4016
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,920
even like singing or alternate

4017
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:11,599
characters it's sort of like it's a

4018
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:13,679
dramatic externalization

4019
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:15,199
but it's the exception that proves the

4020
01:56:15,199 --> 01:56:16,480
rule or it's kind of like the grand

4021
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,560
master chess player who who violates a

4022
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,440
principle

4023
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:22,719
but that is is mastery over the syntax

4024
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:24,639
and we can't let those exceptions that

4025
01:56:24,639 --> 01:56:26,239
prove the rule

4026
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:28,719
lead us to throw out the baby with the

4027
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:29,520
bathwater

4028
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:32,639
or however else they say it but it it

4029
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:35,760
by highlighting language as functional

4030
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:38,239
and the structure of thinking rather

4031
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:40,000
than like um

4032
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,719
rhetorical only in its deployment was

4033
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:43,599
just connecting

4034
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:46,800
two nodes and you're really opening it

4035
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:48,639
up to think about what's inside

4036
01:56:48,639 --> 01:56:50,480
of the cranium as well and taking

4037
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:51,679
measurements from there but it's what's

4038
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:53,119
happening with our thought

4039
01:56:53,119 --> 01:56:56,239
that's being revealed in a linear string

4040
01:56:56,239 --> 01:56:59,520
so so so one of the um one of my

4041
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,000
favorite

4042
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,800
and examples of modern literature is

4043
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,000
magical realism

4044
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,280
and magical realism is basically uh

4045
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:09,199
put getting a blender putting lots of

4046
01:57:09,199 --> 01:57:10,719
different random concepts in there

4047
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:11,920
i'm blending them all together and

4048
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:13,760
seeing what comes out so a lot of

4049
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:15,520
literary like novelty literary

4050
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:16,239
conventions

4051
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:19,199
uh novels poetry is novel precisely

4052
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:20,320
because it just it's kind of

4053
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:21,679
experimental it's saying that's what

4054
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:23,360
happens when you put these two random

4055
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,040
different concepts together let's see if

4056
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:26,080
they can generate a meaningful

4057
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:27,199
interpretation that

4058
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:29,040
is either emotionally resonant or

4059
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:30,480
conceptually intriguing

4060
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:32,080
and in fact some of the most important

4061
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:34,080
poetry that's been written

4062
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,320
in the english language has violated

4063
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:38,159
rules of english grammar

4064
01:57:38,159 --> 01:57:39,520
precisely to generate these novel

4065
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:41,440
interpretations it kind of it's an it's

4066
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:43,199
an intentional violation of some kind of

4067
01:57:43,199 --> 01:57:44,320
linguistic rule

4068
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,239
which isn't it's like a signal to the

4069
01:57:46,239 --> 01:57:47,920
reader that there's a reason for this

4070
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:50,080
it sends a message it reflects something

4071
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:51,280
or whatever right

4072
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:52,960
but yeah absolutely like this these

4073
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:54,560
these exceptions to the rule

4074
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,320
are extremely important to like to think

4075
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:57,760
about

4076
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:01,199
my final question is how might

4077
01:58:01,199 --> 01:58:05,119
digital discourse and multimedia

4078
01:58:05,119 --> 01:58:07,520
be influencing structure of language

4079
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:08,719
structure of

4080
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:11,119
thought like are we synchronizing on the

4081
01:58:11,119 --> 01:58:13,360
functional aspects with memes or are we

4082
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:15,840
diverging in our narratives so how is

4083
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,199
that playing out when it's

4084
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:20,639
more multimedia visual video

4085
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:23,199
than ever less of it is spoken in red

4086
01:58:23,199 --> 01:58:25,119
which is the linearized sort of

4087
01:58:25,119 --> 01:58:27,119
classical language and now there's

4088
01:58:27,119 --> 01:58:28,719
unconventional languages so where does

4089
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:29,040
that

4090
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:32,400
how's that going to work yeah so so

4091
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:34,800
i mean i know that the capacity and the

4092
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:36,000
prevalence of like

4093
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,599
uh long-term digesting of like you know

4094
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:42,000
long sunday times articles is kind of

4095
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:42,880
declining

4096
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:45,119
and the propensity for bite-sized

4097
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:46,400
chunking information

4098
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:48,880
is like easily digestible it involves

4099
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:50,560
less critical thinking

4100
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:52,560
judgments ideological otherwise can be

4101
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,880
made rapidly inferences can be made

4102
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:57,679
and so on and that is definitely on the

4103
01:58:57,679 --> 01:58:59,599
rise however there was a linguistics

4104
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:00,560
book that came out

4105
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:03,440
i believe around 2010 and i can't

4106
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:04,639
remember who it was by

4107
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:07,760
um it was basically just analyzing the

4108
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:08,560
idea that

4109
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:10,639
so around the turn of the century

4110
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:12,560
obviously mobile phones came about right

4111
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:15,199
and everyone started texting and using

4112
01:59:15,199 --> 01:59:16,560
all these different

4113
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:18,159
so instead of saying please you would

4114
01:59:18,159 --> 01:59:20,159
say you type plz

4115
01:59:20,159 --> 01:59:21,840
uh instead of saying mates you would say

4116
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,599
m8 or whatever all these different

4117
01:59:23,599 --> 01:59:24,560
abbreviations

4118
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:27,360
um and at the time and a lot of people

4119
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:28,800
in england were very concerned about

4120
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:30,639
this because they said well all our kids

4121
01:59:30,639 --> 01:59:31,520
are going to be

4122
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:32,800
you know they're going to grow up stupid

4123
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:34,719
because they use all these slang

4124
01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:36,159
deviations of english

4125
01:59:36,159 --> 01:59:37,760
uh it turns out that there's almost no

4126
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:39,199
evidence that this affects intelligence

4127
01:59:39,199 --> 01:59:41,040
like people's ability to you know

4128
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:42,880
be smart and use language and identify

4129
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:44,480
language grammatically because in fact

4130
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:45,520
when you think about it

4131
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:48,639
if you use text language and

4132
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:50,400
if you open a whatsapp chat and you

4133
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:51,840
start and you text with somebody and you

4134
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:53,360
use all these emojis and use all these

4135
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:54,560
abbreviations for words

4136
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:56,639
it presupposes that you actually know

4137
01:59:56,639 --> 01:59:57,679
the correct version

4138
01:59:57,679 --> 01:59:59,280
because in order to violate the rules it

4139
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:01,199
presupposes that you understand them

4140
02:00:01,199 --> 02:00:03,280
so fighting the rules of grammar and

4141
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,040
fighting the rules of spelling

4142
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:07,679
actually exhibits comprehension of

4143
02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:08,400
genuine

4144
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:09,840
uh you know rules of english whatever

4145
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:11,679
when i call them right

4146
02:00:11,679 --> 02:00:15,040
the in this book on texting again i

4147
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:15,760
can't remember it

4148
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:18,080
but uh so i think that's a pretty good

4149
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:18,880
example of when

4150
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:21,440
this panic this this moral panic in in

4151
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:23,520
society over like you know text

4152
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:25,679
you know it's i i the answer is i don't

4153
02:00:25,679 --> 02:00:27,040
know you know i have no idea

4154
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:30,480
but on that sort of moral panic i guess

4155
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:32,639
i thought it's like um then at some

4156
02:00:32,639 --> 02:00:34,239
point maybe even they forget how to

4157
02:00:34,239 --> 02:00:35,239
spell it

4158
02:00:35,239 --> 02:00:37,599
p-l-e-a-s-e you know how to spell please

4159
02:00:37,599 --> 02:00:39,040
and then it's kind of like

4160
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:41,280
our word roots you know oh i can't

4161
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:42,960
believe you don't speak greek enough to

4162
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:44,719
know that the word roots of this it's

4163
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:45,040
like

4164
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:48,320
it's become modularized so units

4165
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:50,639
that were novelties at first and

4166
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:51,920
exceptions

4167
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:54,719
become reified within a cultural context

4168
02:00:54,719 --> 02:00:55,599
a shared niche

4169
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:57,280
shared narrative so that like the crying

4170
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:59,040
emoji does mean this

4171
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:00,960
functionally and then someone could say

4172
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,320
i can't believe that you don't know that

4173
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:03,679
it used to mean this in a different

4174
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:05,760
language it's sort of like

4175
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:08,480
it speaks to so many of these excellent

4176
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:09,199
themes

4177
02:01:09,199 --> 02:01:12,800
so yeah elliott awesome

4178
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:14,400
guest stream thanks for your first

4179
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,480
appearance and we're always

4180
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:18,000

4181
