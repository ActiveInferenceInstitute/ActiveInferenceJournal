00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,678
Hello and welcome to the Active
Inference Lab.

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,181
Today is April 14th, 2021

3
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:19,719
and we're here in guest stream
number 4.1 with Elliot Murphy.

4
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,355
So this is going to be
a really interesting talk.

5
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,557
And Elliot, we appreciate you coming on.

6
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,961
So I'll just pass it to you
to introduce yourself,

7
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,997
introduce the topic,
and then share some slides.

8
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:34,968
So anyone who's watching life
or I guess later in the comments,

9
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,772
just ask questions and we'll have time
during this presentation and at the end

10
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:39,939
to go over some comments.

11
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,509
But thanks again, Elliot,
and looking forward to hearing this.

12
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,211
Awesome. Yeah. Thank you very much.

13
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,881
So I am a post-doc working at U.S.

14
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,183
Health in Houston, Texas.

15
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,587
I work on intracranial recordings
of lot of patients

16
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,958
doing a lot of language tests, trying
to explore the neural basis of language.

17
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,162
And today
I am going to present some slides,

18
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:05,498
kind of reviewing a recent preprint
that is currently in review

19
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,636
on active inference for energy principle.

20
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:14,607
And I was very.

21
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,610
Yep. Looks good.

22
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,078
Okay.

23
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,413
So I'm going to give you a month
to look into the topic

24
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:24,451
and then talk a bit about linguistics
and then try and wrap up.

25
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,886
We'll make this more of a conversation.

26
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,355
Comments, questions,
objections, obviously.

27
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,692
Anyway, so yeah, like I said,

28
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,894
this is the preprint
that's currently in review

29
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:36,996
with Eamonn Holmes.

30
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,932
I call for something useful.

31
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,367
The argument is that natural language
syntax complies

32
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,636
in some degree with friendship principle,

33
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:48,007
so just outlining some kind of
really cool and

34
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,477
basic principles.

35
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,746
I want to make this conversation
a little bit more philosophical

36
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,115
than than than normal.

37
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,118
And obviously,
this is this lab is the business lab.

38
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:03,256
So I want to introduce some linguistics
topics more than the topics,

39
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,959
because the audience might be less
familiar with syntactic theory.

40
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,828
So to begin with, natural language
syntax yields

41
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,599
what linguists then call unbounded array
of hierarchically structured expressions

42
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,435
when bounded, meaning
that they can potentially go on forever.

43
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,872
There's no upper bound
on the limit of a sentence, right?

44
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:21,508
You can always make any sentence longer
by simply adding.

45
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,110
John said that I'm beginning of it
and it gets longer.

46
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:29,249
The only thing that stops sentences
going off forever is the working memory

47
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:32,685
the age of the average human
being in the age of the universe.

48
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,221
No sense of constant
private interest at some point.

49
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,958
And what the genetic component
in principle could do that,

50
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,593
but also the language,

51
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:43,663
the fact that you could in principle
generate unbounded array of expressions.

52
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,166
So I kind of argued in this paper

53
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,835
that these are used
in the service of active inference,

54
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,739
which is intent in accord
with the principle for the general goal.

55
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,742
That's the kind of alliance and consent
that works with those

56
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:59,479
of the normative model for organic system
behavior associated with the ATP.

57
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,649
So I'm going
to be relying on theoretical linguistics

58
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:06,152
with special emphasis on syntax,
which is the system

59
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,989
that determines
the kind of order that will go in the

60
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:13,426
structure and organization in relation
to the organizational relations

61
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,328
between words and sentences.

62
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,697
So a lot of these design
principles are kind of

63
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,967
general
to the biological components of language,

64
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,536
not just for specific
instantiation of language.

65
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,171
And so they're not specific

66
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,241
to English or French or Swahili,
that kind of general design principles

67
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,579
about how the language system
seems to be organized.

68
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,083
So I can say that I want to emphasize
emphasize more on the linguistics,

69
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,754
something more than a reference,
just that to the exposition.

70
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,759
And although the preprint itself has
all the relevant details, it really more.

71
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,730
But yeah, but kind of the brief
historical background here

72
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,933
is that since around the 10th century,
about 20, 25 years ago,

73
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,570
linguists have basically been developing
theories of linguistic computation

74
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,206
which invoke economy principles.

75
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:04,077
So basically the idea is that
when you pass and construct a sentence,

76
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,213
there are signs and computations
that enter into that process.

77
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:11,184
It's not just a single kind of chunk,
but you memorize what produce you do

78
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,553
in discrete operations.

79
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,589
And yet, for some reason, there's
currently no means of grounding

80
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,659
or motivating these ideas
through more general linguistic domains.

81
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,162
So recently,
proposed principles of economy,

82
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:26,532
such as minimum search or
least ever criteria, which I'll explain.

83
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,268
I'll give you definitions obsolete.

84
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,536
And I argue
that they adhere to the epithet.

85
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,606
And if this can be shown,
then this permits a greater degree

86
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,976
of explanatory power to the FFA
with respect to highlight which functions

87
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,545
and it also presents
linguistic perspective,

88
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,081
a grounding of notions
between people building and so on.

89
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,452
So in other words, that the idea is this
natural language syntax is a system,

90
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,987
it's an organic system,
it's a formal system.

91
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,556
Maybe it can be described
using the language of

92
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,227
theory, of recursive functions
and capability

93
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,696
imported from computer science
and all the rest of it.

94
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,231
But there's a problem.

95
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,501
And all of these principles of economy
and language design

96
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,071
in the literature are unsurprisingly kind
of language focused, right?

97
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:09,142
That have a very kind
of linguistically encoded background.

98
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:13,313
And so there's been a paradox
because one of the original goals of this

99
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:17,517
program was actually to say, okay, let's
see how much of language is actually

100
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:21,754
that can arise
through the kinds of formal principles

101
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:26,059
that given
the organizing shape of snowflakes

102
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,362
or the morphology of lightning bolts,
so on kind of just general

103
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,799
domain, general laws of nature

104
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,002
that can give rise in different ways
across different domains.

105
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,272
And yet the linguistic languages
are still kind of

106
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,810
encoding these in language specific
things, rather than relating them

107
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,313
to more general principles of brain
organization or mental computation.

108
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:48,781
So that's the kind of background

109
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,419
and so
many historical insights into syntax,

110
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,488
I argue, are kind of consistent
with the FPP,

111
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,291
which provides another perspective on
to which the principles

112
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,361
governing syntax are not limited to,
on which they actually reflect.

113
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,597
The main general processes
that underpin a variety of computations

114
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,267
is also consistent with a strain
within theoretical linguistics

115
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:12,071
that explores how syntactic computation
may adhere to general principles

116
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,007
that may well fall
within the biological natural law,

117
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,910
in particular
considerations of minimal confusion,

118
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,546
such that certain linguistic
theories might be engaging with

119
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,282
general properties of organic systems,
but in fact, languages are.

120
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,651
So I think that's kind
of a beautiful idea there, that

121
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,055
all the other languages
that we speak English, French, German,

122
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,290
but only are they biologically grounded.

123
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,560
But actually the rules
that kind of govern the what you can say,

124
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,930
what you can't say, and indeed
how you and your brain computes

125
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,134
some parts or sentences
as part of that process.

126
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,136
You kind of get
for free if you just assume

127
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,971
extra biological,

128
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,541
natural law, one of which you can
you can argue is is the French principle.

129
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,844
So that's the kind of background it.

130
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:55,548
So the structuring elements of FP
can be detected in language.

131
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,618
And I'm not only I've argued recently
at the complex level

132
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,621
caucus and his colleagues
of what was a bunch of papers

133
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,824
in the last year
or two, mainly in 2020, arguing that

134
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,194
active inference can relate to narrative

135
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,164
comprehension, interpersonal dialog,
like when two people talk

136
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,201
and cooperative intentional communication
and speech segmentation.

137
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:19,272
And I'm going to kind of argue that
all of these things rely on something

138
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,107
much more lower down.

139
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,175
And that syntax,

140
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,643
if you can't

141
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,312
syntactically construct the phrase,
if you can't put two and two together

142
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,448
and form a phrase,
you're not going to get very far.

143
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,751
You at least need to do that
in order to engage in, you know,

144
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:37,824
intentional operation and narrative and
and storytelling and speech segmentation.

145
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,426
You at least need to be able
to form a phrase, right?

146
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,329
If you can't do that, you can't do
anything to do with language.

147
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,432
So I'm kind of arguing that, you know,

148
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,870
all of the all of the ways that the FP
can be related to all of these things

149
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,540
here is arising from a kind of
fundamental lower level consideration

150
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,075
to do with the way that

151
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,412
phrasebook computations are executed.

152
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,246
Elliot.

153
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,981
Have you changed any slides?

154
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,818
We can't see any slides changing just.

155
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,220
Okay.

156
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,522
Yeah, I have a few slides.

157
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,591
Just maybe unshared reshare.

158
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:15,895
But it stands alone
what you've said as well.

159
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:21,000
But it will be also good
to have the visual. See?

160
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,736
Okay, how about this?

161
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,839
So we see your mouse and then
just advanced like on the left bar.

162
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,875
Like, click on to your next slide.

163
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,809
Mm hmm. Yep.

164
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,110
Perfect. Okay.

165
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,179
What about now?

166
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,547
No. Okay.

167
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,815
Oh, I see.

168
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:36,782
Okay.

169
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:43,422
Well, I might have to the.

170
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,559
Like, window in focus.

171
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,193
Yeah.

172
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,463
This, just as a non
linguist was really interesting

173
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,934
that you appeal to, like,
kind of bigger laws then linguistics.

174
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,068
Mm hmm.

175
00:08:56,402 --> 00:09:00,206
Like complex systems theory or snowflakes
and lightning's, like you said.

176
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:03,242
And then just pointing out
that you're kind of

177
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:09,248
bringing linguistic level rules
or patterns into a bigger scope.

178
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,285
Okay, cool.
So we see it with Chomsky now.

179
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:13,920
Okay.

180
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,489
Well, I've only skipped,
like five slides,

181
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,926
so everything that I've just said is
so I show the paper,

182
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:23,129
here's the paper,
I simply regurgitate this.

183
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,897
I like this.

184
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,998
All of these things already read out.

185
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,401
So, yeah,
if you had what I said, then that's good.

186
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,268
Great.

187
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,604
Okay. So can you see slide number eight?

188
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:35,041
Yep. Cool. Awesome. Okay.

189
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:35,942
Okay. Okay.

190
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,545
So if the process of constructing
hierarchically organized sets

191
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,614
of linguistic features
and the way to phrase incentive

192
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,383
can be shown to adhere
to principles of efficient reputation,

193
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,787
then this process must also operate
within fundamental constraints

194
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,188
on your organics,

195
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:52,892
which is those applied by the FFA,
in which the homeostatic brain minimizes

196
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:56,929
the dispersion of interest
figure it's ever been.

197
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,131
Can also allow us to understand
how natural language

198
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,533
complies with the constraints

199
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:04,136
imposed on worldly interactions,
deriving same features of language.

200
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,306
So again, at the moment
this is all pretty abstract.

201
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,444
I'm going to give you some much more
like concrete examples, so I apologize.

202
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,412
It's a little bit
philosophical at the moment

203
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,149
and so a number of robust findings
from theoretical acoustics

204
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,818
can be used to support
the image of the brain

205
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:22,321
as a constructive organ, assembling
and inferring linguistic representations

206
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,957
in the sense of surprise, minimization
and related goals.

207
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,960
So syntactic structures are not mind
external entities.

208
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,396
They're not the kind of thing
that physicists could easily examine,

209
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,899
but they're rather actively
interpreted by the brain

210
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,969
as seemingly, with the help of endogenous
low frequency activity,

211
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,139
coordinating cross cortical gamut
optimization of linguistic features

212
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,143
according to what your recent models,
which I'm gonna get back to at the end.

213
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,211
So in other words,

214
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,280
we have a general framework
for how to implement the abstract level,

215
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,116
and we also maybe have a kind of

216
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,551
at least understanding
about what's implemented in the brain.

217
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,987
That's the kind of the long vision
of this presentation.

218
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,957
At the end, we're going to try
and wrap it up by returning to the brain.

219
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,861
But for now, I'll
give you a more kind of concrete example.

220
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,463
So I said that syntactic structures
have to be different.

221
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,733
The reform of inference,
their inference generation,

222
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,236
they're not just passive perception.

223
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,872
So if you have a structure like

224
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:17,476
we watched a movie with Jim Carrey,
I can mean two things and it cannot.

225
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,845
I mean, the movie stars Jim Carrey,

226
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:21,781
The Truman Show episode.

227
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,750
We watched The Truman Show
or you actually watched the movie whilst

228
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,620
sat next to Jim Carrey.

229
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,754
It depends on how you pass it, right?

230
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:33,893
It depends on how which phrases get
merged with in which order, basically.

231
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,962
So there's a kind of general

232
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,365
schematic here, but you can have a fun

233
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,901
little operation up
in the pre-print paper that I mentioned.

234
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,838
But the basic idea is that this
structural ambiguity arises from syntax.

235
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,008
So therefore the whole process of syntax
has to be an inference process.

236
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,244
It's not given to us on a
we have to kind of

237
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,648
we have to do some homework in order
to construct every possible pass.

238
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,250
So that poses the problem.
How does it do?

239
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,852
It is an inferential process.

240
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,387
So what are the
operations involved in that?

241
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,323
So here's a kind of a standard.

242
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,292
What local structure in the West is,

243
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,728
is that there's two different ways
of passing the sentence.

244
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,164
You can have a shoot,
an elephant is wearing your pajamas,

245
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,666
which is definitely possible.

246
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,701
Or you can shoot out and walk away
and drop jump.

247
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:19,238
And it depends how you in
which order you merge the phrases right

248
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:23,008
in which which hierarchical relationship
is exhibited, if that makes sense.

249
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,410
So there's kind of a lot

250
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,179
of theoretical background here
and that I won't go into because that's a

251
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:29,715
whole different lecture.

252
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:33,085
But the basic idea is that there's
a ambiguity that instructs generation.

253
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,887
It's not always language,

254
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:38,057
as long as it's not beads on a string,
it's a it's a structure.

255
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:42,061
So along with that kind of theme,
I'm also assuming

256
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,931
a distinction in linguistics between
what's called AI language and E language.

257
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,867
And this is the really Christmas
emotions get clear.

258
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,703
So I want to make sure
this does make sense to everybody.

259
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,805
So an AI language is

260
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,574
the actual internal knowledge,

261
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,043
but an individual human being
has in their mind brain.

262
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:02,481
AI stands for individual internal
unintentional intentional with an s

263
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,451
meaning
meaning meaning separated meanings.

264
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,921
On the other hand,
you have Michael big language perspective

265
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,359
and that is actually arguably
not really a formula or coherent

266
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,295
is the idea
that language is a kind of external,

267
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,365
a system,
a mind external, an extra mental system

268
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,468
like the English language
is somehow out there in the world.

269
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,203
And when we learn the English language,

270
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,539
we kind of approximate
some kind of mind external system.

271
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,407
And we all have something in common.

272
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,275
We all approximate to

273
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,378
the English language in different ways,
but the island, which means that

274
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,980
when we actually communicate
with each other

275
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,551
and the reason why we can't successfully
communicate is not because we share e

276
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:42,922
language in common is because I languages
successfully and sufficiently overlap

277
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,124
to the degree
that we can actually communicate.

278
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,927
And so everybody's islands are different.

279
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,930
It's often said that there's
7000 languages on the bottom,

280
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,331
but that's actually not not true.

281
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:56,101
There's actually how many people
there are common, but it's like 7 billion

282
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,770
or something or half.

283
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,705
And that's how many languages there are.

284
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,875
Every human being
has a different language faculty set.

285
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,376
The parameters are set differently.

286
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,479
We all have different intellects,
different understandings and so on.

287
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,114
And that kind of sounds
really obvious, right?

288
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,483
When you think about it,
it's like obviously that's true.

289
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,053
But and B implications for the study of
language are actually pretty

290
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:16,121
full.

291
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:20,192
In other words, when we study linguistic
competence, we are studying like a mind

292
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:24,363
internal computational system
and we're not studying something outside.

293
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,032
So the English language is not something
that linguists actually study.

294
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,468
We don't know.
That's not a coherent concept.

295
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,371
It's like the concept of culture
or community or whatever.

296
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,341
It's these are not things
that physicists could identify.

297
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,443
And that's not to say
that we can't say things about them.

298
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:41,914
We can't obstruct the human mind,
construct theories of of e languages.

299
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:45,050
I guess
you can talk about the English language

300
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:49,855
you're changing over the decades,
which is kind of every coherent way

301
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,091
to talk about language,
and you can put it in that way.

302
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,526
Both are naturalistic perspective
from a biological perspective,

303
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:57,363
but the only way you can study
it is based on

304
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,432
what individual libraries do.

305
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:01,901
So to

306
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,237
give an example
here, and if you take a recent film,

307
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,741
I generally screen for yesterday
Hitman's wife's bodyguard

308
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,778
and the defining property of language is
said to be this unbounded

309
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,948
array of hierarchical,
organized expressions made recursion.

310
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,851
So recursion is a defining property
of natural language syntax.

311
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,453
But it turns out to be distributed
unevenly across the world.

312
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:26,592
So some people argue that saying
we just don't exhibit advocation at all.

313
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,795
And but this actually tells us nothing
about the actual biological language

314
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:33,132
of the word speakers of these languages
than Portuguese.

315
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:33,632
Right.

316
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,468
So the idea is that language
can easily, unavoidably

317
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,504
be exhibited by most of the world's
languages.

318
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,540
Again, when I say languages,
I mean a kind of convenient

319
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,377
description
of every individual's fixed language.

320
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:50,015
Probably the most Germanic languages only
allow a single criminal Johnson limited

321
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,852
to pronounce the German doesn't allow
it requires a bit in the possessive.

322
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,322
But in German you can say John's house,

323
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,224
you can't say John's sister's
friend's house.

324
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,527
So the above movie,
when it's released in Germany,

325
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,430
it's going to have to be called something
like The Bodyguard and Man's Wife,

326
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,833
which
has a slightly different tone on it.

327
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:12,604
But the idea is that this fundamental
capacity of language to execute recursion

328
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:17,042
and you can find all the ways
you can find it in a phrase embedding

329
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,112
and but phrases the way that we actually
for phrases or you can find it

330
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,615
in other ways like in this example here.

331
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,552
So relating us back to the MVP,

332
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,221
while the MVP is a very full principle
of least action,

333
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,690
such as those
that describe systems of consequence,

334
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,292
these are relatively recent programing.

335
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,194
Linguistics has suggested
that natural language, in fact,

336
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,262
it is the principle of principles
of least action.

337
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,731
I'm going to say

338
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,100
the modern
theoretical linguistics remains

339
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,402
comparatively remote
for the field in science,

340
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,539
but certain parts of it from this field
resonate with the mother of

341
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:53,012
so many biological and cognitive
principles of efficiency

342
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,515
might be special cases of a variational
principle of energy sharing.

343
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,718
This assessment should allow researchers
from distinct disciplines to reevaluate

344
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,888
their hypotheses and empirical evidence
in terms of low level graduate,

345
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,457
which is the kind of go
I have in mind here.

346
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,559
What we should also stress
as a recent paper does, but

347
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:11,030
it can be used as a methodological
heuristic for research

348
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,665
and but it's not a theory of everything,
it's just a fragment.

349
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,368
And actually,
I find this very similar to a framework

350
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,237
in linguistics
called the Minimalist Program,

351
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,540
which is a program
it's not a coherent yet, at least

352
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,742
it has a couple of theories,
working theories,

353
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,411
but it's not a coherent body of Dr.

354
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,847
Klein's ongoing research program
with a particular ideology and framework.

355
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,916
And that's exactly what the apathy is,
right?

356
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,551
It's a formal principle

357
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:37,256
which feels that I can contribute
to a discrete individual and separate.

358
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,458
And so theories depending
on what domain you're looking at.

359
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:44,463
And so I kind of like the idea
that both programmatic motions

360
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,499
and you can implement them a bit ways so

361
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,036
that so
we're working here with the ethics

362
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,972
and the people in question
doesn't work on ethics

363
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,641
so much it's not an applied approach.

364
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:59,611
The debate and so everything
has been argued to be more of a kind of

365
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,047
conceptual mathematical model
for self-organized systems.

366
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,551
And as a recent review
by Andreas makes clear,

367
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,352
there's number of ways
that they would be perceived

368
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:10,322
as an aid to scientific work
without constituting, like,

369
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,658
falsifiable statements
about the state of nature.

370
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:13,659
It's a it's program.

371
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:17,196
It's a way of usefully describing certain

372
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,466
jokes of nature
without necessarily covering them.

373
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,102
So while we argue
about natural language syntax

374
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,671
and so when we argue
that natural language syntax complies

375
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,774
with the French principle,
I'm not necessarily implying that the ATP

376
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:32,678
necessarily bars specific direct
predictions of that behavior.

377
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,682
It's rather a way of motivating
the construction of neural conceptual

378
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,752
arguments for how some practical systems
might be seen as realizing the goals of

379
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:43,956
others and

380
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,792
repeating the language, language
distinction, and focusing on knowledge

381
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,027
which is internal
to the mind of the Speaker,

382
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,464
exploring their apparent competence
rather than what they happen to produce.

383
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,501
So one example of what you can

384
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,604
think of immediately
is the existence of syntactic structures.

385
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,305
You contribute to a unique form

386
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:04,109
of some encouraging through maximizing
moral evidence and minimizing surprise.

387
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,512
I'm very in the actual paper in question.

388
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,814
I'm I'm
so I think it goes into more detail.

389
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,482
But the basic idea is that the highly

390
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,819
restricted set of syntactic projections,
what I call

391
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,823
the way that you can categorize a phrase,
nouns and bits

392
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,659
and components as a phrase
and so on, but restricted set

393
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,762
and finite set of ways
that you can define a particular phrase

394
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,732
as being a better phrase
or not phrase and achieve goal.

395
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,136
So you can also assume that languages and
languages that you're in comprehension

396
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,237
select the phrase structure.

397
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,906
That's least surprising
from the perspective

398
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,574
the hierarchical counter model.

399
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:39,011
Again, this goes back to the we watched
the movie with Jim Carrey example.

400
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,780
It's a prediction.

401
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,382
There's a pretty big rocket.

402
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:46,151
So as such, brain structure
building can be capsule internal action.

403
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,720
It's an actual internal action
that an individual does

404
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,756
in the sense of their commitment
framework

405
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,325
that selects among competing
hypotheses, i.e.

406
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,060
syntactic structures.

407
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,162
You can pass it this way,
you can pass it another way.

408
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,266
And also the same goes
for lexical semantics syntax them.

409
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,536
In other words, you can interpret
an individual with one word.

410
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,672
I'm going to give you
some examples with it.

411
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:10,242
So pretty much all of language
from individual words to sentences and

412
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,178
inferences

413
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,382
and also a little side
point here and writing

414
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,085
more directly to existing work
on active inference and communication.

415
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,522
And it's I think it's pretty interesting
that the recursive combinatorial

416
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:27,092
approaches of syntax has been argued
to facilitate recursive theory of mind.

417
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:27,693
Right.

418
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,294
So the ability, your ability

419
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,831
to know that someone else knows, that
she knows that you know this and so on

420
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,969
and it could be seen therefore
as deriving or piggybacking in some way,

421
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:40,539
and could space properties of either
linguistic communication,

422
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,309
which in turn serves
to unveil the head states

423
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,079
that other people's mental states,
which are the kind of standard assumption

424
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:51,250
and theory of mind, active inference
research, but I think can be related

425
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,587
much more directly to the language once
we understand that the extended kind of

426
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,925
use of theory of mind in language is it

427
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:04,496
comes directly from this as a property,
right?

428
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:04,730
Okay.

429
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,966
So I mean, I want to move on
to kind of the more concrete examples.

430
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,869
Everything I've said so far is
pretty philosophical and pretty abstract.

431
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,171
What I want to kind of give you
some actual concrete examples

432
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:18,710
so it makes more sense.

433
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,045
So it provides

434
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,282
additional constraints on what of system
can be physically realized.

435
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,683
That is very useful.

436
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,486
So take the first three principles
in classical recursive

437
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,888
function theory,
which are functions to propose

438
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:33,258
substitution, primitive recursion
and minimization.

439
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,494
These are all designed in a way
that you might think of

440
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,162
as computationally efficient.

441
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,298
They reuse
the output of various computations.

442
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,567
So for instance, substitution
replaces the argument of functions,

443
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:43,869
but no function.

444
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,438
Primitive recursion
defines a new function on the basis

445
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,406
of as opposed to it.

446
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:51,843
So bottoming out in a previously defined
function and minimization produces

447
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:56,181
the output of a function
with the smallest number of steps.

448
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:59,318
So the notion of minimizing surprise
can be used to ground observations

449
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,186
from theoretical physics
pertaining to the ground.

450
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:05,023
Its propensity to reduce the search space
during syntactic derivations

451
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,360
limit no tempering of objects
during static derivations,

452
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,997
so it restricts the number of resources
able to be confined in a given moment.

453
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,300
So in other words,
this is very kind of an abstract example,

454
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,436
but I'm going to give you
some more concrete ones in

455
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,672
during any particular parts of a sense,
you don't just search the next

456
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,774
on an instruction unit
just because you can't.

457
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,543
You only do so if you need to.

458
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,446
If the current number of lexical items
that you've already said.

459
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,515
So that's one thought and suffice
to generate a given interpretation,

460
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,817
then you don't need to

461
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,353
search for more items.

462
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,987
That's sufficient. Write down of words.

463
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:39,024
Don't just don't do more search
well message as possible.

464
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,961
And also relates
to the grammars propensity to limit

465
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,062
the range of reputation

466
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,232
resources able to be called upon
during any given stage of comprehension.

467
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,102
So examining
some core principles of occasion

468
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,738
natural language
clearly exhibits minimization, right?

469
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,408
While finally branching of structures
limits redundant computation.

470
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,811
The binary branching goes back to
that slide I showed a few minutes ago.

471
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:03,615
We have these binary branching
prescriptions, so I show an elephant

472
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:08,220
and my pajamas and that all relates
to that back a little bit.

473
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,089
Drive through successive implementations
of a binary branching operation

474
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:15,127
that simply puts two things together
and gives us an identity.

475
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,929
So natural language syntax
also exhibits discrete units.

476
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:22,200
Obviously this individual which
which leads to a discrete discontinuity

477
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,101
duality.

478
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,737
So syntax is driven
by closeness of computation.

479
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,341
So objects X and Y form a distinct object
to one.

480
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,943
Its objects
are also bounded to the other.

481
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,515
The fixed list so is bound by adjectives,
adverbs, prepositions, traumatizes,

482
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:41,286
tense objects, little nouns, a little bit
of spectral elements and so on.

483
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:44,790
Always have a peculiar, functional
and content related notions.

484
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:48,560
The hierarchical ordering is based on
a specific functional sequence as well,

485
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,763
and which imposes
direct restrictions of combinatorics.

486
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,233
These objects can be combined
into cycles, so recursive embedding

487
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,203
which can be extended
to non-local dependencies.

488
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,773
So an example of that is you have
flight number four output market.

489
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,510
So you can say the keys to the old wooden
cabinet are on the table

490
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:09,448
and not the keys to the old wooden
cabinet is on the table, obviously,

491
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,982
is those of keys

492
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,952
they have to mark, but they have to agree
and the number pictured.

493
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:14,519
Right.

494
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,955
So that's the example
where you have a non-local

495
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,924
and dependency between two elements.

496
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:21,693
So if to hold it in memory,
even though they cross

497
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:26,131
phrase boundaries, so syntax
still keeps on generating new structures,

498
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,734
but you have to associate one element
with a new element further boundary.

499
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,572
And so these properties are retained,
guarded by principles of minimal

500
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:34,306
search on links that

501
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,508
show in a minute,

502
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,344
fulfilling the goal of active inference
to construct meaningful representations

503
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:40,412
as efficiently as possible.

504
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,180
I think that's really
what it comes down to.

505
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,516
That's the kind of core crucial message
here.

506
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,586
If it can be shown that
the language system

507
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,624
constructs meaningful representations
as efficiently as possible,

508
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,861
then therefore
it must be absolutely everything.

509
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:58,029
And again, that contributes
to surprise minimization.

510
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,464
How much of the goals

511
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,701
so from the perspective of APB

512
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:06,271
and the range of possible structures
available to comprehend is provide

513
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,640
alternative promises, but generalize

514
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,776
such preclude overfitting sensory data.

515
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:15,814
So the complexity of linguistic stimuli
can be efficiently map to a small series

516
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:20,018
of regular and regularized in the sense
of when syntactic formats.

517
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,387
This contributes to the brain's
more general goal

518
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,323
of restricting itself to a limited number
of characteristic states.

519
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,628
So therefore it's only changeable things
if you have to write by mapping

520
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,631
syntactic structures the language
extent of conceptual interfaces.

521
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:36,334
Now that's a kind of a key to language
external interfaces.

522
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:41,072
What that means is you have a narrow
and a component of language,

523
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,207
the kind of narrow school,

524
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,442
the narrow faculty of language,
but we can call it whatever you like.

525
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,978
It's just the capacity to
to construct the structures.

526
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:51,249
But then you have a language external,
mental modules and memory systems

527
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,653
and what have you,
attentional control systems

528
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:59,024
in the mind that are located across
different cortical surfaces.

529
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,593
It's kind of the standard, the standard
much of the framework, I guess.

530
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,663
And so by mapping these structures,

531
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:08,500
general language through these language,
external interfaces

532
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,735
in a manner adherent
to principles of common

533
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,038
language can be seen as engaging
in a series of questions and

534
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,272
answers which sensory data

535
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,041
specific.

536
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,345
So those that work in theoretical
semantics assumes that there are

537
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:24,215
and there are flexible concepts
that language can interface with.

538
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,518
And there also nonfunctional concepts

539
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,353
don't have words
that there are systems, that

540
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,388
there are properties of human thought.

541
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,824
But the language system
seems pretty clear

542
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,361
and it likes to use explicit.

543
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,297
But there are other modules of cognition

544
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,634
that for some reason can't be
linguistically encoded as easily.

545
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,202
That's kind of a weird property, right?

546
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,270
But why should we able

547
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,638
why should we be able to linguistically

548
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:50,141
encode and communicate about,
send thoughts going to others?

549
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:53,211
And so one example is many of the world's
languages.

550
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,982
Again, when I say will as languages,
I mean in quotation marks.

551
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,551
And what I really mean, this
many of the individual human beings,

552
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:01,286
they make use of

553
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:05,323
quantification of numeracy, often
typically seen as this

554
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:10,095
from the parietal patient,
which is interestingly closely linked

555
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,298
to major language sites.

556
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,800
So that might be one of the reasons
why it makes use of the

557
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,503
and so they make little use of it

558
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,440
despite featuring just as prominently
an ordinary experience.

559
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:22,807
Right?

560
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,477
Sensorium is filled with colors and

561
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,847
and this might be due to the randomness
of occipital visual regions of the brain.

562
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,348
Maybe, maybe not.

563
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,349
And that's one explanation.

564
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,818
Maybe it's wrong,
but it's one possible reason.

565
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,121
So, for instance, one might imagine
some functional, morphing,

566
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,024
encoding brightness
or shade of coloration in language.

567
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:39,924
You can imagine it.

568
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,994
Like if you were to invent
a new language, you could

569
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:46,998
you could encode color features,
some kind of inflection.

570
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,534
But it doesn't seem
to be the case, even though

571
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,437
color is a pretty good enough.

572
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,840
At same time, language seems to make
considerable use of certain quantum

573
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,277
book concepts like intentionality,
but not all this word.

574
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,346
If you're like no morphemes.

575
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,981
Mark how concerned
somebody is about something?

576
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:06,317
I'm very concerned about,
a little bit concerned that

577
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,120
which seems to be making
potentially neurally efficient use

578
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,691
of specific access, easily accessible
representational resources,

579
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:16,227
rather than less easily accessible
cognitive modules.

580
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:20,398
Write to map complex
meaning onto natural expressions.

581
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:24,703
So it's fair to observe that language
acts as an artificial context,

582
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,639
which helps constrain
what representations are recruited

583
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,241
and what impact
they have on reasoning and inference.

584
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,779
So words themselves are highly flexible
and metabolically cheap sources of price

585
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,114
throughout the neural hierarchy.

586
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,849
This is a really cool
idea that I'm going to expand

587
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:39,451
upon.

588
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:40,785
So to give you some

589
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:44,022
more examples of again,
right in this fact the active inference

590
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,293
and take the second ball, second
will go to the left of large box.

591
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,495
That's a pretty simple spatial direction,

592
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,865
but it can only be encoded
with natural language syntax.

593
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,333
You need that kind of

594
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:58,503
we organized infrastructure
to generate that particular thought.

595
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,705
Three simple, very simple direction.

596
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,207
But you can only generate inferences

597
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,744
about it through using the recursive
and or third approaches language.

598
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,247
Similarly, you have structures
like the young, happy, eager,

599
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,683
either going to talk to a Cambridge
pleasant man.

600
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:15,820
This involves unbounded, unstructured
coordination involving disjunction too.

601
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,490
So the distinction is X or Y,

602
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,126
which is a highly complex structure
to compete with a highly complex

603
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,560
conceptual structure.

604
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,163
And yet language users can easily
inherit ferret.

605
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,434
But it also opens the door
for a whole new species of inferences

606
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,168
to be generated.

607
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:31,402
New thoughts about the world,

608
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:34,005
new possible hidden states,
new things that you can think about.

609
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:38,243
And one of the examples, a luxury photo
of the space that it is. And

610
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:40,578
he says,

611
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:45,683
if you take a a pen on a piece of paper,
you can easily draw a man.

612
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,519
You can use it for a zebra.

613
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,022
But it's kind of difficult to draw
the thought that there is not

614
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,690
a zebra next to you right.

615
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,425
So if you try and conceptualize
the thought,

616
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:57,061
there is not a zipper right next to me,
how can you draw?

617
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,864
I need to take the fact
that there is no zebra next to me.

618
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:02,100
That's kind of weird. It's
kind of difficult to do.

619
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,537
I suppose you could draw like a man
and then a zebra and a line

620
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,539
through the zebra,
but that's kind of weird,

621
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,441
but still presupposes
that there's a zebra next to you

622
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:14,913
and so language generates
a whole new species

623
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:18,249
of a new form of thought, basically
generates a new format for thought,

624
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,418
which seems to be unique.

625
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,354
In other words,
not readily translatable into other

626
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,991
domains like visual representations
or so.

627
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,027
These rapid inferences of our properties
and states

628
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,564
in states can be generated
relatively effortlessly by language.

629
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:33,498
And like I said,

630
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,534
no other computational system in human
cognition that it can achieve this.

631
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,203
Well, that's the idea.

632
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:40,271
So a number of

633
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,740
economy principles have been proposed
in theoretical linguistics.

634
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:47,111
These were very powerful, in fact,
very good notions.

635
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,681
So Robyn explained to many of them,
but I will give some examples

636
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,317
and these are open framed.

637
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:55,053
Like in the beginning
they've all been framed exclusively

638
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:58,423
within a linguistic context,
invoking highly domain specific notions,

639
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:02,327
despite a part of the intended
project of modern theoretical acoustics

640
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,897
being to embed linguistic theory within
principles, generative cognition, right?

641
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:07,599
So for example, they inclusive.

642
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,566
This condition maintains

643
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,335
that no new elements can be introduced

644
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,670
in the course
of a particular sense derivation.

645
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,173
So what you want,
you're passing a particular sentence

646
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,876
on your deriving
a particular representation of that.

647
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,677
You aren't
just going to randomly introduce

648
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:23,014
a new lexical item or you know, just,
just for the sake of it,

649
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,650
you're only going to do it if it
contributes to immediate interpretation.

650
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:29,921
And so only existing elements
can be rearranged, restricting available

651
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:30,989
resources.

652
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:33,992
But it's also clear to what
extent this computational principle finds

653
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,127
analogous examples
in non-coercive domains.

654
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:38,596
So one way

655
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:41,499
of motivating these language specific
generalizations

656
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:45,970
by making direct reference to the debate
will not only foster.

657
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,706
I think that we'll create relationships
within that.

658
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:52,477
There is a kind of neurobiology
because those are both the explanatory

659
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:55,380
scope for the existence and prevalence
of particular syntactic phenomena.

660
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:59,150
And but what's interesting to note
is that linguists readily admit

661
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,020
to lacking a specific theory
of computational language.

662
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,390
Like I said at the beginning, it's kind
of a programmer is a programmatic notion.

663
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:08,159
So in a recent paper,
the way when Chomsky points out,

664
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:11,462
be sure we do not have a general theory
of computational efficiency,

665
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,332
but we do have some observations
that are pretty obvious and should be of

666
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:19,170
is basically the same field
that linguists are very well

667
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:22,006
a hundred theories of language specific

668
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,610
efficient efficiency criteria.

669
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,948
But translating that into kind of more
domain general goal areas.

670
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,215
This has not been so successful,

671
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:36,321
but we can at least suppose that
whatever definition will be forthcoming

672
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:40,191
will be related to more generic notions
of the economy, like Hamiltonian notions

673
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:43,227
or minimizing energy expenditure
during language processing.

674
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:47,765
A short description of the minimal
description that reducing complexity

675
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,901
and the degree of associated belief
are facing.

676
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:53,638
Again, like I said in a revised one,
if needed, I'm be

677
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,742
so one of these so-called

678
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,446
minimal computational procedures

679
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,481
is well-advised minimally.

680
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:07,585
So this is the principle that states
that given a particular configuration,

681
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:11,823
it's the
and why a local relation cannot connect X

682
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:16,127
and Y if C intervenes and Z fully matches
the specification

683
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:19,397
of X and Y in terms
of the regular features of his example.

684
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,101
So in other words, if X and Y attempt
to establish a syntactic relation,

685
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,870
if you go if you go back to the long
distance dependency thing I mentioned

686
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,207
and but some element intervenes
and provides,

687
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:32,944
I can also provide a superset
of the features, i.e.

688
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,780
access features plus some of the
features, this box or relation

689
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:37,982
that's sort of extremely abstract.

690
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:41,219
So I do apologize for,
but this is a more concrete example.

691
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,222
So in the sentence
you have a one which game

692
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:49,527
provides a subset of the features
and posted by how

693
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:54,032
which results in unacceptability, but
the equivalent does not obtain in two.

694
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:54,866
And so a relationship

695
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:58,202
between both copies of which game
can obtain licensing interpretation

696
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,873
on the strike through denotes
the originally made position

697
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,741
after after movement has taken place.

698
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,744
So it's originally merged down here
and then you move the structure

699
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,647
to the beginning of the sentence
and to formal question.

700
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:13,051
So question formation often involves
just moving all elements

701
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,020
in the middle of the sentence,
the beginning of more question.

702
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:20,124
And so if you say,
how do you wonder which game to play?

703
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,360
That sounds pretty radical.

704
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,263
But if you say Which game
do you wonder how to play?

705
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,765
Which has the same approximate
interpretation, that's okay.

706
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,701
And the reason why is because that's

707
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,539
how it's only a
Q feature, a question feature.

708
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:39,510
And as it searches down
the structure of encounters, which game,

709
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,747
which game bears a Q feature
because of which

710
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,349
but it also has another feature
that the game

711
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,986
and so therefore it can't reach its
final destination the final destination

712
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,457
being its originally alleged position
after play, which only has a Q feature.

713
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:56,360
On the other hand, if you move
which game to a book, do you want that

714
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,063
and you leave how in situ

715
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,100
then which game carries
these two features here?

716
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,103
It skips over
how because how it does does

717
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,339
not satisfy the full feature
specifications of which game.

718
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:08,906
Right.

719
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:12,210
So it needs to search for it
and then only when it searches

720
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,213
back and reaches to its original position
does it interpret it.

721
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,747
So this means what this means is

722
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,383
when you say which game
do you want the how to play,

723
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,487
you're interpreting
which game at the position of play

724
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,590
because you're not you don't have to have
a condition of wonder.

725
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:29,627
You're not asking,
which game do you wonder how you want?

726
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,130
You're asking which can be
what the how you play.

727
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,832
It's all about the question,
it's about the play.

728
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,703
And so this has been argued to emerge
directly from minimal search,

729
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,038
allowing this high level representation

730
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,641
a principle to make directly
from practice of official reputation.

731
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:47,778
This is one example where you have
a kind of rhetorically kind of gross

732
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,682
higher order principle linguistics

733
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,753
being reduced to a lower level,
a more simple kind of element.

734
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:59,257
So translating into minimal say,
which you cannot even consider,

735
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:03,094
as I just said, when you search
the structure for matching of features

736
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,230
and to the minimal stage procedure,
it would simply skip out

737
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,368
to find the original copy of which game
because it's searching in across

738
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:15,173
the whole structure.

739
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,541
So another example of economy can be

740
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:20,077
found in the principle of deputation,
which simply states

741
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,781
that there are no typical symbols
allowed up to linguistic interfaces.

742
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:27,018
So these indicators are assumed to be the
conceptual and sense for what this is.

743
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,953
So in other words,
the two things you can do

744
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,322
with a linguistic
structure is you can interpret it

745
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:34,358
or you can externalize it,
you can produce it, you can you can say

746
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:39,330
you can sign it, you can go into Braille
and so on, or you can simply pick it.

747
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,832
So this ensures that the system need
not compute.

748
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,434
Symbols are ultimately superfluous

749
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:46,037
to the goals of either interpretation
or externalization.

750
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,973
So for instance, in three,
this has an argument

751
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,176
that does not have a symbolic role,
so therefore it's unacceptable.

752
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:55,980
So you can imagine the sense
what gave Jessica a fine

753
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,783
or the semantic roles of this
agent as a patient.

754
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:02,353
And there's an actual thing about
the particular tool, but uninjured too.

755
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:06,090
So there's an additional kind of location
preposition that they with,

756
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,826
but it doesn't have a semantic role,
so it can't be interpreted.

757
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,861
And that sounds kind of trivial, right?

758
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,096
Like most people when you

759
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,731
when you given these examples,
they say, well, yeah,

760
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,900
obviously
that's kind of not very different.

761
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,101
But actually it's it's a pretty because

762
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:18,869
it demands

763
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:22,173
actually has to be explained somehow.

764
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:25,009
And so one of the operations
that's been involved in this

765
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,713
minimal
computational procedure is called image.

766
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:32,650
So the operation, which simply takes X
and Y and forms a set X, Y,

767
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,253
it just puts two things together.

768
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,189
And this constructs the binary
branching structures that I mentioned.

769
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:41,192
But merge itself
can also derive some core

770
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,861
separately properties
of linguistic relations,

771
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:46,631
such as membership, a dominate time off
and so on.

772
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:50,935
These different hierarchical relations
between nodes and a tree in a11

773
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:54,572
branch retrieving higher
or more deeply embedded, the other one

774
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,442
as well as the other relations C command.

775
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:02,780
We can put that aside and so in brief,
much of the complexity is a syntactic

776
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,250
relations and can be derived
from successive instances of this simple

777
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,151
merge computation,

778
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:08,786
reducing

779
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,056
complex physical to simple invisibles.

780
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,826
So for instance if you the example
I gave here with which game

781
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:20,131
and you can imagine that the set a, B, B

782
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,000
and then if you would take
the same element B

783
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,870
and you match it with the set again,
you get a B

784
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,907
and then you can delete the first
appearance of B and then you simply get

785
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,943
the linear order would be be a broken

786
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:35,613
the actual set being affected by this.

787
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:36,614
And this seems to be

788
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:40,351
what's happening here
where you have a B over here, which again

789
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:45,056
and then A the whole structure
and then B again being originally merged.

790
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:50,194
So all of these kind of superficially
complex linguistic phenomena

791
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,663
which on the surface seem
very complicated, know very elaborate,

792
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,299
they can all be boiled down
to a very simple operation,

793
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,234
which is just to take two
things and put them together

794
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,604
that was thinking about this.

795
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:04,208
Is that related problem like a junction,
do not involve modification

796
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,410
of the semantic content of the structure,
the adjunct.

797
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,447
So an adjunct is something like a, like

798
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:12,683
a prepositional object,
like in the path or to the beach.

799
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,785
And so for instance,
if you take a structure

800
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:19,590
like John and Mary talk in the path,
the fact that they talk in the path

801
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,759
doesn't change
the fact that they talk, right?

802
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:25,363
So the actual original interpretation,
the syntactic structure of the integrity

803
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:29,433
of the meaning of John and Mary talk
is not changed by adding an adjunct.

804
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,902
So you can add an adjunct in the path.

805
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:32,703
But it doesn't change

806
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:37,508
the fact that John Mayer so so again,
that sounds like a very trivial property.

807
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,976
It's obvious, right.

808
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,312
But again, it demands
explanation has to be a reason for

809
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:45,583
and the reason why is it
turns out that when you add an adjunct,

810
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,919
you simply can't you simply minimally
add it to the end.

811
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:53,090
You don't change the actual identity
of the phrase itself, that there's no

812
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:54,225
what's called labeling.

813
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,594
There's no labeling involved
in prepositional mate matching.

814
00:39:56,727 --> 00:40:00,097
So you don't change
identity of the phrase.

815
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:02,967
So everybody who's been acquainted
with the principle of least effort

816
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,703
and its process theory is a reference.

817
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,106
So strictly speaking, the be basically
is a computational principle, right

818
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:10,775
the probabilistic beliefs.

819
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,910
It's concerned with objects, absolutely.

820
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,179
Namely external states
of a self-organizing system.

821
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:18,783
And in a similar way
that identity as a researcher is that.

822
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:19,884
So there is much more recent

823
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:22,453
theoretic linguistics
guided by programmatic concerns. Right?

824
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,022
Like I said, it's a program.
It's an ongoing kind of ideology.

825
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,659
On how linguists
develop theories of syntactic leaks that,

826
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:32,596
like I said, that process
theory is a little bit less clear, right?

827
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,265
How it's actually implemented?

828
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:38,169
It's slightly less clear than
what I would argue may become more clear

829
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,537
if it can be accommodated

830
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:43,974
within existing frameworks and knowledge
that it can bring with it.

831
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:48,446
To help solve the puzzle of how languages
are implemented in the brain.

832
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,949
So here's another example for you

833
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,218
routinely poems that run evaporate.

834
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:58,823
So in this instance,
routinely exclusively modifies evaporate.

835
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,691
So the word routinely goes
would evaporate.

836
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:01,892
That's how they reject it.

837
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:05,563
So it cannot modify rain,
even though this word it's closer in

838
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:09,967
terms of linear distance to routinely run
the rhyme comes 1 to 3 words

839
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,071
after evaporate comes one, two,
three, four in terms of linear distance.

840
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,674
So the more, the more many we remove.

841
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,443
And yet in terms of interpretation,
they go together.

842
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:22,279
And the reason is
and the matrix predicate

843
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:25,816
evaporate is closer in terms
of structural distance to retaining.

844
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:30,721
And the reason why is that
rhyme is embedded within the phrase

845
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:31,922
headed by poems.

846
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:35,392
So it has its on it exists on a different
hierarchical planet, if you like.

847
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:38,929
It's kind of lower
down in the hierarchy and evaporate. And

848
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,298
so it language computes

849
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,434
over structural distance
and not linear, just

850
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:49,073
so sensors are not simply beads
on a string and not linear objects

851
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,510
and they have to be linear
objects in terms of sensory

852
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,012
motor externalization,
because we live in the universe

853
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,214
we live in and we can't
we can't speak in parallel.

854
00:41:57,214 --> 00:42:00,150
We can only speak in a linear

855
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,287
transition, although there is
some evidence that assigned languages

856
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:04,455
can communicate.

857
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:09,360
So to some degree in Peru, by using one
element with one hand and number of

858
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,296
so there's some evidence
of sign language, you might be able to

859
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,734
defy the laws of physics, but
it turns out that's probably exaggerated.

860
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,770
So it is still a form of winterization.

861
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,907
But just how cold in translation notes

862
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,410
the language prioritizes
the demands of the syntax, semantics

863
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,481
and debates over other subsystems
like Morpho phonology.

864
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:33,017
So while two structures
might exhibit different linear orders,

865
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,519
they may exhibit
the same underlying hierarchies.

866
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:39,023
So here's a really good example
in English and Basque, the direct

867
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:42,092
object dependencies are the opposite
to the interpretation of concept.

868
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,062
So John have read the book.

869
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,065
You have John
that actually delivered an object

870
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,668
and in Basque you have a different order.

871
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,971
You have John bendable,
then the verb and then the auxiliary,

872
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,773
and yet they mean the same thing.

873
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,474
They have the same interpretation, right?

874
00:42:57,474 --> 00:42:59,343
So this suggests that

875
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,379
a kind of more fundamental operations
going on here,

876
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:05,382
namely syntax, encodes
the verb under an object

877
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,485
as an abstract phrase
which omits the subject.

878
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:11,455
So the words in the syntax
in English, on Basque,

879
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:15,225
you have the same underlying syntax
which is subject and then verb indirect

880
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:18,228
object being merged with the image,
that being the first.

881
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,097
And then you accommodate this object.

882
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,266
And then when you look in your eyes
that when you

883
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,304
communicate it in the darling
and you do in different ways

884
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:30,307
in English, you do it
one way, Ambassador, another way.

885
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,076
But the basic idea is the same.

886
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,044
You have the same
underlying interpretation

887
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:36,213
that also accounts for something
pretty obvious, namely

888
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:38,916
the fact that you can translate
one sentence into one whole language.

889
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:39,350
Right.

890
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,152
That's that's that's a fairly
obvious thing that you can do about which

891
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,022
and so therefore there has to be
some kind of commonality somehow.

892
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:48,692
But the commonalities
might be much more deeper down than that.

893
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:51,862
Most people appreciate.

894
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:54,331
So through the various stages of language
development as well,

895
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:57,935
it doesn't children don't typically
produce expressions that deviate

896
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,904
from general grammatical principles
pertaining to the structure.

897
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,907
Dependance of a rules, even when they
produce so-called mistakes.

898
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:07,544
So there's been a lot of research
on child language development.

899
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:09,313
So in other

900
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,483
words, when children do make mistakes,
they seem to make mistakes

901
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:16,286
which accord with the practical rules
of that language, which suggests

902
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:21,659
that sensitivity to structure
dependance forms a core part of language.

903
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,561
So corpus studies of infant language
exposure revealed that they are actually

904
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:29,133
very few diagrams of programs,
so statistical procedures can help.

905
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,269
But there seems to be more kind
of sensitivity to structure

906
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:35,606
dependance which seems necessary.

907
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:38,042
And as a recent paper
also reviews, human learners

908
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:41,078
prefer to induce hypotheses
that have a shorter description

909
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:45,182
and the logic with simplicity preferences
possibly being a governing

910
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:48,852
principle of systems
all in accord with what

911
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,255
the FP would would predict.

912
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,258
So simplicity based preferences

913
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:57,394
and a range of formal language models
to really think that the notion

914
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:58,328
of minimal description that

915
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:00,364
you might also

916
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,433
invoke
the principles of minimum redundancy.

917
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,769
So this is kind of
a really important idea that

918
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:09,440
that minimal computational efficiency
seems to be a really general

919
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:10,741
cognitive goal of the brain.

920
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,143
And there's a couple of recent papers,
one of them in Tex, I think

921
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,647
maybe you already this year

922
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:20,050
and I think was called
memory is a computational resource

923
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:23,587
which showed that across
a bunch of domains, human memory

924
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:28,058
in its various guises also exhibits
utterance, principles of efficiency.

925
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:32,162
So I think not very surprising
to where linguists come along and say,

926
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,832
you know, language also adheres
to principles of official computation.

927
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,769
So all of these ideas
seem to be out there at the moment

928
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:42,039
and everyone's kind of coming to more
or less the same conclusions.

929
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,841
But it's just using different language.

930
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,609
It's using different
background assumptions.

931
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:49,546
But the general idea, I think, is
kind of they all mesh well together.

932
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:51,949
So as I said,

933
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:52,816
linguistic computation

934
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:55,686
seems to be optimized for the generation
of interpretable structures

935
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,322
rather than for the generation
of maximally communicative

936
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:01,024
messages, possibilities, in other words.

937
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,360
And whenever there's a conflict
between principles

938
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,662
of computational efficiency
on the one hand

939
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:09,333
and principles of communicative clarity
on the other the former typically wins.

940
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:10,534
Now, this is not to say that

941
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,770
when we do communicate with each other,
as with by personal

942
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,973
data, it's not going efficiently.

943
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,144
When we do communicate with you, do it
in a way that's a separate question from

944
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:24,381
the language system is designed in a way
as to maximize that communication.

945
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:27,951
So the normal functioning of syntax
seems to lead to instances which reduce

946
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:31,622
reactive efficiency
and prioritize inference generation

947
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:34,992
so that so the goal of the language
system is to generate

948
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:37,728
particular inferences
and representations about the environment

949
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:38,862
in an efficient way.

950
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:41,165
So here's a pretty clear
example of this, right?

951
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:44,301
If you take the sentence,
you persuaded Saul to sell his car,

952
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:47,604
the individual
and the object can both be questioned

953
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,440
for questioning
the more deeply embedded object

954
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,442
in terms of the hierarchical structure

955
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:55,045
for the Speaker
to produce a more complex circumlocution

956
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,715
so you can say, who did you persuade
to sell what?

957
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,050
What you can't say?

958
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:03,487
What did you persuade him to sell, even
though they mean the same thing, right?

959
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,455
Same words, interpretation.

960
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:06,957
All that means is, you know,

961
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:09,092
what is the individual
and what's the object?

962
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:09,693
That's it.

963
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:09,893
Just.

964
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:12,963
Just tell me who
then who the individual is.

965
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:15,365
But you can only say it
if you constructed

966
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,836
in the most computationally efficient
way, i.e.

967
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:21,171
search for the first possible element
to question.

968
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:22,072
Right.

969
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:25,876
If you search for the more
deeply embedded object, can't do it.

970
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:28,879
And so the structures in 11 involve
the same words interpretations.

971
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,682
Yet the more competition, costly process
can't be complex.

972
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:33,750
So this is a pretty good example
and there's plenty of examples

973
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,787
like this about it in the paper,
but it involves plenty of examples

974
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:40,057
in which there is a clear conflict
between syntactic

975
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,293
priorities
of just generating a meaningful structure

976
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:47,497
and generating the possible structures
that would actually aid

977
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:50,033
communicative efficiency
and communicative flexibility.

978
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:51,835
That's not part of language.

979
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,172
So the example
show that the acceptability of sentences

980
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:58,375
can be impacted based on the extent
to which the construction makes sense.

981
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,911
It contributes to a novel non redundant

982
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:04,014
contribution
to one's mental models beliefs.

983
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,950
Again, this is really directly in accord
with what I would predict

984
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,286
rather than those specifics.

985
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,120
Again, reinforcing

986
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,923
the role of syntactic processing
in infancy generation provocation.

987
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:17,995
So the degraded acceptability in 12
be that by the way, the reason why

988
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:21,765
these are number 1213 is because
that's enumeration in the in the paper.

989
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:25,235
So the reason why 12 B seems degraded.

990
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,403
Well, eight

991
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,170
seems to stem from

992
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:30,340
the fact that the speakers are unlikely
to be ignorant of the relevant content.

993
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,477
It's kind of a pragmatic reason
the kimonos are the source,

994
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:36,146
and that sounds okay.
But Kim knows what I remember.

995
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:39,583
It sounds kind of weird, even though it's
a kind of a grammatical sentence.

996
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:42,486
It sounds
weird because you would never say

997
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:45,622
it does contribute
meaningfully to just revising or

998
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:48,392
contributing to one's mental models
or beliefs about the world.

999
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:51,828
So therefore the language system
doesn't like it, which again

1000
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:56,466
brings in closer contact language design
with the epithet and also cases

1001
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:59,703
which are 13 real
how even processes such as contraction

1002
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,373
of sensitive to hierarchical structure
and can't be executed

1003
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:05,575
over and over and any random web.

1004
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,845
So you can say
source code of the chemists,

1005
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:11,281
but you can't say source the likens.

1006
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,784
And the reason is
because there's a visible phrase

1007
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,320
back in between those two elements.

1008
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,255
Other examples I wrote that

1009
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:21,191
there are in 14 and 15 you can say,

1010
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:24,695
what do you want to do and contract
and say what you want to do.

1011
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,497
But if you say,
Who do you want to read the book

1012
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:30,467
and you can't contract back to generate
if you want to read the book.

1013
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,769
That sounds a bit weird,
but you certainly can counsel it

1014
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,105
and if you saw that to me,
I would know what you mean.

1015
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:39,543
I know Gateway is no problem,
but it sounds a bit more awkward.

1016
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,814
Again, the idea is that this invisible
phrase view that commits, that starts

1017
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,182
contraction and I can

1018
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:49,119
appreciate
computation or at least structure.

1019
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:49,720
Dependance,

1020
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,857
I should say, is also exhibited in more
classical examples in the literature.

1021
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:58,195
So if you say the mind is happy,
you can question that structure

1022
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:02,199
by moving the engineering to the front
and saying, Is the mind happy?

1023
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:06,069
And so you might be forced to conclude,
well, maybe the question you simply say

1024
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:06,870
is the structure.

1025
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,673
I'll take the first possible element,

1026
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:12,676
but that turns out not to be sufficient.

1027
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,979
So you can say the man who is
tall is happy, but you can't say is

1028
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:20,684
the man who told is happy because who is
tall is again similar to problems.

1029
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:24,654
That rhyme
routinely is embedded in the mind.

1030
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:28,792
And this phrase is the question is happy,

1031
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:31,161
which is higher up
the hierarchy and is essential.

1032
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,231
So therefore you have to say,
is the man who is tall happy

1033
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:37,501
because is is actually closer
to the element you're questioning

1034
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,837
in terms of structural distance
than the is in his thought.

1035
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:44,708
So again syntax cares about structure
what kind of thing and I'm not

1036
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,542
linear proximity

1037
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:48,645
and there
are also constraints on this as well.

1038
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:51,314
And so you can say giant chicken
and bread for lunch

1039
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,818
and and you can question the whole phrase

1040
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:57,387
of chicken and bread and you can say
what the journey for lunch.

1041
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,123
But if you want to efficiently question

1042
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,693
one element, that's
why you already knew that giant chicken.

1043
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,564
But you're not sure what else you can't
say what the Johnny Chicken Uncle lunch,

1044
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,333
which there's no reason why
it can't do that. Right?

1045
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,635
Why can't you say that?

1046
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:14,071
If I thought
and you already know why a chicken.

1047
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,673
You know, someone just told you rate
chicken. It's something else.

1048
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:19,443
And what you can't say
what the giant chicken for lunch

1049
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:23,180
is the whole syntax respects the
integrity of the phrase chicken and bread

1050
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:28,151
is it's a has a phrasal identity that
syntax respects and you can't find it.

1051
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:28,752
You can't just

1052
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,353
by the

1053
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:34,191
phrase boundary and only interrogate
while

1054
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:36,126
other examples
really across phrase phrase

1055
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:38,395
boundaries of conflict boundaries
not just within them.

1056
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:41,198
So you can say Sam gave a guitar to me
and loaned a trumpet to you

1057
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:42,833
and you can question both elements.

1058
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,168
You can say,
what did some give to me along to you?

1059
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,938
But you can't say what that sound
give to me alone, the trumpet to you,

1060
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,941
even though again,
in terms of communicative efficiency,

1061
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:52,709
that's a pretty simple structure
to generate.

1062
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,778
You already know that he alone
the trumpet to you.

1063
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:59,649
You want to figure out
what Sam gave to me right?

1064
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:03,820
And again, these relations of hierarchy,
you can find them all over place.

1065
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:07,858
So pronoun
reference is a pretty good example.

1066
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,428
You can say Mary said
that he has a lot of talent, I'm afraid

1067
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:14,965
if you go far, in which case the pronoun
he is being connected with Peter,

1068
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,701
in which case you have

1069
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:21,271
a permanent he coming before Peter,

1070
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,708
you simply take my best phrase
and question it.

1071
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,477
I'd say that it's no longer accessible.

1072
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,347
You can't say he has walked out on Peter
should go far.

1073
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,381
That sounds a bit strange.

1074
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:33,984
He should refer to someone like John.

1075
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,087
And the reason
why is because when you embed structure

1076
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:40,624
in one, a large structure, it changes
the actual identity of the conduit

1077
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:44,761
for the conduit that and headed by
that is a compromise phrase,

1078
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:48,131
whereas the conduit is headed by
he and Peter are simply temporary

1079
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:52,002
and other puzzles exist here as well.

1080
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,572
So you can say John, you can say
John said he has part of his house,

1081
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:57,841
in which case he goes with John.

1082
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,310
But it sounds weird to say in
John's house he organized the meeting

1083
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,681
and when he refers John again,
you can kind of pass it,

1084
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,483
you can force it,
but it sounds a bit more awkward.

1085
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:08,685
It's more natural for to refer to Peter.

1086
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,821
If you say in John's house, you know
someone else that organized a meeting.

1087
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:15,592
And the reason why is because code
reference via this phenomenal phrase,

1088
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:18,862
one is but since syntax preserves
interpretation across movement.

1089
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:22,132
So the original structure
that's generated is a John said

1090
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:25,869
he's in John's house
he's organizing a meeting

1091
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:30,240
and that's that's generated
from a more original structure

1092
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:33,843
he organized meetings hilltops
in which case you have a he

1093
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,212
coming before John

1094
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,581
in the same kind of temporary structure
that I mentioned earlier.

1095
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:41,284
So in other words, syntax
seems to win over linear precedents

1096
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,688
and other kind of quick examples
like this, too.

1097
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:47,791
So you can say I for the book
that Sarah always wanted to say,

1098
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,459
I gave her the book that Sarah wanted.

1099
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,695
But again, that sounds slightly strange,

1100
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,930
changing the syntax
by adding the overview element.

1101
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:57,601
Change the actual content of the magic
phrase itself,

1102
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:01,504
which allows more easier reference.

1103
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:05,475
So and stepping back a little bit, this,
this whole framework of like merging

1104
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:07,143
of generating hierarchical structures

1105
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:10,880
has been argued in the literature
to kind of boil down from a

1106
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:14,551
domain general lower
level computational procedure.

1107
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:17,654
So some people call it
the universal generative faculty,

1108
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:18,822
which is just the ability

1109
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:22,525
to construct hierarchical structures,
a map of the different interfaces.

1110
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:24,894
So the idea is that

1111
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:27,897
when we have our system of moral judgment
promotion,

1112
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:31,067
which involves agents, patients
and so on, that's there requires

1113
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:33,903
some kind of combinatorial apparatus
to generate those judgments.

1114
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,439
Then with music is the nonsense
the seventies

1115
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:40,210
that musical structures
have a kind of prior operation to the

1116
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,780
and then also with numeracy with numbers.

1117
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,949
You can imagine
that it's been hypothesized by Chomsky

1118
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:47,684
that if you restrict this operation

1119
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:50,520
image to a single element
and simply reapply,

1120
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,622
you can kind of generate
the natural numbers, right?

1121
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,391
So you can kind of from the outset

1122
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:57,193
and then imagine it with itself
and imagine it with the object and so on.

1123
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,530
And you can call it zero and course
the next one

1124
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,533
one goes on for that too,
but gives them natural numbers.

1125
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,002
But the general idea is that
you have an underlying

1126
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:10,173
generative faculty,
an interface with different subsystems.

1127
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:12,676
So in interfaces
but with sound system, you get music

1128
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:16,413
when it interfaces with whatever morality
is, theory of mind structures

1129
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:20,183
or just information for whatever
you get, moral judgments.

1130
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,453
When it interfaces with the system
of quantification and numeracy,

1131
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:26,790
you get the natural numbers and then what
it interfaces with the lexicon,

1132
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:27,590
whatever that is.

1133
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:32,329
Even more mysteriously, you get language,
which is actually what I'm saying

1134
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,198
right here.
So huge amount of sound music.

1135
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:39,135
And interestingly, only language
seems to attribute

1136
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:41,871
to these merged elements
an independent identity.

1137
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:45,709
So with quantification,
music and morality,

1138
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:48,745
you simply involve
a generation of a chunk.

1139
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,547
So kind of talking about tapping

1140
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:52,982
what we call natural language,
you seem to get an additional operation,

1141
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,252
you know, for some things you chunk them
and then you give it

1142
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:59,622
an additional identity
or you give it a kind of at the end,

1143
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:03,093
the sum is greater than the parts,
I guess, that way.

1144
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:06,696
So what's anything is
that you can use that merge

1145
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:10,133
structure to then call it again,
but we can treat it

1146
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:13,436
as an independent object
independent of its constituent parts.

1147
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,773
But you can't you don't really seem to be
able to do that in musical language.

1148
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,508
Sorry, anonymous domains.

1149
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:22,679
So is also a recent paper

1150
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:26,616
by standing who argues that this capacity
to generate nested tree

1151
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:30,153
structures is a human specific
kind of a species property.

1152
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:30,553
Right.

1153
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:35,358
And it gives a bunch of different
and more powerful instantiation of this.

1154
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:38,428
But it was clear that you know,
only humans have language

1155
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,998
along one side that you got.

1156
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:42,565
I'm interested

1157
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:46,803
in a unique level of complexity,
possibly due to this linguistic question.

1158
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:50,874
So for instance, spheres are constructed
from a rock and a shop.

1159
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,343
But it's not just a sphere, it's
not just a rock was a shape.

1160
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,478
A sphere is a rock was a shot

1161
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:59,115
with an additional obstruction,
the functional use of IT utility.

1162
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,850
I'm going to come back to that
in a minute.

1163
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:05,155
But that language seems to be uniquely
concerned with functional abstractions

1164
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:10,193
like use not just for.

1165
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:11,561
And then on top of that,

1166
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:14,831
it seems that only humans have what
Chomsky has loosely called the science,

1167
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:18,768
but more importantly, so only humans
or scientists, not surprisingly.

1168
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,905
And we can do things
like painting a picture or knowledge

1169
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:26,443
of this complex sentence generation
where you get some weird event echoes.

1170
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,312
But then we posit that if A is true,

1171
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:32,882
and then we would simply say, Well,
I'm actually right, so it should be.

1172
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,919
And then of course, on top of that,
we have the example

1173
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:37,320
I mentioned Theory of Mind Box.

1174
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,556
If I recall,
and I know that you know that, you know,

1175
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:44,627
so there's all these kinds of weird human
specific cognitive traits, all of which

1176
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:49,265
can potentially maybe be boiled down to
or connected to some linguistic capacity.

1177
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,268
So here's a good example
about the hangings.

1178
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:55,472
And these are five different types
of sequence sequences

1179
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:59,509
that you can generate only human
being seen capable of generating fittest.

1180
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,711
Just as I've argued here

1181
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:05,081
and in the paper, we generate
tree structures, not just randomly.

1182
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,850
We don't just do it
because we feel like it.

1183
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,051
We do it efficiently

1184
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:12,222
and in the end for the explicit purpose
of active inference federation.

1185
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:17,627
So transition and timing, chunking or no
knowledge, algebraic patterns.

1186
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:22,265
These are all nonhuman capacities
to the bonobos, macaques, batons.

1187
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:24,033
They all exhibit these forms of things.

1188
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:26,569
It's only humans that can do
option number five.

1189
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:28,004
The next iteration of business.

1190
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:30,840
So again, this is this

1191
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:35,512
idea that when you merge car factory,
you don't just manage to write, right?

1192
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,181
Car factory,
you're actually create a noun phrase,

1193
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:40,383
a structure
that's bigger than the two parts.

1194
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:43,720
In a way the factory is not operates
and cars are not a phrase.

1195
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,989
You need both of them
to create and operate.

1196
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:49,325
And then you can use that
and operate as an independent unit and

1197
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,296
with its own kind
of computational identity.

1198
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,066
So this leads to a kind of a more

1199
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:59,636
important question, I think,
which is what is language, right.

1200
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,237
We're all human beings have language.

1201
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,540
We all have very strong opinions
about what languages

1202
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,276
and but consider the fact that geometry
was originally

1203
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,878
the study of language
right back in back in the day.

1204
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:10,146
And what developed

1205
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:13,516
a sufficiently rich body of knowledge
to abstract away from original its

1206
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:17,053
original object of inquiry and the part
that also from common sense intuition.

1207
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,357
So our common sense intuitions about what
languages actually have no place inside

1208
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:25,929
data for common sense notions of physics.

1209
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:29,866
So at MIT, Professor Andrew Petrenko
recently conducted a Mechanical Turk

1210
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:34,470
survey yesterday asking ordinary people
what they thought languages primary

1211
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:38,942
function was, and now most of them said
communication in line with common sense.

1212
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:42,679
And you use this
this data to create science.

1213
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,414
The idea from

1214
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:48,651
linguistics that language isn't
basically an instrument

1215
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:52,288
for its primary purpose
is to contribute to conceptualization.

1216
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,792
And what a physicist
obviously wouldn't conduct a

1217
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:59,862
to survey randomly asking people
what they thought the nature of life is

1218
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:01,831
a wouldn't concern themselves

1219
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:03,900
with people's intuitions
about how parts of the way

1220
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:07,170
and and so on that the language syntax
I think should be investigated

1221
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,539
using the same standards
of scientific inquiry

1222
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,574
as any other object in the organic world.

1223
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:15,445
There's no reason why people's intuitions
about language should be needed, right?

1224
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:17,080
In fact,
if that were the case, would just

1225
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,414
there's
no need for linguistic department.

1226
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:20,683
So let's just ask
what around the people on the street?

1227
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:24,187
Let's that's what we do.

1228
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:27,690
So on top of syntactic phrase generation
and we can also frame this

1229
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,760
as contributing to policies
used for particular

1230
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:35,098
strategy, minimizing actions, and
not just generating linguistic objects.

1231
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,468
So the rapid and reflexive identification
of objects,

1232
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:41,904
states and events in the next hour,
well, through simple linguistic means,

1233
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:46,142
a new complex lexical interpretations,
but some of the most common non

1234
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:50,580
non all the fancy word nouns
aiding in the successful generation

1235
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:54,250
of internal models of the environment,
using a limited number of resources.

1236
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:57,353
And so objects in the world
have to be identified

1237
01:00:57,453 --> 01:00:59,656
and they have to be identified matter
immediately.

1238
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:00,289
Right.

1239
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:03,960
In order to be successful in navigating
the world, you have to understand things

1240
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,263
straightaway and rapidly identify things.

1241
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:10,033
That's kind of obvious,
but at least it's not puzzle.

1242
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:13,970
So for instance, complex forms of
what's called colostomy plus to me

1243
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,072
just means aware, having multiple senses

1244
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:19,976
and complex meals, which turns out to be
much more widespread than most people,

1245
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:20,576
because

1246
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:22,645
almost

1247
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:25,415
half the ways radio hosts

1248
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:27,950
and complex forms of almost

1249
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:32,188
6% of complex forms of question,
we generate that we're way constructions

1250
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:35,692
allow for more precise and exact
localization in conceptual space

1251
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:40,263
than discrete symbols and gestures
with natural language syntax, allowing

1252
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:43,633
the generation of a more accurate
unveiling of contextual.

1253
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,636
So natural language
syntax allows us to more

1254
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:49,906
accurately position
ourselves in conceptual state space.

1255
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:50,373
Right?

1256
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:53,076
Again, I gave the example of a second
blue box to the left.

1257
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:54,677
Here's an example for you.

1258
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,713
You can say
in the poorly written newspaper

1259
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,415
that I held this morning
has been sued by the government.

1260
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:02,552
That's a perfectly fine sentence,
but it's referring to three

1261
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,054
different senses of a simple
we're like newspaper,

1262
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:08,391
so a newspaper can simultaneously
be a piece of information,

1263
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:11,761
it can be a physical object,
it can be an abstract organization.

1264
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:14,230
And we can also call upon
all of the senses at once.

1265
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:18,468
And yet notice that this sentence cannot
possibly refer to anything in the world.

1266
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:20,136
There's

1267
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,638
nothing this is not a kind of thing
that causes us to explore

1268
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:25,608
something that's poorly written,
something that you hold.

1269
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:26,943
So we're not going to be sued.

1270
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:29,112
It's not a coherent entity.

1271
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:31,681
And yet the language allows.

1272
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:35,251
Simple question is with one single
lexical item to generate

1273
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:38,921
a very rich range of perspectives
to interpret experience,

1274
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,358
which is exactly what you would expect
from the activity framework.

1275
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,462
And so it seems that can't possibly be
any object in the external world.

1276
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:49,732
A complex question
square like newspaper can index a 1 to 1

1277
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:53,136
mapping with the framework
we are developing here.

1278
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:56,973
Next, what items could possibly
be seen as hypotheses about the structure

1279
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:58,908
of likely co-occurring sensory input?

1280
01:02:58,908 --> 01:02:59,942
Right.

1281
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,811
Well, hypotheses about ontological

1282
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:04,547
and maybe logical relations
between objects and states in the world.

1283
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:08,284
So in a where it is not simply something
that has a conceptual meaning,

1284
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:13,689
where it's not simply response in a way,
it is basically a hypothesis about what

1285
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:17,493
the world is, what we can interpret
experience to be at any given moment.

1286
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,862
And we basically test the hypothesis.

1287
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:23,800
So we use the word newspaper as a
hypothesis about what's going on inside.

1288
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,568
And maybe it fails.

1289
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:26,836
Maybe it succeeds.

1290
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:27,804
It depends on the context.

1291
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,138
It depends on the state of mind

1292
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,841
and also depends on our interests
and our contents.

1293
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,910
I'll give some more examples.

1294
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,545
And second, just to illustrate that.

1295
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:38,714
So a recent paper by Parker

1296
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:42,785
sums up a held by the makers of the Times
2020 and a paper in Frontiers.

1297
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:46,489
They note that
from the perspective of inference, things

1298
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:51,060
only exist as a label or hypothesis
or inference about hidden state.

1299
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:54,330
So the contention
that I'm kind of presenting here

1300
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,500
is that forms of complex meaning derive
from natural language semantics.

1301
01:03:57,767 --> 01:04:01,137
But a core component of this labeling
mechanism and active inference.

1302
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:04,106
So linguists
like to talk about lexical items,

1303
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,475
well spoke, table walk and so on.

1304
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:07,076
These are basically

1305
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:10,880
just hypotheses composed from distinct
knowledge systems in the mind.

1306
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:14,317
So our sense of geometry, our sense
of place, our sense of social relations,

1307
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:17,653
which can elucidate
environmental regularities essential

1308
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:20,022
to active inference.

1309
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:21,524
So here's some more examples.

1310
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:24,527
And again, I like to look at
the make us believe in both.

1311
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:28,331
And let's take the notion of vagueness.

1312
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:29,632
So I was once an infant,

1313
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,236
but I'm
no longer an infant, but I'm still me.

1314
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:37,073
But on the boundary between infancy
and childhood and child and adults

1315
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:41,310
and there are legal terms for that, but
that's kind of a just arbitrary choice.

1316
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:44,213
The actual concept of infancy
is an arbitrary boundary

1317
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:46,015
rule.

1318
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:49,151
Some philosophers do actually think
that there is a specific nanosecond

1319
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:51,621
which transitions
you from infancy to child.

1320
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:55,992
But no, I think that's sort of
like I think applying fixed

1321
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:02,265
by notions like that to intentionally
an inherently vague notion like infancy.

1322
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:03,132
It's kind of a paradox.

1323
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:05,301
It's meaningless infancy, just infancy.

1324
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:08,971
It's not meant to be a precise boundary
unless you're a legal scholar,

1325
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:12,341
in which case you can find
legal, legal boundaries between things.

1326
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,076
But that's kind of irrelevant to science.

1327
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:16,879
So consider someone like infancy.

1328
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:18,981
You also have things like pile theory.

1329
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:23,219
Say there's a pile of sand
and you keep taking bits of sand off.

1330
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:26,322
At what point
how many grains of sand are sufficient?

1331
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:27,890
But to make a pile right?

1332
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:30,026
That's got the Southeast paradox.

1333
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:34,430
And the notion of the vague notion of
pile is great for active inference.

1334
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:37,199
It's great for generating
rapid inferences and assessments.

1335
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,202
Well, you know, it's dangerous
to interrogate that sufficiently.

1336
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:41,971
The system becomes exposed,

1337
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:43,539
the system's flaws become exposed once

1338
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:46,075
you're actually subjected
to all that much scrutiny.

1339
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:50,913
And then saying things like,
Am I can you go into a library on this,

1340
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:55,051
let's say a thousand physical books,
but there's only 800

1341
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:57,720
kind of actual abstract
books in the sense that, you know,

1342
01:05:57,753 --> 01:05:59,889
every library
has multiple copies of different books.

1343
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:04,860
So the life will have ten copies of the
Bible, ten copies of the Koran and so on.

1344
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,830
Let's say John goes into the library

1345
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:11,534
and he reads every book in the library
and then leaves the library

1346
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,036
up and all the books are rubbish.

1347
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:15,805
So we just assess the science about it.

1348
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,807
Now in that case

1349
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:18,908
you can say John burned

1350
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:22,411
every book in the library or John read
and then every book in the library,

1351
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:25,581
in which case he banned more books
and he read right?

1352
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:29,585
He actually banned a thousand books,
but he only reads 800 books.

1353
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:34,190
So the phrase every book does
not pick out a fixed quantity.

1354
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:38,461
There's nothing in the external world
that actually exhibits a 1 to 1 relation.

1355
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:40,763
In terms of quantification,
it could be 800, it could be a thousand.

1356
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,431
It depends on my perspective.

1357
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,100
And that's the crucial thing
about even simple words

1358
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,136
like, look, they generate these
very rich, poor little perspectives

1359
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:50,373
that you can use to whatever experience
will have no necessary component to the

1360
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:51,640
idea.

1361
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:53,743
For example, in something like a city.

1362
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:56,212
So you can say London burned down
and was rebuilt

1363
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:59,448
50 miles at the Thames
and London can still be London,

1364
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:01,150
even though it's physically
completely changed.

1365
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,551
It's in a different location.

1366
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:05,254
While the woman has a debt and so on.

1367
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:07,023
London is a very complex place

1368
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:12,094
in a sense that you can decompose
into organization, sense, location, sense

1369
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:16,032
and population centers or government
institution and with a single word.

1370
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,300
London
does not refer to anything in the world.

1371
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,502
So in a wasteland

1372
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:22,905
there's no such thing as London,
but just a kind of convenience.

1373
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:26,042
It's a convenient abstraction
that we use to interpret experience.

1374
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:30,312
And but there's nothing there's nothing
in the world where London refers to.

1375
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:30,780
Right?

1376
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:34,183
So here you can use the word London
to refer, but that's an action.

1377
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:37,253
It's an act of human will to actively do
that and choose to do that.

1378
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,487
There's a choice.

1379
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:39,221
It's an action.

1380
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,524
Again,
one of the code of active inference.

1381
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:43,759
You can choose to voluntarily
and willfully refer

1382
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:47,129
to one specific component
of your representation of a city

1383
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,031
to refer to something
in the external world.

1384
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:51,434
Well, that's a context by context case.

1385
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,669
The idea that London invariably refers

1386
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:57,740
to a particular
structure is just not not just not true.

1387
01:07:59,175 --> 01:07:59,842
So by

1388
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:03,779
permitting a more refined,
accurate positioning in conceptual space,

1389
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:07,483
natural language, syntax, AIDS
agents in the formation of policies

1390
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:10,419
to navigate and make inferences
about the environment,

1391
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:14,790
the cognition is an ongoing process
of dynamic interaction

1392
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,992
between an organism and its environmental
niche.

1393
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:21,630
Yet notions like event
are also not predefined external entities

1394
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:24,633
but actively generated
and populate the body language system.

1395
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,636
And so again,
events are not things in the world

1396
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:30,539
and events are things
that the mind constructs

1397
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:34,844
so that consider
also that simple lexical items

1398
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:37,913
like setting up properties that go way
beyond the semantic complexity

1399
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:40,015
of the atomic representations.

1400
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:42,618
So you can say the large school
with windows

1401
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:45,988
next to the river starts at Nottingham
and has a strict headmaster.

1402
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,823
I want to remove students

1403
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:50,126
so there's nothing in the aftermath
of the world that could possibly

1404
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:53,295
be a location, an artifact event,
a social group

1405
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:57,066
are surely not absolute,
not that that's not an ontology.

1406
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:59,235
And also using these kinds of sentences,

1407
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,403
surely it isn't committed to the belief
that there are such things.

1408
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:01,971
The world.

1409
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:04,440
It's a convenient abstraction,
it's a fiction.

1410
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:06,509
It's basically
a fiction and useful fiction

1411
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,478
that is used in the service of inference.

1412
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:10,646
And this is a very good job.

1413
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,515
It's very successful.

1414
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:15,551
And the fact that it's so successful
is evidenced by the fact

1415
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:19,822
that philosophers have only just begun
to really investigate this phenomenon,

1416
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:20,589
this this phenomenon.

1417
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:23,392
So explicit
and has taken centuries of inquiry.

1418
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:27,163
It's actually realized
that some of our most basic common models

1419
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:32,168
do not have reference the things
of the world that just convenient.

1420
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,335
So taking up a sentence,

1421
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:36,872
the average man is concerned about wage
cuts because he means before insurance

1422
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,975
does language committed to the belief
that the world is made of things

1423
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:42,711
like average men and wage cuts
and relations of concern.

1424
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:46,649
That's not surely not something
that we're committed to at London

1425
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:47,783
can be, as I said, limited.

1426
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:49,952
We want to believe
it's the man down below.

1427
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:51,387
We will ten miles up the river.

1428
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,289
And so we've got London.

1429
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:55,891
So these nested piece,
which as I mentioned earlier, are widely

1430
01:09:55,891 --> 01:10:00,596
considered to be abstract or even simple,
which exhibit considerable abstraction.

1431
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:04,533
So in other words,
that the people I've written refers to

1432
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:07,403
and Holmes focuses on nested structures.

1433
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,573
And it is also worth pointing out,
but even simple words

1434
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:13,943
themselves exhibit
a considerable degree of abstraction.

1435
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:16,779
I'm perhaps just as relevant here

1436
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:21,383
as with this invitation to consider
applied physicists in physics.

1437
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:21,750
Right?

1438
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:24,353
It's a kind of hypothetical,
complete scenario.

1439
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:28,123
So what is it that a sighted person knows
that the blind physicist doesn't know

1440
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:30,960
if this is not

1441
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:32,895
certain
experiential content? Truly. Right.

1442
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,697
So what it's like to see the color red

1443
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:36,832
that's not part of
the blind is just knowledge.

1444
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:39,468
So therefore physics
can only capture the causal skeleton

1445
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:43,339
when at least conclude from this
that my experience of seeing the color

1446
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:45,341
red simply is a property of the world,

1447
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:48,143
but one that we can't provide
any naturalistic counsel.

1448
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:50,613
And the reason I mention that is
because I think that may also be the case

1449
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:52,214
for words like London.

1450
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:56,418
The book is Abstractions
are considerably much more detailed,

1451
01:10:56,652 --> 01:11:00,990
much more intricate and much more complex
than we give them credit for that

1452
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:06,362
our minds have managed to achieve
an analysis of the concept of number one.

1453
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,030
And number theory is very rich,

1454
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:11,834
very serious field in mathematics
about about number theory.

1455
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:15,271
Well, there isn't
really much of an analog in linguistics.

1456
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:19,174
So lexical semantics is nowhere near
as across, nowhere near as detailed

1457
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:23,045
and nowhere near as sophisticated
as number theory and lexical semantics

1458
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:27,483
is pretty much the meaning of water
is the set of all things that are water,

1459
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:30,753
especially if you think of a semantic
textbook semantics.

1460
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:32,254
Textbooks are pretty much just that.

1461
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:36,492
The meaning of the meaning of
it is raining just means it's raining.

1462
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:37,393
Right? That's it.

1463
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:38,794
Just like a re description.

1464
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:41,597
And so, in other words,
linguists are very far

1465
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:42,498
from actually having

1466
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:46,335
a serious naturalistic account
for even some of the most simplest words

1467
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:50,205
and which, again, might
which might just simply be because of our

1468
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:51,874
cognitive limitations. Right.

1469
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:53,575
We want to construct these objects

1470
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:59,048
and so one of the were kind of ways
to exhibit this,

1471
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:01,784
which puts me is by looking
to the philosophy literature.

1472
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:05,521
So in the philosophy of literature,
there's something called external wisdom,

1473
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:09,458
which is the position I've just been
taken, which is the idea that, well, it's

1474
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:13,862
going to be kind of a 1 to 1 reference
with things in the external world.

1475
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,265
And there was a survey conducted
not too long ago

1476
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:19,368
which showed that the majority
of philosophers are extremists.

1477
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:23,072
They do believe, in fact, that the way to
Water River is to take trouble with it.

1478
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:27,209
So consider this famous experiment,
which I think contributes

1479
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:30,512
to our understanding of active inference
as shown in a few slides.

1480
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:35,317
In some parallel universe,
it said that water is not effectual,

1481
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:37,986
but rather that some of the substance
right actually.

1482
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:41,724
So in the parallel universe
prior to the exact same as well

1483
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:45,361
except water is not made up
for its X-Y-Z.

1484
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,963
So the question is
can the inhabitants of this twin

1485
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:50,099
use water to affect the substance?

1486
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:54,103
So extend the same no extend to say that
the meaning of water can't be applied to

1487
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:55,337
the substance. And

1488
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:59,341
on the other hand, in contrary
in contrast to the extent

1489
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:01,577
this is what's called
the infamous position

1490
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:04,313
which says that one meaning of words
is simply a conceptual

1491
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:09,418
because there's nothing in the
external world at least interpret it.

1492
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:12,955
So the intent was to say, yes,
of course it is, it's just a concept.

1493
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:17,559
And so the term water
seems to be polyphemus between

1494
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:22,131
some kind of common function make sense
and a more concrete technical sense.

1495
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:26,135
So you can imagine that a matter,
let's say one of the examples that Noam

1496
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:31,006
Chomsky is given is imagine that there's
a tea factory, but kind of explodes

1497
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,511
some of the tea leaves in the factory
into the local water system.

1498
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:39,782
And so what comes out
sort of is chemically identical

1499
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:41,917
to the tea
that they're making in the kitchen.

1500
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:44,853
And yet one them
one of the substances is water

1501
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:46,488
and one of the symbols of this tea,

1502
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:48,490
even though they're chemically identical,
right?

1503
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:49,591
Chemically the same thing.

1504
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:52,795
And one of them is water
and one of them is tea.

1505
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:54,530
And the reason
why is because it doesn't one of them

1506
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:57,866
satisfies the functional based criteria
and the other one violated

1507
01:13:58,801 --> 01:13:59,401
that.

1508
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:02,237
Indeed, you
can imagine under the parallel universe.

1509
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:05,040
But then just
the other is what he goes on potentially

1510
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:08,043
where doppelgangers of our scientists
discover that

1511
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:10,979
when and what they've all been loosely
called the mud.

1512
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:13,482
In fact, a deep uniform structure.

1513
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:16,785
So if they occupy Earth on Earth
and there's no uniform

1514
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:19,788
strips, there can be anything

1515
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:23,892
of in this parallel universe
that all of their example

1516
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:27,596
substances would actually exhibit
a uniform structure X, Y or Z.

1517
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:31,900
And so the argument is
that they can use the concept to refer

1518
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:35,037
to acceptable physical structures
and then ask for that.

1519
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:35,404
Right?

1520
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:38,941
They could specifically use the web
to just read X, Y or Z.

1521
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,511
But does it follow from this
that the inhabitants of original Earth

1522
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:45,814
could not travel to our universe
and use the word mode

1523
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:49,985
to refer to our computer samples
if they became too old?

1524
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:51,520
And I think the answer is no.

1525
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,322
They extend this would say yes, right?

1526
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:56,558
Next sentence would say, Well, the
meaning of simply refers to X, Y or Z.

1527
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:59,194
And since we don't have X,
Y, or Z in our universe,

1528
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:02,464
when these people jump in a black hole
and come to us,

1529
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:05,100
when they talk of they have to be
speeding with something else,

1530
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:08,237
but surely violates the actual
meaning of the term.

1531
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:11,240
What its conceptual representations
matter is construction.

1532
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:16,111
So the idea that the natural kind
of the use of what could not readily be

1533
01:15:16,111 --> 01:15:17,679
extended to a place of a sense

1534
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,282
doesn't really seem to be well-supported
and it's just not a good description

1535
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:22,384
of what language
actually is or what it is.

1536
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:26,221
Language doesn't really care about what
it cares about, what does it, you know,

1537
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:28,290
it doesn't care about the external world
as it actually is.

1538
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:29,591
It's not.

1539
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:32,728
That's what science tries
to science tries to achieve reference

1540
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:36,064
within the language system
just cares about active inference

1541
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:37,833
just goes about making sense of the world

1542
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:40,602
that's it doesn't actually care
if Waters made a picture.

1543
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:42,471
All right. That's not true.

1544
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:45,607
So we can use simple words like water
more to access multiple concepts

1545
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:48,544
and then use those concepts
in the same way to back the reference

1546
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:50,379
if arbitrarily

1547
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:53,582
goes with it, and shows
that using government statistics,

1548
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:57,920
the US government statistics show Diet
Coke as a high percentage of H2O.

1549
01:15:58,253 --> 01:16:01,690
That stuff from my well, in fact,
I'm drinking a bottle of Dr.

1550
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:02,090
Pepper.

1551
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,826
I'm not sure it actually
has that information, but Dr.

1552
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:07,362
Pepper has almost definitely agreed.

1553
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:10,766
The content of H2O and stuff
from the well in your backyard

1554
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:12,901
and in fact Diet Sprite inputs.

1555
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:14,870
So that are even more like H2O.

1556
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:17,339
And yet
they're not in water for reasons purely.

1557
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:18,974
They were content purposes, right?

1558
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:21,643
So I think a cup of tea is like 99.7

1559
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:25,380
or 99.5%, thanks to what I mean,
it's called a go take, right?

1560
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,148
It's not worth it.

1561
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:28,717
It's tea.

1562
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:32,554
So moving even further away from this,
consider that even scattered entities

1563
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:33,689
going by water.

1564
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:35,524
That's not what skylands these scallops.

1565
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:38,727
These can be taken to be a single
physical object on the sun condition.

1566
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:42,898
So imagine a picket fence with bricks
or a called mobile, right?

1567
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:45,267
The latter is a thing called mobile.

1568
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:48,270
It's called the thing or the collection
of leaves on a tree, is not it?

1569
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:52,007
Unless, of course, these leaves a place
for the purposes of decoration

1570
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:53,342
or art installation.

1571
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:54,443
And so the reason seems to be

1572
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,878
that the mobile is created
by an act of human will.

1573
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:58,680
Again, function of oceans, of water here.

1574
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:01,116
So here's the question

1575
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:03,752
how are these humans
behaving notion of function and intention

1576
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:07,356
coded into the lexicon, and how are they
covered as part of any kind of model

1577
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:08,557
under active inference?

1578
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:11,059
Three Tricky question and

1579
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:16,098
indeed going
beyond this to Bertrand Russell

1580
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:19,267
and Banks who claim to object to this
based on spatial temporal continuity.

1581
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:22,237
But it also seems to be not sufficient

1582
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:24,940
for the forelegs of a dog
can be seen as a single object

1583
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,708
on the many conceivable contexts,

1584
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:29,578
such as if they were cut
off, tied together and use a toaster.

1585
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:32,314
But they could still be understood
by its use as part of it.

1586
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:35,684
So after objects
do not bear causal relationships

1587
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:38,086
and they're also not
spatial technically located.

1588
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:41,323
So an object is usually understood
to be a concrete thing as the confusion

1589
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:43,659
when somewhere denied special operations.

1590
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:46,261
So an object is
an object if we deem it so.

1591
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:48,897
And in addition, I think

1592
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:52,601
it's important to note that a psycho
linguistic lens is needed to walk.

1593
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:54,703
This talk of extended
was one in journalism.

1594
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:57,105
They'll just talk about language
without actually

1595
01:17:57,105 --> 01:18:00,075
knowing anything about linguistics,
which is kind of like a philosopher,

1596
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:02,544
a physicist, like a philosopher,
a philosopher of physics,

1597
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:05,280
trying to do a physics
without knowing anything about physics.

1598
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:06,715
It's kind of strange, right?

1599
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:08,984
If you want to do philosophy
of the mystics, but in language

1600
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:10,952
we should really know about it.

1601
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:13,955
So here's one particular paradox
in the foster literature.

1602
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:16,525
The following contrast
has been called a paradoxical problem.

1603
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:20,495
So you can say Batman
fights more mobsters than Bruce Wayne.

1604
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:23,498
And but we also know that Bruce Wayne
just is Batman, right?

1605
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:27,002
So therefore, we should be able to save
Batman quite so much as the Obama.

1606
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:27,869
Right.

1607
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:29,805
But we can't say that
because the software

1608
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:32,808
and the reason why is due to linguistics,
it's not for the philosophy.

1609
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:36,044
So then that as a constraint
on discourse, interpretation of language

1610
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:39,214
through which whenever there's two
referential expressions in the clause,

1611
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:41,717
they're default as not identical.

1612
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:45,554
And this feeds
into redundant computation, which again

1613
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:48,890
feeds back to efficient computation,
and as such reference is operative.

1614
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:51,393
So we have to into
the Obama is a problem.

1615
01:18:51,793 --> 01:18:54,730
So the sentence and B forces us to say it
for different reference,

1616
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:56,798
even though we know
it's the same record. Right.

1617
01:18:57,866 --> 01:18:59,901
So this paradox in philosophy of language

1618
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:03,572
is not due to mind world
relations, it's just due to linguistics.

1619
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:05,507
It's just a psycho linguistic phenomena.

1620
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:08,977
So it is it's pretty simple

1621
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:12,080
and. Again, one of the problems here
is that a lot of these

1622
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:16,351
quirks of language demand, interrogation,
and they're not immediately obvious.

1623
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:19,054
The kind of language is very bit
of constructing an illusion,

1624
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:21,123
but we kind of become susceptible
to that.

1625
01:19:21,123 --> 01:19:24,426
To think about the things we talk about
are really,

1626
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:28,196
really existing in the world
and in fact, you know, languages.

1627
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:30,432
I like to think it was kind of a fairy
tale.

1628
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:33,368
Using language is kind of more akin
to constructing a fairytale

1629
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:36,037
than it is science,
because we're just constructing concepts

1630
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:38,774
and using the kind of lipstick
and science language game sets.

1631
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:41,810
So here's
another example of Escher sentences.

1632
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:43,445
There's a

1633
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:46,615
famous staircase
painting of the endless staircases

1634
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:50,752
go round and round and round
so the visual system doesn't care.

1635
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:53,121
Rather
the visual system just sees what it sees.

1636
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:56,191
If the world turns out to be a physically
impossible construct,

1637
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,827
that's not relevant to the visual system.

1638
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:01,329
We just see is what I would say is
and it's the same with language.

1639
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:05,167
So language also has things
like analogous things like Wall

1640
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:06,368
Escher sentences.

1641
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:08,436
So if you say more people have intuition
than I have,

1642
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:12,641
or in Michigan, in Minnesota,
more people found Mr.

1643
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,810
Bush's ads negative candidate, Mr. Kerry.

1644
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:15,977
That's actually a meaningless sentence.

1645
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,780
It doesn't mean that more people
went to Russia than I have

1646
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:22,617
is I mean, in a sense,
it kind of sounds like it makes sense,

1647
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:24,085
but it's completely meaningless

1648
01:20:24,085 --> 01:20:26,788
because you're trying to compare
it fixed on a quantity.

1649
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,591
But two, a simple binary. Yes. What?
Not right.

1650
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:31,593
You've ever been to Russia, yes or no?

1651
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:33,995
And a more people means
five or six people.

1652
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:38,133
So it's it's syntactically legal
but semantically incoherent.

1653
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:41,703
And the spelling of sentences like that,
where it's kind of a language

1654
01:20:41,703 --> 01:20:46,875
system is very good at that,
generating the illusion of meaning,

1655
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:48,210
but generating the illusion

1656
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:51,913
of obstruction when in fact,
if you interrogated, there's no reason.

1657
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:56,751
And again, this feeds of the idea of a
fission computation of our generation.

1658
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:59,754
You know, the language just doesn't
want to interrogate to me.

1659
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:02,157
It just wants to generate an inference.

1660
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:03,425
Why is this person trying to say

1661
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,163
it also
generated also thesis value by reference.

1662
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:12,434
So this sentence sounds meaningful,
but there's nothing in the external world

1663
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:15,270
I can refer to,
so there's no real comparisons being made

1664
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:20,275
between more people maybe being being.

1665
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:23,712
So in conclusion,
it seems that any object is much more

1666
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,448
than its material constitution
or its function.

1667
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:28,116
We can also use its origin.

1668
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:29,851
So Thomas Hobbes talked about reference.

1669
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:33,455
His famous example was A River
can be maybe defined by its origin,

1670
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:36,925
and I think that's divergent
and go into different parts

1671
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:40,262
and then maybe converge again,
but also a sense of continuity.

1672
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:43,932
So John likes the person who was that
person is defined

1673
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:47,535
by a sense of continuous identity
and not physical constitution.

1674
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:52,574
And so when a child watches a cartoon
of the handsome prince getting kissed,

1675
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:57,612
it turns into a frog, and then
it turns into, you know, a human again.

1676
01:21:57,612 --> 01:21:59,114
Once you or whatever.

1677
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:01,249
But there's a catch
and then something happens.

1678
01:22:01,383 --> 01:22:03,251
The child knows that same person, right?

1679
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:06,087
The child watching the TV knows
that it's the same entity.

1680
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:11,927
It's the same person
that the prince, being from a human.

1681
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:14,429
And yet again,
that's not enough to do a reference.

1682
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:17,732
There's nothing that could
coherently exist in that sense.

1683
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:21,036
So all these reputations, it's fine.

1684
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:23,371
And in addition,
we also have a kind of a fifth element.

1685
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:26,308
So we kind of call this
linguistic biases, the shaping object.

1686
01:22:26,908 --> 01:22:29,010
So that pertains to one example.

1687
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:32,414
There were lots of examples, but one
example, the marking of objects images.

1688
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:35,884
So if you say John painted the house
brown,

1689
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:39,654
this implies that he painted
the external surface brown me into it

1690
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:43,291
because we seem to have a sense
of objects as being concave objects,

1691
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:45,327
which seems a lot like scenes.

1692
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:47,996
Events inside seem so exciting.

1693
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:52,334
So we seem to have a kind
of visually sense of what our house is.

1694
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:55,670
So if John and Mary almost stood
five meters

1695
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:59,541
from the surface of the house, but Mary's
inside of the house and John's outside

1696
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:02,844
it, John is in need of a house,
but Mary is not near the house.

1697
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:05,714
Mary is inside the house,
even though they're both equidistant

1698
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:08,149
the actual physical structure
of the house.

1699
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:10,952
So the house is again a functional

1700
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:13,088
it's not just a physical object,
it's also

1701
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:15,590
a functional based interpretation.

1702
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:17,292
And so, in other words,

1703
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:20,762
at least these five components,
they all contribute up to inference.

1704
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:22,597
They all contribute
to generating structures,

1705
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:25,233
or at least these are proponents
of somehow coded language.

1706
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,969
I consider that to be one
of the biggest mysteries of

1707
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:31,072
how are
these things encoded in the lexicon

1708
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:33,475
and how it is that how these networks
across the brain

1709
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:36,011
interpreted and activated during language
comprehension.

1710
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:38,346
That's extremely problematic issue

1711
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:43,051
because like I said, when we talk
about schools being having masses

1712
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:46,154
and being large and near the river
and etc.,

1713
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:49,324
we're using pretty much
all of these concepts at once

1714
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:51,426
and we're doing effortlessly.

1715
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:54,529
And yet somehow how they're actually
implemented is kind of a mystery.

1716
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:58,033
But there is interestingly precedence
in recent

1717
01:23:58,366 --> 01:23:59,634
print literature for this suggestion.

1718
01:23:59,634 --> 01:24:03,438
So in a recent paper perhaps argue
that if it be is most compatible

1719
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:05,907
with an instrumentalist
theory of mental representations,

1720
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:07,809
which representations are useful?

1721
01:24:07,809 --> 01:24:10,045
Fictions for explanatory goals,

1722
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,047
which is exactly what
I've just been saying about linguistics.

1723
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:16,184
And this is also compatible with
certain models in philosophy of language.

1724
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:18,686
We have endless perspective,
which is about let's go

1725
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:21,456
items having to want to direct reference
and external well.

1726
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:23,458
But I basically useful fictions

1727
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:24,159
the composites

1728
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,161
of distinct representations of the rooms
that I use

1729
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:29,497
for successful efficient interpretation
and ultimately survival.

1730
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:29,764
Right.

1731
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:31,399
And it's

1732
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:33,802
also compatible
with families, models of blankets

1733
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:35,236
which have been argued

1734
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:38,873
to be the form of neo, continuing
to have much in the council permission

1735
01:24:39,307 --> 01:24:42,844
whereby the barriers of commissioner
about school emphasizing

1736
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:45,814
the interactive,
constructive nature of higher cognition

1737
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,183
and generating interpretable,
actionable concepts.

1738
01:24:48,349 --> 01:24:50,685
Again, the crucial concept of actionable
concept.

1739
01:24:50,785 --> 01:24:51,686
It's a useful concept.

1740
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:54,622
There's something that you can use
in some meaningful way.

1741
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:59,094
So the long storage of frequently
generated

1742
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,531
lexical characters on the material rules
on the line that created the planet

1743
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:05,700
and language comprehension,

1744
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,937
all of this seems to allow speakers
to categorize novel sensory data

1745
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:12,207
into a discrete set of object
or uneventful representations.

1746
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:13,942
So there are a few events

1747
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:17,612
that can actually be passed through the
simple, unique schemas provided by one,

1748
01:25:18,246 --> 01:25:22,183
which increases the likelihood
of speakers avoiding surprising states

1749
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:23,685
the more efficiently and readily.

1750
01:25:23,685 --> 01:25:26,688
You can pass a particular situation
as an event then,

1751
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:31,593
but at least the surprise minimization.

1752
01:25:31,593 --> 01:25:34,863
So another reason paper notes that
the active inference model of the brain

1753
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:38,299
assumes an imperative
to find the most accurate estimation

1754
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:40,935
of the sensory observations
that is minimally complex

1755
01:25:41,336 --> 01:25:44,572
which has been recruited involves
exploration of resiliency

1756
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:48,209
and which seems to accord
with how the language system provides

1757
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:51,513
the most computationally efficient format
for solving the problem

1758
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:55,183
of mapping being linear sensory input,
so linear sentences

1759
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:57,085
to hierarchical interpretations.

1760
01:25:58,653 --> 01:25:59,721
So from the perspective of

1761
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:03,691
inference, individuals need to minimize
the effort involved in meaning making.

1762
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:07,762
So we propose that there is increasing
evidence from theoretical linguistics

1763
01:26:07,762 --> 01:26:11,533
and natural language syntax
and that this structure exhibits design

1764
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:14,736
principles in keeping with the theory.

1765
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:16,905
Some of a recent paper by Kristin
Christian,

1766
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:21,876
she proposes that the goals of speech
segmentation, the sampling data

1767
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,044
in a way that requires

1768
01:26:23,044 --> 01:26:27,115
the most parsimonious degree of belief
operating in the third principle.

1769
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:29,584
So we've basically extended
these claims with the

1770
01:26:30,118 --> 02:01:47,533
methodology.
