1
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:13,440
this is active guest stream 15.3 lucky

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,179
number three with Bobby

4
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,580
we're here with Bobby Azarian as well as

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,920
some guests we're going to have a

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,480
discussion

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,119
talk about a range of different topics

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,939
it's June 1st 2023

9
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,000
first Adam and Michael can introduce

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,820
themselves then Bobby will pass it off

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,800
to you for sharing your screen and

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,380
facilitating this however you see fit so

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,399
Adam go for it

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,739
hello oh I'm Adam I am a research fellow

15
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,260
at the Johns Hopkins Center for

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,320
psychedelic and Consciousness research

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,379
um long standing interest in the free

18
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,059
energy principle

19
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,000
um Consciousness Free Will psychedelics

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,820
artificial intelligence and along the

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,299
way I met and befriended Bobby and

22
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,299
um

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,920
uh I guess uh

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,820
proud to be part of the movement so

25
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,799
thanks for coming Adam yeah Adam

26
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,659
I wish we would have time to get into

27
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,619
this today but Adam is uh presented a

28
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,920
pretty clear mechanistic model of Free

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,280
Will cybernetic Free Will and um

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,159
there's just this huge problem where and

31
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,740
I'll keep this short we're gonna

32
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,320
introduce Michael but um

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,180
basically the the main kind of straw man

34
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,799
against free will is that there's this

35
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,479
argument that you have this non-physical

36
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,880
mind doing like stuff outside of

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,040
causality and that's why everyone's

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,880
rejecting it as not a scientific idea

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,680
but

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,479
of course something can't work if it's

41
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,460
not it doesn't have mechanism it's not

42
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,680
real it's not real so it's kind of a

43
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,320
ridiculous debate to have if you want to

44
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,540
talk about what people are talking about

45
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,719
when they discuss Free Will in the past

46
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,520
we didn't have mechanisms to understand

47
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,720
what that was but now we understand

48
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,520
things like top-down causation we

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,319
understand control and when you have

50
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,360
that language you can actually talk

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,360
about what free will is in a mechanistic

52
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,660
way and that just changes the debate

53
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,340
completely

54
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,200
um that's not enough to convince people

55
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,640
that you know there's something called

56
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,440
free will because there's a lot of

57
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,780
issues that we get into but Adam's one

58
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,020
of the people that have been taking this

59
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,940
nebulous concept and have have been

60
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,120
trying to show that there's actually a

61
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,980
very specific set of mechanisms and it's

62
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,440
nothing outside of science but it is

63
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,420
science that is outside of our current

64
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,000
Paradigm it's it's just dynamics that we

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,640
don't normally that weren't included in

66
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,900
the previous model so it looks like

67
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,180
magic but it's actually there's stuff

68
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,319
going on there

69
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,959
um so yeah uh we're gonna have a longer

70
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,700
discussion with Adam in the future

71
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,379
either on my Channel or maybe we'll come

72
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:02,519
back and make it all about free will

73
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,920
because it's such a big topic but yeah

74
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,399
thanks for coming

75
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,480
and invite Michael as well so

76
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,620
um

77
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,739
am I supposed to take the wheel now yeah

78
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,580
um obviously I'm a fan of Bobby's

79
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,360
um I very much like uh

80
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,739
oh well I think it's important I think

81
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,379
the the work that uh Bobby is trying to

82
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:31,379
articulate and Adam I'm a fan uh so this

83
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,819
is the first time we've met but I've

84
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,440
watched some of your stuff as well and

85
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,480
and Daniel obviously we've talked

86
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,360
um and uh yeah let's just uh yield to

87
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,519
Bobby and let's see where we go here

88
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,319
um yeah Michael has a background and

89
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,959
kind of um system science and those kind

90
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,340
of things that's where how he kind of

91
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,900
resonate is

92
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,400
um kind of like the system science

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,680
approach but thinking about how system

94
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,299
science can be applied to like

95
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,019
psychology and organizational issues so

96
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,700
how to make this stuff that's very

97
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,760
theoretical practical and so we're kind

98
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,799
of working on that on the side and then

99
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,080
Brennan Grand MC will be coming and

100
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,640
joining the conversation since he's not

101
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,840
here right now I'll just give a little

102
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,879
introduction for him he's the author of

103
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,099
a book called emergentism and he has a

104
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,959
Facebook group called meta modern

105
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,160
spirituality and basically he's in that

106
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,100
book he's turned this emergence Paradigm

107
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,479
which which is basically kind of the

108
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,419
opposite of the reductionist Paradigm

109
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,000
um into something like a sort of secular

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,880
religion and

111
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,160
um so he's talking about a lot of these

112
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,020
same things

113
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,780
um so he'll join us shortly probably I

114
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,699
think he's watching the the stream and

115
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,340
is trying to get into the zoom link

116
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,120
um

117
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,960
so yeah we can start I um

118
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,940
it'd be great to for this to be sort of

119
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,280
a discussion so if anything

120
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,960
I say

121
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,180
triggers any sort of thoughts or

122
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,479
criticisms please speak up because I

123
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,259
don't have an organized uh set of slides

124
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,440
and there's a lot to talk about and the

125
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,120
problem really when I was trying to make

126
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,979
these slides was like everything I say

127
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,680
kind of gets into something else and so

128
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,139
I had like a hundred slides and I was

129
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,880
just trying to organize them in the last

130
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,919
minute so

131
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,900
um I think you know I have some slides

132
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,160
that were made in the past for other

133
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,720
presentations that are just going to be

134
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,780
kind of like a road map but

135
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,820
um we can Veer off of that and I'm going

136
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,259
to be saying a lot of stuff that's not

137
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,479
in the slides

138
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,620
um

139
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,020
yeah so I guess we can start

140
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,720
so I'll share my screen because I just

141
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,280
shared my screen for my computer and I

142
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,740
couldn't see you but I think that a

143
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,960
trick to that is to share my screen

144
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,000
through Zoom

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,060
and then share do like slideshow and

146
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,680
then I should be able to see your faces

147
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,199
on the side yep okay so you can see my

148
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,000
screen now

149
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,860
yeah

150
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,600
then if I do slideshow it doesn't work

151
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,380
yeah perfect

152
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,100
okay

153
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,940
um so

154
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,280
uh Bobby just before you get started I

155
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,259
believe Brennan's joined us as well hey

156
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,620
Brandon

157
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,020
we've warmed up the crowd those audios

158
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,120
yeah I thought he was probably not

159
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,520
connected yet but um

160
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,819
yeah so we can just begin uh hey Brandon

161
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:30,060
I introduced you and uh yeah I was just

162
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,280
on the YouTube uh version and then I got

163
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,199

do this by myself so

170
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,319
um and maybe you can play the role of

171
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,000
the critic too because I should have

172
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,400
invited some like anti-free will people

173
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,479
because

174
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,340
um or just some Skeptics of these ideas

175
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,720
because

176
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,479
what I realized is like

177
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,580
I'm saying these things a lot of them

178
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,139
were the things in my book romance

179
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,240
reality and

180
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,819
I make that argument as clear as I can

181
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,979
but then people have criticisms that for

182
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,500
whatever reason you know how I worded it

183
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,900
don't address those and then they're not

184
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,660
convinced and then I do nothing to

185
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,580
convince anyone who doesn't already

186
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,680
believe this so it's actually a lot more

187
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,960
um fruitful if there's a sort of this

188
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,960
dialectical debate like this dynamic

189
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,940
because then you hear both sides and

190
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,680
then I can actually address the things

191
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,880
that people think are the issues that

192
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,319
might

193
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,099
um

194
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,440
you know cast out on some of the things

195
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,500
that I'm arguing so

196
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,020
um the teleological stance so this is

197
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,740
the name of the self-help system for a

198
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,380
lack of a better uh term I know people

199
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,180
hear self-help and they think uh you

200
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,860
know that's something like cheesy and

201
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,120
new age or you know BS and there are a

202
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,400
lot of like you know snake oil salesmen

203
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,020
in this place and I think that's why

204
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,380
it's so important that we try if

205
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,520
possible to create something like a

206
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,940
self-help system and you know

207
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,979
something almost like a religion like

208
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,400
something that has practices

209
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,160
and a sort of instruction manual for a

210
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,479
living

211
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,419
um based on scientific principles now it

212
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:31,919
doesn't have to be based on you know

213
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,919
science won't explain everything

214
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,380
um or address everything

215
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,380
um but this provides a foundation where

216
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,640
we can

217
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,559
actually start to build a logic where we

218
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,060
can go some of these things are right

219
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,040
and some of these things aren't and we

220
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,500
can start to see things that have been

221
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,519
said

222
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,120
in folk psychology or New Age practices

223
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,680
that people just considered to be

224
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,700
non-scientific or pseudoscience we can

225
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,860
see how that maps on to some of these

226
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,440
newer mechanisms that we're

227
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,399
understanding because now we're starting

228
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,800
to look at biology and neuroscience and

229
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,480
psychology from the perspective of

230
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,320
information Theory and thermodynamics

231
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,620
and these are

232
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,560
like revealing new mechanisms that I

233
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,220
believe can create a bridge between

234
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,140
reductionist science and

235
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,680
the higher Sciences but also a lot of

236
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,420
these statements you'll hear you know

237
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,160
things that you hear in like spiritual

238
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,860
circles or people are doing practices or

239
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,899
uh and you know just different little

240
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,399
things that they find to be very

241
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,160
effective in most cases there's a

242
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,019
scientific explanation for why those

243
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,940
things are effective and most

244
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,760
science-minded people are ignoring all

245
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,339
that stuff so they're like throwing out

246
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,459
all of these things that emerged because

247
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,060
they were adaptations like practices

248
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,620
um you know community building things

249
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,540
like that are just completely being

250
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,100
ignored

251
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,380
um and that's really bad it's just

252
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,760
throwing the baby out with the bath

253
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,580
water and as long as we

254
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,220
have that mentality

255
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,019
um you know scientists they may say you

256
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,880
know I don't want to

257
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,940
promote religion organize religion let's

258
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,640
say or you know like kind of new age

259
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,899
spirituality I don't want to promote

260
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,720
that but they're actually helping keep

261
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,519
those things

262
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,240
in existence because the a lot of

263
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,399
regular people are hearing this

264
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,019
scientific worldview that's the

265
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,760
mainstream worldview and it's very

266
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,560
nihilistic in some of its beliefs and

267
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,100
that'd be okay if that's how reality was

268
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,720
but we're going to see that a lot of

269
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,500
these are based on mistaken assumptions

270
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,360
and people are rejecting that worldview

271
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,660
because it's doesn't offer anything of

272
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,120
value to them as a normal person and

273
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,779
they will opt for other less

274
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:59,640
evidence-based uh worldviews or

275
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,680
philosophies because they're not getting

276
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,540
that from that so

277
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,480
science is actually helping like

278
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,540
pseudoscience and things like that

279
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,660
um if they want to keep science isolated

280
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,140
from all these practical things and sort

281
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,880
of addressing bigger existential and

282
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,279
even spiritual questions and so if we

283
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,019
can do that if we can build that bridge

284
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,779
it would be good for unifying everyone

285
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,180
but it would also cut down on a lot of

286
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,160
the the pseudoscience and stuff that

287
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,620
people are trying to

288
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,339
um kind of prevent from you know not

289
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,560
going there but actually I think that's

290
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,820
um part of the problem if that makes any

291
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,680
sense

292
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,740
um

293
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,779
so this is stuff for my sub stack road

294
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,399
to Omega go there and check it out

295
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,519
there's uh uh post on the teleological

296
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,640
stance that break this down in uh more

297
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,079
detail than I'll be able to give here

298
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,000
today

299
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,860
um I have this word in the slide poetic

300
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,720
meta naturalism if you're familiar with

301
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,459
my book

302
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:03,899
um you might have seen that it's not

303
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,399
really important

304
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,339
um to really talk about why I call it

305
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,500
that but let's just say there are these

306
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,380
two distinctive worldviews so there's

307
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,079
the old mainstream scientific world view

308
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,300
which is the reductionist world view

309
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,339
which I think is basically a nihilistic

310
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,140
world view

311
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,180
um and uh there are a lot of assumptions

312
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,640
built into this world view based on

313
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,880
just we had limited knowledge at the

314
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,800
time of how the world works so there

315
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,660
were things like for example when we

316
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,060
thought the world was Newtonian you just

317
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,640
couldn't get away from determinism uh

318
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,320
this kind of strict laplacian

319
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,019
determinism LaPlace basically took

320
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,060
Newton's

321
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,920
um kind of framework and tried to apply

322
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,360
it to everything it's really interesting

323
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,980
that Newton himself didn't do that he

324
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,660
didn't think that his laws applied to

325
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,160
life and Newton was actually very

326
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,839
religious and thought there were all

327
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,399
these crazy hidden messages in the Bible

328
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,040
which is neat and kind of like covered

329
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,200
up because people you know don't want

330
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,480
people to know that that Newton was so

331
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,700
religious but um

332
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,920
so LaPlace kind of you know created this

333
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,360
deterministic philosophy and when we

334
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,060
thought that was the truth and there was

335
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,040
no room for a human agency there was

336
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,000
just one future trajectory and we

337
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,920
couldn't do anything to change that and

338
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,820
we couldn't

339
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,620
we were we weren't really doing anything

340
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,959
to begin with it was all everything we

341
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,180
do is sort of illusory and we can talk

342
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,660
about determinism in Greater detail

343
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,240
um but that's one nihilistic aspect is

344
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,639
that we don't have any agency and we

345
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,200
don't have free will free will it's a

346
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,420
bit more of a loaded term there's just

347
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,579
assumptions with that word like with the

348
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:50,519
word free that uh make it a little bit

349
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,740
more of a contentious subject but um

350
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,220
yeah without with determinism in the

351
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,260
strict sense

352
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,420
no one could have any agency so it kind

353
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,320
of if you accept that scientific

354
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,220
um

355
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,980
proposition then you're like basically

356
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,560
accepting that you have no control over

357
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,380
the future or your life and that can be

358
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,440
very depressing and demotivating in

359
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,000
their studies that we can talk about

360
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,600
that have shown that

361
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,620
um that belief actually causes people to

362
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,540
for example

363
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,459
um behave less morally they will be more

364
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:30,959
likely to cheat

365
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,240
uh because they don't have culpability

366
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,980
because no one's responsible for

367
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,420
anything that's then basically

368
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,519
choosing

369
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,120
to not have this agency that I'll

370
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,760
explain exactly what I mean by that but

371
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,500
basically I mean the fact that you can

372
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,240
tell them that and then they lose it and

373
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,560
then they start behaving more immorally

374
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,480
it's obvious that there's something

375
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,279
causal there that's changing their

376
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,360
behavior

377
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,100
so that's kind of a clue that that

378
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,720
pictured something doesn't make sense

379
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,980
there

380
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,240
um

381
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,940
and it also causes people to be like

382
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,560
really depressed and have kind of

383
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,199
existential meltdowns

384
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,240
um I personally had you know when I

385
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,740
thought determinism was the only

386
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,620
explanation that made sense I sort of

387
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,079
had you know times where I would have

388
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,480
these experiences where I was very

389
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,100
disturbed by the fact that I had no

390
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,959
control over anything and that this was

391
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,079
sort of a tape that was determined from

392
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,839
the initial event and that I was just

393
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,800
playing that out it can be very

394
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,779
disturbing if you take this stuff

395
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,240
seriously and what I'm arguing is that a

396
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,740
lot of the scientists preaching this

397
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,779
stuff they're not taking it seriously

398
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,360
because they can't it would be your life

399
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,860
would just be over if you really

400
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,540
believed that you had no agency because

401
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,940
you would stop doing stuff

402
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,740
um

403
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,600
seriously and uh it took me out for a

404
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,100
good two years

405
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,839
um how do you even take it seriously

406
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,639
like what does that do what do you do

407
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,860
then

408
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,899
um so the it happened

409
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,519
um it was a combination of reading this

410
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,620
book um the meme machine

411
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,920
um by Susan Blackmore and um Darwin's

412
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,720
dangerous idea there's this one sentence

413
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,000
that just like took me out it was like

414
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,120
um everything up to this moment

415
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,240
including your genes environment uh and

416
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,639
all your experiences including the first

417
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,320
half of the sentence will determine how

418
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,660
you uh interpret the second episode it

419
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,940
was sort of like just this web of

420
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,040
causation being described on a different

421
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,620
level of analysis sort of like bringing

422
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,480
that to the foreground and I was like

423
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,839
and not seeing me in that foreground and

424
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,220
and then I was like oh hey there isn't

425
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,440
like a neuron in my brain that knows or

426
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,839
cares that I exist this whole or and

427
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,680
then was wait not even a wait so sodium

428
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,360
ions are going to sodium ion they're

429
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,920
just gonna follow those gradients like

430
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,860
oh God and I so

431
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,100
um and it just sort of had me and and so

432
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,899
for I just was

433
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:02,579
I mean so it's like I was actually so

434
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:06,260
for a while I was um uh

435
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,059
is it kind of paralyze you or do you

436
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,559
just go I'm gonna do what I was gonna do

437
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,540
anyway but I'm gonna do it I'm gonna

438
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,939
have this weird sort of you know

439
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,679
experience at the same time because it's

440
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:17,939
all meaningless I'm just going to go

441
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,919
through life I'm probably going to look

442
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,780
really sad but I'm gonna do everything

443
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,660
that I plan to do otherwise or does it

444
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,799
just shut you down where you're like I'm

445
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,160
not gonna get out of bed

446
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,059
there was kind of like a double

447
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,799
Consciousness about it too because it

448
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,380
was like I'd be moving between like um

449
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,160
like

450
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,900
having that as a as a frame and but then

451
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,160
like to take action you're like you

452
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,600
can't you can't you just gotta throw it

453
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,760
out the window and so like yeah so in

454
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,740
some on occasion there would be kind of

455
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,880
like a

456
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,320
um maybe this is a I don't think it took

457
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,539
me in an unethical Direction but

458
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,760
um kind of like a like a fracket mindset

459
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,620
like uh well

460
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,500
it doesn't nothing matters anyway so woo

461
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,200
but yeah and it doesn't really stick for

462
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,900
me can can I offer a devil's advocate

463
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,640
take here and yeah I don't know if we're

464
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,679
I don't know if we're derailing or no

465
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,880
this is perfect this is great but um so

466
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,919
and it is very much a devil's advocate

467
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,840
position because I think Bobby you and I

468
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,400
are very much aligned on trying to

469
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,919
emphasize the importance of uh free will

470
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,080
the the causal power of information

471
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,880
potentially Etc I'm sure you might get

472
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,039
into some of that uh but I will say this

473
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,700
in its favor or in in addition to what's

474
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,020
being said

475
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,299
um so I also had an experience like that

476
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,700
of suffering from the uh you know

477
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,380
seeming implications of the

478
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,200
deterministic universe but I do think

479
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,980
that there's a way of also allowing all

480
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,020
of that to be the case and responding

481
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,940
differently and there are a number of

482
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,460
different ways that that can look

483
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,380
um I mean there's the nietzsian approach

484
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,120
to this which is actually kind of taking

485
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,760
this deterministic cycle and kind of the

486
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,440
Eternal recurrence of the same as sort

487
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,100
of a wild yes saying to existence

488
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,140
um and I'll just I'll just throw that

489
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,760
out there and bracket it we could come

490
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,220
back to that one uh what do you mean by

491
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,220
that though sorry I I don't know so

492
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,900
Nietzsche was he would philosophize

493
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,820
while walking or he would think his

494
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,380
philosophy while going on these long

495
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,240
walks and everything right and one day

496
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,400
he was walking in the Swiss Alps and he

497
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,799
sees this gigantic Rock

498
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,080
um and uh he comes to this sudden

499
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,700
realization

500
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,960
um and I guess I won't get into the

501
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,860
whole story because it would probably be

502
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,299
a little bit too much but basically the

503
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,400
the realization that Springs there which

504
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,160
he uh which he has when at this sort of

505
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,280
like monolithic scene is somehow he sort

506
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,799
of transported and appreciates that

507
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,039
um what what he would need to do was

508
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:47,460
affirm his existence uh under the

509
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,440
assumption that everything that has

510
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,620
happened and will happen uh will happen

511
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,980
over and over and over again for

512
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,679
eternity all the mistakes all the

513
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,679
ecstasies ETC it was all there almost

514
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,360
you could kind of think of it kind of in

515
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,580
the uh you know there's the big bang big

516
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,440
crunch model and then it repeats and so

517
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,120
let's say something like that is

518
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,100
happening where yeah he called in

519
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,260
Eternal recurrence right I mean yeah

520
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,240
yeah return on recurrence and he

521
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,539
basically said that um we need to be

522
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:21,299
able to positively affirm that in an

523
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,940
exuberant sense uh and and actually and

524
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,620
here's like what does that mean well

525
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,600
what it means is that if you take the

526
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,760
idea seriously

527
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,580
um that this is your life and you are

528
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,860
therefore radically responsible in some

529
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,500
ways for what you experience

530
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,480
um uh and I'll come back to this in the

531
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,799
sense of what responsibility could mean

532
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,660
in this context as well

533
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,240
um then then it actually imbues

534
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,860
everything with an incredible

535
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,900
significance because this is what you'll

536
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,120
be experiencing over and over again uh

537
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,440
the second thing I wanted to say which I

538
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,940
think might kind of preempt some of your

539
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,919
kind of like well how does that work how

540
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,559
can you be responsible uh is um I do

541
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,360
think that there's a phenomenological

542
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,440
way that you can uh come to terms with

543
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,919
determinism uh that basically

544
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,320
concludes something like okay even if

545
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,720
mechanistically this can be describable

546
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,820
in terms of deterministic cause and

547
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,880
effect all the way back

548
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,160
my experience of it is rather different

549
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,340
I have the experience of free will I I

550
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,700
feel as though as if I can choose as I

551
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,240
want to uh and so there's no necessary

552
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,600
reason why some descriptive uh you know

553
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,720
framework needs to needs to impinge upon

554
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,000
my own phenomenological sense of reality

555
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,520
so for a long time I made peace with

556
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,020
this question that way by basically

557
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,600
saying yeah it's all determined but I

558
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,880
feel as though I have free will and

559
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,980
that's really I think the the core there

560
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,140
because um let me yeah let me tell you

561
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,020
something about that and I don't want it

562
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,480
to be seem dismissive

563
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,220
um but I mean this is not your idea

564
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,179
anyway so I don't really have to

565
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:02,460
apologize to you it's Nichi and it's one

566
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,500
of the possible things that I think

567
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,360
you're considering but I mean I I you

568
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,980
know we've talked about this I think you

569
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,080
kind of we have similar ideas about

570
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,539
agency what I want to say about that is

571
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,000
basically that is

572
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
similar to compatibilism and what's

573
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,240
going on is that these people are

574
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,880
there's language Games first of all like

575
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,880
if you want to talk about that if you

576
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,919
believe that causal story

577
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,179
in the strict sense

578
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,900
um and it's more complicated at because

579
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,820
I'm saying that the the there is

580
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,440
causality there's always cause and

581
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,720
effect to everything that doesn't not

582
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,220
permit agency but what I'm going to say

583
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,740
is the the the kind of magic ingredient

584
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,880
to understanding how this can be uh you

585
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,580
know uh mechanistic idea

586
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,980
um our mechanistic process How Free Will

587
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,500
can be explained as part of the causal

588
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,780
chain uh we need to talk about top-down

589
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,280
causation and that's really the game

590
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,220
changer and but without top down

591
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,919
causation I don't think there is any

592
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,440
responsibility and what I think that

593
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,380
Nichi and others are doing is they're

594
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,360
first of all they're compartmentalizing

595
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,400
they're like they're they're they're

596
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,760
they're not fully taking the determinism

597
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,100
they're talking about seriously and if

598
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,559
you do that like you you have to

599
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,880
compartmentalize if you believe that

600
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,159
because like Adam said like you have to

601
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,740
throw that out when you actually want to

602
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,659
take action so first of all everybody

603
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,179
who believes in determinism is kind of

604
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,940
living a split personality life and that

605
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,260
that leads to all kinds of cognitive

606
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,340
dissonance

607
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,340
but it's worse than that

608
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,039
I mean you still are I mean in a way it

609
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,260
depends so like

610
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,720
um I'm agnostic about determinism in

611
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,600
terms of like that was part of but it

612
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,600
wasn't agnosticism about determinism but

613
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,960
going more deflationary on causation or

614
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,059
more instrumentalists on causation and I

615
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:03,059
I do think but I'm open to there being

616
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:06,419
like a best causal handling or like

617
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,340
there could be like a new like um

618
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,860
Gestalt ship for me where like causation

619
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,539
kind of like enters into physics and

620
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:16,080
like full majesty and like that's what

621
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,700
this is that's that's what I want to

622
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,860
describe but the move for me was um

623
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,059
compatibilism via instrumental causation

624
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:25,760
that kind of stays within it as like

625
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,799
carols like it stays in its Lane yes and

626
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,600
I I so

627
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,460
I will put out a thing out there where

628
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,860
you could have determinism and have a

629
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,720
true agency too at these higher levels

630
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,159
you would still need top-down causation

631
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,020
but you might not need any indeterminism

632
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,659
at the most fundamental level uh like

633
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:44,400
Quantum and determinism

634
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,700
um and you could still have uh

635
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,220
potentially agency and that's sort of

636
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,559
Adam's perspective or like he says he's

637
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,360
agnostic on it but

638
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,860
um in the future I hope to convince Adam

639
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,679
that there's a better solution and so so

640
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,900
what I was saying to Brendan is that

641
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,880
these are language games when he's like

642
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,980
uh it's truly this way you know it's

643
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,539
this way but that should make you feel

644
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,280
like you're responsible because this is

645
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,960
you know the life you have and the one

646
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,100
you're going to repair whatever you know

647
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,440
it's good reasoning Brian Green says

648
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,580
similar stuff and that's why I say this

649
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,840
Brian Green's like

650
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,000
the decision is real but it's not really

651
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,460
you making it but it's a real like a lot

652
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,200
of strange weird language games that if

653
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,179
you actually make language the focus

654
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,820
which I wanted to do but it's way too

655
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,559
abstract like I didn't have time to nail

656
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,559
that down for today but that's what I

657
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,600
want to do in the future and you can

658
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,240
show that people who are talking about

659
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,299
this stuff especially people who are you

660
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,460
know trying to find some sort of Silver

661
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,220
Lining to determinism they're they're

662
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,559
using words inconsistently they will use

663
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,539
a word one way and then contradict it

664
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,159
they might even use the same word in two

665
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,020
different ways

666
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,700
um in the same sentence but basically

667
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,039
you can't have well I'm gonna let you

668
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,600
respond Brandon but I don't think there

669
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,500
can be in his that that model any true

670
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,559
responsibility and then this solution of

671
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,840
like but I feel like I have it to me it

672
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,120
doesn't give you anything additional

673
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,760
like you're just an epic phenomenon and

674
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,980
to me that can be almost worse like he's

675
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,679
given a nice spin on the positive way

676
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:17,940
you can see it but there's other people

677
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,980
like illusionists that say you know we

678
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,440
have this phenomenal experience it feels

679
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,820
like I have free will but there's

680
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,159
absolutely no responsibility like Sam

681
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,919
Harris was like I don't have pride uh a

682
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:29,880
friend was just talking to me about this

683
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,039
because he's a Sam Harris fan but he's

684
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,840
turned off by this whole no free will

685
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,580
thing and then he hears Sam Harris

686
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,020
contradict himself all the time because

687
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,460
Sam Harris will say you don't have Free

688
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,620
Will and the whole thing is on Free Will

689
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,940
and then there's a little commercial for

690
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,559
his podcast where he goes you have the

691
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,240
freedom to choose to listen to this

692
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,760
podcast and it's like you're you're

693
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,760
using double talk like constantly so I

694
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,320
think it's very notable Sam Harris does

695
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,940
not tell that to his daughter

696
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,480
and he tells he says

697
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,400
they say to each other but he says I'm

698
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,539
not I'm not going to tell my kids

699
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,640
because it's going to make them you know

700
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,500
behave differently and like all these

701
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,299
bad things that I said but when they

702
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,440
grow up I'll tell them that they don't

703
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,419
have any agency when they're ready for

704
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,659
it but what I'm saying is all of that is

705
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:14,940
absolutely ridiculous talk it's

706
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,880
absolutely nonsense to be like

707
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,919
she doesn't have age I'm I'm not gonna

708
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,260
tell like everything he's doing is it

709
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,360
like the whole argument's completely

710
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,520
self-defeating in every way and there's

711
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,200
a lot of people that have tried to make

712
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,840
nice stories out of it but ultimately

713
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,700
they're contradicting themselves and

714
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,400
compat compatibilism in its current form

715
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,980
is a contradiction and people call it

716
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,380
out for that all the time

717
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,940
um but that doesn't stop the compatible

718
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,559
us because it seems like the best answer

719
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,419
it goes yeah but I experienced this

720
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,279
agency so it has to be real on some

721
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,320
level but then how can we go against

722
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,659
this determinism it seems to go against

723
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,179
causality in general so it's like

724
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:56,460
a lot of people like Dan didn't their

725
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,140
solution was like you know I'm not going

726
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,419
to go against

727
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,000
um these sorts of like you know I'm not

728
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,059
gonna go against uh determinism or

729
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,620
causality which I'm saying it doesn't go

730
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,659
against causality but they think the

731
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:11,460
best solution is to try to do some magic

732
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,740
and make both these things work together

733
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,360
um yeah so we can talk more about that

734
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,940
but yeah maybe you have a response that

735
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,159
please yeah yeah I was just gonna throw

736
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,059
in

737
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:22,860
um you know something that we had

738
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,320
grounded this in before was the idea

739
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,340
that uh you know we choose not to act on

740
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,559
on the back of that right so there's

741
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,299
that balance of you know what I'm

742
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:35,100
talking about right yeah yeah if you yes

743
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,080
if you believe that it's going to affect

744
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,820
your behavior too and what I'm gonna

745
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,980
argue is that you won't exercise your

746
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,380
agency as much as you would

747
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,100
uh uh if you don't believe it

748
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,440
um along those lines part of what really

749
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,840
concerns me about the

750
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,919
um

751
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,900
anti-free will rhetoric is because like

752
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,480
an agency like so like active inference

753
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,919
that like Carl sometimes say like you

754
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:00,419
know there's certain optimism that's

755
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:02,400
required like that's just built into it

756
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,179
for the way you pursue goals like

757
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,039
um predicting them into being and so

758
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,380
like if you don't pers if you're not if

759
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,840
you stop believing in yourself as a

760
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,820
cause being able to predict certain

761
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,039
goals that actually could be a real

762
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,520
problem I believe it is a real problem

763
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,779
and that actually these people living

764
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:27,720
this are already not behaving optimally

765
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,940
not making decisions optimally here's

766
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,320
the thing that you may see Sam Harris a

767
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,059
really successful guy how do you explain

768
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:36,659
that it's because he's living to he he

769
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:39,059
he has a split personality the part of

770
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:41,640
him that believe like is like plumped

771
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,919
about doing all this stuff it's

772
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,960
disconnected from the part of him that

773
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,399
really believes that he has no agency

774
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,380
um and you've seen that in those studies

775
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,980
where they will like you see people lose

776
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,840
that belief and it changes their

777
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,320
behavior so my point is if if that's the

778
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,659
way reality is then we have to tell the

779
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:05,159
truth that's what Sam Harris says like

780
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:06,240
I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you

781
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,940
but what I'm saying is that idea is

782
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,380
built on a mountain of language

783
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,700
ambiguities that are creating this

784
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,740
problem and

785
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,140
um just a misunderstanding of of

786
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,480
causation because if you think all

787
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,000
causation is bottom up which means that

788
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
the system is not there's no higher

789
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,500
level control

790
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,640
um and this is kind of getting into

791
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,140
details that I need to give some more

792
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,419
background for but if it's all bottom-up

793
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:36,840
causation then there is no room for

794
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,820
agency but if you have top-down

795
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,640
causation and the whole system is this

796
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,740
control center

797
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,899
um it's a cybernetic control system

798
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:48,480
that's basically

799
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,220
um

800
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,120
um we can explain this later but what I

801
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,799
will argue is that the evolutionary

802
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,779
process

803
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:00,720
um accumulates knowledge uh so adaptive

804
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,760
information in

805
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,100
um biological systems so predictive

806
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,260
information about the environment the

807
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,000
knowledge the adaptations that are being

808
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,380
acquired through Evolution correspond to

809
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,500
um genes and

810
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,740
um you know neural connections that

811
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,419
um

812
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:24,419
uh basically encode information about

813
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,820
the external world and that's what

814
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,539
starts to give a system agency and

815
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:32,100
that's why living systems behave

816
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,600
differently than inanimate systems and

817
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,220
um that is because the system has gained

818
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,880
causal power so the system as a coherent

819
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,919
unit

820
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:49,559
um is starting to control the components

821
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,059
that it's made of and the trajectory

822
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,640
that the system follows

823
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,640
um and so for example Philip ball is a

824
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,080
journalist who's been writing about this

825
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,640
a lot like one of the most respected

826
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,860
science journals but if you drop a

827
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,440
pigeon and a rock off a tower The Rock

828
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,260
You can predict with Newtonian uh

829
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,240
mechanics you can with with classical

830
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,919
physics equations You can predict the

831
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:12,840
trajectory of the rock you can't predict

832
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,640
the trajectory of the bird so there's

833
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,980
something fundamentally different about

834
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,140
those two things and I'm saying that

835
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,940
behavioral distinction is what we have

836
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,220
to call agency now that doesn't give us

837
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,919
get us to free will but it shows us that

838
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,419
there's some sort of causal difference

839
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:30,539
between biological systems and inanimate

840
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:32,580
systems and this used to be attributed

841
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,919
to vitalism what I'm saying is that

842
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,559
vitalism wasn't necessarily wrong we

843
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,360
just didn't know what that vital force

844
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,640
was and now we have a name for it and we

845
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,159
call it information

846
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,220
um so I kind of veered from the point

847
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,419
maybe but um yeah what was uh

848
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:53,279
I can't remember what I was answering

849
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,539
with that

850
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,539
um

851
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,940
yeah so maybe we should finish up the

852
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,020
Nietzsche thing and then I should get

853
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,760
into some slides and then we should uh

854
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,039
come back to this yeah I was just gonna

855
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,840
say real quick again I think Bobby I

856
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,399
think what you're articulating I mean

857
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:09,899
having read your book and you know

858
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:12,360
talked with you a lot about your work I

859
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,860
think we're very much on the same page

860
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,440
uh I was very much also at the same time

861
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,000
doing a devil's advocate thing though

862
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,220
for a couple of reasons and it would it

863
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,200
would derail us too much from the

864
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,700
present topic which is more important

865
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,980
than trying to make a devil's advocate a

866
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,799
case living with determinism so yeah

867
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,159
well I I told Daniel that I'm a

868
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,960
recovering determinist that's kind of

869
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,220
that's kind of what I want to do here

870
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,200
because I said if you don't if we don't

871
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,299
hear the criticism then the people who

872
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:41,640
don't agree with this I'm not going to

873
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,700
answer so you said that yeah I would

874
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,140
just like to push you a little bit more

875
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,880
to explain

876
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,519
yeah if if it's purely deterministic

877
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,679
what's where's the responsibility that

878
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:55,080
Nietzsche is talking about yeah well let

879
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,360
me say maybe a couple things too

880
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,380
um uh that adds further context here

881
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,120
um there's sort of a tradition uh

882
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,679
uh of

883
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,480
let's say

884
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,020
using historical uh philosophical or

885
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,418
even theological categories

886
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:18,480
um and the kind of uh Frameworks that

887
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,040
those used to provide for making sense

888
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,020
of really important

889
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,359
um Concepts and ways of being in the

890
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:26,699
world and then presuming that if someone

891
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,440
deviated from those that there would be

892
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,899
these natural natural necessary sort of

893
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:32,699
implications that would flow from

894
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:34,859
thinking differently about something uh

895
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:37,139
the classic case in my experience has

896
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:40,320
been oh we need morality and moral facts

897
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,239
to make us good people as soon as you

898
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,619
don't believe in moral facts you'll

899
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:46,440
become you know a a terrible human being

900
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,800
and that's not true uh you know people

901
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,139
who don't believe in moral facts in the

902
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,239
kind of traditional way uh can find all

903
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,720
sorts of groundings for their yeah but

904
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,480
sorry to interrupted but I do I can see

905
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,220
like these language things going on like

906
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,920
everywhere in these discussions so for

907
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,720
example

908
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,980
um

909
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,320
yeah so

910
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,000
you're saying that people don't need

911
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,220
morality and that these people but then

912
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,560
you said traditional morality so that

913
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,820
was the point I was going to make is

914
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,119
that the people who let's say you don't

915
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,060
believe that there's any

916
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,960
purposefulness in nature there's no

917
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,400
teleologies there's like everything is

918
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,020
random and accidental

919
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,119
then they go well you know what that

920
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:32,220
doesn't make me depressed I'm actually

921
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,220
this is the only time I'm you know this

922
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,200
is all we've got so I better make it

923
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,359
count there's no afterlife

924
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,339
um so what I'm saying is they're still

925
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,920
deriving morals from this

926
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,680
uh Paradigm and they're actually

927
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,380
deriving meaning and purposeful

928
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,640
principles out of this so they're really

929
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,500
um

930
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,520
um in a way there they still see some

931
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,680
they're they're still finding what they

932
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,740
need to find to

933
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,140
um behave in an optimal way but what I'm

934
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,880
saying is that that's kind of a

935
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,359
teleological View and they're not fully

936
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:14,880
sticking to their Paradigm with no

937
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,800
assumptions they're building on lots of

938
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,720
assumptions and you get this morality

939
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,760
that ends up looking exactly like

940
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,160
religion once you map it out and you go

941
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,640
oh yeah like the golden rule for example

942
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,960
the Golden Rule you don't need a

943
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,599
religion or the Golden Rule you just

944
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,880
need to know that you're an agent there

945
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,380
are other agents like you they're like

946
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,839
you they also experience happiness and

947
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:38,099
suffering therefore I'm going to treat

948
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:40,980
them like I would want to be treated and

949
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,839
also there's an incentive to do that

950
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:45,540
because then they can treat me that way

951
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,980
um then they'll treat me as I've treated

952
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,060
them but the Golden Rule could be a

953
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,040
basis for

954
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,060
a religion and a moral postulate so are

955
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,839
they really moral morally free free of

956
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:04,320
moral facts are or are they creating a

957
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,839
set of morals from

958
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,640
a paradigm that's supposed to be

959
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,520
completely moral free but maybe it's not

960
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,260
because what I'm saying basically is

961
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,820
they're kind of

962
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,400
converging on this kind of purposeful

963
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,920
narrative without even realizing it well

964
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,240
yeah I mean there's a there's a lot

965
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,380
there I mean I would say what you're

966
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,820
getting at which is important which is

967
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,079
there is often a performative

968
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:26,760
contradiction that we're engaged in

969
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,800
we're asserting something logically and

970
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,839
then our our actions are sort of you

971
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:32,579
know suggesting otherwise I mean if I if

972
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:34,680
I'm a solipsist and I say you know I

973
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,420
believe in solipsism and I think this is

974
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,800
right it's sort of like well wait why

975
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,320
are you telling me that you know like uh

976
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,660
so there's there's that element to it uh

977
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,359
there are actually though some rather

978
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:47,220
detailed arguments you could make that

979
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,020
get into things like

980
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,119
um well yes I'm a solipsist but I'm

981
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,619
talking to you about it because your

982
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:54,540
projection of me and it's still

983
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,980
worthwhile for me to have projections

984
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,880
with my you know conversational

985
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,579
projections to myself Etc and there are

986
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:01,200
versions of that for the free will sort

987
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,320
of a thing right that's you could but I

988
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,940
think there's fallacies with all of that

989
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,980
so for example let's say and there's a a

990
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,000
old joke about

991
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,240
the teacher gives a lecture on solipsism

992
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,420
and why solipsism can't be refuted and

993
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,160
the student comes up to him after the

994
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,440
lecture and says oh you're a solipsist

995
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,000
too like he's happy to meet another

996
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,220
solipsist but the whole point is that

997
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,780
the other person doesn't exist so you're

998
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,880
very happy to meet yourself but so what

999
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,000
I would say is let's follow that anytime

1000
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,400
okay so then we would do a little game

1001
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,020
where we break that down or what I'm

1002
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,460
saying when you start to break all those

1003
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,960
things down they lead you back to the

1004
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,839
same road so let's say you're not real

1005
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:44,700
Brendan you're a projection of my mind

1006
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,400
but what does that mean

1007
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,099
Brendan is a projection of my mind but

1008
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:52,020
you're an agent and you have different

1009
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:55,320
beliefs than me as I know myself here

1010
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,820
and you're going to do things you're

1011
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,079
going to behave in ways that are

1012
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,180
different than I would

1013
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,520
then I would behave because you have a

1014
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,320
different set of beliefs ultimately

1015
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,540
compared to actually the me I know even

1016
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,180
if you're really me what I'm saying is

1017
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,920
that really me

1018
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,200
doesn't really have any meaning because

1019
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,599
when you start to Define you as this

1020
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,119
agent even if you make this metaphysical

1021
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:21,780
claim that you're a projection of me

1022
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,540
for all practical purposes you are an

1023
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,640
agent within this system that has a

1024
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,960
different set of beliefs than what I

1025
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,339
know that behaves differently so what

1026
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:30,420
I'm saying is even the thought

1027
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,460
experiment has this language fall

1028
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,320
because you come back to the equivalence

1029
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,300
of it's not really a meaningful

1030
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,160
statement to say whether it's me or not

1031
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,880
if it has all these properties that

1032
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,560
counts as

1033
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,280
an individual agent in the reality that

1034
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,320
we can be aware of if that makes sense

1035
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,020
yeah and I think we I agree if we really

1036
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,520
followed this through I think we would

1037
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,500
converge to the same point which for me

1038
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,940
tends to be well I'll frame this a

1039
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,380
little bit by saying something like you

1040
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,020
know uh you know Hume we were talking

1041
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,400
you're just mentioning earlier about how

1042
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,079
like you know Sam Harris said I wouldn't

1043
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,240
tell that to my daughter you know Hume

1044
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,339
skeptic would question well will the sun

1045
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,320
actually rise Etc but he made the point

1046
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,520
that basically once he puts his

1047
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,440
philosopher pen down and he goes and

1048
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,300
leaves his study he's now living like a

1049
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,820
regular person now you could say so what

1050
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,140
there's a there's a potentially

1051
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,359
meaningful distinction between the

1052
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,640
pragmatism and the sort of intellectual

1053
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,640
logical uh you know coherence let's say

1054
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,440
but I do think that there's a meaningful

1055
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,180
way that we can actually collapse those

1056
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,500
in a way that should be collapsed

1057
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,820
because

1058
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,280
um because it would lead to something

1059
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,460
like uh what information about reality

1060
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,820
has a has causal power for sustaining my

1061
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,980
viability and flourishing in the face of

1062
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,079
entropy right kind of tie back in some

1063
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,720
of this free energy principle you know

1064
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,400
Bayesian updating sort of thing here

1065
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,720
right so

1066
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,579
um you know and this is the point that

1067
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,980
uh that you introduced me about the work

1068
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,780
of like kolchinsky and walpert which

1069
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,640
I've made great use of of thinking about

1070
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,740
meaningful information as being that

1071
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,940
meaning that a system uh produces by

1072
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,800
processing information about its

1073
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,420
environment that ultimately AIDS its

1074
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,280
viability right now if what we're

1075
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,859
talking about in a pragmatic sense has a

1076
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:16,200
deleterious effect on our viability

1077
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,599
because of our Concepts then we might

1078
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,820
say that that actually is decreasing our

1079
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,040
viability and therefore we might be

1080
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,900
inclined to say are if that's our sort

1081
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,579
of Criterion for asserting information

1082
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:29,760
as being an accurate model of reality uh

1083
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,619
which I'm not sure of a better one and

1084
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:33,300
we could say that things like skepticism

1085
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,920
women's solipsism are are untrue on that

1086
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,440
ground if that if if that line makes any

1087
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,820
sense you could really start to unpack

1088
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,140
that but I think that that might be

1089
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,579
where we'd ultimately converge an

1090
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:46,560
agreement on some of this points on some

1091
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,119
of these points

1092
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:51,420
yeah so five minutes

1093
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,859
um I'm gonna have to run in five minutes

1094
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:54,960
unfortunately so I'll just like throw in

1095
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,180
a quick a couple of quick thoughts um oh

1096
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,099
let me just say one sentence

1097
00:41:59,099 --> 00:41:59,760
um

1098
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,619
before I forget

1099
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,480
um maybe I already forgot

1100
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,380
um

1101
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,359
let's see okay go ahead Adam I'll try to

1102
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:07,980
remember it sorry

1103
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,380
um that's okay so

1104
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,240
um oh sorry yeah when you were talking

1105
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,619
about viability like all these

1106
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:15,839
explanations like oh well maybe I don't

1107
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,359
have free will but being optimistic has

1108
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:20,820
some positive effect what I'm trying to

1109
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,280
say is if the micro scale determinism is

1110
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,680
true and we're gonna break that's one

1111
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,960
point I want to make there's determinism

1112
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,520
when people are saying that word it's

1113
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,740
conflating two different things there's

1114
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,660
physical determinism that I'm talking

1115
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,400
about like micro determinism where

1116
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,260
everything is just this model like where

1117
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,420
you have these atoms are basically pool

1118
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,740
balls and they're following these

1119
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,380
trajectories well I'll get to that in a

1120
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,240
slide but that's a different kind of

1121
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,339
determinism than saying that your genes

1122
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:50,040
and experiences

1123
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,700
um uh give rise to what you do

1124
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,640
um my point is if you're saying all

1125
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,980
these if the micro scale determinism is

1126
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,619
true there's no need to even talk about

1127
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:04,020
oh optimism helps me there's there's no

1128
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,640
like oh even being optimistic because

1129
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,000
like all that biological level talk is

1130
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,400
causally redundant so basically if

1131
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,339
there's micro scale determinism

1132
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:15,420
genes even aren't determining anything

1133
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,760
that's causal over determinism you're

1134
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,500
saying okay the genes cause my behavior

1135
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,240
but then you said the atoms cause my

1136
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,099
behavior so my point is if micro scale

1137
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,440
determinism is true you don't even have

1138
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,839
genes determining your behavior it's an

1139
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,000
incoherent argument and Sam Harris is

1140
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,260
conflating these two types of

1141
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,940
determinism and flipping back and forth

1142
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,339
so what I'm saying is we got to break

1143
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:37,740
this down and what uh agency what

1144
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,780
top-down causation does is it overcomes

1145
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,300
this physical determinism and then

1146
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,980
there's biological determinism that

1147
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,140
determines what agents will do

1148
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,180
um and I'm saying that Consciousness and

1149
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,980
self-awareness reflective thought is

1150
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,800
what overrides biological determinism

1151
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,099
and that's when basic quickly your

1152
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:58,980
higher mind like this monitoring kind of

1153
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,619
prefrontal Cortex executive control like

1154
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:03,720
the mind that's responsible for that

1155
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,640
there's access Consciousness versus

1156
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,680
phenomenal Consciousness distinction so

1157
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,720
that mind can override your biological

1158
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,940
programming your impulsive actions so

1159
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,400
when we have this hierarchical model we

1160
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,560
see that there's multiple there's two

1161
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,780
types of determinism at least and then

1162
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,819
there's multiple types of top-down

1163
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:24,480
causation which overcome those things so

1164
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,540
not to say that that argument

1165
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,579
doesn't hold up like we have to talk

1166
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:31,500
about determinism as far as like your

1167
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,240
you know genes determining your behavior

1168
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,520
but my point is if someone believes in

1169
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,160
microscale determinism then these higher

1170
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,619
level things when people say oh you know

1171
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:42,420
your genes are deciding what you're

1172
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,640
doing that would those things would also

1173
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,200
be at the phenomenal those would be

1174
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,000
shorthands because you could actually

1175
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,560
look at the genes and you could see a

1176
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,760
bunch of particles and then you could

1177
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,619
use newtonians trajectories just applied

1178
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:54,300
to the particles the genes are

1179
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,280
phenomenal now the neurons are

1180
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,720
epiphenomenal

1181
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,700
so it's a level of new I don't know Adam

1182
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,560
have you thought about that at all

1183
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,440
yeah the um that's kind of my not part

1184
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,839
of my agnosticism is like is there such

1185
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:09,660
a thing as a true atomism does causation

1186
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,400
even make sense if it's just like an

1187
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,460
undifferentiated like uh Quantum field

1188
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,260
for instance like as soon as we're

1189
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,180
talking about particles or kinds of any

1190
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:22,440
anything we can even name or pick out

1191
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,319
um are we basically course screening and

1192
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:27,420
are we in kind of like a

1193
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,920
um and and then like when we say micro

1194
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,660
uh why don't we just keep going like

1195
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,099
isn't it already someone like an

1196
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,440
instrumental for a given purpose but in

1197
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,960
terms of it's like I've been like and

1198
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,339
I've kind of kept these separate like

1199
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:43,980
these issues of like the philosophy of

1200
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,599
causation like the hammings of Free Will

1201
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,220
so like I've tended to focus on like

1202
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,079
functional cybernetic Free Will

1203
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,540
basically the planning and and like the

1204
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,180
the architecture of choice and like

1205
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,740
being able to like

1206
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,420
um suss out different options and

1207
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,280
evaluate counterfactuals that you then

1208
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,740
like have different control energy for

1209
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,660
the system but I think there could be

1210
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,220
really interesting connections between

1211
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,160
how we handle causation though and where

1212
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,720
within the control hierarchy and the way

1213
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,300
you're describing of like were um what's

1214
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,040
responsible for what so like ways in

1215
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,020
which like system two can override

1216
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,180
system one or like that's absolutely

1217
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,040
what I want to develop here because I

1218
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,020
think you can bridge this low level

1219
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,060
causation discussion that I'm talking

1220
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:27,119
about which for example Paul Davis and

1221
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,079
Sarah Walker have written about

1222
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,760
informational control and that's with

1223
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,260
the origin of life there's this change

1224
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,940
in the causal structure of the system

1225
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,060
and then it gains this agency and that's

1226
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,339
what I focused on a lot in part one of

1227
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:39,660
the book

1228
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,700
um and so what I'm saying is

1229
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,180
Adam's work focuses on basically this

1230
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,520
Free Will topic where I'm saying that

1231
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,319
there's this even higher level system

1232
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:51,540
Beyond just normal biological agents

1233
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,220
that comes with not just Consciousness

1234
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,420
but

1235
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,579
an ability to create counterfactuals in

1236
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:58,319
imagination so it's like a prefrontal

1237
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,760
cortex sort of

1238
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,319
higher self

1239
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,700
um and a lot of people say that

1240
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,980
self-solution that's why I love to fall

1241
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,599
back on Adam's work because it really

1242
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,579
breaks down the cell from a mechanistic

1243
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:10,440
perspective

1244
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,900
um but that's exactly what we can do we

1245
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,940
can look at the space of counterfactuals

1246
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,520
and as we will see that I think there is

1247
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,200
some indeterminism at the fundamental

1248
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,020
level of reality that propagates up and

1249
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,480
that's what you know you see with chaos

1250
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,980
even though it's called deterministic

1251
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,140
chaos and that's a whole other issue to

1252
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,260
get into but basically

1253
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,420
um I'm saying that there are choices and

1254
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,720
that the world's trajectory is not set

1255
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,599
in stone and there's some variation and

1256
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,920
when we as agents

1257
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,180
um consider the space of counter

1258
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,800
factuals and then choose something

1259
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,480
specifically

1260
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,280
um it may be something like we're going

1261
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,839
to make a choice and then our biases

1262
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,480
like our impulsive decision is to make a

1263
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,660
certain Choice like reflexively based on

1264
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,579
like how we feel and you know our

1265
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:01,440
genetic programming and our experiences

1266
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,480
but then we can have another process

1267
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,940
where we go okay is this decision

1268
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,060
optimal given my principles I have this

1269
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,380
higher self now I think about like

1270
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,359
what's good what I want to do what are

1271
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:13,920
my long-term goals

1272
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,220
and that that is the mechanism that

1273
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,720
corresponds to what people mean when

1274
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,359
they talk about free will

1275
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,240
um and so I'm excited about that you

1276
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,339
know and and working with Adam to to

1277
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:29,160
explain that to people who you know are

1278
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,720
just think that there's no way Free Will

1279
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,920
can work because he's looked at the

1280
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,140
talks about these mechanisms from this

1281
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,460
you know cybernetic and computational

1282
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,859
neuroscience perspective and formalize

1283
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:39,839
them people like Sabina hasenfelder like

1284
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,579
physicists are like saying there's no

1285
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:43,319
way freaking Free Will can be compatible

1286
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:44,819
with a causal picture of the world I

1287
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:46,680
don't think that's true but what I

1288
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,760
wanted you know and Adam's going to

1289
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,319
leave so he's unfortunately part of this

1290
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:51,780
but he'll see it later I think we can

1291
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,060
Bridge Adam's work at this higher level

1292
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,640
to this low-level causation stuff to

1293
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,140
actually have a causal story where

1294
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,700
there's actually still cause and effect

1295
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,180
but there's higher level causation

1296
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:07,140
um that can basically override the sort

1297
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,300
of cause the lower level bottom-up

1298
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,880
causation and then you even get these

1299
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,520
higher levels where you can have

1300
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,960
um that sort of causation being

1301
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,140
overridden by conscious like mental

1302
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,400
causation so you would have bottom

1303
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,859
causation and then top-down causation

1304
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:25,140
and then mental causation and top down

1305
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,700
in mental causation they would all be

1306
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,560
like looped under like you know

1307
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,359
categorized in or downward causation or

1308
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:31,319
you could call them all top-down

1309
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:33,720
causation but there are differences when

1310
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,119
Consciousness emerges that allows for

1311
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:38,579
what could be called new causal power

1312
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:40,200
things are working in a similar way but

1313
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,359
you will see a behavioral change when

1314
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:44,160
you get Consciousness that will allow

1315
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,660
for

1316
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:48,000
things like technology things that

1317
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,300
require imagination uh counterfactual

1318
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,760
generation that can't be achieved with

1319
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,500
the lower level intelligence

1320
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,180
and that we can actually construct a

1321
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,220
causal picture that is perfectly in line

1322
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,460
with everything we know about causality

1323
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,380
but when you do this you realize that

1324
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,599
the bottom-up story and I haven't really

1325
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:08,280
defined that you know you guys know what

1326
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,599
I'm talking about but I haven't defined

1327
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,780
it for their listeners but that when you

1328
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,400
have this story of causation you have

1329
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,140
agents emerge and they're actually

1330
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,599
control centers that can initiate causal

1331
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,819
chains and they do it for reasons

1332
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:23,160
there's always reasons that you want to

1333
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,380
make a certain decision over another so

1334
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,760
some people think because you have a

1335
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,260
reason that's a cause that somehow

1336
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,240
that's not free will but if you didn't

1337
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,680
have a reason for it you would be doing

1338
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,240
it randomly and that wouldn't be free

1339
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,800
will either so free will just has to be

1340
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,900
reconceptualized within this framework

1341
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,900
and it's not full free will but full

1342
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,020
free will wouldn't be free will in the

1343
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,640
in the first place because again it

1344
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,319
would be random if it was not based on a

1345
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:51,359
reason but what I'm saying is that your

1346
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,660
reason even though it's a Cause

1347
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:58,140
um the reasons uh it's not determined

1348
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,900
because basically

1349
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:01,619
um

1350
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:03,720
it's it's not determined in the same

1351
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,940
sense that people are talking about with

1352
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,160
physical determinism we'll get to this

1353
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,359
there's no way I can do it without

1354
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,760
looking at the slides but if anyone has

1355
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,339
any comments about what I just said

1356
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:17,880
uh and Adam I know you gotta go so any

1357
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,880
final concluding thoughts

1358
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,180
um I am furious that I have to go but um

1359
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,040
I'm really uh I'm looking forward to

1360
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,260
tuning in a bit so uh talk to you soon

1361
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,640
all right see Adam thanks for coming

1362
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:37,260
yeah if anybody wants to read Adam's uh

1363
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,000
papers on integrated World modeling

1364
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,420
Theory and yeah uh cybernetic free will

1365
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:43,680
you can just Google his name in those

1366
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,119
terms and you'll see some great papers

1367
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,119
and some you know really uh respected

1368
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:49,920
journals like entropy I think is the

1369
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,660
integrated World modeling everyone yeah

1370
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,700
um Michael

1371
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,839
no I I was just uh I'm just trying to

1372
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:01,859
again do my job it's uh Daniel I did

1373
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:04,380
want to ask uh your thoughts about you

1374
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:07,079
know active inter inference or inference

1375
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:10,520
at this juncture

1376
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,260
yeah any thoughts about active inference

1377
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,880
how that applies to anything we've said

1378
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,400
already and I will link it to that soon

1379
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,900
because I know a lot of listeners that's

1380
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,200
what you're they're interested in

1381
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,300
I'll definitely look forward to how you

1382
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,540
link it but although active inference is

1383
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,819
this incredible modern composable

1384
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:32,700
framework for on one hand cognitive

1385
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,859
modeling and on the other hand the

1386
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:37,740
actual embodied situational modeling a

1387
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,780
lot of the reason why people get into it

1388
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,819
get curious start participating in The

1389
00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:44,220
Institute is exactly the topic of

1390
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,440
self-help and self-improvement and

1391
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,480
personal decision making amidst

1392
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,740
multi-scale uncertainty and so there's

1393
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:55,319
among the many gaps between Theory and

1394
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:58,220
application or practice one of them is

1395
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:01,380
utilizing these kinds of multi-scale

1396
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,660
information geometry decision making

1397
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:06,240
moment of choice type Frameworks for

1398
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,119
what for what we actually do so this is

1399
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,559
something that really strikes at the

1400
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,680
heart of what we do as infra ants and

1401
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,300
I'm just looking forward to how you

1402
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,400
frame it in this narrative and then we

1403
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,960
can come back to some more technical

1404
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,180
details too yeah so we're going to cap

1405
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:25,079
it at eight I guess at 7 50 I don't know

1406
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:26,460
if you'll have many questions in the

1407
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,839
chat

1408
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,280
um but I'm gonna try to give the

1409
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,579
presentation in the next like 45 minutes

1410
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:35,400
um but feel free feel free to comment on

1411
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,680
stuff that will still be helpful but I

1412
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,720
guess we shouldn't get too far into like

1413
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,599
make a comment so we can mark it I might

1414
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:43,920
give a little answer and then we'll come

1415
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,020
back to it but I prefer that you speak

1416
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,819
up because then we'll know what to come

1417
00:53:47,819 --> 00:53:49,619
back to

1418
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:50,300
um

1419
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,920
so I'll say a few more things about

1420
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,960
causality because they're important and

1421
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,300
then I'll get into kind of the bigger

1422
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,800
picture of the theory and then

1423
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,020
specifically the self-help teleological

1424
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,359
stance which is you know the free energy

1425
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:07,260
principle comes into play there and

1426
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:09,480
um yeah then we can talk about practical

1427
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,640
applications for the individual and for

1428
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,640
society because the goal is that this

1429
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,160
system can be used it's kind of like a

1430
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,099
theory of everything so it explains

1431
00:54:19,099 --> 00:54:21,599
reality but that it can be used to

1432
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,880
improve your life as an individual but

1433
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,940
also be used to figure out how to sort

1434
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,220
of optimize our social systems political

1435
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,040
systems so it kind of creates

1436
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,500
a logic that could be used to base like

1437
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,540
a new like a political party on like a

1438
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,740
third party or something which would be

1439
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,480
great if we had a party kind of based on

1440
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,819
systems thinking we kind of need a not

1441
00:54:41,819 --> 00:54:44,700
like a bipartisan ideology right now

1442
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:48,839
that's not based on anything other than

1443
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:49,940
um

1444
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,859
evidence-based things that we know can

1445
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:55,800
be used to to optimize systems not that

1446
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,960
that's everything but what I'm saying is

1447
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,359
it provides a foundation that then the

1448
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:01,400
ethical

1449
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,460
uh and kind of moral

1450
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,160
stances emerge from and if you don't see

1451
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,460
this basic Cosmic story then you will be

1452
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:15,000
confused about ethical issues and what I

1453
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,920
will argue is that folk psychology

1454
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,880
ethics all of that stuff it was it's I I

1455
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,440
believe

1456
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,920
is consistent with this view because it

1457
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,960
was kind of intuitive that this is the

1458
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,380
story of Nature and that it will kind of

1459
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,480
ease that cognitive dissonance for

1460
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,740
people who have accepted the

1461
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,059
reductionist view

1462
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:37,619
like I know a lot of people have

1463
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:39,000
accepted this view that there's no

1464
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,500
agency that there's just the strict

1465
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,599
determinism but then they want to use

1466
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:44,819
you know this free energy principle type

1467
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:46,740
things to improve their life but that's

1468
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,319
kind of a contradiction because

1469
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:51,839
are they choosing to improve it or is

1470
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,460
there just one trajectory that's set in

1471
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,040
stone and and and so I think that

1472
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,920
getting this stuff straight will allow

1473
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,920
people to embrace stuff like the free

1474
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,240
energy principle and apply it to their

1475
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,280
lives because they go okay this I can

1476
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,980
actually use this and I can do that and

1477
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,160
I can create change in myself and in the

1478
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,859
society I'm a part of but with this old

1479
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:16,140
model there's no hope for change because

1480
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,240
there's only one trajectory and so if

1481
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,280
Nietzsche really took that seriously it

1482
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,800
would be

1483
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,640
no reason to really talk about

1484
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,559
responsibility because it's just purely

1485
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:27,839
a block time

1486
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:30,420
Frozen thing where the Futures already

1487
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,240
determined from the initial State and

1488
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,040
the fact that it would repeat over and

1489
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,800
over is just even more hell it's like

1490
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,960
determinism was bad enough now you have

1491
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,059
to experience not having you know an

1492
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:45,000
illusion uh forever

1493
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,339
um so what I want to offer is a

1494
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:48,900
different model that we can't fully get

1495
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:52,980
into but what I would what I have called

1496
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,920
Eternal recursive emergence and so that

1497
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,079
it's not a cyclical process it's

1498
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:59,520
actually a process of the universe

1499
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,760
evolving and maybe giving rise

1500
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,619
um to something new potentially like a

1501
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:06,000
new universe

1502
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,079
um there's cosmological National

1503
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:08,339
selection we don't have to go there we

1504
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:10,200
have to talk about like what what

1505
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,400
you know

1506
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,880
anything outside of this universe but

1507
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:15,660
um

1508
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,599
my point is that

1509
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:19,559
um

1510
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:23,220
yeah so what I want to show is that the

1511
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,920
universe is uh not an arbitrary system

1512
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,140
it's not random it is a system that

1513
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,059
exhibits a design you can say it's the

1514
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:32,160
appearance of a design maybe it's not

1515
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,180
really designed but there's there's

1516
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:36,359
qualities that can't be explained

1517
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:38,280
um if the universe was the only Universe

1518
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,540
in all of reality yeah uh you you

1519
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,819
couldn't have that theory either there's

1520
00:57:44,819 --> 00:57:48,839
a designer that designed it that way or

1521
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:51,359
there's a larger reality with a

1522
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,980
Multiverse that would explain this

1523
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,780
fine-tuning and that's where basically

1524
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,819
science went they said okay it looks

1525
00:57:56,819 --> 00:57:57,839
like there's a Creator because the

1526
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,059
fine-tuning problem but we can't accept

1527
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,760
that so we have to consider this

1528
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,859
Multiverse option but the Multiverse

1529
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:07,200
option is just as weird as a Creator it

1530
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,000
leads to all kinds of crazy things like

1531
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,680
other universes where there's every

1532
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,780
possible version of you

1533
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,240
um so it probably has just as much

1534
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,700
baggage as the Creator thing but then

1535
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,160
there's cosmological natural selection

1536
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,079
which basically is an evolutionary

1537
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,660
explanation where basically universes

1538
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:27,119
give rise to other universes and there's

1539
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,339
this darwinian selection principle that

1540
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,559
would lead to like a universe optimized

1541
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:35,099
for like complexity growth in life uh

1542
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:36,960
essentially like spreading like

1543
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,640
continuously so we don't really need to

1544
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,700
get in those metaphysical topics but uh

1545
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:45,059
I just wanted to State up front that

1546
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:47,220
um the universe does have something that

1547
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,280
uh we could call it design but when I

1548
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,500
say that don't assume that I am talking

1549
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:56,099
about it being created by some sort of

1550
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,720
conscious intelligent agent it could be

1551
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,540
this evolutionary process

1552
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,940
um but it's not random it's not

1553
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,160
arbitrary and that's the big mistake is

1554
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,740
that we have models of a random system

1555
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:09,960
like a gas that's what boltzmann used to

1556
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,099
kind of

1557
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:13,740
try to have a statistical foundation of

1558
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,960
the second law of Thermodynamics and the

1559
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,940
problem is we base the Dynamics of that

1560
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,640
inanimate system I mean we we understood

1561
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,079
the Dynamics of that inanimate system

1562
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,640
and then we assume that the Universe

1563
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,160
behaved the same way and that led to all

1564
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,839
of these

1565
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:30,180
um bad assumptions that created this

1566
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,400
nihilistic worldview so let me let me

1567
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,380
talk about that first

1568
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:37,619
if determinism is true like if there

1569
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:39,599
were no indeterminism at the lowest

1570
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,700
level for example

1571
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,319
um everything was just made of these

1572
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:45,660
atoms and these atoms were like

1573
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,540
classical scale objects like pool balls

1574
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,799
on a pool table

1575
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:51,720
and that you have all these atoms and if

1576
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,220
those atoms follow classical

1577
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,440
trajectories and they're just like

1578
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,299
basically you can imagine the universe

1579
00:59:57,299 --> 01:00:00,900
as a table of pool balls

1580
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,599
um then there's no room for anything

1581
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,720
there's one future trajectory and it's

1582
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,099
set in stone

1583
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:10,020
so if you believe that if you accept

1584
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,000
that world view

1585
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,579
there is no other future there's no

1586
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:17,700
changing it and if you believe that

1587
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,859
and you want to change your life you

1588
01:00:19,859 --> 01:00:21,119
have to and you're really taking this

1589
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,700
seriously you would have to ask yourself

1590
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,040
well if I change my life am I really

1591
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,960
changing it or was this the way it was

1592
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,099
always supposed to happen it was

1593
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:30,420
determined that I was going to change my

1594
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,819
life or are you saying like

1595
01:00:32,819 --> 01:00:34,799
it's determined in a way where you can't

1596
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,180
change your life so you shouldn't even

1597
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:38,520
try it leads to all these weird

1598
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,079
conclusions but what I'm saying is

1599
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,140
that's not the way reality is and that

1600
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,299
leads to like this world view where you

1601
01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:46,799
have no agency you can't get around it

1602
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,660
because if it's a purely pool ball

1603
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:49,799
universe

1604
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:53,040
then there's no agency

1605
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,200
um not only that so that's the first

1606
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,059
thing that's if if the world was

1607
01:00:57,059 --> 01:00:59,760
Newtonian at the micro level there would

1608
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,559
be no agency there would be one

1609
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:03,359
trajectory and there would be this block

1610
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,859
time thing it would just everything

1611
01:01:04,859 --> 01:01:07,200
would follow from the initial state in a

1612
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,559
way that was calculable from just

1613
01:01:09,559 --> 01:01:11,640
specifying the positions of every

1614
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,980
particle and applying Newton's laws to

1615
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,920
those and then we have some forces that

1616
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,420
interact but it doesn't really change

1617
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:19,680
the picture

1618
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,299
um so

1619
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:23,520
there's just one continual trajectory

1620
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,799
then boltzmann found that you know an

1621
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:28,440
inanimate system because all of in a gas

1622
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,420
for example so it's a specific type of

1623
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,359
system that boltzmann was using to

1624
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:35,040
derive the second law of Thermodynamics

1625
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,740
on a statistical Foundation

1626
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:39,540
um and it's not the way open systems

1627
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:42,720
work so first of all we should know that

1628
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,700
um

1629
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,260
he showed with statistical mechanics

1630
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,299
that if you have a gas so in a gas every

1631
01:01:48,299 --> 01:01:50,099
particle is uncorrelated it's just

1632
01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:52,500
moving around freely and in his model

1633
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,059
also people should know that this is

1634
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:55,559
before we understood the periodic table

1635
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:58,079
periodic table didn't come until like

1636
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:00,299
decades after boltzmann did this work so

1637
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:01,740
we didn't understand like chemical

1638
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:03,780
bonding for example we didn't understand

1639
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,299
a lot of things so in his model as an

1640
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:09,780
idealization used Spirit spherical like

1641
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,819
what would be marbles like spherical

1642
01:02:11,819 --> 01:02:14,420
round things that bump off each other

1643
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:17,040
elastically so they just bounce off each

1644
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,660
other they don't combine and interact

1645
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:21,720
with forces and if you have this picture

1646
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,880
if you if you have these things just

1647
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,440
bumping off each other interacting this

1648
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,240
way moving around

1649
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,799
um following these classical

1650
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:30,900
trajectories

1651
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:33,359
um not bound in any way you will get a

1652
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:36,299
transition from order

1653
01:02:36,299 --> 01:02:38,700
um to disorder if the system starts out

1654
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,280
in an ordered state of course

1655
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,799
because the disordered State there's

1656
01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:45,660
more possible ways to do that so if

1657
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,760
everything's moving around randomly you

1658
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,540
see this trajectory here that we see

1659
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:54,200
um and then so the idea but

1660
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,640
there's so much there were so many weird

1661
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,740
assumptions in trying to apply the star

1662
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,000
Universe like when you start to break

1663
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,500
them down like none of them really made

1664
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,720
sense so he was saying okay this is what

1665
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,339
has to happen you go from order to

1666
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:07,680
disorder

1667
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,839
um and this must wait be the way the

1668
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:12,180
universe is because this is what has to

1669
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,680
happen by statistical laws if

1670
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,940
everything's moving randomly if there's

1671
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:16,500
no magical forces do anything this is

1672
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,299
what happens

1673
01:03:18,299 --> 01:03:20,819
um so

1674
01:03:20,819 --> 01:03:22,500
um

1675
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,839
the problem with that

1676
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:26,700
uh

1677
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,920
uh basically

1678
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,380
well so

1679
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,420
one thing I should say is that's not

1680
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:36,780
even true if this was the way the world

1681
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,760
is

1682
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,680
um and people pointed this out to

1683
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,900
boltzmann

1684
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,720
given enough time if these are following

1685
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,520
these mechanical trajectories even the

1686
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,799
disordered state will go back to the

1687
01:03:49,799 --> 01:03:52,280
ordered State given enough time this is

1688
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:55,440
poincare's uh

1689
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,780
um recurrence theorem

1690
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,460
um kind of similar to nichi's Eternal

1691
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,859
recurrence but so the idea is that if

1692
01:04:01,859 --> 01:04:03,420
you have the system behaving this way

1693
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:06,780
you it would um basically all

1694
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:08,880
trajectories are possible and given

1695
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,559
enough time it will go from disorder and

1696
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,119
then we'll revert and people challenge

1697
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:13,740
boltzmann with this and he couldn't get

1698
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:16,859
away from that that possibility

1699
01:04:16,859 --> 01:04:18,660
um what I I lost my train of thought

1700
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:19,680
earlier

1701
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,660
um I didn't let you know I just went on

1702
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:23,160
to the next thing but what what I forgot

1703
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,640
to say was that um

1704
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:28,200
boltzmann was like the base of the

1705
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,700
problem of why is our universe look so

1706
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,440
complex if it goes from order to

1707
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,319
disorder and then that's where like so

1708
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:35,940
he had to say oh it must have started

1709
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,440
out really ordered because it can't go

1710
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,000
from disordered order so it must have

1711
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,220
been this highly ordered state which was

1712
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:43,200
the beginning of time this is low low

1713
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,119
entropy state

1714
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:46,859
but now we know that after the big bang

1715
01:04:46,859 --> 01:04:49,799
everything was homogeneous and then

1716
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:52,559
things started aggregating so it was

1717
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,200
literally an equilibrium State that's

1718
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,819
fully mixed up

1719
01:04:56,819 --> 01:04:59,099
High disorder State something closer to

1720
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:01,680
that before that and then things started

1721
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,900
Plumping and you get more organization

1722
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,180
so the story is completely the opposite

1723
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:08,579
of what we've been taught Julian Barber

1724
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:10,920
in his new book explains this that the

1725
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,359
trajectory of the universe is towards

1726
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:15,119
higher complexity and Order and that we

1727
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,099
made a mistake by applying this model of

1728
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:19,980
an inanimate system to the universe in

1729
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:22,380
its entirety when the universe has all

1730
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:24,900
of these batteries in the sky we call

1731
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,420
stars and their Driving Systems away

1732
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:28,859
from equilibrium

1733
01:05:28,859 --> 01:05:31,140
so then we had

1734
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,460
um

1735
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:37,920
Ilia pregogene in 1940 1950 1960 1970 I

1736
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,200
would say 50s and 60s were probably when

1737
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,059
he was starting this work and it was

1738
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:44,099
really gaining influence

1739
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:46,260
but he basically showed that there's

1740
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,299
another Dynamic where if you have a

1741
01:05:48,299 --> 01:05:51,119
system of particles driven by a flow of

1742
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,700
energy it will start to naturally

1743
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,040
organize that system

1744
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,200
um assuming that the molecules can bind

1745
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,940
to each other so you need to have the

1746
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,799
right sort of

1747
01:06:01,799 --> 01:06:03,839
um molecular variety for this to happen

1748
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,880
but this model of boltzmanns didn't take

1749
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,460
into account

1750
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:09,839
bonding it didn't take into account the

1751
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:11,520
force of gravity it didn't take account

1752
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,520
into account open systems and what I'm

1753
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,960
arguing is ultimately that the

1754
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,700
universe's Dynamics are more like an

1755
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,140
open system being pushed far from

1756
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,660
equilibrium where it's self-organizing

1757
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,220
so in this model the universe isn't

1758
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:25,200
going towards disorder because it's not

1759
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:29,039
a a universe made of particles that that

1760
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,680
stay uncorrelated so this Bolton's model

1761
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,839
was based on this H theorem where

1762
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:35,819
everything stays uncorrelated but when

1763
01:06:35,819 --> 01:06:37,619
things interact they become correlated

1764
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:40,380
so this model works for gases and it

1765
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:41,940
doesn't work for open systems and what

1766
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,260
I'm saying is it doesn't work for the

1767
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,299
universe we applied it to the universe

1768
01:06:45,299 --> 01:06:47,220
and if this was true there's only one

1769
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,900
trajectory which means there's no

1770
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,400
changing in the future what's going to

1771
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,079
happen is going to happen and if that's

1772
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:53,760
the case that's pretty depressing

1773
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,640
because it kind of demotivates us to go

1774
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,799
oh you know what I can change the world

1775
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,200
I can have this idea and it can blow up

1776
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,880
like Mark Zuckerberg by creating

1777
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,200
Facebook like you could create something

1778
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,180
like Facebook and you would have that

1779
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,220
and you would change the world world but

1780
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,660
if you believed in determinism it would

1781
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:11,460
be kind of strange you'd be like

1782
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,319
wait but this is already determined so I

1783
01:07:13,319 --> 01:07:14,520
already did it in a way I'm already

1784
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,980
gonna do it and like there's only one

1785
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,720
trajectory and then I play that

1786
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,819
important role in history no that can't

1787
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:22,440
be true I'm not gonna this is impossible

1788
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,119
like I'm Gonna Change the World and it

1789
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:25,799
was determined so

1790
01:07:25,799 --> 01:07:28,020
that philosophy leads to a lot of

1791
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:31,579
weirdness that I'm saying completely

1792
01:07:31,579 --> 01:07:33,780
dissipates when we get the causal

1793
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,640
picture straight and we see that there's

1794
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:39,539
not this nihilistic one trajectory

1795
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:42,539
because of quantum indeterminism and

1796
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:43,920
that's not everything but what Quantum

1797
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,260
indeterminism does is it shows that when

1798
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:48,299
you shrink when you zoom in and you get

1799
01:07:48,299 --> 01:07:52,559
to a certain level that Newton's Laws of

1800
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,680
Motion do not hold you will see there

1801
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,599
will be no definite

1802
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:58,700
state

1803
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:02,400
uh of an electron that you can predict

1804
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,680
given its prior State there's only going

1805
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,599
to be a wave function that gives a

1806
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:08,400
distribution of probabilities where that

1807
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,380
can go and then use the born rule to

1808
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:11,700
find out where it's like you to go and

1809
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,740
then if you repeat that study a bunch of

1810
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:14,880
times you'll you'll see these

1811
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,520
statistical patterns but so what I'm

1812
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,160
saying is quantum and determinism

1813
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:24,420
get rid of this picture of

1814
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:25,439
um

1815
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:28,319
brick determinism at the micro level

1816
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:29,698
and if you did have that strict

1817
01:08:29,698 --> 01:08:31,738
determinism at the micro level

1818
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:34,620
you would not have any agency or any

1819
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,600
there would be no real counterfactuals

1820
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,299
they would be sort of

1821
01:08:39,299 --> 01:08:42,238
due to our epistemic limitations what we

1822
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:43,560
can know about the world we think there

1823
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,000
are different possibilities but there

1824
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,560
actually are none the world can only go

1825
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,939
one way and what I'm saying is that

1826
01:08:47,939 --> 01:08:50,040
there are some different there's a

1827
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,479
possibility space of things that can

1828
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:53,339
happen and that when agents make

1829
01:08:53,339 --> 01:08:56,580
decisions you're carving out a path

1830
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:59,460
um that in some way is not it's not

1831
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:01,198
determined by the micro scale physics

1832
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:03,238
because of quantum and determinism and

1833
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:05,580
then we have chaos too at the classical

1834
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:07,259
scale where you can't predict what a

1835
01:09:07,259 --> 01:09:08,640
chaotic system is going to do people

1836
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,319
call it deterministic chaos I have

1837
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:11,939
issues with calling that determinism

1838
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,100
because it's completely not predictable

1839
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,899
and I don't even think determinism is

1840
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:17,540
the right word people want to look up

1841
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:20,640
norden's Dome if you have a ball posed

1842
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,319
at the top of the Dome there's multiple

1843
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,238
Newton's equations that can satisfy

1844
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:25,259
where it's going to go next there's

1845
01:09:25,259 --> 01:09:27,299
actually even determinism is not fully

1846
01:09:27,299 --> 01:09:29,339
deterministic but that's kind of beyond

1847
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:31,738
what we'll get into so

1848
01:09:31,738 --> 01:09:32,580
um

1849
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:34,439
let me just try to go faster through the

1850
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:37,198
slide since the 720 and so I'm not going

1851
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:39,420
to talk about a lot of the details that

1852
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:43,020
uh I planned but maybe are earlier

1853
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,600
uh conversation provides context that

1854
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,880
can clear a lot of this stuff up so what

1855
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,198
I'm arguing is that the universe is

1856
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:52,080
self-organizing and so Lee smolen uh

1857
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,640
popular physicist says the possibility

1858
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,320
of conceiving the universe as a whole as

1859
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,060
a self-organized system in which a

1860
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,280
variety of improbable structures exist

1861
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,380
permanently without the need of a pilot

1862
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,540
or other external agent

1863
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:05,640
um I can't see that word

1864
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:06,840
um so we have the possibility of

1865
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,840
constructing a new scientific cosmology

1866
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:11,040
it's clear that if the natural state of

1867
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,600
matter is chaos and external

1868
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,280
intelligence is needed to explain the

1869
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,040
order and beauty of the world

1870
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,260
um so he's basically saying if we had

1871
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:21,120
this model of like Randomness and it

1872
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,679
wouldn't make sense for us to see what

1873
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:24,659
we see and we would need a Creator would

1874
01:10:24,659 --> 01:10:27,179
be a better exploit explanation but if

1875
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:28,440
life order and structure are the natural

1876
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,480
state of the cosmos itself in our

1877
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,219
existence indeed our spirit might

1878
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:33,540
finally be comprehended as created

1879
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:34,800
Naturally by the world rather than

1880
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,900
unnaturally and in opposition to it

1881
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,580
and you'll see up here that he says a

1882
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:42,320
variety of improbable structures

1883
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,760
um that exists permanently so what I'm

1884
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:46,800
saying is there's some language issues

1885
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,260
here that we're seeing

1886
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:50,940
um where we're saying why do we see all

1887
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,620
this improbable stuff if it's there it's

1888
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,540
not improbable so it's only improbable

1889
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:58,080
if we accept the old model uh based on

1890
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:02,219
you know this simplified model of

1891
01:11:02,219 --> 01:11:04,080
causation that doesn't include top-down

1892
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,540
causation which we'll explain and that

1893
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:09,120
actually complexity

1894
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,060
that you would say that this is highly

1895
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,739
improbable that complexity just keeps

1896
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:15,000
growing and growing and growing because

1897
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,219
statistically you would think that there

1898
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:18,780
would be some transient complexity and

1899
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,880
then basically you would have this trend

1900
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,380
towards entropy that you know this

1901
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,360
complexity would dissolve what I'm

1902
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,120
saying is it's not when I'm saying that

1903
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,800
the universe is becoming more complex

1904
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,159
it's not opposed to naturalism it's that

1905
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:35,100
our conception of naturalism is based on

1906
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,260
an outdated Paradigm that did not

1907
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,140
include dynamics that really exists that

1908
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:43,199
were now just finding so that this these

1909
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:44,940
structures that are highly complex were

1910
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:46,980
never improbable and I'm actually going

1911
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:48,480
to argue that they're statistically

1912
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,880
inevitable

1913
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:51,739
um

1914
01:11:51,739 --> 01:11:54,960
uh that they arise

1915
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:55,739
um

1916
01:11:55,739 --> 01:11:57,719
in a way deterministically and it might

1917
01:11:57,719 --> 01:11:59,880
be kind of confusing that I use that

1918
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,400
word but what I'm going to try to argue

1919
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,500
is that there when we talk about

1920
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,199
determinism we need to make distinctions

1921
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,420
between that as well so what I'm saying

1922
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:11,219
is that there's strict determinism is

1923
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:13,440
not true but I'm now going to argue that

1924
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,080
something like Global determinism is

1925
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,580
true which is a name that's been used by

1926
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:20,100
philosophers that there is that there

1927
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,900
are attractors that create these

1928
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,480
Dynamics such that it is natural that

1929
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,860
the world goes towards increasing

1930
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:28,260
complexity and that

1931
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,600
if we see this trajectory that we're a

1932
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,460
part of you know life is spreading we're

1933
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:34,980
building technology the biosphere has

1934
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,780
created all this complexity on Earth if

1935
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,280
we spread we're spreading complexity

1936
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,320
throughout the Universe in the form of

1937
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,420
like you know computational structures

1938
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,400
life is a computational structure this

1939
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,560
information processing Network that we

1940
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,480
call the biosphere is spreading if life

1941
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,179
spreads that that was never improbable

1942
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:53,340
it was just improbable because it seemed

1943
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,960
improbable because we didn't have all

1944
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,760
the laws and that actually it's

1945
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,199
inevitable

1946
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:00,360
um but that there is some Freedom within

1947
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,880
that but there is an outline that's

1948
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,360
basically

1949
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:10,560
um deterministic at this larger scale

1950
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,080
um and by that I mean things can go a

1951
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,699
different way like if you're around the

1952
01:13:14,699 --> 01:13:16,280
tape of time and you played it again

1953
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,380
that different events there would be a

1954
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,120
slightly different chain of events that

1955
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,040
would happen it would get different for

1956
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,179
example genetic mutations because

1957
01:13:27,179 --> 01:13:30,239
genetic mutation and Schrodinger was the

1958
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,860
first person to speculate about this but

1959
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:33,480
that there's a Quantum component so if

1960
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,860
you rewound the tape of time and you

1961
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,420
played it again you would get some

1962
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:37,920
different genes but what I'm arguing is

1963
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,080
because of these emergent attractor

1964
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,060
dynamics that were really explained by

1965
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:44,640
non-equilibrium physics and and the work

1966
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,000
of the Precision then what you see is

1967
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,219
that you would get the same trajectory

1968
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:51,840
towards higher and higher complexity

1969
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,640
because there were other laws that we

1970
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,940
weren't aware of and so in this model

1971
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:59,340
there's going to be a sort of cosmic

1972
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:02,400
destiny that is this sort of form of

1973
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,440
global determinism and then there's

1974
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,340
going to be

1975
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:08,940
free agency that the agents can do

1976
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:11,040
things that's not set in stone within

1977
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,320
that kind of global deterministic

1978
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,900
picture so it's kind of new it's not I'm

1979
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,460
saying that it's not binary it's the

1980
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:20,460
world deterministic or indeterministic

1981
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:22,739
there's indeterminism at the lowest

1982
01:14:22,739 --> 01:14:25,920
level which basically introduces slack

1983
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,719
into the causal chain so not everything

1984
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:30,060
is fully determined in this strict sense

1985
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:33,120
but because of these attractors you get

1986
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,679
these emergent Dynamics where you're

1987
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,540
going to see similar patterns similar

1988
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:39,000
regularities

1989
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,580
um

1990
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:43,440
so Kristoff Coke just a couple

1991
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,320
scientists who well yeah I'll skip this

1992
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,400
stuff but so there are a lot of

1993
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,640
scientists who a lot of philosophers who

1994
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,380
have had this kind of teleological

1995
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:53,880
narrative that the Universe was moving

1996
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,500
towards some sort of goal that it seemed

1997
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,239
to be like an organism that's developing

1998
01:14:57,239 --> 01:15:00,120
and that seemed like a an idea post

1999
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,920
naturalism people like teal hard day

2000
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:05,580
Chardon and uh bergson where you know

2001
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,020
um uh

2002
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:10,679
in Chardon was religious but bergson was

2003
01:15:10,679 --> 01:15:12,780
a philosopher that wasn't really so I

2004
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:13,860
think a lot of these people got

2005
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,540
criticized wrongly they were actually

2006
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,100
seeing what was right about nature but

2007
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,980
this view was thought to be

2008
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:21,780
opposed to naturalism that was

2009
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:23,640
teleological and that had to be some

2010
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,960
sort of Mystical Force and what I'm

2011
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,820
saying is we just didn't know about

2012
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:27,960
certain things we didn't understand

2013
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,420
information and that these people were

2014
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:32,580
right and that a lot of people will hear

2015
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:33,920
this and say oh well that's against

2016
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:36,239
science that might be again they might

2017
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:37,320
think it's against the second law of

2018
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,300
Thermodynamics or something let's know

2019
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,159
there's a big misunderstanding about

2020
01:15:41,159 --> 01:15:44,219
that and all of these people are you

2021
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:45,840
know all the scientists on this page

2022
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,719
really everyone with the exception of

2023
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:51,179
couple those phosphorus are extremely uh

2024
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:53,580
respected and very accomplished people

2025
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:56,400
who support this view I mean all right

2026
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,900
Ray Kurzweil you know it's technology

2027
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,699
guys a little bit more out there but he

2028
01:15:59,699 --> 01:16:01,560
even uses the word destiny destiny

2029
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,420
ultimate it is clear that the physical

2030
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:04,920
laws of our universe are precisely what

2031
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:05,940
they need to be to allow for the

2032
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:07,260
evolution of increasing levels of order

2033
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:09,120
and complexity ultimately the entire

2034
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,920
universe will become saturated with

2035
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,179
intelligence

2036
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:14,580
This Is the destiny of the universe so

2037
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,199
what I'm saying is that this is the

2038
01:16:16,199 --> 01:16:18,540
trajectory of cosmic Evolution this is

2039
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,600
the the road map of the future and this

2040
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,480
provides something like an outline for

2041
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,820
uh non-reductionist Theory of Everything

2042
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:28,920
based on emergence so you have first

2043
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,840
physics and chemistry emerged in biology

2044
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:34,140
then brains in technology and then the

2045
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:36,540
merger of biology with technology and

2046
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:37,860
then you get patterns of matter and

2047
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,000
energy and the universe becomes

2048
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,920
saturated with intelligent processes and

2049
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:44,280
knowledge so life expands and we do that

2050
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,780
because we have to we're going to run

2051
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:47,520
out of energy on this planet Our Stars

2052
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,440
gonna die which necessitates that we

2053
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,560
move outward and then we extract the

2054
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,300
energy from that and we keep moving

2055
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:56,640
outward and as we do the informational

2056
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,280
Network that is life keeps expanding and

2057
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,420
it keeps

2058
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:02,880
taking inanimate matter in the world and

2059
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,380
incorporating that into its

2060
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:06,480
computational substrate so the the

2061
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,880
island of agency the island of

2062
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,739
information keeps spreading and

2063
01:17:10,739 --> 01:17:12,960
subsuming the inanimate world and I'm

2064
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,239
saying that that is an inevitable

2065
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:17,699
process and people say well that seems

2066
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:19,320
very unlikely and if that that's

2067
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:22,679
happening then it's it's not part of the

2068
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:25,440
the designer it's not part of the the

2069
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,600
the the code of the universe like it's

2070
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,239
not necessitated by the the parameters

2071
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,219
the laws and the constants they'll say

2072
01:17:32,219 --> 01:17:33,420
you know it's just something that could

2073
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:36,060
have happened uh and it's unlikely but

2074
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,460
we're defying the odds now when those

2075
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:39,780
people say that they don't even realize

2076
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,880
their own ontology like if they believe

2077
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,560
in determinism then there's only one

2078
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,060
trajectory there's only one thing that

2079
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:46,860
could happen so there's no likely or not

2080
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:47,940
likely if you really believe in

2081
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:50,400
determinism there's no statistics and

2082
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,960
there's really no causation it's just

2083
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,880
one thing follows another and people

2084
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,440
have talked about that if German isn't

2085
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,960
true then even causality is an illusion

2086
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:02,219
it's just one sort of Fab of events that

2087
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:04,020
all follow from the initial event

2088
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:05,820
so

2089
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:08,040
um what I'm arguing is that the Universe

2090
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,659
shows the Dynamics of a far from

2091
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:12,960
equilibrium system a driven system and

2092
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,440
that it moving towards complexity isn't

2093
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,120
violating any laws and it's not

2094
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,260
improbable

2095
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:21,840
we just didn't understand far from

2096
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,659
equilibrium Dynamics and that the

2097
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:26,280
universe's complexity doesn't have to be

2098
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,020
transient so Sean Carroll has this thing

2099
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:29,699
where he's showing like the increase in

2100
01:18:29,699 --> 01:18:31,800
complexity and the increase in entropy

2101
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,659
and people go okay this is making sense

2102
01:18:33,659 --> 01:18:35,340
complexity is not opposed to entropy

2103
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:36,719
it's part of that but it goes up and

2104
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:38,159
then it goes down you have the coffee

2105
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:40,620
and you have the cream and the the

2106
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,480
coffee mixing and you get this

2107
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,159
complexity and then it all becomes

2108
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:46,199
homogeneous what I'm saying is no that's

2109
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:47,520
not true for the universe at all

2110
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,920
complexity keeps going because when life

2111
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,440
emerges it's not like some complexity

2112
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,600
like you get some you know random

2113
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,820
Pebbles arranged as a crystal and then

2114
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,560
the wind blows and then they disperse

2115
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,380
life is robust it's modeled the world

2116
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:03,960
and it's because it's modeled the world

2117
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:07,320
it can start to it can maintain its own

2118
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:10,739
existence so for example if an asteroid

2119
01:19:10,739 --> 01:19:12,000
is coming at the Earth in 100 years

2120
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,460
assuming that we advance technologically

2121
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:16,380
at the rate we've been we're going to

2122
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:18,060
destroy that asteroid we're going to do

2123
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:19,980
what we need to do to preserve of life

2124
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:22,260
and that's going to change the

2125
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:23,640
deterministic trajectory of the

2126
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,300
inanimate world so life changes the

2127
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,920
trajectory of the inanimate world but

2128
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,719
what I'm saying it was inevitable that

2129
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:33,420
life emerges and does this so there is a

2130
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:36,179
sort of trajectory that's sort of set in

2131
01:19:36,179 --> 01:19:39,480
stone from the uh initial parameters

2132
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:42,780
but that this trajectory

2133
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:45,600
um is the opposite trajectory of what

2134
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,699
boltzmann thought it's actually towards

2135
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:50,580
greater and greater organization

2136
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:52,920
and the discussion of where's the limit

2137
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,020
if this universe wakes up and the whole

2138
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:56,040
thing becomes this integrated

2139
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,380
computational system when does it have

2140
01:19:58,380 --> 01:19:59,880
to stop what about the second law of

2141
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,760
Thermodynamics what about the energy

2142
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,560
uh needs and I wrote an article for

2143
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,699
noema

2144
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:08,280
called life need not ever end and it was

2145
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,500
shared by David Deutsch and Sabine

2146
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,179
Austin Felder and Robin Hansen also were

2147
01:20:12,179 --> 01:20:14,460
commenting on it and saying yes it's

2148
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:16,860
possible that life could potentially not

2149
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:18,540
have a limit it depends on if there's an

2150
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,100
upper bound to entry Robin Hansen said

2151
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:21,780
Sabine was like I have a chapter on this

2152
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:24,420
in my book so a lot of the things that

2153
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,640
we took as gospel like the first law and

2154
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:28,380
second law of Thermodynamics those apply

2155
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:30,840
very well to certain systems but we

2156
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:31,980
shouldn't have applied them to the

2157
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:34,260
universe as a whole I mean the first law

2158
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:36,780
of thermodynamics is just like

2159
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:39,120
uh there's conservation of energy which

2160
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,679
which is

2161
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:41,780
um

2162
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:44,400
holds and we use that to calculate

2163
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,380
things but this statement matter can't

2164
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,719
be created or destroyed absolutely not

2165
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,760
true Cosmic inflation theory has new

2166
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,620
matter and energy created during the

2167
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:54,659
cosmic inflation period

2168
01:20:54,659 --> 01:20:57,060
um continuously and then now with the

2169
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,980
expansion of the universe there's Dark

2170
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:01,440
Energy constantly being created as well

2171
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,020
and astronomers I mean there's this

2172
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:06,000
astronomy conference paper where people

2173
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,880
have speculated have argued that we can

2174
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,580
use dark energy and that's getting more

2175
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,080
speculative

2176
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:16,020
um uh to continue to to power life

2177
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:17,219
um we might not even need that if you

2178
01:21:17,219 --> 01:21:18,659
read my article you'll see this but you

2179
01:21:18,659 --> 01:21:20,280
can look up on Sean Carroll's blog he

2180
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,719
has an article called Energy's not

2181
01:21:21,719 --> 01:21:24,000
conserved and it talks about basically

2182
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,940
the first law is not true in the ways

2183
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:29,219
some people thought it was

2184
01:21:29,219 --> 01:21:32,100
um oops didn't mean to do that let me go

2185
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,320
back to this slide

2186
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:38,100
so um let's speed it up

2187
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:39,659
um so maybe this is where we're at now

2188
01:21:39,659 --> 01:21:42,300
so it's a series of these

2189
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,520
um stages and what I'm saying is we're

2190
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:48,239
at this stage and that the biosphere

2191
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:49,860
um mirrors a brain it's an Information

2192
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:51,780
Network of Agents exchanging information

2193
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:54,260
through the internet

2194
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:57,659
and that there's actually you know

2195
01:21:57,659 --> 01:21:59,159
people might say that's Cosmic mysticism

2196
01:21:59,159 --> 01:22:01,199
well there's some interesting new

2197
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:03,000
theories by people like Lee smallen and

2198
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,560
John Lanier

2199
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,880
um arguing that the universe is a

2200
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,500
learning machine and everything in that

2201
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,239
paper is consistent with this view so go

2202
01:22:09,239 --> 01:22:11,219
read that paper read the universe as a

2203
01:22:11,219 --> 01:22:12,840
neural network by Vitali he has a group

2204
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:15,120
on Facebook and we've been meeting

2205
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,440
um we're taking a break for the summer

2206
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,239
and making some videos but basically

2207
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:19,320
there's

2208
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:22,020
a mathematical foundation for this

2209
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:26,640
this picture and uh so calling it Cosmic

2210
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,280
mysticism it's just not true anymore and

2211
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,520
you can have a fundamentally purposeful

2212
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,400
Universe headed towards this what

2213
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,659
trjardin would describe as like an Omega

2214
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:38,100
Point

2215
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:41,040
um and it's completely consistent with

2216
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,480
naturalism as long as you update

2217
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,179
naturalism to include these new Dynamics

2218
01:22:45,179 --> 01:22:47,280
so

2219
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,020
um I was going to talk about phase

2220
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:52,260
transitions so basically this these

2221
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:55,020
stages in Cosmic Evolution occur from

2222
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,600
components like Nature's fundamental

2223
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,699
particles combining to make higher level

2224
01:22:59,699 --> 01:23:04,020
systems so we have you know atoms uh

2225
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,340
come together to form molecules which

2226
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:06,960
come together to form cells which come

2227
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,179
together to form organisms and

2228
01:23:09,179 --> 01:23:11,640
ecosystems and in the biospheres this

2229
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,800
fully Integrated Network so those are

2230
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,900
phase transitions it occurs in stages

2231
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:18,239
you have a depiction here we see a

2232
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:21,780
single-celled organism uh and then those

2233
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:23,699
organisms you can think of a slime mold

2234
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:25,440
so you have a bunch of like paramecium

2235
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,540
or something and they need to solve a

2236
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:29,280
problem and so they come together and

2237
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,380
they solve a problem they form uh

2238
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:33,360
multicellular organism so here's a slime

2239
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,860
mold and here's a human

2240
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:36,960
and these agents also come together to

2241
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,659
form larger collectives and every time

2242
01:23:39,659 --> 01:23:40,920
you have one of these it's called a

2243
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,840
phase transition and it's exactly the

2244
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:45,780
same as the phase transitions

2245
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:47,699
not exactly the same but the same

2246
01:23:47,699 --> 01:23:49,679
category of

2247
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,760
phenomena like when you have

2248
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:54,600
um

2249
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,580
water freezing to ice but we have these

2250
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:58,380
non-equilibrium phase transitions where

2251
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:00,420
you'll have like the emergence of a a

2252
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:03,739
tornado or a whirlpool in your bathtub

2253
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:07,500
and basically these little units like in

2254
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:08,940
the formation of a Whirlpool you have

2255
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:10,260
all these atoms that are bouncing around

2256
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:13,500
chaotically and due to some

2257
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,060
thermodynamic constraints that we won't

2258
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:18,060
get into here they start to organize

2259
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:20,580
themselves into these uh Collective

2260
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:23,100
formations that create these flow

2261
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,620
patterns and you can see these organized

2262
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:27,800
structures and that life is basically

2263
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:31,080
another version of this

2264
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,820
um and that when

2265
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:36,840
um atoms come together to make a

2266
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,760
our subatomic particles come together to

2267
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:40,020
make an atom like these phase

2268
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:41,820
transitions they continue in the

2269
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,380
hierarchy of flight so you have agents

2270
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:45,120
coming together single settlements to

2271
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,199
make multicellular then to make

2272
01:24:46,199 --> 01:24:49,800
societies and these phase transitions

2273
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:50,520
um

2274
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:54,420
happen at this edge of chaos so there's

2275
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:56,340
this sort of dialectical dynamic between

2276
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:59,100
Order and Chaos that creates complexity

2277
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,900
and really

2278
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,699
everything is going through these Cycles

2279
01:25:02,699 --> 01:25:04,920
so when there's a phase transition you

2280
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,719
know you don't want to a system to be

2281
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:09,780
too stable because it's too rigid to

2282
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:12,360
transition to the next stage so there

2283
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:13,920
will be periods of chaos like we're

2284
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,380
experiencing right now in society and

2285
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:18,060
you might think that the world's ending

2286
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:19,739
but it's actually an indication that a

2287
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:22,020
phase transition is about to happen and

2288
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:24,239
so the system has the potential to

2289
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:27,360
either collapse or to transition into a

2290
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,340
higher state of organization

2291
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:33,480
and so you know this shows this these

2292
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:35,460
different stages you have non-living

2293
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:37,020
then you have it with living you go from

2294
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:40,260
cells military organisms to tribes and

2295
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:42,780
cities Nations and in tagaya and then it

2296
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:44,580
can even extend from like when we

2297
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:46,500
terraform Mars that's the bias for

2298
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,960
yourself replicating and so life will

2299
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,960
basically the spread of life is like

2300
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:53,580
this higher level unit that's the

2301
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:55,380
biosphere making copies of itself with

2302
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:59,159
variation in selection and then you know

2303
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:01,560
life would potentially you know

2304
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:04,920
um I'm arguing inevitably subsume

2305
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:08,360
um Galaxy uh solar systems than galaxies

2306
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,980
uh and so on

2307
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:12,960
so

2308
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,239
let's skip some stuff and get into the

2309
01:26:15,239 --> 01:26:17,280
the self-help stuff since we don't have

2310
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,980
much time Daniel are is it a eight do we

2311
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:21,179
have to cut it eight or can we go 10

2312
01:26:21,179 --> 01:26:23,460
minutes longer

2313
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:26,040
we can go 10 minutes over well we'll

2314
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,960
only go 10. um I don't want to keep you

2315
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:29,520
too long but that will help with the

2316
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,139
question so if I can end at eight then

2317
01:26:31,139 --> 01:26:33,060
we can do 10 minutes of questions sorry

2318
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:36,179
maybe I'll try it in before but um so

2319
01:26:36,179 --> 01:26:38,400
these phase transitions create these

2320
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,560
memory systems so these higher organized

2321
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:41,820
systems

2322
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:43,800
um like life uh

2323
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,960
so when we get the first cell

2324
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:48,480
we have genetic memory and that's

2325
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,940
encoding information

2326
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:54,000
that the organism basically that living

2327
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,620
things have discovered through Evolution

2328
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:58,139
so evolution is this process where it's

2329
01:26:58,139 --> 01:26:59,699
making these different copies of these

2330
01:26:59,699 --> 01:27:01,500
organisms

2331
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,900
um so there's a genome with some

2332
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:05,760
information but it makes a copy and that

2333
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,320
copy has some variation so you get

2334
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:10,440
something different and that difference

2335
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:13,080
that organism might be better fit to the

2336
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,940
environment or Worse fit if it's worse

2337
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:17,100
if it's a worse fit it's going to die

2338
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:19,380
out so it's going to be weeded out that

2339
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:22,199
that template of information is going to

2340
01:27:22,199 --> 01:27:25,380
be weeded out of the population and the

2341
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:28,739
the the organisms that are well adapted

2342
01:27:28,739 --> 01:27:30,960
get to make more copies of themselves so

2343
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,940
what's going on in this process is that

2344
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:34,860
you're building up information in an

2345
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:36,380
organism and that information

2346
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:39,300
corresponds to adaptations and so that

2347
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,860
information is information that is

2348
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:43,620
predictive about the environment so

2349
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:46,020
organisms are performing inference from

2350
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:48,659
the very beginning of life's emergence

2351
01:27:48,659 --> 01:27:51,060
they're trying to solve a problem it's

2352
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:53,820
how to stop this order to disorder

2353
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:56,520
transition basically for an organism to

2354
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:59,580
stay organized it has to find energy

2355
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:01,380
and if it has to find and that's what

2356
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:02,760
Schrodinger's book what his life was

2357
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:05,159
showing is that you know life resists

2358
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:06,780
this tendency to fall apart that both

2359
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:09,120
men describe because it captures energy

2360
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,520
and that energy allows the system to do

2361
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:15,480
work that's keeping the organization so

2362
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:17,100
with these phase transitions you get

2363
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:19,139
different memory systems building on

2364
01:28:19,139 --> 01:28:20,639
each other so you have genetic memory of

2365
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:22,139
the origin of life then you have neural

2366
01:28:22,139 --> 01:28:24,120
memory with the emergence of brains and

2367
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,020
then you have the emergence of

2368
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:26,760
civilization and you get cultural memory

2369
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,980
and then you get meme propagation so you

2370
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:31,080
get a different mode of transferring

2371
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:33,420
information and

2372
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:35,940
um all of these memory systems build on

2373
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:38,780
each other and they all encode

2374
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:40,800
predictive information about the

2375
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,600
environment that allows the living

2376
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,880
system to stay out of thermodynamic

2377
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:47,340
equilibrium to stay out to prevent

2378
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:49,980
falling apart

2379
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:53,340
um so one thing that is worth mentioning

2380
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:55,020
is this new picture of hierarchical

2381
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:57,300
emergence this new paradigm where you

2382
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:59,460
have this multi-level level nature of

2383
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:01,139
reality where reality is organizing

2384
01:29:01,139 --> 01:29:03,480
itself into these hierarchical levels

2385
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,040
it has predictive power that the

2386
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,260
reductionist theory any reductionist

2387
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:08,760
theories of everything don't have those

2388
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,940
are are micro physics theories and they

2389
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:13,679
don't apply to life so those theories of

2390
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:15,120
everything I would argue aren't theories

2391
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,320
of everything because they don't include

2392
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:19,080
life and civilization and Consciousness

2393
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,120
and what I'm saying is that that stuff

2394
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,100
has causal power it's not epic phenomena

2395
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:25,440
so those things any Theory of Everything

2396
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,840
needs to include those things because

2397
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,400
they consider them epic phenomena they

2398
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:30,540
go we don't have to worry about it but

2399
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:31,739
what I'm saying is those things actually

2400
01:29:31,739 --> 01:29:33,060
have causal power they need to be

2401
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,699
explained so some predictive power that

2402
01:29:35,699 --> 01:29:36,960
this theory has that the old model

2403
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,120
doesn't this micro scale model is that

2404
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,400
we can actually use the Dynamics of a

2405
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,219
system at one level to understand the

2406
01:29:44,219 --> 01:29:46,620
Dynamics of the system at another level

2407
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:48,420
because they're isomorphic they're they

2408
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:50,940
have similar patterns because they're

2409
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:53,219
all complex adaptive systems so what I'm

2410
01:29:53,219 --> 01:29:55,739
saying is that you can make predictions

2411
01:29:55,739 --> 01:29:57,659
and you can

2412
01:29:57,659 --> 01:30:00,840
use principles to optimize society that

2413
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:03,000
are the same principles at work and

2414
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,880
evolution that optimize organisms

2415
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:08,820
and so we can think about someone's

2416
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:10,080
asking okay maybe you accept that

2417
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:11,580
there's a global brain you go okay we

2418
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:12,900
are agents we're informationally

2419
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:14,219
connected we're exchanging information

2420
01:30:14,219 --> 01:30:17,400
the way neurons exchange uh you know

2421
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,540
signal each other through Action

2422
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:20,940
potentials we must be forming this

2423
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:22,620
collective intelligence the way that

2424
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:23,820
there's an intelligence in the brain and

2425
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:25,139
we know we are because that's how we

2426
01:30:25,139 --> 01:30:26,639
build rockets and stuff the single

2427
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:27,780
person doesn't do it we build on

2428
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:29,639
accumulated knowledge we stand on the

2429
01:30:29,639 --> 01:30:31,380
shorter of Giants and we share

2430
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:33,300
information that's what science is all

2431
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,580
about it depends on that so

2432
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:37,320
if you want to ask

2433
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:40,199
what how intelligent is

2434
01:30:40,199 --> 01:30:42,540
the global brain is the network of

2435
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:45,060
humans then you can fall back on

2436
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:46,739
understanding the way that

2437
01:30:46,739 --> 01:30:48,480
neuroscientists have understand brains

2438
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,040
and what leads to greater computational

2439
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,320
power in brains or

2440
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:55,620
is what's the most robust design for a

2441
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:57,540
civilization well what's the most robust

2442
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:59,159
design for an organism

2443
01:30:59,159 --> 01:31:00,840
well we want it to be hierarchical

2444
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:03,179
because you have this division of labor

2445
01:31:03,179 --> 01:31:05,100
and all these other advantages that

2446
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,080
we'll talk about in a minute but so my

2447
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:09,060
point is this Theory allows us to

2448
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:10,620
predict things that we couldn't predict

2449
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:13,679
before because we are using a model of a

2450
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:15,659
similar system of a complex adaptive

2451
01:31:15,659 --> 01:31:17,400
system at one level to tell us things

2452
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,260
about what hasn't happened in the future

2453
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:22,199
and what will emerge and so there is a

2454
01:31:22,199 --> 01:31:24,000
an Essence there is a aspect of

2455
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,980
determinism here it's not the same kind

2456
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,840
of determinism but there's a global

2457
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,060
determinism where you get expected

2458
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:32,760
patterns at these levels so we can get a

2459
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:34,320
glimpse into where the future is headed

2460
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,360
but we can never know the details and we

2461
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,520
can never know what will emerge exactly

2462
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:40,020
but we can see that these phase

2463
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:41,760
transitions happen and we will get new

2464
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,679
emergences

2465
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:45,120
um

2466
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,100
talking about predictive power so Paul

2467
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:48,840
Krugman Nobel prize-winning Economist

2468
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,880
said by 2005 it will become clear that

2469
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,679
the internet's impact on the economy has

2470
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:54,600
been no greater than the fax machines

2471
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:57,000
probably the most wrong statement that

2472
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,280
you could ever make

2473
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,739
um and so

2474
01:32:01,739 --> 01:32:03,960
um why did he make this mistake here we

2475
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:05,460
see it again internet maybe just a

2476
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:08,340
passing fad as Millions give up on it

2477
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:10,500
why did they make this mistake what I'm

2478
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,900
saying is if they had this framework

2479
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:15,420
that I've just outlined we would have

2480
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:17,460
known when we saw the internet this is a

2481
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:20,159
tool for interconnection this is a tool

2482
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,080
for complexification it's not going away

2483
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,300
maybe the internet would go away but

2484
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:25,679
something else with a different name

2485
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:27,600
would replace it because this is part of

2486
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,880
this trajectory that Ray Kurzweil called

2487
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:31,620
like the Destiny for life

2488
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:34,260
so without this Theory we will not see

2489
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:36,480
obvious things that would be obvious to

2490
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,860
us otherwise and we'll make terrible

2491
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:39,480
predictions like Paul Krugman and

2492
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:40,980
hopefully everybody reminds him every

2493
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:42,060
day of his life that he made that

2494
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:43,020
prediction

2495
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:44,820
um he is into he's really into systems

2496
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:46,920
thinking and so I think he would

2497
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,659
understand this and I'm interested to

2498
01:32:48,659 --> 01:32:50,340
know whether he got into systems

2499
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:51,780
thinking after he made that prediction

2500
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:54,780
or before because if you see this

2501
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:56,760
picture like teal Hardware chardon's

2502
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:58,739
newest fear he predicted this the

2503
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:02,040
internet like you know 100 years ago

2504
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:04,500
um based on his theory

2505
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:07,800
becoming more integrated

2506
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:08,719
um

2507
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:11,699
so what does this mean for society we'll

2508
01:33:11,699 --> 01:33:12,719
mention some of that stuff before

2509
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:14,280
getting into the Bayesian stuff just

2510
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:17,100
because it's here isolationism is bad we

2511
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:18,480
want to be connected if you cut people

2512
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:19,980
off it's not good

2513
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:21,719
um there's no information exchange and

2514
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:24,000
it could be good for your nation in the

2515
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,460
short term but eventually

2516
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:28,139
what's happening elsewhere in the world

2517
01:33:28,139 --> 01:33:30,600
is going to affect you because it's one

2518
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,699
integrated system so we want to connect

2519
01:33:32,699 --> 01:33:34,020
to people because we want to open up

2520
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:36,719
channels of information exchange but we

2521
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:40,080
also want to uh preserve Nations we want

2522
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:41,460
to have this hierarchical thing where

2523
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:42,480
there's

2524
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,400
um control centers at all these levels

2525
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:48,780
towns cities Nations uh

2526
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:50,760
Etc so we don't want it to become a

2527
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:53,040
homogenized hive mind why because

2528
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,219
complexity is in computational power

2529
01:33:56,219 --> 01:33:58,260
it's a function of variety and

2530
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:00,360
integration so something is more complex

2531
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:01,980
has more computational power if there's

2532
01:34:01,980 --> 01:34:04,320
more diversity among the parts and if

2533
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:05,880
there's more

2534
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:06,659
um

2535
01:34:06,659 --> 01:34:09,840
connections between those parts so that

2536
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,760
definition of complexity that lets us

2537
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,280
know if an organism is more complex like

2538
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:16,199
a human brain is more complex than an

2539
01:34:16,199 --> 01:34:18,060
ant brain because it has more neurons

2540
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:19,739
and more connections and more

2541
01:34:19,739 --> 01:34:22,920
hierarchical levels we can use that to

2542
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:26,159
create a more robust Society now what

2543
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:27,719
does this mean for you it means life's

2544
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:29,580
part of a cosmic process with a goal

2545
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,800
there's this Cosmic attractor and we're

2546
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:34,020
agents that are part of that bringing

2547
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:35,580
that attractor about

2548
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:38,340
this process allows the universe to to

2549
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:41,159
wake up so life spreading is the

2550
01:34:41,159 --> 01:34:42,659
inanimate world

2551
01:34:42,659 --> 01:34:45,780
finding a form that models itself and

2552
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:48,060
slowly the the universe starts to become

2553
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:49,739
this Integrated Network that's this

2554
01:34:49,739 --> 01:34:52,320
coherent intelligence so that's pretty

2555
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,760
interesting

2556
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:54,960
um spiritual implications to that

2557
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,000
however you want to interpret that but

2558
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,159
when we're part of this what does it

2559
01:34:59,159 --> 01:35:01,800
mean for us okay so this is the framing

2560
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:04,040
of the free energy principle it says

2561
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:06,780
organisms are so saving it for last so

2562
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:08,520
it'd be climactic so the free energy

2563
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,679
principles it frames it with this

2564
01:35:10,679 --> 01:35:12,480
Schrodinger Framing and Carl friston

2565
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:13,679
that's where he got it from and it's

2566
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:15,420
also influenced by cybernetics but if

2567
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:17,219
you look at that stuff you have the free

2568
01:35:17,219 --> 01:35:19,199
energy principle because it basically

2569
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:21,360
says all organisms will fall apart all

2570
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,639
ordered systems so free energy principle

2571
01:35:23,639 --> 01:35:26,520
applies to aliens any any organized

2572
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:28,560
system anywhere in this universe will

2573
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:31,739
have to first of all extract energy if

2574
01:35:31,739 --> 01:35:34,800
they want to stay organized uh the free

2575
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,659
energy principle doesn't focus on that

2576
01:35:36,659 --> 01:35:38,400
but even though it has free energy in

2577
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,139
the name but I will focus on that

2578
01:35:40,139 --> 01:35:41,159
because I think it should be a part of

2579
01:35:41,159 --> 01:35:44,040
it organisms have to capture real

2580
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,560
thermodynamic free energy to stay in the

2581
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,179
game of existence

2582
01:35:48,179 --> 01:35:50,219
to capture energy from a chaotic

2583
01:35:50,219 --> 01:35:51,960
external world

2584
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,540
you have to start modeling the world and

2585
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:56,760
that evolution is building a model of

2586
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:58,620
the world through variation and

2587
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:00,239
selection through through these

2588
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:01,980
accumulation of adaptations and then

2589
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:03,780
brains do it even better and then you

2590
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:05,219
can update the model in real time with

2591
01:36:05,219 --> 01:36:06,300
brains because you have synaptic

2592
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:08,100
plasticity you don't have it's not slow

2593
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:09,960
where things have to die and you have

2594
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:11,880
this phylogenetic learning which is like

2595
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:14,760
the the population is learning this

2596
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:16,980
individuals can learn in real time

2597
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:20,100
and so you have to model the world and

2598
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:21,900
the free energy principle that's what it

2599
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:24,179
says it says there's reality and it has

2600
01:36:24,179 --> 01:36:26,340
all these details that we don't know and

2601
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:28,139
we have to create a model or a map of

2602
01:36:28,139 --> 01:36:29,639
that world that's a coarse grain

2603
01:36:29,639 --> 01:36:31,440
simplified version of that

2604
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:32,940
and then

2605
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:35,940
um that uh

2606
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:39,120
uh model is going to have errors and so

2607
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:40,980
what the free energy principle and

2608
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:42,719
active inference framework says is that

2609
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:45,719
when we're doing actions in the world

2610
01:36:45,719 --> 01:36:49,980
those are like miniature experiments and

2611
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:53,159
um what we should do if we want to live

2612
01:36:53,159 --> 01:36:55,260
optimally and stay out of thermodynamic

2613
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:58,139
equilibrium if we want to survive and be

2614
01:36:58,139 --> 01:37:00,540
robust we want to decrease the

2615
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:02,280
difference between our model of the

2616
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,199
world

2617
01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:07,560
um uh we want to decrease the error of

2618
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:10,020
our model and we want to make it more of

2619
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:11,580
an accurate representation of the world

2620
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:12,900
so you have reality and then you have a

2621
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:14,340
model of reality and when you want your

2622
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:16,739
model to match reality as close as you

2623
01:37:16,739 --> 01:37:19,380
can to be able to extract energy and

2624
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:21,179
avoid threats and to stay in existence

2625
01:37:21,179 --> 01:37:22,920
so we can be part of this continual

2626
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:25,500
process of complexification

2627
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:28,320
so we only got 10 more minutes but I

2628
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,179
think we can uh actually cover all this

2629
01:37:30,179 --> 01:37:32,520
so

2630
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,739
this looks really complex but this is

2631
01:37:34,739 --> 01:37:36,060
going to allow me to explain the free

2632
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:38,400
energy principle and merge it with

2633
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:41,580
evolutionary theory and even the process

2634
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:43,800
of science so

2635
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:46,260
this is an organism imagine this is the

2636
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:48,360
first organism

2637
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:51,360
um that uh emerged with the origin of

2638
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,199
life

2639
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:55,679
and so this organism makes copies of

2640
01:37:55,679 --> 01:37:56,940
itself

2641
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:58,880
and you get all of these different

2642
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:01,199
designs right

2643
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:03,659
so these different designs are

2644
01:38:03,659 --> 01:38:06,420
variations on this model this organism

2645
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:08,400
is an embodied theory about how to

2646
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:09,900
survive about how to stay far from

2647
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:11,880
equilibrium so it has a predictive model

2648
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:14,340
of the world that makes copies of itself

2649
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:15,840
and you get all of these competing

2650
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:18,600
predictive models and then these models

2651
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,580
compete for survival and some die out

2652
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:21,960
and the winning design is the best

2653
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:24,000
predictor it gets to make copies of

2654
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,580
itself when you get a similar design

2655
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:28,500
so what's going on here is you have

2656
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:30,780
models that are competing models the way

2657
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:33,480
scientific models compete and Bayes

2658
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:36,239
theorem is basically you have a theory

2659
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:38,100
and you have competing models and then

2660
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:39,780
you make predictions with those models

2661
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:41,520
and then you test those predictions and

2662
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:43,500
you update the probability that each

2663
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,380
model is true based on the results of

2664
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:47,880
those experiments

2665
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,440
and so you want to update your model

2666
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,719
based on new evidence and so what I'm

2667
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:53,760
saying is evolution when you create all

2668
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,560
these organisms these copies and they

2669
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,780
compete it's competing models the way

2670
01:38:57,780 --> 01:39:00,900
that scientific theories compete and the

2671
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:03,480
winning model uh is a product of natural

2672
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:05,219
selection the same way that the winning

2673
01:39:05,219 --> 01:39:07,139
scientific theory is a product of

2674
01:39:07,139 --> 01:39:09,300
surviving criticism and testing so

2675
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:12,360
that's a natural selection pressure

2676
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:18,679
um so as these Generations go on you get

2677
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:20,820
um with each generation you get an

2678
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:22,739
update to the model it's a Bayesian

2679
01:39:22,739 --> 01:39:25,320
update and so the model starts to match

2680
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:27,480
reality better such that after a bunch

2681
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:29,460
of generations you get an optimized

2682
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:32,699
organism that's optimized for that niche

2683
01:39:32,699 --> 01:39:35,400
and so this is how Evolution itself is a

2684
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:38,159
process of Bayesian inference as uh

2685
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:40,800
organisms adapt they're updating their

2686
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,540
model

2687
01:39:42,540 --> 01:39:44,340
Carl fresen has understood this

2688
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:46,380
equivalence and and says that all of

2689
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:47,940
evolution is inference of course someone

2690
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:49,500
might say all of inference is evolution

2691
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,260
and it would all be equally true but so

2692
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:54,120
this model applies to science and

2693
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:55,620
applies to

2694
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:58,199
learning so instead of all these

2695
01:39:58,199 --> 01:40:00,179
different organisms you know which we

2696
01:40:00,179 --> 01:40:01,260
said could be theories different

2697
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:03,420
competing models you could have this as

2698
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:04,820
different

2699
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:07,260
models of

2700
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:09,600
um maybe you're trying to figure out how

2701
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,699
to play your sport a sport like to the

2702
01:40:11,699 --> 01:40:12,960
best of your ability and you want to

2703
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,120
test out these different things and then

2704
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,460
you test them and and one performs

2705
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:19,560
better and so that's the free energy

2706
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:21,659
principle is that you're decreasing the

2707
01:40:21,659 --> 01:40:24,420
difference between your model and actual

2708
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:27,420
reality so you're doing these little

2709
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:29,460
experiments all the time and based on

2710
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:32,280
what works you're updating your model or

2711
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:36,179
you should be if you want to optimize

2712
01:40:36,179 --> 01:40:39,840
your system for survival and growth and

2713
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,219
so

2714
01:40:41,219 --> 01:40:43,080
um

2715
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:45,480
it's the same when we're trying to find

2716
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:51,780
a um uh a a political philosophy

2717
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:54,840
capitalism socialism these are competing

2718
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,780
models we test those models out this is

2719
01:40:57,780 --> 01:40:59,460
variation in selection and the ones that

2720
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:01,260
work they get retained by society and we

2721
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:04,620
keep those so capitalism I would argue

2722
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:07,320
um it's terrible right now but it was

2723
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:11,340
the best model for the time and

2724
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:13,739
um the superior model is always going to

2725
01:41:13,739 --> 01:41:15,120
be it's never going to be one thing it's

2726
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:16,739
always going to change so we would want

2727
01:41:16,739 --> 01:41:18,780
to test hybrids between socialism and

2728
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:20,520
capitalism and crypto economics if you

2729
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:22,620
want to Def like determine a political

2730
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:24,120
party based on this what you would say

2731
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:26,520
was that the best solution for a

2732
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,800
political party is to try out different

2733
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:32,940
models in small areas and uh based on

2734
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:34,679
what works then you can see where to

2735
01:41:34,679 --> 01:41:36,420
apply those models but I would argue

2736
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:38,460
that it's not going to be socialism for

2737
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:39,480
every place it's not going to be

2738
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:41,760
capitalism it might not even be a hybrid

2739
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,100
it might even be something in addition

2740
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:46,260
to that like I said crypto economics and

2741
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:48,119
that we have to test these things and if

2742
01:41:48,119 --> 01:41:49,980
we're not testing them and we're not

2743
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:51,840
trying these different models we're not

2744
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,020
living optimal we have no way to get uh

2745
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:57,659
to the to the to the optimal world view

2746
01:41:57,659 --> 01:41:59,219
political philosophy if we're not doing

2747
01:41:59,219 --> 01:42:01,739
this testing in Bayesian updating so

2748
01:42:01,739 --> 01:42:04,800
that's one big thing another thing that

2749
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,780
you know as I said that you know this is

2750
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:08,820
a basis for a self-help system so you

2751
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:10,260
have to model the world and your model

2752
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:12,119
of the world how accurate is determines

2753
01:42:12,119 --> 01:42:14,520
how successful you are in life if you

2754
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:15,960
don't have an accurate model of the

2755
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:18,960
world you don't understand how

2756
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:22,560
things work for example let's say you

2757
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,060
take a bunch of physics courses you can

2758
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:25,980
become an engineer and if you don't

2759
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:28,380
understand how things work and you're

2760
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:30,000
not paying attention to evidence and you

2761
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,560
just have some sort of belief that you

2762
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:33,719
believe for no reason and you try to get

2763
01:42:33,719 --> 01:42:37,139
through life you will not be able to

2764
01:42:37,139 --> 01:42:40,619
achieve goals and progress uh in the way

2765
01:42:40,619 --> 01:42:42,239
you would if you were doing Bayesian

2766
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:43,679
updating

2767
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:44,280
um

2768
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:45,900
so

2769
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:47,520
when I say this is a self-help system

2770
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,679
basically I'm saying there's lots of

2771
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:52,260
inaccuracies about our model of the

2772
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:54,500
world that could be

2773
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:57,300
optimized if we took a Bayesian approach

2774
01:42:57,300 --> 01:42:59,940
to reality and let me see let me tell

2775
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:01,139
you what I mean by that in these last

2776
01:43:01,139 --> 01:43:03,540
few minutes so we have five more minutes

2777
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:05,400
so

2778
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:07,260
there's this principle of incomplete

2779
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:08,940
knowledge that comes from cybernetics

2780
01:43:08,940 --> 01:43:11,159
and it says our there's this phrase the

2781
01:43:11,159 --> 01:43:13,679
map is not the territory so our model of

2782
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:15,300
the world is not the same as the actual

2783
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:17,400
World it can't hold all those details

2784
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,520
the world is too chaotic

2785
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:23,400
uh and there's just too many

2786
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,739
um there's too many variables for any

2787
01:43:25,739 --> 01:43:27,619
brain to model so we need to have this

2788
01:43:27,619 --> 01:43:30,360
low-res like coarse grain version of our

2789
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,159
model of the world and it's going to be

2790
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:33,420
incomplete it's always going to have

2791
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:35,100
uncertainty so anyone who's certain

2792
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:37,739
about anything like Sam Harris is 100

2793
01:43:37,739 --> 01:43:40,139
certain that Free Will can exist even

2794
01:43:40,139 --> 01:43:43,020
though there's lots of uh well-respected

2795
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:44,880
people that know a lot more about him

2796
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,800
than neuroscience and causality that say

2797
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,900
that Free Will can exist

2798
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:51,179
um it's just bad to be that certain

2799
01:43:51,179 --> 01:43:53,040
because anybody who's been that certain

2800
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,960
in the past has been proven wrong

2801
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:57,420
everybody thought Newtonian mechanics

2802
01:43:57,420 --> 01:43:58,739
would explain everything then we had

2803
01:43:58,739 --> 01:44:00,239
general relativity and now we see

2804
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:01,440
general relativity doesn't explain

2805
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,900
quantum mechanics every model is going

2806
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:06,119
to be proven wrong so one thing to do is

2807
01:44:06,119 --> 01:44:08,460
never be fully certain always take into

2808
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:09,840
account the uncertainty of your model

2809
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:12,060
what should we do from that we should

2810
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:15,420
consider all possible theories we should

2811
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:17,040
consider for example when we're trying

2812
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:19,739
to explain something we want to know

2813
01:44:19,739 --> 01:44:21,360
what was the call what was the origin of

2814
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:23,219
covid we want to know how did we get

2815
01:44:23,219 --> 01:44:25,199
sick the other day we want to know how

2816
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:27,719
dangerous dangerous it is is it to move

2817
01:44:27,719 --> 01:44:30,119
into this neighborhood

2818
01:44:30,119 --> 01:44:31,320
um when we want to try to understand

2819
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:33,840
like the origin specifically like we

2820
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,020
have to consider all possible

2821
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:38,580
explanations because if we don't we're

2822
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:40,619
already setting ourselves self up for

2823
01:44:40,619 --> 01:44:44,159
bias and self-deception so we want to be

2824
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:46,739
aware of the space of possibilities of

2825
01:44:46,739 --> 01:44:48,719
of possible explanations for a certain

2826
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:50,820
thing when making a decision and then we

2827
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:52,619
want to

2828
01:44:52,619 --> 01:44:55,440
map out the likelihood of each of those

2829
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,239
theories being true with all everything

2830
01:44:57,239 --> 01:44:58,739
we know

2831
01:44:58,739 --> 01:45:00,780
and we do we don't we can't do this in

2832
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:02,219
everyday life we don't need to we have

2833
01:45:02,219 --> 01:45:04,320
intuition about you know what to do in a

2834
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:05,639
lot of simple situations but with

2835
01:45:05,639 --> 01:45:07,800
complex situations like what person we

2836
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:09,420
should vote for what political candidate

2837
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:11,699
what political party we should

2838
01:45:11,699 --> 01:45:15,239
um support uh I think you have to do uh

2839
01:45:15,239 --> 01:45:17,760
this sort of Bayesian analysis where you

2840
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:20,340
map out every possibility for example

2841
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:21,960
every possible Theory and explanation

2842
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:23,580
for something you write down the

2843
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:25,199
evidence for each one and then you use

2844
01:45:25,199 --> 01:45:27,300
those theories to make predictions and

2845
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:30,540
then you test them and then you

2846
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:32,219
um based on the results of those testing

2847
01:45:32,219 --> 01:45:34,619
uh that testing update your likelihood

2848
01:45:34,619 --> 01:45:36,780
of each of those theories being true and

2849
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:38,580
we're not doing this all the time so let

2850
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:40,800
me give you some examples

2851
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,239
um

2852
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:44,960
well so

2853
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:48,119
flat earthers you could you know flat

2854
01:45:48,119 --> 01:45:49,500
earthers think the Earth is flat they

2855
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,060
have these pictures where it's this Flat

2856
01:45:51,060 --> 01:45:54,360
Earth uh in space and you know so if you

2857
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:56,880
go by this method I'm not gonna I'm not

2858
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:58,139
gonna

2859
01:45:58,139 --> 01:46:01,139
rule that out immediately uh to be a

2860
01:46:01,139 --> 01:46:03,119
good Bayesian you want to consider the

2861
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:04,380
possibility because there's always going

2862
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:05,880
to be surprises in nature who would have

2863
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:07,080
thought quantum mechanics who would have

2864
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,060
thought superposition in Tango Israel is

2865
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:10,500
so weird that everyone said that was

2866
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:11,639
pseudoscience they would have been like

2867
01:46:11,639 --> 01:46:13,679
that defies the laws of physics we don't

2868
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:15,719
know so we consider the theory and we

2869
01:46:15,719 --> 01:46:16,980
write down evidence for it then we try

2870
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:18,000
to test it

2871
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,860
so we can take a flat Earth or we say

2872
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:21,480
we'll do a test let's put you in a

2873
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:22,800
rocket we're going to pay for this we're

2874
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:23,940
going to fund this we're going to give

2875
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:25,560
you a video camera you and your Friday

2876
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:26,520
with your friends are going to bring you

2877
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:27,719
up in a rocket we're going to show you

2878
01:46:27,719 --> 01:46:28,920
we're going to look we're going to see

2879
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:30,780
if it's round or not everybody's trying

2880
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:31,980
to really figure it out because most of

2881
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:33,480
us haven't been to space

2882
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:34,920
let's say we take them into space we

2883
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,179
bring them back down they see the Earth

2884
01:46:36,179 --> 01:46:38,219
is round they come back down and they

2885
01:46:38,219 --> 01:46:39,780
still get on their flat message boards

2886
01:46:39,780 --> 01:46:41,760
or it's flat they drugged me or

2887
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:43,080
something like that some impossible

2888
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:44,100
thing

2889
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,860
um that person is not being base optimal

2890
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:49,679
because they're not updating their uh

2891
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:51,659
model of the world

2892
01:46:51,659 --> 01:46:52,320
um

2893
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,900
uh to be more accurate so they're going

2894
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:56,580
to make mistakes let me give you an

2895
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:59,400
example a final example of how I can

2896
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,679
give you some new Knowledge from this

2897
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:03,600
from a theory that will immediately

2898
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,340
change statistical Behavior I want to

2899
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:07,440
show you the effects of like agencies so

2900
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,719
let's say you're completely ignorant to

2901
01:47:09,719 --> 01:47:13,199
whether squids or octopus are

2902
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:14,820
intelligent you just don't know and

2903
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:16,739
you're you you eat calamari at a

2904
01:47:16,739 --> 01:47:18,360
restaurant every week sometimes you eat

2905
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:20,880
popcorn shrimp and then you eat calamari

2906
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:22,679
let's say it's randomly

2907
01:47:22,679 --> 01:47:24,540
and you're a person that cares about

2908
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:26,219
your compassionate person so I have

2909
01:47:26,219 --> 01:47:27,360
lunch with you and I say you know

2910
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,280
Neuroscience has shown that it seems

2911
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,560
like you know squids are highly

2912
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:32,880
intelligent and they show all this

2913
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,100
complex Behavior they have these nervous

2914
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:37,800
systems that would uh seem to make them

2915
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,719
intelligent

2916
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:41,520
um I mean lead to this like

2917
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,960
computational power where they can solve

2918
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,179
all these problems and I tell that

2919
01:47:45,179 --> 01:47:46,500
person if they're convinced of my

2920
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:47,639
argument

2921
01:47:47,639 --> 01:47:49,800
their statistical behavior is likely to

2922
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:51,480
change such that if you're someone and

2923
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:53,100
you were looking at their eating pattern

2924
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:55,500
all of a sudden you see them get this

2925
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,000
new knowledge they update their model

2926
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,300
and suddenly they don't need uh the

2927
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:01,739
calamari anymore suddenly their

2928
01:48:01,739 --> 01:48:03,360
appetizer becomes shrimp because they go

2929
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:05,699
oh that's unethical

2930
01:48:05,699 --> 01:48:07,199
um and then maybe they're kind of weak

2931
01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:08,940
maybe they go I love Karma and they eat

2932
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:11,040
it like once a month instead of like

2933
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:13,440
every week or something so what I'm

2934
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,239
saying is that there's a real power of

2935
01:48:15,239 --> 01:48:18,060
knowledge that when you

2936
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:19,920
show the person that and they update

2937
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:22,500
their model there is a statistical

2938
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:25,020
change in Behavior that's quantifiable

2939
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:26,820
immediately

2940
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:28,619
so

2941
01:48:28,619 --> 01:48:31,800
That's The Power of of of knowledge like

2942
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:35,219
we can we do have like agency and we can

2943
01:48:35,219 --> 01:48:37,679
actually see that people are not

2944
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:42,060
behaving in a Bayes optimal way and

2945
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:44,659
um we can see all sorts of you know

2946
01:48:44,659 --> 01:48:47,219
disagreements about for example theories

2947
01:48:47,219 --> 01:48:49,139
if we did amazing analysis we could

2948
01:48:49,139 --> 01:48:51,239
start to converge on what is the true

2949
01:48:51,239 --> 01:48:52,679
answer for this

2950
01:48:52,679 --> 01:48:54,239
um so it could be a solution to the

2951
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:56,639
misinformation problem the solution to

2952
01:48:56,639 --> 01:48:58,080
the misinformation problem is the

2953
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,960
solution to a problem in your own life

2954
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:03,540
um basically it tells you you know how

2955
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:06,659
you need to update your model to be more

2956
01:49:06,659 --> 01:49:08,159
accurate and you behave in a different

2957
01:49:08,159 --> 01:49:11,040
way you don't have these like delusions

2958
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,000
um

2959
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,719
so you know I yeah there's uh you set

2960
01:49:15,719 --> 01:49:17,639
goals for yourself uh in the

2961
01:49:17,639 --> 01:49:20,880
teleological stance because basically

2962
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:23,520
life to stay out of equilibrium has to

2963
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,159
have these intrinsic uh survival goals

2964
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:27,719
like finding energy and avoiding threats

2965
01:49:27,719 --> 01:49:29,820
but when you create a goal you you

2966
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:32,159
basically create an attractor and when

2967
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:34,920
you start working towards that goal

2968
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:38,340
um that is when you have a goal in your

2969
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:41,040
mind you say I'm going to do this for

2970
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:42,540
the world I'm going to build this thing

2971
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:44,699
that creates an attractor that you work

2972
01:49:44,699 --> 01:49:46,380
towards if you don't create that goal in

2973
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:49,139
your mind you're actually not going to

2974
01:49:49,139 --> 01:49:52,380
do what you need to do to make sure uh

2975
01:49:52,380 --> 01:49:54,659
to work towards that happening so goal

2976
01:49:54,659 --> 01:49:56,639
setting is absolutely something

2977
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:59,159
essential and if we don't do that then

2978
01:49:59,159 --> 01:50:01,260
we're not living optimally either and

2979
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:02,400
actually like the Law of Attraction

2980
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:04,080
those kind of things that sound you know

2981
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:05,820
like woo and you're like you know but

2982
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:07,619
they're these best sellers why do they

2983
01:50:07,619 --> 01:50:10,320
sell because we can actually start to

2984
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:13,920
map this on to the this sort of like

2985
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:15,060
um

2986
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:17,820
systems thinking and you can see oh

2987
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:20,340
that's why this new age stuff worked

2988
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:22,739
um variation selection is the method of

2989
01:50:22,739 --> 01:50:26,880
evolution or learning or science so we

2990
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,560
can use that in our real life like if

2991
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:30,840
you're writing a book or something

2992
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:31,500
um

2993
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:34,320
don't just be isolated for a year

2994
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,960
writing it yourself write it a little

2995
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,699
bit at a time pass it to your friends

2996
01:50:38,699 --> 01:50:41,699
get some criticism and so that's a

2997
01:50:41,699 --> 01:50:43,260
natural selection filter they tell you

2998
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:45,300
what's not good about it you go back you

2999
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:46,679
change it you vary it and you give it

3000
01:50:46,679 --> 01:50:48,480
back to your reading group that's using

3001
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:50,159
variation and selection to optimize your

3002
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:51,780
writing you can use this for any project

3003
01:50:51,780 --> 01:50:54,060
for not doing that we're making life

3004
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:55,560
harder

3005
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:57,179
um creating a collective mind so I'm

3006
01:50:57,179 --> 01:50:59,119
saying that there's this process

3007
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:01,800
uh at all these hierarchical levels so

3008
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:03,179
when we

3009
01:51:03,179 --> 01:51:04,440
um start to collaborate with someone

3010
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:07,040
we're forming a collective intelligence

3011
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:09,659
that then exchanges information for us

3012
01:51:09,659 --> 01:51:11,159
so we want to try to form Collective

3013
01:51:11,159 --> 01:51:12,480
minds and that's when you're passing

3014
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:13,860
your book to your friend you're doing

3015
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:15,179
that you're forming a collective mind

3016
01:51:15,179 --> 01:51:16,920
and then you're doing an optimization

3017
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,960
process at the level of the collective

3018
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,880
you want to align interests so you find

3019
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:22,860
Synergy so basically you're not you

3020
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:24,420
don't want to be opposed to others goals

3021
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:26,280
so if you all have goals you want to

3022
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:28,500
look at what are your similar

3023
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:31,380
goals and not where you're conflicting

3024
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:33,420
and then you will try to align those

3025
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:35,400
interests so we could try to do some

3026
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:37,320
sort of analysis with China for example

3027
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:40,500
where we try to uh align interest and

3028
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:42,360
see where we agree before you know

3029
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:43,679
rather than focusing on all of our

3030
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:45,119
disagreements and try to make progress

3031
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:46,980
that way and then the law of requisite

3032
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:48,480
variety is the final thing I'll I'll

3033
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,159
mention right now

3034
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:51,780
um is that

3035
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:54,000
um to when you want to model the world

3036
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,119
depending on how complex your Niche is

3037
01:51:56,119 --> 01:51:59,520
you basically your model matches the

3038
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:02,219
complexity of the niche and so you will

3039
01:52:02,219 --> 01:52:03,659
have a lot you will need a lot of

3040
01:52:03,659 --> 01:52:05,940
accessible cognitive States if your

3041
01:52:05,940 --> 01:52:07,619
theoretical physicist living in

3042
01:52:07,619 --> 01:52:11,760
Manhattan in this chaotic world were

3043
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:15,119
living on a farm or something so you

3044
01:52:15,119 --> 01:52:17,940
want to try to

3045
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:20,639
um find the niche that Max matches your

3046
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:22,199
skill set

3047
01:52:22,199 --> 01:52:24,179
um so you want to find low complexity

3048
01:52:24,179 --> 01:52:26,159
Niche if you're not a highly cognitive

3049
01:52:26,159 --> 01:52:27,840
person and if you are a person that

3050
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,880
thinks a lot and your mind is just

3051
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:30,840
always

3052
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:33,420
thinking you might not want to live in a

3053
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:36,659
small town simple like rural town you

3054
01:52:36,659 --> 01:52:37,920
might because you're not matched with

3055
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:39,119
the niche you could be highly

3056
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:42,119
intelligent but still you'd be seen as

3057
01:52:42,119 --> 01:52:44,520
crazy because basically

3058
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,080
um the niche is so simple that your

3059
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,840
model is too complex so

3060
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:50,760
um yeah there's a lot of things that

3061
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:52,560
come out of this that I would like to

3062
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:55,199
expand on but we don't have any time and

3063
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:57,840
we haven't really talked about Free Will

3064
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:00,300
and and and everything that we talked

3065
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:01,739
about at the beginning so maybe we'll

3066
01:53:01,739 --> 01:53:04,320
have to do this again but um hopefully

3067
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:06,000
that was an introduction to this Theory

3068
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,280
of Everything which creates this Cosmic

3069
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:10,199
context that you're an agent in the

3070
01:53:10,199 --> 01:53:12,239
theological stance is saying I'm an

3071
01:53:12,239 --> 01:53:14,880
agent that has to survive in a world

3072
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:17,400
that tends towards this other disorder

3073
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:20,340
otherwise and to do that I have to

3074
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:22,800
extract energy and to extract energy I

3075
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:25,860
have to model the world in more detail

3076
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:28,500
and more sophistication as we run out of

3077
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:29,820
energy we're going to have to model more

3078
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:32,520
and more of the world so Bayesian

3079
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:37,199
inference is how agents basically

3080
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:38,360
um

3081
01:53:38,360 --> 01:53:41,340
uh carry out this process of cosmic

3082
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:44,460
conflict uh complexification so life is

3083
01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:46,400
the mechanism for in complexity increase

3084
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:50,040
and we are agents with causal power and

3085
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:53,280
we have to basically

3086
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:56,639
um take this Bayesian approach to get to

3087
01:53:56,639 --> 01:53:58,800
the Future uh

3088
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:02,340
that we want to see and if we don't take

3089
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:04,199
this approach

3090
01:54:04,199 --> 01:54:05,239
um

3091
01:54:05,239 --> 01:54:07,920
basically uh

3092
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:10,739
uh the world is on a sort of trajectory

3093
01:54:10,739 --> 01:54:14,820
towards resource depletion so this is

3094
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:19,320
actually like becoming aware of this and

3095
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:22,139
this method is something that Society

3096
01:54:22,139 --> 01:54:24,000
needs to get us to the next phase

3097
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,580
transition if we don't have it we're not

3098
01:54:26,580 --> 01:54:28,619
going to get there so what I'm saying is

3099
01:54:28,619 --> 01:54:30,780
that this self-help system in a way

3100
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:32,219
there's a selection pressure that's

3101
01:54:32,219 --> 01:54:34,320
creating it it might not be this version

3102
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:36,480
of it but some form of this is sort of

3103
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:38,219
destined to be the next big thing so

3104
01:54:38,219 --> 01:54:40,320
everybody thinking along these lines and

3105
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:42,480
there are other people besides me

3106
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:45,179
um keep going in that direction because

3107
01:54:45,179 --> 01:54:48,980
you're on to something so yeah

3108
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,580
Daniel you jumping in there yet or what

3109
01:54:56,580 --> 01:54:58,380
I think yeah Brandon must have had to go

3110
01:54:58,380 --> 01:55:01,380
wow

3111
01:55:01,619 --> 01:55:03,600
well Bobby

3112
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:06,239
I'll ask just two short questions from

3113
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:08,820
the chat just in our final minutes so

3114
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:13,320
first quick question from Ross B

3115
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:15,360
what is the line between living and

3116
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:16,980
non-living matter

3117
01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:19,080
how about I answer them in like a few

3118
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:21,119
sentences and we do a little bit more

3119
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:22,800
um but we'll still cut it early so the

3120
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:24,119
line between living and non-living

3121
01:55:24,119 --> 01:55:27,360
matters agency an agency comes from the

3122
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,820
causal power of information and it gets

3123
01:55:29,820 --> 01:55:31,380
built up through an evolutionary process

3124
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:34,080
so you have an auto catalytic set that's

3125
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:37,080
a self-maintaining chemical set and

3126
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:39,179
there's some sort of phase transition

3127
01:55:39,179 --> 01:55:42,780
between that chemical set and the first

3128
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:45,780
cell where there's a causal a change in

3129
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:48,540
causal structure and the agent basically

3130
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:51,119
gains informational control and it gains

3131
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:52,800
the ability to initiate new causal

3132
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:53,940
chains and we call that top-down

3133
01:55:53,940 --> 01:55:56,699
causation so check out Sarah Walker and

3134
01:55:56,699 --> 01:55:58,320
Paul Davies work on informational

3135
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:00,300
control next

3136
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:04,739
all right very well second question from

3137
01:56:04,739 --> 01:56:07,739
Ross are these phase transitions

3138
01:56:07,739 --> 01:56:09,960
representative of weak emergence or

3139
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:12,900
strong aversions in Bobby's Theory EG's

3140
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:14,340
new laws come into play that exert

3141
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:15,900
downward causation

3142
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:17,760
yeah I wanted to address that nuggets

3143
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:19,199
and the Free Will stuff and I would love

3144
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:20,400
to just come back and do a talk on Free

3145
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:21,659
Will so

3146
01:56:21,659 --> 01:56:23,219
um what I'm saying is strong emergence

3147
01:56:23,219 --> 01:56:25,320
has been defined wrong it's emergence

3148
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:27,780
that seems to violate the laws of

3149
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:29,100
physics the way it's been defined and

3150
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:30,659
what I'm saying is strong emergence is

3151
01:56:30,659 --> 01:56:32,100
real but of course it doesn't violate

3152
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:33,600
the laws of physics anything that's real

3153
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:36,960
is part of physics so

3154
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:38,820
um weak emergence would be more like the

3155
01:56:38,820 --> 01:56:41,040
formation of like a whirlpool in the

3156
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:43,199
bathtub like you have all these

3157
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:46,980
uh you have the formation of a coherent

3158
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:49,500
structure that does introduce Global

3159
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:52,199
constraints that constrain the movement

3160
01:56:52,199 --> 01:56:53,580
of the particles such that they're no

3161
01:56:53,580 --> 01:56:54,960
longer chaotic they're in this ordered

3162
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:57,300
state but with strong emergence you

3163
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:59,159
actually see this change in causal

3164
01:56:59,159 --> 01:57:00,420
structure that I just mentioned or

3165
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:01,340
information

3166
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:03,840
basically gains causal power and you

3167
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:05,400
have an agent that's a control center

3168
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:07,679
that's actually deciding to do things

3169
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:09,239
and that's actually real causation

3170
01:57:09,239 --> 01:57:12,599
that's called top down causation and so

3171
01:57:12,599 --> 01:57:15,179
what strong emergence is is for example

3172
01:57:15,179 --> 01:57:17,699
uh prior to Life coming into existence

3173
01:57:17,699 --> 01:57:19,980
you have all inanimate matter and when

3174
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:21,300
you have a living thing we already said

3175
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:23,159
you drop a rock and a pigeon off a tower

3176
01:57:23,159 --> 01:57:25,320
one's predictable from Newtonian

3177
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:27,360
equations one's not one you have to

3178
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:29,820
understand it's genes and you have to

3179
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:31,500
understand like its relationship to its

3180
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:33,239
environment and then you can say oh it's

3181
01:57:33,239 --> 01:57:35,340
flying because it has to survive and you

3182
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:36,360
can actually predict some things about

3183
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:37,980
it won't Splat on the ground it's going

3184
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:39,119
to fly away but you can't predict it

3185
01:57:39,119 --> 01:57:40,380
with the same thing so what I'm saying

3186
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:42,420
is what strong emergencies is the

3187
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:44,280
changing causality such that we have

3188
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:46,219
living agents with informational control

3189
01:57:46,219 --> 01:57:49,500
and it's not something that's against

3190
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:51,900
the laws of physics or somehow working

3191
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:54,000
against that what it is is the laws of

3192
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,500
physics weren't complete now we're

3193
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:56,820
understanding that there's information

3194
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:59,400
that can have causal power and you do

3195
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:00,719
see this different type of causation

3196
01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:03,080
such that the Living World behaves

3197
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:05,520
distinctly different than the non-living

3198
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:07,760
world

3199
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:11,880
Michael the penultimate word

3200
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:14,760
oh that's uh put me on the spot young

3201
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:17,940
Lads uh and again Daniel you know uh

3202
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:19,679
what's going on in the background and

3203
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:22,679
I'm sure people will guess but uh no um

3204
01:58:22,679 --> 01:58:26,219
I think you know what uh Bobby and I had

3205
01:58:26,219 --> 01:58:29,940
spoken about earlier was uh

3206
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:35,219
this comes down to what is our uh

3207
01:58:35,219 --> 01:58:38,460
personal agency in terms of you know

3208
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:41,880
again Bobby has spent a long time here

3209
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:43,860
and I'm gonna have to like re-listen to

3210
01:58:43,860 --> 01:58:46,860
it myself again and uh spend some more

3211
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:48,540
time with it but

3212
01:58:48,540 --> 01:58:51,179
um we're elucidating or Bobby is

3213
01:58:51,179 --> 01:58:54,719
elucidating uh what kind of agency we

3214
01:58:54,719 --> 01:58:57,960
have in the face of complexity

3215
01:58:57,960 --> 01:59:00,480
um and obviously there's a what we say

3216
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:03,239
before Bobby a methodology is a

3217
01:59:03,239 --> 01:59:05,580
methodology to this uh we had some kind

3218
01:59:05,580 --> 01:59:08,460
of Catchphrase whatever but yeah so well

3219
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:11,219
the thing is we do have agency we behave

3220
01:59:11,219 --> 01:59:14,040
different than inanimate systems and we

3221
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:16,199
do have causal power

3222
01:59:16,199 --> 01:59:18,300
um but that's not enough that's like the

3223
01:59:18,300 --> 01:59:19,619
first step it's like okay where are

3224
01:59:19,619 --> 01:59:22,860
these agents then what do we do and the

3225
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:24,540
the Bayesian approach is kind of an

3226
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:27,000
instruction manual for how do you do how

3227
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,099
do you exercise this agency agency

3228
01:59:29,099 --> 01:59:30,239
optimally

3229
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:32,480
and what we want to do is we want to be

3230
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:34,980
aware of the uncertainty in our model

3231
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:36,659
and we want to try to decrease that

3232
01:59:36,659 --> 01:59:38,580
uncertainty and we do that by for

3233
01:59:38,580 --> 01:59:41,280
example not just having one theory about

3234
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:42,659
something we consider all possible

3235
01:59:42,659 --> 01:59:44,639
theories we consider the outcomes of

3236
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:46,739
those theories and we make sure that we

3237
01:59:46,739 --> 01:59:49,139
update our model uh in light of new

3238
01:59:49,139 --> 01:59:50,820
information and if we don't do that

3239
01:59:50,820 --> 01:59:53,219
we're not behaving optimally and we're

3240
01:59:53,219 --> 01:59:54,960
not fully exercising our agency and

3241
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:57,179
you're going to see consequences of that

3242
01:59:57,179 --> 02:00:00,360
at the societal level and so Society is

3243
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:01,860
basically creating pressures that are

3244
02:00:01,860 --> 02:00:05,900
going to force us to be sort of

3245
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:08,940
Bayesian agents because if we're not

3246
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:10,860
updating our model and not seeking out

3247
02:00:10,860 --> 02:00:13,199
new information and being curious uh

3248
02:00:13,199 --> 02:00:15,719
we're not going to be competitive

3249
02:00:15,719 --> 02:00:18,599
but yeah it's all about agencies I will

3250
02:00:18,599 --> 02:00:20,340
add to this too Bobby just know what to

3251
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:22,260
bridge the gap between the two of you

3252
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:26,099
um uh Daniel and pin out the word for

3253
02:00:26,099 --> 02:00:28,679
sure on my part but that you said act

3254
02:00:28,679 --> 02:00:31,560
infer and serve right

3255
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:34,679
Daniel said that I like that yeah

3256
02:00:34,679 --> 02:00:37,080
yeah so all this is really saying new is

3257
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:39,300
that active inference is not something

3258
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:43,199
specific to humans that organisms when

3259
02:00:43,199 --> 02:00:44,940
you have a population of organisms and

3260
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:47,940
evolution is making all these copies the

3261
02:00:47,940 --> 02:00:49,619
population is doing a sort of inference

3262
02:00:49,619 --> 02:00:50,820
process you have these different

3263
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:52,560
organisms that are different embodied

3264
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:54,420
models and then they're competing and

3265
02:00:54,420 --> 02:00:56,820
then only the most accurate ones survive

3266
02:00:56,820 --> 02:00:59,699
so that's what Bayesian inference is

3267
02:00:59,699 --> 02:01:03,239
um and uh this should also apply at the

3268
02:01:03,239 --> 02:01:05,280
level of society so when you have a a

3269
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,920
social organism a society it has a model

3270
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:10,260
and that model is its worldview it could

3271
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:12,659
be a religion it could be the political

3272
02:01:12,659 --> 02:01:14,460
model it could be authoritarianism or

3273
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:16,800
whatever and so with that too we want to

3274
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,840
optimize those models and if we don't

3275
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:21,480
try all of the different models and and

3276
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:23,699
test those models

3277
02:01:23,699 --> 02:01:26,760
um we will have no way to know if we

3278
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:29,099
have the optimal model so we can't just

3279
02:01:29,099 --> 02:01:30,900
go capitalism seems the best or

3280
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:32,340
capitalism sucks let's throw it out

3281
02:01:32,340 --> 02:01:34,860
Let's do let's do communism we want to

3282
02:01:34,860 --> 02:01:36,960
test things constantly and update and

3283
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:38,460
that's error correction if we don't do

3284
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:40,739
that we're screwed so

3285
02:01:40,739 --> 02:01:43,020
the Bayesian the free energy principle

3286
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:47,940
needs to be extended to all these levels

3287
02:01:47,940 --> 02:01:51,420
um and when we do that then we have a

3288
02:01:51,420 --> 02:01:53,219
whole new way to go about optimizing

3289
02:01:53,219 --> 02:01:54,840
social systems and political systems

3290
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:57,239
right now it's just like oh I think this

3291
02:01:57,239 --> 02:01:59,099
you know I believe in

3292
02:01:59,099 --> 02:02:02,040
uh you know a liberal world or I believe

3293
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:04,380
in this conservative View and it's like

3294
02:02:04,380 --> 02:02:07,139
okay fine well how do we get to the

3295
02:02:07,139 --> 02:02:09,119
bottom of it No One's Gonna agree first

3296
02:02:09,119 --> 02:02:11,820
I mean let's do do testing constant

3297
02:02:11,820 --> 02:02:13,860
testing the proof is in the pudding it's

3298
02:02:13,860 --> 02:02:15,719
a good idea we're going to see benefits

3299
02:02:15,719 --> 02:02:18,119
we're going to take surveys of everyone

3300
02:02:18,119 --> 02:02:20,340
and get feedback and see what we can

3301
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:23,639
improve and um Vitality of insurance the

3302
02:02:23,639 --> 02:02:25,199
guy who has the idea of the universe

3303
02:02:25,199 --> 02:02:26,520
being the snail Network which has been

3304
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:29,760
covered by media he's explained that

3305
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,619
this multi-level learning is consistent

3306
02:02:31,619 --> 02:02:33,179
with this neural network Theory and that

3307
02:02:33,179 --> 02:02:34,980
you do have true emergence and you have

3308
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:37,560
causal power at these higher levels

3309
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:39,780
um and he's trying to design a political

3310
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:42,360
party around this like a new approach to

3311
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:43,619
politics and

3312
02:02:43,619 --> 02:02:45,480
that sort of position that I came up

3313
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:47,040
with that you need to test it without me

3314
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:48,780
even saying anything to him that was

3315
02:02:48,780 --> 02:02:51,840
already his idea that he's has fleshed

3316
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:55,080
out you know I'm sure more than I have

3317
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:56,880
um so people are working on this stuff

3318
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:00,360
but this is like a new Niche being

3319
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:01,920
created right here this is the time

3320
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:03,659
everybody needs to go like how can we

3321
02:03:03,659 --> 02:03:05,280
use these systems

3322
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:07,380
Bayesian inference and evolutionary

3323
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:09,659
science evolutionary theory mechanisms

3324
02:03:09,659 --> 02:03:12,000
to optimize Society if we don't do that

3325
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,739
from if it's not entering the political

3326
02:03:13,739 --> 02:03:14,820
discussion

3327
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:17,940
we're lost we're primitive like like in

3328
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:19,980
a hundred years all of these things that

3329
02:03:19,980 --> 02:03:22,320
we're talking about I believe will be

3330
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:25,920
part of the discussion uh uh for anyone

3331
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:28,860
who's having any sort of ideas about how

3332
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:31,820
to design systems

3333
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:35,340
all right Bobby well you're always

3334
02:03:35,340 --> 02:03:38,639
welcome back for 15.4 we can push into

3335
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:40,260
decimal places

3336
02:03:40,260 --> 02:03:43,080
unseen all right let's do Free Will

3337
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:44,820
let's let's bring Adam and everybody

3338
02:03:44,820 --> 02:03:48,000
back and and do Free Will Free Will and

3339
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,820
does voting matter two sides of the same

3340
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:51,840
coin

3341
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:54,420
yeah it is and no one's really doing

3342
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:56,280
that no one's thinking that that's

3343
02:03:56,280 --> 02:03:57,960
debate has they think it's purely

3344
02:03:57,960 --> 02:04:00,420
intellectual it's not yeah so yeah we

3345
02:04:00,420 --> 02:04:01,860
need to connect it to practical stuff

3346
02:04:01,860 --> 02:04:04,139
yeah well thank you to all of our

3347
02:04:04,139 --> 02:04:06,980
panelists and Bobby as always so

3348
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:10,679
yeah both of you yeah no strengthen the

3349
02:04:10,679 --> 02:04:11,820
journey journey well is everyone

yeah I wish we could hear more from

3352
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:18,440
Brennan but uh yeah we'll follow up um

3353
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:21,360
uh go to the road to Omega sub stack and

3354
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:23,280
I'm gonna post about this video and then

3355
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:24,599
we can have some discussion in the

3356
02:04:24,599 --> 02:04:26,580
comments if you see this yeah all right

3357
02:04:26,580 --> 02:04:27,780
thank you all right thanks a lot

3358
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:31,639
everybody farewell bye
