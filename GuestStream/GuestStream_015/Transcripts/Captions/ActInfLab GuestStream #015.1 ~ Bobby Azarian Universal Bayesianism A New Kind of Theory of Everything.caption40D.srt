1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,634
Yep. All right.

2
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:03,136
Thanks, Daniel, for having me.

3
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:06,840
Everyone at the active entrance lab staff.
Canceling twice.

4
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:11,211
Life's been kind of crazy
with finishing this book

5
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:15,849
that this talk will be about
and having a kid at six months old.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,385
And I got sick,
like, a week ago, like, right.

7
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,153
Leading up to.

8
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,322
I didn't want to cancel a third time.

9
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:23,023
Look crazy.

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,925
So this is a very rushed presentation.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,662
It'll be better
if it's more of, like, a conversation

12
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:32,799
and since I haven't even gone
through the slides myself once,

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,169
and it's
going to get into a lot of things,

14
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,671
like immediately
like open up bags and worms.

15
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,907
Like, there's just philosophical issues,

16
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:46,279
things that people won't agree about,
like immediately.

17
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,348
But yes.

18
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:53,053
So this is just going to be like
a small introduction to the thesis.

19
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:54,854
In the book.

20
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:55,855
And yeah.

21
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:58,124
Explain more, I guess.

22
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,927
After I begin so yeah, it's

23
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:02,662
called this the

24
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,764
integrated evolutionary synthesis

25
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,968
compared to like the modern synthesis
or even the extended evolutionary

26
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,005
synthesis is integrated because it

27
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,241
kind of reconceptualize is evolution,

28
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,179
biology and evolution in terms. Of.

29
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,982
In terms of thermodynamics
and information theory

30
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:26,219
or energy flows, energy
and information flows

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,522
takes from cybernetics

32
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:33,393
so yeah, it's a non reductive theory
of everything

33
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,963
that includes emergent phenomena
like life, mine and civilization.

34
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,700
I. Say that
because most theories of everything

35
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,302
we're used to are fundamental physics

36
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,572
theories that don't have anything to say
about life and consciousness.

37
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,041
They ignore in

38
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:52,011
and I don't think those should be called

39
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,914
theories of everything,
because theories of everything should be

40
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,484
an explanation for everything.

41
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,186
And if you believe the things
that we care about most out.

42
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:00,854
Then.

43
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,490
It's not much of a theory of everything.

44
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,225
So this is the book.

45
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:10,196
I've spent the last two to three years
writing obsessively.

46
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,600
And it's available for preorder now.

47
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,235
So if you want to check that out,

48
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,105
you can find it within Google search.

49
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,841
Here is the table of Contents.

50
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,210
So the book is broken into three
sections.

51
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,914
Part one talks.
About the origins. Of life.

52
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:31,251
And part two about evolution,
while part three.

53
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,520
Focuses on.

54
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:38,057
Consciousness and free will
and the fate of life in the universe.

55
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:41,694
So these are really big questions
that we're going to focus on.

56
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,363
Part two.

57
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,965
And give a pretty.

58
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,634
Like a. Superficial.

59
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,370
Overview of part two.

60
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,037
But you can.

61
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,973
Feel free to ask me any questions about

62
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,410
any of the other topics that are related

63
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,114
and I'll try to see what I can answer
without going into.

64
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,715
All of the.

65
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,852
Information
that I would need to explain this things.

66
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:10,890
So Thomas Huxley,
known as Darwin's Bulldog,

67
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,761
because he was such a strong advocate
for Darwin's theory,

68
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,797
said that the question of questions
for mankind the problem

69
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:21,000
which underlies all others is more
deeply interesting than any other,

70
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:25,238
is the ascertainment and of the place
which man occupies in nature

71
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,608
and of his relations
to the universe of things.

72
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,011
So where do we fit
into the grand cosmic scheme?

73
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,147
Most scientists

74
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,716
in the 20th century,
and I would even say.

75
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,852
Now believe.

76
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,955
That we are an accident.

77
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,390
So Jack Monroe.

78
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:45,792
French

79
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,262
biochemist who won the Nobel Prize

80
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,998
for Physiology and Medicine.

81
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:52,832
And wrote a.

82
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:56,369
Book called Chance Incest,
which was really influential. And.

83
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,372
He was just as reductionist
as you can get.

84
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,875
Man at Last knows that he is alone
in the unfeeling immensity

85
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:08,014
of the universe, out of which he emerged
only by chance neither.

86
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:12,385
So some of the words
are covered by by Daniel.

87
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:16,422
So either it's his destiny spelled out
nor his duty.

88
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:17,557
Have. Been written down.

89
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,726
I think something wrong with that quote.

90
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,594
But so if there are times

91
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,397
I'm trying to read something
where the is over, I might have to skip.

92
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:28,468
You can you can move that
because it looks good on my site.

93
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,571
It it looks fine. Thank you. Yeah.

94
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,375
Neither his destiny
nor his duty have been written down,

95
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,012
so that was kind of
based on this old idea that

96
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,415
the emergence of life

97
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,584
was a product of chance assembly

98
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,920
so like this just

99
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,989
statistical fluctuation

100
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,726
that brought together all the molecules
needed to create the first cell.

101
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:57,196
We now know that that's probably not
what happened.

102
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,066
It's this gradual process
of self-organization.

103
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,101
Jeremy England has

104
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:06,239
been in the media a lot about his theory
of dissipated adaptation.

105
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:11,377
So let's

106
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,116
so we will see.

107
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,985
This is kind of
like a different point of view.

108
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,021
Not everybody was convinced.
By a monster.

109
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,123
Carl Sagan said the origin of life

110
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:27,360
must be a highly probable warfare
as soon as conditions permit.

111
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,629
Up it parts.

112
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,297
So this is an important question.

113
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:36,869
Whether
life was improbable or inevitable.

114
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:41,307
So if life is highly improbable,
we're likely to be alone in the universe.

115
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,775
But if the emergence of life

116
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,578
is inevitable,
given a certain set of common.

117
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:46,813
Physical.

118
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,749
Conditions,
then it's likely that we have life

119
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,853
at least on planets
that are sufficiently earthlike

120
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,824
specifically have geochemistry
like the Earth.

121
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,260
Have a star.

122
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,762
Some like the.

123
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,397
Earth's because that's. What.

124
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,266
Provides the energy that pushes
it far from equilibrium.

125
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,335
So we're going to get in. To.

126
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,071
All that stuff pretty soon.

127
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,641
Christian, to do this quote is kind of a.

128
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,610
Response to Stephen J.

129
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,946
Gold, who just really emphasized.

130
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,815
To. Both Meno and Stephen J.

131
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,917
Called the.

132
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,286
The importance of chance.

133
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,822
In. Nature,
and that everything is basically,

134
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,693
you know, a contingency
that came from a chance process.

135
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,161
Where.

136
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,731
They do
says that you can have this inevitability

137
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:42,335
at some philosophers
would see us as teleology.

138
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,204
But it doesn't mean that.

139
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:50,543
This inevitable progress is being driven
by a supernatural force.

140
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:54,747
He explains that the natural constraints
within which chance operates

141
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,284
are such that evolution
in the direction of increasing complexity

142
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:02,221
was virtually bound to take place if
given the opportunity, chance does not.

143
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,624
Exclude. Inevitability.

144
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:09,061
So he was also a Nobel Prize
winning biologist

145
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:14,066
the same category as minor,
but had the complete opposite opinion.

146
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,869
And we can talk about that too.

147
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,438
Basically,

148
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:24,076
when systems are open systems
and they're pushed far from equilibrium.

149
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:29,315
By. A flow of energy,
you basically get something like.

150
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:35,188
A. Statistical bias away from what
we would expect with isolated systems.

151
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,523
Closed systems that. Are.

152
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:41,627
Open to energy
will relax the thermodynamic equilibrium.

153
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,264
And when a system is being pushed
far from equilibrium,

154
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,769
it will naturally
organize because organization

155
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,371
happens.

156
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,072
Under the flow of.

157
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:53,539
Energy.

158
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,108
And we're going to see exactly
why it's a Darwinian process.

159
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:00,079
But basically

160
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,883
you get inevitability
if you have the right ingredients.

161
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:08,488
So we'll talk about.

162
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,157
To kind of frame this.

163
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,726
We already
kind of mentioned those two worldviews.

164
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,094
So the first world.

165
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,163
View would be the reductionist worldview.

166
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,232
And I should be clear that.

167
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,267
Reductionism. Is

168
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,538
also it's a method in an ideology,
and we shouldn't

169
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,041
confuse those two things.

170
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:33,412
And Daniel, I guess
just so I'm know where I'm at, maybe

171
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,882
when you, when I've gone 30 minutes,
you can let me know.

172
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,851
OK, or who.

173
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,986
OK, great.

174
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:44,023
So reductionism the method

175
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,124
basically says

176
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:48,661
that reality can be understood
by breaking down all physical phenomena

177
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:52,398
into their simplest parts
so that we may observe the basic

178
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:56,402
behavior of the fundamental
constituents of nature. So

179
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,405
you know,

180
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,407
plug in this. Charge.

181
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,242
I might get to do that.

182
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,878
But basically the.

183
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,180
Method is how science works.

184
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,781
If we want to.

185
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:12,418
Understand emergence, we also have
to understand how the components

186
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,555
that systems are made of work
in isolation.

187
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,523
So it's an essential.

188
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,457
Part of the.

189
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,560
Story, but it's not the whole part.

190
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:21,794
We'll see.

191
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,864
So the method inspired an ideology,

192
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:28,200
and ideology is is is just that.

193
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,770
It's it's an ideology and it's rigid.

194
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,341
And basically the method

195
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,945
doesn't really

196
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,213
imply that that ideology is true.

197
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,751
So when I'm attacking reductionism,
I'm not attacking the method.

198
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,820
I'm attacking the worldview.

199
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,158
And so that worldview,
we can say that basically.

200
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:57,196
So. Hard determinism
is part of the reductionist worldview.

201
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,001
So thought experiment
that some people are familiar with.

202
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,070
I'm sure the place is Daemon.

203
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,271
Basically.

204
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,339
The class was.

205
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,108
A. French mathematician that.

206
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,876
I took.

207
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,613
Newton's kind of model of reality.

208
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,948
And. Applied it to everything.

209
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,584
Newton himself was kind of a mystic
when it comes to life.

210
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,820
He didn't really think that physics
applied. To.

211
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,589
Two organisms, or at least to humans. But

212
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:28,260
Laplace really, you know,

213
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,497
came up with the idea that, like,

214
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,734
basically the evolution of the universe
is just this.

215
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,403
Like clockwork.

216
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,872
Universe, where it's like

217
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,541
a machine with cogs
that are just turning.

218
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:47,246
So there are no there's no room
for agency and free will in that picture.

219
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,082
When Boltzmann came along

220
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,053
in the 19th century and

221
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,355
came up with statistical mechanics,

222
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:00,159
the clockwork universe kind of became
the billiard ball universe.

223
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,530
But it's just the idea that everything in
the universe is made of atoms.

224
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,333
And at these atoms are

225
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,937
interacting and that's the whole picture.

226
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,072
So the ideology says

227
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:16,108
we're nothing more than our atoms,
so we don't make decisions.

228
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:21,914
Consciousness is just an empty phenomenon
and it feels to us like we are.

229
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:25,117
But actually this trajectory
was determined basically

230
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,221
at basically
from the moment of the Big Bang.

231
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:33,693
And there's kind of
no freedom in anything and no future

232
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,763
other than
what was determined from the beginning.

233
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,132
So the second law of thermodynamics.

234
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,301
Also sort of shaped
the reductionist worldview.

235
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,805
Says the universe is becoming
increasingly disordered.

236
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:49,742
There's actually kind of two different
interpretations of the second law.

237
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,445
The first one.

238
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,047
Kind of emerged from the work of.

239
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,950
Karnow and Classiest, the kind. Of.

240
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,753
Original thermodynamics work
where entropy was about.

241
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,323
A measure of.

242
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,525
Energy that can't be used for work.

243
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,929
So a kind of measure
of what use less energy,

244
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,866
where later with Boltzmann, he tried. To.

245
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:18,037
Put the second law on like

246
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,240
statistical basis
based on like atomic theory.

247
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,709
So basically

248
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:28,848
people applied Boltzmann
statistical interpretation

249
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:32,818
of the second law to the universe
and came up with this notion

250
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,321
that the universe
is becoming increasingly disordered,

251
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,924
which isn't great for life,
because it means that life is transient

252
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,393
and likely cosmically insignificant.

253
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:45,231
And this world view
is associated with materialism,

254
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,167
which doesn't recognize

255
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:52,471
consciousness as real, certainly doesn't
recognize it as having causal power.

256
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:58,043
And. Historically, it often ignored
apparently immaterial phenomena

257
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,080
like energy
and information, mental processes.

258
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,182
I am.

259
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,850
Just going. To.

260
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,820
Grab my charger. So

261
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:10,756
sounds good.

262
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:14,160
This doesn't die
but I will be right back.

263
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,728
Take your time

264
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,732
so those who are watching

265
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:23,669
live, please feel free to leave a comment
or a question.

266
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,105
I'm writing some things down.

267
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,141
We'll look forward
to the return of electrical power

268
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,676
to Bobby

269
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,420
All right.

270
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,488
My first live.

271
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,824
I will be more prepared when I return.

272
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:45,858
Part two.

273
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,328
That's something else I told Daniel
is that this is kind of like part one

274
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,329
that I could come back and.

275
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,463
Talk about

276
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,366
the. Ideas that come after.

277
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:58,504
So it will have 15.2 it'll be awesome.

278
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,872
It's an infinite sequence.

279
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,907
It's the sequence is always joyous.

280
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:04,410
Great.

281
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:09,048
OK. So

282
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,150
reductionist worldview
says that all lifeforms,

283
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,819
including humans, are nothing more
than collections of atoms

284
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:18,257
literally following fixed and arbitrary
mechanical trajectories.

285
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,926
Term and solely by. Math and not by mind.

286
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:28,067
So this worldview, if if.

287
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:32,571
You convince someone that they don't have
free will because you tell them about.

288
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,573
The reductionist worldview.

289
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,744
There's actually a study
where they did this and they read

290
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:42,615
participants a passage from Francis Crick
explaining

291
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,385
that it appears
that we don't have any free will.

292
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,589
The participants actually on.

293
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,625
Subsequent tests.

294
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,893
Were more like more likely.

295
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,561
To cheat on the. Test.

296
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,797
Because they felt like they didn't have
any personal responsibility.

297
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,333
They weren't making the decisions,
therefore they could cheat.

298
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:06,272
That's kind of funny because they are
actually you can see that.

299
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,406
By what.

300
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:12,144
They're being told,
they are changing their behavior.

301
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,313
So it is having some kind of effect

302
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,783
if we do in fact have agency
or free will and.

303
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,751
We're.

304
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,053
Kind of talking about agency,

305
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,856
we don't really get into free will,
but those are related topics.

306
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,458
But if that's not true.

307
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:31,096
Then that's really bad that the majority
of scientists are telling people

308
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,565
we don't have free will
because the people that believe this,

309
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,070
it's having negative
effects on, for example, mental health.

310
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,171
Other studies have shown.

311
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:39,571
That.

312
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,841
Belief
and no free will can lead to depression.

313
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,912
And belief in free
will can have all these positive effects.

314
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,647
Of course.

315
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,883
As soon as I start
talking about free will,

316
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:55,220
I'm sure a lot of people have objections
you might think that there's no way

317
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,691
that we can have room for free
will in a physical worldview.

318
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:02,561
But that's exactly what we're going
to begin to talk about today.

319
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,130
That causal power of information

320
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,534
and that basically organisms are agents

321
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,537
that are cybernetic control units.

322
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,873
So as controllers.

323
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,509
We do have agency.

324
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:23,882
So in the belief
that we're accidents of nature

325
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:27,820
rather than natural manifestations
of physical laws.

326
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,956
I'm sure also in our sense.

327
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,324
Of well-being.

328
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,626
Just so you know, I'm not making this up.

329
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,563
I can I'll give you some.

330
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,764
Quotes from.

331
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,100
Really famous physicists.

332
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,402
Who are. Kind of militant reductionist.

333
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,037
So Brian Greene

334
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,639
says, I think it's very important
to face up to the truth of reality,

335
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,709
which is in fact,
that life and consciousness is

336
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,013
a fleeting phenomenon
on the entire cosmological timeline.

337
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,050
Brian Greene just came out with a book,

338
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,020
and he's like going on interviews
just saying this.

339
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:05,157
And it's really interesting
because some other famous physicists

340
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,160
don't agree at all, and he's stating it
like it's complete facts.

341
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,927
So, for example,

342
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:13,832
David Deutsch would not agree with this,
and we'll get into that Sabine Pass.

343
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,602
And Felder is another person

344
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,470
I know some of the

345
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,440
some of my friends in the community,

346
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,842
who are these people

347
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,745
working on emergence and causation stuff?

348
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:30,416
I get bothered by her statements
because she is also.

349
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,719
Very ultra. Reductionistic.

350
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,188
So I wish people would stop insisting
they have free will.

351
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,556
It's terribly annoying.

352
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,059
Insisting that free will exists
is bad science,

353
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,628
like insisting that horoscopes
tell you something about the future.

354
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,664
It's not compatible
with our knowledge about nature. So

355
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,767
I'm saying that's wrong.

356
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,702
We want to be into free will that much.

357
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:54,740
But if you have questions at the end,
we will talk about

358
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,077
how information, adaptive information

359
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,080
gets built up by evolution

360
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,483
in adaptive systems, complex
adaptive systems

361
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:09,388
and you will see how these systems
actually do control their own future.

362
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,592
So Sam Harris is another anti-free
wheel person

363
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,628
says you're not controlling this storm
and you are not lost in it.

364
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,263
You are the storm.

365
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,899
So it's kind of funny
because he's using a metaphor here.

366
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:24,369
But what this story kind of reveals
is that

367
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,473
yes, we are a storm.

368
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,808
That's right.
We are a dissipated structure.

369
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,376
Like a storm.

370
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,813
Emerges to dissipate an energy gradient.

371
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,282
And we're not really going
to talk about that.

372
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:41,153
That's what the first part of the book is
about, the origins part. But

373
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,356
I'm just
pointing it out because it's interesting

374
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,992
because we are like a storm
in that aspect.

375
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,962
But we also. Differ from a storm.

376
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,130
Because a.

377
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,400
Storm does not have agency,
a storm does not have the ability

378
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,604
to seek out new energy gradients.

379
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,140
It's just kind. Of.

380
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,777
Being pushed around by these gradients
in nature.

381
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,112
Where.

382
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,715
Organisms are actually.

383
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,316
Controllers.

384
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,352
And so you are storm.

385
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:14,853
But you do.

386
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,856
Have control over. This storm.

387
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:23,862
So these people are kind of
have the opposite view.

388
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,664
So Julio Tanoni,

389
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:29,334
creator of Integrated Information
Theory, says there is true free will.

390
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,872
Great lecture that just popped up,
I think, months ago where he gives

391
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:37,509
a two hour talk
on basically integrated information

392
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,712
and how it shows that systems

393
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:44,683
do have causal power and in a. Way.

394
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,218
Have free will.

395
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,687
So depending on
your definition of free will.

396
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,256
We do have free will.

397
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,925
According to his model.

398
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:57,062
David Deutsch said in an interview
with John Horgan just a year ago or so.

399
00:19:57,062 --> 00:20:01,233
I'm sure we have free will, Christof Koch
says, explains how, you know,

400
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,835
there are a lot of experiments
still about experiments

401
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,172
which we will talk about next time that

402
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,509
basically, yeah,

403
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:14,012
some people interpret
it as not having free will, but actually

404
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,449
we will see later.

405
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,651
When you deliberate.

406
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,853
That's actually an act of free

407
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,890
will, these choices
where we're actually where

408
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,060
you bring your entire conscious being
to that question and try to analyze it.

409
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,194
Under all the.

410
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:32,331
Various conditions
and actually there was a study cook

411
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:36,501
did that kind of show that the debate,
the study

412
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,340
was kind of interpreted wrong. And

413
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,675
for anyone

414
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:48,780
who understands that stuff, the readiness
potential that was supposed to be proof

415
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:54,653
that there was no free will disappeared
when the decisions involved deliberation.

416
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:58,156
So yeah, that's kind of meandering

417
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,360
but I'm sure a lot of people
are interested in this bigger.

418
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,461
Picture of.

419
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,230
Why this emergence paradigm

420
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,667
is so radically different
from the reductionist paradigm.

421
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,769
It kind of.

422
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:11,536
Puts.

423
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:16,441
Information front and center and systems
that process information.

424
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:17,643
Complex.

425
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,479
Adaptive systems,
our computational systems

426
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,149
and these systems.

427
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,918
In. The with these systems information
actually does

428
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,187
have causal power we're going to explain
what we mean by that.

429
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,124
So paradigm of emergence,

430
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,926
the collective says the collective.

431
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:38,730
Behavior of interacting parts,
not simply how they function in isolation

432
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,334
is key to understanding the emergence
and evolution of all the fascinating

433
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,203
organisms and ecosystems
that make up the biosphere.

434
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:49,675
So it's really not about
just like particles.

435
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:55,380
It's about the patterns that emerge
when these systems find these certain

436
00:21:55,647 --> 00:22:00,118
configurations
through basically Darwinian mechanisms.

437
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,889
And we'll see that
self-organization, too, has a Darwinian.

438
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:04,389
Dynamic.

439
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,093
Each emergence
in the cosmic self-organization process

440
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:11,430
is brought about by higher order
phase transition that moves life ever

441
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,433
further away from a state
of thermodynamic equilibrium.

442
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,901
In total disorder.

443
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,270
I'm assuming the audience knows

444
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,273
what thermodynamics equilibrium is.

445
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,208
It's basically

446
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:27,179
if you have, for example, Boltzmann
to a model. Of.

447
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,583
An ideal gas
and explained that, for example,

448
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:36,555
if the gas molecules are bunched
up in the corner, naturally it's going

449
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:41,793
the gas is going to spread out
until there's no pattern.

450
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:46,498
And basically
it's like a completely mixed up state.

451
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,868
So. Equilibrium

452
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,270
is associated with death and disorder.

453
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,140
Because systems.

454
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,509
Naturally tend toward.

455
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,044
This more.

456
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,746
Next. Step.

457
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:04,549
On patterned completely chaotic state.

458
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,586
Of course.

459
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,421
Later we're going to talk about.

460
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:12,357
Why. Open systems
that that rule doesn't apply.

461
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:15,327
Basically, systems
that are open to the flow of energy

462
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,829
can resist this tendency
towards a disorder.

463
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,532
And that's really.
What the whole story is kind of

464
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,101
based on.

465
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:27,739
So through that series of such phase
transitions, these are also called

466
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:32,110
these higher order phase transitions
are major evolutionary transitions.

467
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,380
John Maynard Smith talked about them
and Metis system transitions

468
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:40,252
by the Cybernet is this Valentine Turgeon
basically the same concept.

469
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,987
There's some subtle differences.

470
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:46,591
So the idea is that cosmic
self-organization is a series of these

471
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,828
transitions where functional things
come together to make larger

472
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:54,099
functional ones which come together
to even make even larger ones and so on.

473
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,436
And through this process,
adaptive complexity or life.

474
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,305
So that's a more general way
to talk about life

475
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,542
becomes better
equipped to dominate the cosmos.

476
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,579
Life requires an organization
that is increasingly hierarchical

477
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:11,283
and integrated and therefore more
resilient and computationally powerful.

478
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,187
So here are just a couple of.

479
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:18,657
Figures you see this hierarchy

480
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,693
in this structural hierarchy
of matter in life.

481
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,462
This was adapted from.

482
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,931
A big. Physics journal. I can't remember.

483
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,065
Which one it was, but.

484
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,735
Basically physicists are

485
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:35,540
recognizing this hierarchy,
even when it extends to life.

486
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,276
So Jeffrey Westbrook scale comes to mind.

487
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,381
And so we see the hierarchy of science

488
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:48,954
kind of naturally mirror
this hierarchy of matter and life.

489
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:53,558
And the reductionist picture would say
that these things at the top here

490
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,395
are kind of insignificant

491
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,464
parts of the story, transient.

492
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,602
But we will see that this you know.

493
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,370
The more we go up.

494
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,640
The more influence on cosmic evolution.

495
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,809
The phenomena have.

496
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:12,477
Cells.

497
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,347
Thomas Huxley's question

498
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,949
about man's place in the cosmos.

499
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:24,389
Is basically the emergence of paradigm
the paradigm of.

500
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,491
Emergence. I'm going to discuss.

501
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:29,861
And actually this is kind of
maybe like in a specific

502
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,898
or a new paradigm of emergence
because it includes all this stuff

503
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:37,502
about thermodynamics and information
theory says that emergence,

504
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:40,939
the emergence and evolution
of life, modern societies and technology

505
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:44,776
are all part of one thermodynamic
process, one evolutionary process,

506
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:48,880
one computational process
unified by the concept of knowledge.

507
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:53,752
So this theory is a
theory of knowledge creation.

508
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,290
And so knowledge
is going to be the unifying theme.

509
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,325
And we'll briefly
talk about epistemology.

510
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:03,428
I wanted to talk about it more,
but it just would have been too long.

511
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,765
Cosmic evolution

512
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:10,969
in this paradigm is a universal process
of becoming as opposed to being.

513
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,138
So the universe isn't this static thing.

514
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,741
It's actually evolving
very much like an organism

515
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,778
or a complex adaptive system.

516
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,314
So it's not a can psychic theory
in this theory,

517
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,616
consciousness emerges
that's very important.

518
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,886
But you might. Call
it emergent pants like.

519
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,121
Ism because.

520
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,391
As this evolutionary process precedes

521
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:37,629
inanimate matter,
as life spreads gets converted into.

522
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,631
Animate matter.

523
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,900
So in this picture, humans are neither

524
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,703
a cosmic accident
nor the end goal of evolution.

525
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:49,174
So we are instead a step
on the evolutionary ladder of becoming

526
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:54,446
and we are also potentially an essential
driver of increasing cosmic complexity.

527
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,916
So this big idea that the universe
is undergoing this

528
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,720
majestic self-organizing process
and at this moment of time,

529
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,890
at least in this corner of the universe,
we are the stars of the show.

530
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,694
This picture is from Chasen's.

531
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:11,062
Book.

532
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:15,400
The Rise of Complex The Cosmic Evolution,
The Rise of Complexity.

533
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,870
He's a Harvard astrophysicist,

534
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,140
but I just use Freeman Dyson quote here
because it seemed irrelevant.

535
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:23,575
It's conceivable

536
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,778
that life may have a larger role
to play than we have yet imagined.

537
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:30,448
Life may succeed against all odds and
molding the universe to its own purpose.

538
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:33,518
So I guess Brian Greene
doesn't buy that at all.

539
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:36,655
But if that's true, then

540
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:41,593
as far as cosmology,
cosmologists have to think about. The.

541
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:42,594
Role of life.

542
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:46,398
There's a lot of people
that said similar things like celluloid

543
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,400
and famously Ray Kurzweil.

544
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:52,971
So just a couple of quotes here.

545
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:57,742
So, you know, when people hear these
terms progress, there's just this stigma.

546
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:01,046
Immediately they thought like,
oh, someone's trying to sneak in religion

547
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,948
or some intelligent design theory.

548
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:07,686
So you see these trusted names of physics
here.

549
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,989
David Deutsch, his narrowly conceived
evolutionary theory, considers

550
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,792
as mere vehicles for the replication
of our genes or means,

551
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,161
and it refuses to address
the question of why

552
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:19,731
evolution has tended to create ever
greater adaptive complexity.

553
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:20,732
Or the role that.

554
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,601
Such complexity
plays in the wider scheme of things.

555
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:27,472
So there is clearly implying
that adaptive complexity

556
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,507
does have this larger role to play

557
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,010
we now see how it is

558
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,513
possible for the universe to increase
both organization and entropy.

559
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:38,683
At the same time, the optimistic
and pessimistic areas of time

560
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:41,986
can coexist
the universe can display creative actual

561
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,190
you need directional progress
even in the face of the second law.

562
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,460
Physicist Paul. Davies says. That.

563
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,528
So that's really

564
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,098
kind of a key point.

565
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:55,600
In. This is that

566
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,002
the second law actually

567
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,672
is in a sense
driving this increase in progress.

568
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:01,372
So not.

569
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,509
Only can we have know directional
progress in the face of the second law,

570
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,879
it seems that this progress requires
the second law

571
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,715
because we'll see that
the second law is. The.

572
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:15,320
Basically the natural selection pressure
for self-organizing systems.

573
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:21,493
So in a sense, the second law is both Shiva the destroyer and Brahma the creator.

574
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,529
So a goal

575
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,532
of this unifying theory of reality.

576
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:28,600
I I've been.

577
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,868
Calling to great constituents.

578
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,670
It was actually a name

579
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,841
suggested by Marco Lin, who is is a PhD,

580
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:40,078
Estonian
and influenced some of this talk.

581
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,782
So basically the.

582
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,452
Unifying theory of reality illuminates
the connection between complexity

583
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:52,290
cognition, consciousness and cosmic
evolution or matter mind and cosmos.

584
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,692
And it's really based on complexity.

585
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:59,197
Science is a lot broader than complexity
science but I guess that name kind.

586
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,533
Of in a way. Includes everything.

587
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:05,303
So it's the unification of major sciences
of our time, including but not limited

588
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:05,970
to physics,

589
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,374
biology, neuroscience, computer science,
evolutionary theory and statistics,

590
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,075
and basically describes

591
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:14,813
complex adaptive systems of all scales
in terms of energy and information flows.

592
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,882
So it uses statistical

593
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:20,919
thermodynamics,
information theory and cybernetics.

594
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,154
So we will talk about those.

595
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:23,721
A bit.

596
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,624
Coming up.
So if you want to see kind of I.

597
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:30,195
Can a map of what sort of informs.

598
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,565
This non reductive theory of everything.

599
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:36,768
So. Here you go.

600
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:40,572
So I know the slide of information,
so I'll kind of try

601
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,575
to simplify this for everyone.

602
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,910
There are some unifying paradigms
that have emerged.

603
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,846
So basically this theory is nothing new.

604
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,215
It's basically evolutionary epistemology.

605
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:55,453
After that came universal
Darwinism and later

606
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,990
right now we're seeing
this kind of revolution with like

607
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,727
Bayesian inference in these ideas
being applied to everything.

608
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:07,632
So being informed.

609
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,235
By these

610
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,238
paradigms. And.

611
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:17,675
Combining those paradigms, updating them,
I should say, with

612
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:21,980
information from non equilibrium
thermodynamics that we're talking about,

613
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,048
the thermodynamics of open systems

614
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,050
information theory.

615
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,553
So Shannon's theory,

616
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,589
some of you will know that information
theory

617
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:35,393
is related very closely
to non equilibrium thermodynamics and.

618
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,829
Basically.

619
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:38,396
Boltzmann.

620
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:44,369
Statistical entropy is mathematically
the same as Shannon entropy

621
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,705
to information entropy,
which is a measure of uncertainty.

622
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,008
If I.

623
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:50,642
Had more time,

624
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:55,246
I would go through thermodynamics
and the different types of entropy.

625
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,016
But we. Don't have time for that.

626
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:02,220
But if anyone has any questions
I can clarify cybernetics. Was.

627
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:07,492
Basically information theory
applied to biology adaptive systems.

628
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:10,528
It was the first science
of adaptive systems, really.

629
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:15,700
And it's funny, while writing this
I found out because, you know, I.

630
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,234
Hadn't.

631
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,203
I had heard the name cybernetics,
but it wasn't clear.

632
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,506
How important it was

633
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,909
and I talked by Jim Crutchfield.

634
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:28,546
Santa Fe Institute
basically revealed that

635
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:32,684
because cybernetics got associated
with like the Russian.

636
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:33,885
Like during.

637
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:37,355
The Cold War, kind of like the Russian
agenda cybernetics,

638
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,391
which used to design like heat seeking
missiles.

639
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:44,595
Norbert
Weiner's theory was almost immediately

640
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:47,799
applied for military uses,
and because of that,

641
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,569
it stopped
being taught in American colleges.

642
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,340
So. Yeah, it's really important.

643
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,375
And it was actually

644
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,978
emerging at the same time
as information to people

645
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:05,016
were already thinking about systems
in terms of information flows.

646
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:08,286
But it's more than information theory
because it's the science of feedback.

647
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,824
So. Dynamical systems theory

648
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:16,561
or complex systems, it's
kind of like an offshoot of that.

649
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:21,232
All of these inform what I call universal
Bayesian ism, not the only person to.

650
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:22,533
Call it that.

651
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,003
I had searched that term

652
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,138
and found Adam Saffron's

653
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,342
paper on integrated world
modeling theory that use that same term.

654
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:34,612
But John Campbell has been a researcher.

655
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:37,515
Who has done.

656
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,918
A lot to show this equivalence between

657
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:44,722
evolutionary processes and processes

658
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,291
of Bayesian inference for
and talk about that in a little. Bit.

659
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,996
So yeah,
if anybody has any questions about that.

660
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:55,867
But really all of these things,
origin of life research, integrate

661
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,068
evolutionary theory

662
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,837
if you haven't checked out the work

663
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:03,674
of these people, like everybody here
is worth reading their work.

664
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:07,478
But so from that we get a unified
theory of reality

665
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:11,549
that is based on what I call
evolutionary physiology, universal

666
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,951
Darwinism,
universal Bayesian ISM framework.

667
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,454
That's a long. Name. I'm aware. Of that.

668
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:19,590
But it's just to show
that these three theories are basically

669
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,092
the same theory.

670
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:28,566
So. Universal
Darwinism says that the universe

671
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,402
is evolving at every scales
for both competitive evolution

672
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:35,006
and through self-organization,
which is cooperative evolution

673
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,008
among agents
that have formed a collective unit.

674
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,812
So it started with Richard Dawkins
and his concepts of the meme,

675
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,448
the selfish gene that means

676
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:49,153
where these cultural units
that were equivalent to genes.

677
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,623
And so we started to see how information.

678
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,992
Was this paradigm.

679
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:58,262
That can be extended beyond biology.

680
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,532
And then we had Dan Dennett and Darwin's
dangerous idea really extend this

681
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,469
to like everything to

682
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:08,739
self-organizing systems, to like cultural
and technological systems.

683
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,276
I evolutionary biology came before that.

684
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,947
It was based on Karl Popper's philosophy,
but it was actually invented

685
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,549
by cognitive psychologist
Donald Campbell.

686
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,620
And basically that said
that the evolutionary process

687
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,090
is a problem
solving procedure that creates knowledge.

688
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:32,263
So the information stored in genomes
and in

689
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,700
brains and cultural memory

690
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:41,539
basically that all that knowledge
accumulates from an evolutionary process.

691
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,942
And it's really helpful
to think of it as knowledge,

692
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:48,045
especially when we start to talk
about this.

693
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,080
In the.

694
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,715
Context of thermodynamics.

695
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,917
And information. Because.

696
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,420
Basically this knowledge is what allows

697
00:35:56,654 --> 00:36:00,858
life adaptive systems
to stay far from equilibrium.

698
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,461
They can resist this tendency towards
decay.

699
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,531
Life can continue to persist

700
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:10,368
if it can acquire the knowledge
that it needs

701
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:15,840
to essentially to find free energy
that will allow it to sustain itself.

702
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:17,942
So we'll talk.

703
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,344
About that in a second. More

704
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:24,482
so Universe Bayesian ISM is a Bayesian
update of the first two paradigms.

705
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,250
Knowledge is encoded.

706
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,420
So the knowledge
that evolutionary cosmology described

707
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,323
it's actually encoded
in biological systems.

708
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,159
In the form. Of a world. Model.

709
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:39,397
So this model is an internal
representation and statistical mapping

710
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,967
of the environment, which gets updated
through adaptation and adaptive learning.

711
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,737
I talk about that process.

712
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,740
Really the

713
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,841
the whole.

714
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:54,879
Bayesian brain hypothesis, free energy
principle is inspired by

715
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,748
cybernetics heavily so Ross Ashby's.

716
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:58,549
Good.

717
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,952
Regulator theorem
and the law of requisite variety,

718
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:04,822
which we'll talk about,
was kind of the first talk of systems

719
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,458
having models
and having to model the environment.

720
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:12,230
So Kristin says inference is actually
quite close to a theory of everything,

721
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:15,299
including evolution,
consciousness and life itself.

722
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,702
We're not going to go into.

723
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,971
Those bigger. Implications.

724
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:24,108
That would be at the end of the book
in the last chapter.

725
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,912
But basically this isn't just
a theory about evolution.

726
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:29,880
Well, it.

727
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,883
Is evolution, but evolution applied
way more broadly.

728
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:36,921
So quantum
mechanics has an interpretation

729
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,091
that's consistent with this
and bigger problems,

730
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,427
like the fine
tuning of the constants and parameters

731
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:47,765
that allow for the emergence of life
in the universe, we can actually

732
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,968
probably have the best explanation
for the fine

733
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:53,904
tuning problem and measurement problem
of quantum mechanics.

734
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,741
With this theory,

735
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:57,975
we won't talk about it.

736
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,177
But just so you know, next time,

737
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:04,115
cosmological natural selection
by Lee Smolin is the theory that kind of

738
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,652
addresses the fine tuning problem
from a universal Darwinism perspective

739
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:10,755
while quantum Darwinism

740
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,291
addresses the measurement problem.

741
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,360
So we will save that for next time,
but feel free to ask questions

742
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:17,595
about any of those.

743
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,130
So what is this?

744
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,131
Do I have.

745
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,932
This name poetic method naturalism?

746
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,101
I to take that. Out, but.

747
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,103
Next time we'll get into why.

748
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:27,938
I. Chose that name.

749
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:33,844
It's actually, it sounds kind of like,
you know, like complex or buzzword

750
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:37,081
or jargony but there's actually very
practical reasons for having that name.

751
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,185
So this.

752
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,287
Unifying theory, bridges
matter with mind.

753
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:48,025
So Universal Darwinism gives us
the picture of the open ended complexity.

754
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:48,859
Gross

755
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:53,431
that this whole idea is based on the idea
that evolution

756
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:57,001
keeps producing increasingly complex,
intelligent.

757
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,803
Forms of life.

758
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,338
Excuse me.

759
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,842
So. Yeah, universal Bayesian

760
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:09,613
ism is the link that kind of connects
those paradigms with

761
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,449
consciousness.

762
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:17,021
So again, we won't get into that today,
but when you understand

763
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,024
that knowledge is stored
stored in the form of a world model

764
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:24,929
that a system that models itself
can experience, then we start to get

765
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:28,833
a better understanding
of what consciousness consciousness is.

766
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,568
It's a it's a mental model.

767
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:34,538
So it's not a traditional person psychic
theory, even though I know Kristin and.

768
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:35,573
Levin.

769
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,742
And some of his colleagues
have kind of been flirting

770
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:42,613
with being Sikhism, this theory would say
that's wrong and it's kind of

771
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,250
reduces
consciousness to something trivial

772
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,886
by saying that it's in everything.

773
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:52,890
Like a proton is conscious
because it's a triad of quarks

774
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,625
that have to be
in a certain configuration.

775
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,195
So there is some minimal level
of integrated

776
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,531
information that's not enough

777
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,868
to get conscious experience again.

778
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,470
Observer So Safran.

779
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:06,871
Integrate.

780
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:09,173
World
modern theory says that you need a model

781
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,342
with spatial temporal
and causal coherence.

782
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:15,146
I would also argue that it requires
self modeling capacity.

783
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,214
Talk about that a little.

784
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,083
Bit at the end, if anyone's interested.

785
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,586
But this theory is supposed to bridge
mine with cosmic evolution.

786
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:27,057
So the story starts with the second law.

787
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,729
Daniel, if there's any questions
about that intro, let me know.

788
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,698
Yeah, if. I can just proceed.

789
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,901
Could I ask two questions? From a chat?

790
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:37,601
Sure.

791
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,970
OK, the first question is from Blue.

792
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:44,508
Blue wrote Do you think that non-living
autonomous agents

793
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:49,113
with multiple competing priorities
such as self-driving cars have free will?

794
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:53,684
If not, what is the defining difference
between these systems and humans?

795
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,854
No, I don't think they have free will.

796
00:40:56,854 --> 00:41:00,991
So adaptive information
is a special type of information.

797
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:06,030
I do think those things and this is
kind of following Sarah Walker's lead,

798
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:11,068
who's at Arizona State,
and she's also said five faculty now.

799
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:16,140
But basically to have self-driving cars,
you first need life.

800
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:20,744
So anything like a self-driving car
that's like this information

801
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,513
processing system.

802
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:26,750
If you were to come across a broken.

803
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,621
Down self-driving car on some planet
and you saw that,

804
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:33,691
you would have to infer that
there was also life there

805
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:36,227
because life is part of the trajectory
to get to that.

806
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:37,895
But I wouldn't.

807
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:42,967
Say that it has free will because it's
just this input output machine

808
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:46,403
with a defined set of algorithms

809
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,273
and adaptive systems.

810
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:50,908
Are more flexible.

811
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,778
And they're OK.

812
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:58,315
So in the next next time we'll talk about

813
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:02,186
actually the emergence of agency,
which occurs

814
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:06,390
with the origin apply for Abiogenesis
and you basically.

815
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:08,192
Because.

816
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,562
This self-organizing system that would be

817
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,131
kind of like the protocell.

818
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:15,566
Is evolving.

819
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:16,800
Through a mechanism that

820
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,971
a Darwinian dynamic for self-organization
that will explain a bit.

821
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:24,041
It builds up information
and at some point there's

822
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,711
a phase transition where the information
that's getting built up in the system

823
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,181
basically gains

824
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:35,252
what Sarah Walker and Paul Davies
call informational control.

825
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,455
So there's a point where information

826
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:41,859
actually starts calling the shots. And.

827
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,162
You can see the difference between.

828
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,065
Systems that where.

829
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,701
There is informational. Control.

830
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:54,872
So living systems and inanimate systems
because for example,

831
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,142
inanimate systems,

832
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,911
their movement can be predicted
with Newton's laws.

833
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:06,050
So anyone who's taken for sheer physics
probably had to do an exercise

834
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:10,921
where you're trying to predict
the movement of some macroscopic system

835
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:15,059
like a ball that gets kicked
or pushed by a gust of wind.

836
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:17,528
And what you do is.

837
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:19,697
You are you have to draw out.

838
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,799
All the forces acting on the system,

839
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,068
and then you can understand
where the system is going to go.

840
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:25,536
With. Life.

841
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:30,274
You don't need an external force for it
to start, for example, climbing uphill

842
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,843
that's internally generated.

843
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,045
Of course, it's not magic.

844
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:37,514
The adaptive system, the agent

845
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:41,919
has stored energy that it's abstracted
from the environment.

846
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,455
So for example, humans
that are eating food

847
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:48,092
and there's a metabolic process
that's driving this. But.

848
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,362
Still, yeah, with living systems

849
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,764
that where information has causal power,

850
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:58,035
basically the trajectory of the system
can't be predicted

851
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,704
by these fundamental laws of physics.

852
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:02,773
So the ball.

853
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:05,109
Journalist that has been talking about.

854
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:05,843
This.

855
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:09,513
Here, his recent article,
which caused a lot of controversy

856
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:12,616
between like the reductionist
like talking about

857
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:16,320
free will and agency
and just a lot of confusion around that.

858
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,657
So people like Jerry Coyne
were like trying to shoot it down and

859
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:23,160
yeah, hopefully I can talk about that.

860
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,529
I guess we'll talk about that
next time because there's a lot of

861
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,198
confusion.

862
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:29,733
About what we're.

863
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,403
Saying when we say
something has agency or free will.

864
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:34,071
But his example is if you.

865
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,240
Throw throw a ball and a bird.

866
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,741
Off the tower.

867
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,210
And you. Can predict.

868
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:40,477
What.

869
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:42,946
One is going to do, you can't predict
what the other is going to do.

870
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,884
Interestingly, though, I would say that.

871
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,852
The. Birds are completely unpredictable

872
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,188
you can predict
that it's not going to hit the ground.

873
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,190
It's not going to splat on the ground.

874
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,658
It's going to fly away.

875
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:57,628
You have to understand
the bird in terms of its goals.

876
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,998
So you have to understand
the bird and its environment

877
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:04,168
and the information
that got built up through evolution.

878
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:07,271
And then we can start to predict
the bird.

879
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,773
It's statistical behavior.

880
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:14,244
So inanimate systems, you can pretty much
precisely predict the movement

881
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:17,247
unless they're chaotic systems,
which is another story.

882
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:18,782
But with life.

883
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,985
Yeah,
it's not predictable in that same way.

884
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:24,421
With like low level laws of physics.

885
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:29,059
But I'm arguing that actually
life is more predictable than we thought.

886
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:33,731
But you need things like non
equilibrium statistical mechanics

887
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:37,835
and for example, free energy principle

888
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:43,207
so you can say that
an organism will try to minimize

889
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:47,878
free energy or minimize
the difference between its models.

890
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:49,613
Prediction and reality.

891
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:51,381
So it will try to minimize
prediction error.

892
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:53,050
And that's.

893
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,385
A way that we can start to describe

894
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:58,856
behaviors statistically. So

895
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:01,859
yeah.

896
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:04,528
Was there another. Yep.
The second question.

897
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:07,598
Yeah,
I know I didn't completely answer that,

898
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:11,401
but that will require
like all of the points that I would

899
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:13,904
get into in the second topic.
It's a great question. Yeah.

900
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:17,074
I would have written in a larger
margin if I had more time.

901
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,409
The second question is

902
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:23,981
from Joseph Clark
who wrote First Complimented your talk

903
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,650
and let you knew
that you were an interesting guy.

904
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:31,021
So then the question was
how far do you think

905
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:34,792
the universe can organize itself
and what does that look like?

906
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:36,660
OK, great.

907
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,896
That's a perfect question
to lead into the next part.

908
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:41,632
And hopefully by the end of this,

909
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,667
we will have
some sort of answer for that,

910
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:47,337
which is good because when I started
making the beginning of the presentation,

911
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:50,674
I was going to get to consciousness
and free will and I ran out of time.

912
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,109
So there's been a lot of talk

913
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,611
about things that I won't get to
but that we will get to.

914
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:59,116
So the story starts with the second law

915
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:04,454
so. The second law thermodynamics,
as popularly,

916
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:10,561
popularly understood, says that systems
naturally become increasingly.

917
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:11,695
Disordered.

918
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,530
That's really just.

919
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,899
Because of the.

920
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,701
Large scale effects of chance.

921
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:18,902
So there are.

922
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:25,142
Many ways to be disordered and there are
relatively fewer ways to be pattern.

923
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:31,248
So a system
that's this collective of particles.

924
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:33,350
So this evolving ensemble of.

925
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,552
Particles will.

926
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:39,056
Naturally
tend to move towards a configuration

927
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:41,625
that's completely spread out
and mixed up.

928
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,995
There are no energy gradients.

929
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:48,265
So where it can be extracted,
that's a state of equilibrium

930
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,735
so we are going to use this word

931
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:55,873
thermodynamic equilibrium
to mean death and disorder.

932
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,442
So life wants to resist the tendency.

933
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,077
Towards. Equilibrium.

934
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:02,179
It wants to stay ordered.

935
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,648
What's interesting about this
is that it applies to.

936
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:07,985
All this is kind of like where.

937
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:11,221
The free energy principle first since

938
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:14,725
Bayesian brained hypothesis,
it frames everything this way.

939
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,392
So I thought it.

940
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,360
Was a.

941
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,197
Good way to kind of frame it here
is that you start with the second rule

942
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:23,967
in any conceivable system,
any ordered system, for it

943
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:27,871
to continue to
persist has to resist this tendency.

944
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,676
So basically.

945
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:38,282
Schrodinger the guy everybody knows
from quantum mechanics in the in the cat

946
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:39,917
thought experiment,

947
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:43,320
he wrote a book called
What Is Life in the Forties, and

948
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,791
basically kind of solved this paradox,
like if there's a second rule

949
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:48,959
and things become more disordered,

950
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:51,161
then what's with life
and what's with the biosphere

951
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,830
and all this complexity
that we see around us.

952
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:55,766
And he explained.

953
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,302
Actually, Boltzmann
explained this before him.

954
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:00,570
But Boltzmann.

955
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,874
Said a lot to contradict. This as well.

956
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,543
Or just didn't
follow this to its implications.

957
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,712
But Schrodinger explained that.

958
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,380
Open. Systems.

959
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,250
By. Feeding off
free energy in the environment.

960
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:17,554
So free energy is just energy
that you can extract work from.

961
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:20,190
So it's ordered
energy as opposed to energy

962
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,626
that's been dissipated
in the form of heat.

963
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,961
You can expect energy

964
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,030
useful energy from that energy.

965
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:27,664
It's still there.

966
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:31,001
It's just spread out
and it's you can't harness it.

967
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:34,371
Collecting it would cost more than you
get out of it.

968
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:36,974
So Schrödinger.

969
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,608
Explained that.

970
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:42,212
If. A system can get free energy,
which he called negative entropy

971
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,248
or energy, Nagin peace

972
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:47,584
was called by someone later.

973
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,288
So to understand.

974
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:54,624
How ordered system stay ordered,

975
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:57,127
you basically need to understand
that they have to

976
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:01,231
constantly be extracting free energy
from the environment.

977
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:05,502
The moment that they can't
extract more free

978
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:10,240
energy is the moment that the system dies
and decays to equilibrium.

979
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,444
So basically

980
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:18,348
the second law is not violated by life
because.

981
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:20,550
In this.

982
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,452
Effort to stay far from equilibrium.

983
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,621
In. Life, it keeps extracting

984
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:27,924
that ordered free energy
and keeps dissipating it as heat.

985
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:32,662
So so it's basically exporting entropy
into the environment.

986
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:34,231
So the. Order.

987
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:38,168
That is maintained

988
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:44,107
is paid for by the dissipated energy
which come becomes thermal entropy.

989
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:45,475
So there are multiple.

990
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:47,744
Definitions of entropy.
So you have thermal entropy,

991
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:50,113
which is heat entropy
and then statistical entropy.

992
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,550
Which explains. Thermal entropy.

993
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,451
But it has.

994
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,753
A. Broader domain of application.

995
00:50:56,753 --> 00:51:00,824
So you can talk about
shuffling a deck of cards

996
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,593
and you can talk about like

997
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,996
statistical entropy increasing

998
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:10,500
if the deck is ordered and it starts
becoming mixed, accepting the shuffling.

999
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,602
But the deck of cards.

1000
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,671
The thermal entropy

1001
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:16,073
isn't changing much at all.

1002
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,842
So there's different types of entropy.

1003
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:21,344
There's also information entropy,
which has to do.

1004
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:23,280
With the

1005
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,449
the number of.

1006
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:28,885
Messages that can be sent across
the channel instead of.

1007
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:30,320
The number.

1008
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,690
Of states that a system can be in,
the number of micro states

1009
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,560
without changing the
macro state, macro state. Or.

1010
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:40,030
The kind of collective properties.

1011
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,431
Of this system.

1012
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,766
And there's a really neat

1013
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,036
relationship between statistical entropy
and information entropy,

1014
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:48,438
which I won't talk about here.

1015
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,842
It was really fleshed out by each Jane's.

1016
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:53,243
Yeah.

1017
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:56,680
But yeah, so information

1018
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,749
in entropy might go hand in hand.

1019
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:01,952
Just to. Give a little more context.

1020
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:05,822
Before we get into the details,
David Deutsch in his great TEDTalk.

1021
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:07,591
Called.

1022
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:10,293
After billions of years of anatomy,
the universe is waking up as if

1023
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:11,795
to speak of a cosmic war.

1024
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,866
It's war between monotony and novelty,
between status and creativity.

1025
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:18,835
And in this war,
our side is not destined to lose.

1026
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:20,337
If we choose to apply.

1027
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:24,508
Our unique capacity to create explanatory
knowledge, we could. Win.

1028
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,677
So that's very different
than Brian Greene story.

1029
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:30,747
And it kind of gets at
the second question that was asked there.

1030
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,215
How how.

1031
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:34,818
Far can this complexity increase go?

1032
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,588
And so this kind of foreshadows
that maybe it doesn't have a limit.

1033
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,390
And that seems you know,

1034
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,826
most people think that would go against
the second half of thermodynamics.

1035
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,228
We're going to see why
that's not necessarily true.

1036
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:49,833
But you can also see this cosmic war
as this fight between water

1037
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,968
versus disordered life versus entropy

1038
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:54,871
and knowledge
versus uncertainty or ignorance.

1039
00:52:56,339 --> 00:53:00,143
But is life's battle against disorder
good.

1040
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:02,245
Versus evil or yin and yang?

1041
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:07,350
So I'm going to kind of argue
that these two things kind of have this.

1042
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:12,222
You can describe their relationship
as causally dependent,

1043
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:15,192
and it's kind of like this dialectic
between life

1044
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:17,727
and disorder.

1045
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:21,798
And it is through this sort of.

1046
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:25,602
Interaction that creates progress.

1047
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:29,639
So we have some Eastern ideas
mentioned again.

1048
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:31,041
But when.

1049
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,810
I was writing the book, a friend. That.

1050
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:35,979
Practices
Buddhism called me and told me about this

1051
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:39,115
interdependent, polarizing idea,
which I thought was really.

1052
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:41,384
Cool so we're going to come up with this,
what we call.

1053
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:45,188
Popper's principle, which is problems
create progress.

1054
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,857
We're going to see that this problem. Of.

1055
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:51,861
Entropy, that this tendency towards
decay is what actually.

1056
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,931
Forces systems to.

1057
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:55,498
Evolve.

1058
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:58,068
Basically, it forces them to search.

1059
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,302
What's called the.

1060
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:02,305
Configuration space
for the phase, space for the state, space

1061
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:07,577
to find configurations that are good
at extracting energy and that allows it

1062
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:11,881
to stay far from equilibrium
so we're going to have some figures soon.

1063
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:15,685
So this stuff that's kind of abstract
becomes a little bit more concrete.

1064
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:18,355
Just.

1065
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:23,927
Out of respect to the earlier request,
how about you check the time and feel

1066
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:27,497
then how fast you'd like to continue
however much you want to present.

1067
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:27,831
And then

1068
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:31,067
if you want to take any questions,
but first, just check the time and let.

1069
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,770
Just how I didn't

1070
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:36,106
I didn't.

1071
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:37,307
Notice when we started.

1072
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:39,709
So about how long have I been going?

1073
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:42,612
I would say five 0 minutes.

1074
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,080
Really?

1075
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:47,284
OK, how long. Can we go.

1076
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,718
We can go another

1077
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,289
99 minutes. OK,

1078
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:56,826
I'll try to go through it
little bit faster.

1079
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:58,862
But yeah, so.

1080
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,098
But if we use all the time.

1081
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,567
I told you yesterday that I was feeling.

1082
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:07,203
Oh, I had a sore. Throat
and this shorter.

1083
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:09,272
It's better
today. I'm hopped up on cold medicine.

1084
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:12,075
I'm sure I'm
going to pay for it tomorrow.

1085
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:16,112
But yeah, if we use all the time
with questions, that would be good.

1086
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:22,052
So in our everyday experience
experience, things

1087
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:26,356
don't naturally become ordered
unless someone intervenes.

1088
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:29,759
Rooms get messier, buildings or road

1089
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,928
so we already talked about this

1090
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:36,199
Schrodinger's solution,
so we can think of life as a game.

1091
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,937
So life has always been playing a game
against the second law of thermodynamics.

1092
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,407
There is another narrative that I won't.

1093
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:47,544
Go into,
but life is also an energy flow channel.

1094
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:48,378
So life

1095
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,781
by existing
in computing and trying to say.

1096
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:53,516
Librium.

1097
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:56,086
Is also increasing entropy.

1098
00:55:56,553 --> 00:56:01,291
Actually, the universe of life
will increase entropy at a faster

1099
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:05,161
rate in a universe without life,
which is pretty interesting.

1100
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:09,199
So it's again,
not necessarily that life is like

1101
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,869
battling against entropy,
and in many ways it increases entropy.

1102
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,438
But there's also this story.

1103
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:18,408
I guess what it's trying to battle
is the tendency towards disorder.

1104
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:20,744
So it depends on what type of entropy
you're talking about.

1105
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:25,515
So the challenge in the game of life,
which applies to you

1106
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:29,819
as well as other simpler adaptive systems
is to resist that tendency.

1107
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,922
So this gives. Life
a goal. For Teleology.

1108
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:36,926
So Trilogy was associated
with kind of this mystical thing, but

1109
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,963
basically while we're seeing

1110
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:43,566
that Teleology is just agency, it's.

1111
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,502
Just a result goal.

1112
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:48,037
Oriented behavior as a result of
the information that's been.

1113
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:50,073
Accumulated over.

1114
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,742
Evolution. So Teleology.

1115
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:53,843
The book.

1116
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:57,046
Tries to naturalize ideology
and just say that

1117
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:59,983
they're these goal oriented systems
that behave different.

1118
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:02,318
Because.

1119
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:05,522
They are acquiring information
through Darwinian evolution.

1120
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:08,825
So life has to attract free energy.

1121
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:11,227
That's how it stays in the game of life.

1122
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:15,131
And to extract free energy, it's
not a simple task.

1123
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:15,832
So the.

1124
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:18,802
Computational task of extracting
free energy

1125
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:23,373
requires
that the system acquire information

1126
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,842
about its environment,
otherwise it can't find energy.

1127
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:27,544
It also.

1128
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:30,447
Requires
that the system model its environment.

1129
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:34,651
So the information is creating this
predictive model, this generative model.

1130
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:37,787
And it is

1131
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:38,955
that model.

1132
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:42,992
That allows it
to continuously find free energy.

1133
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,997
So we will explain that life strategy
as it searches

1134
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:51,634
through a configuration space
for solutions to the problem of survival

1135
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:53,403
through trial and error, search

1136
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:57,941
variation
and selection so we know about evolution.

1137
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:01,544
There's this genetic variation
in natural selection,

1138
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:06,449
and we're going to argue that that
process, that mechanism is much broader.

1139
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:09,652
The evolutionary mechanism
is actually the mechanism

1140
00:58:09,752 --> 00:58:12,555
of the scientific method
and of adaptive learning.

1141
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:17,460
And that mechanism is also a process that
accumulates evidence based knowledge.

1142
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,296
So it's also a process
a Bayesian in France.

1143
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:21,931
We're going explain. Why.

1144
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:24,601
So here we have those different
mechanisms with different names.

1145
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:29,606
So it's not included.

1146
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:29,906
Here.

1147
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:33,743
But so if life is a game,
there are levels to this game

1148
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:39,048
and the levels we're going to see
are these evolutionary transitions.

1149
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:41,551
Every time life graduates to this.

1150
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:43,286
More.

1151
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:46,823
Complex hierarchical system, like when

1152
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:51,127
single celled organisms come together
to form a multicellular organism

1153
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:55,665
and multicellular organisms come together
to form communities like societies.

1154
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,102
That you can view.

1155
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:02,805
These evolutionary transitions as as life
graduating to.

1156
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:06,910
A new level so.

1157
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:10,914
We're going to talk about
how adaptive information

1158
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:12,549
gets built up through evolution.

1159
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,984
And we're calling that knowledge.

1160
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:18,988
It's nice to have that word knowledge,
because this process

1161
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:19,989
of an adaptive system

1162
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:23,960
acquiring this information
is actually reducing its uncertainty.

1163
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,928
About the environment.

1164
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:29,732
So it's it's reducing its ignorance
about all the ways the surrounding world

1165
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:33,136
could potentially surprise it.

1166
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:35,438
So knowledge is a nice word.

1167
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:37,173
Some philosophers.

1168
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,441
Like old school philosophers.

1169
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:44,013
Might have issue with that
because in some teaching psych

1170
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:47,717
knowledge is something that conscious
beings with awareness have.

1171
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:52,655
But we're calling any adaptive
information knowledge, and it's got

1172
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:53,990
more of a technical definition

1173
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:59,162
because knowledge is that information,
which reduces uncertainty.

1174
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:02,599
And you can actually quantify
this process of evolution.

1175
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:06,402
And Terence, in has talked a lot
about how you can do that with

1176
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:08,071
information measures.

1177
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:11,040
So just.

1178
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,677
To explain this, why is knowledge
something that matters?

1179
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:16,512
Like does it have causal. Power.

1180
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:20,249
Or is it all just this this billiard
ball universe where it's like these.

1181
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:21,551
Particles bumping into.

1182
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:26,122
Each other and you can basically use
fundamental laws of physics

1183
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:29,692
to describe like the trajectory
of all of the particles in the universe.

1184
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:33,496
This is saying no, that the information
gets built up through

1185
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:37,867
evolution, has causal power
such that these systems start to behave

1186
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:41,070
in ways that are different
than what would be predicted from

1187
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,040
something like Newton's laws.

1188
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,377
So we also have this process
of anti accretion

1189
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:52,482
that Sarah Walker likes to talk about,
but anti so anti accretion is.

1190
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:55,218
Basically we're familiar with.

1191
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:56,986
Planets pulling in matter.

1192
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,756
So bodies like asteroids because

1193
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:02,759
gravity pulls matter in naturally.

1194
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:05,895
But anti accretion is
when a planet is ejecting matter.

1195
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:08,464
And in many cases.

1196
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,401
What well so the only.

1197
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,836
Time we really see anti accretion.

1198
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:18,141
Is. When you have
a planet with life on it. So

1199
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:22,011
right now

1200
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:24,313
bits of biosphere.

1201
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:27,817
So humans in space rockets are being sent
to other celestial bodies

1202
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:31,888
so that's a form of anti accretion
sending up satellites.

1203
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,924
You won't see a satellite get sent out

1204
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:38,161
if you see that in the universe.

1205
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:38,428
Like.

1206
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:43,599
You're looking at some other solar system
and you see a body sent out

1207
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,103
and put into orbit from a planet,
that's an indication that life is there.

1208
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:49,105
That's a bio signature.

1209
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:54,343
So she says that integration requires
comprehension, specifically the existence

1210
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:57,613
of physical systems
with knowledge of Newton's laws.

1211
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:03,653
So so what is it all mean?

1212
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:07,590
It means we need knowledge. To.

1213
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:09,726
Keep us out of thermodynamics.

1214
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,160
Equilibrium

1215
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,898
so how do we acquire knowledge?

1216
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,202
Science is the most.

1217
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,437
Is. The most salient example.

1218
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:22,138
Of the causal.

1219
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:24,574
Power of knowledge. So science

1220
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:30,580
has eradicated lethal diseases,
built a global communication

1221
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,883
network called the Internet
and created weapons of apocalyptic power.

1222
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:34,717
It's not always.

1223
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:36,853
Good, this power of knowledge, but.

1224
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:42,058
We see that there's something
about the scientific method

1225
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,261
which is efficient at

1226
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,197
accumulating knowledge.

1227
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:51,801
So we're going to talk about why,
and that's where we get into Karl Popper

1228
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:54,971
and evolutionary epistemology.

1229
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:58,107
So we know knowledge is important.

1230
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:00,810
Karl Popper says we're always faced
with practical problems

1231
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:04,413
and out of these gross, sometimes
theoretical problems for we try to solve

1232
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:07,049
some of our problems
by proposing theories.

1233
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:09,852
So if.

1234
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:13,990
Popper stresses
that all of science starts

1235
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:16,259
with a problem, either theoretical or.

1236
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:17,760
Practical.

1237
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:19,862
And it is that. Problem.

1238
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:24,367
That forces us to seek out a solution
so we can already see why

1239
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:27,703
this principle
that I've called Popper's principle

1240
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:33,376
says that problems create progress.

1241
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:36,279
So some of these.

1242
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:40,082
Theories that we make to try to solve
our problems will be wrong.

1243
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:41,951
There will be errors.

1244
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:45,221
But the idea with science
is that those errors get filtered out

1245
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:48,558
by a process of testing your theories

1246
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:51,928
and a peer review process
which gives criticism.

1247
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:55,231
So knowledge is really.

1248
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:59,435
For knowledge for us to know that some.

1249
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:01,871
Piece of information is knowledge.

1250
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,706
It really needs to be tested.

1251
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:08,911
And we call that evidence based knowledge
or evidence based information.

1252
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:12,782
So that's really the only true
kind of knowledge because you don't know

1253
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:14,951
if something is true until you test it.

1254
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:17,520
For example,

1255
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,924
the world doesn't look.

1256
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:23,893
Round from a naive perspective.

1257
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:24,961
It looks. Flat.

1258
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:29,966
So for example,
someone who had the first idea

1259
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,935
and I'm sure it was before anybody

1260
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:36,038
famous, we knew someone had this idea
and probably people blew it off.

1261
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:42,879
But some things that are true
about reality are not immediate,

1262
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:46,849
immediately apparent from like sensory
observation, from sense data

1263
01:04:47,183 --> 01:04:51,587
so we really need to test our theories
if we are going to be sure about them.

1264
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:55,591
So what Popper found out was
the scientific method is an algorithm.

1265
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:59,095
We call that algorithm
conjecture and refutation.

1266
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:05,034
And basically
this is the method of hypothesis testing.

1267
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:06,903
So you have a problem
you believe can be solved.

1268
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:10,806
You make an informed guess, are sure to
see if your theory can be refuted,

1269
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,609
prove false by testing its predictions.

1270
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:17,580
So people have pointed out.

1271
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,615
Like John. Campbell.

1272
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,652
First in
that science is a process of inference.

1273
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:25,888
So he recognizes statistical patterns
and trends in nature

1274
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:28,457
that we can use to make
increasingly accurate predictions.

1275
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,327
It would not be an accurate thing
to say that the function

1276
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:33,663
or purpose of scientists
to generate predictive knowledge

1277
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,132
and we can

1278
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:39,201
characterize that as process
of inference, which basically means

1279
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:42,171
that scientists draw logical conclusions
about the way the world works

1280
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:46,375
based on evidence
based information acquired in the past,

1281
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,712
but with an ever present awareness
that the information can

1282
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:51,814
and will lead to.

1283
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:55,384
To new.

1284
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:57,019
Conclusions and deeper understanding.

1285
01:05:57,019 --> 01:06:00,523
So when we recognize this,
we also have to recognize that

1286
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:04,860
all of our models will have uncertainty
so we should never think that our models.

1287
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,127
Right?

1288
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:07,964
Every model is going to be proved
wrong in some way.

1289
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,999
But through the scientific process,

1290
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,202
the idea is that we get closer

1291
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:16,272
and closer to truth,
so we can never reach perfect truth.

1292
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,342
But in this model you.

1293
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:20,643
Can actually get closer to it.

1294
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:24,347
So in some senses, it's different
than like post-modernist philosophy

1295
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:27,750
that says there is no objective truth,
there is an objective truth

1296
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:32,221
but we can never
know it, but we can get closer to it.

1297
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:35,458
So once Popper.

1298
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:38,461
Understood that knowledge, the knowledge
generating mechanism behind science

1299
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:42,331
success was conjecture and reputation,
he realized that human learning, which

1300
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:46,268
begins at birth, continues to that uses
the same problem solving algorithm.

1301
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:47,670
Although the developmental.

1302
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,506
Psychology literature
called the method, trial and error.

1303
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,276
So because life is constantly
presenting us with new challenges

1304
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:57,580
such as the need to get from one place
to another problem that inspires babies

1305
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:00,983
to learn to walk, we must constantly
try out new behavioral solutions.

1306
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:05,321
We can think of these actions as guesses
about how to survive or if you prefer

1307
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:08,958
experiments in evading equilibrium
or predictions for persist

1308
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,294
and they will often fail.

1309
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:18,634
So. This is damned in its idea of life
exploring this design space.

1310
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,736
We're going to talk about how it does
so through evolution.

1311
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,772
We're still talking about science here.

1312
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:23,672
And adaptive learning.

1313
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:24,540
On abstract level,

1314
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,441
we can imagine a certain

1315
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:26,275
practical problem

1316
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:28,944
as a challenge, one with a solution
that exists somewhere out there

1317
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:32,048
in the space of possibilities,
just waiting to be found by someone

1318
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,383
sufficiently motivated and clever.

1319
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,752
It may take some time,
but if the possibilities space,

1320
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:38,954
the space of possible
solutions is continuously.

1321
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:42,958
Explored in an efficient way,
eventually a solution will be discovered.

1322
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:45,027
So excuse me.

1323
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:48,164
Trial and error learning explores
the solution. Space

1324
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:53,069
so just to give you a clear.

1325
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:55,304
Example of how adaptive learning

1326
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:58,874
is kind of this form
of hypothesis testing.

1327
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:00,543
So whenever we have a problem.

1328
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:03,579
In life and we don't know the correct
solution to a problem in advance,

1329
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:07,016
we naturally begin
with those potential solutions

1330
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:10,653
that are closer to our starting point
in the solution space we're sampling.

1331
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:13,389
So for example.
If a baby reaches for its bottle.

1332
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:14,090
And barely.

1333
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,258
Misses, it'll just its behavior slightly,

1334
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:18,461
which minimizes
the chances of making an error.

1335
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:22,898
So. Our instincts may nudges

1336
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:26,435
in the general direction of a solution,
but the instinct alone is not.

1337
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:27,336
Enough.

1338
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:30,005
We have to try out.

1339
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:31,073
What you could call.

1340
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:36,779
A behavioral conjecture,
and when it fails, we try something new.

1341
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:40,449
So that's kind of like a new theory,
and it's essentially the.

1342
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,585
Old one, but with a little. Twist.

1343
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:46,555
And if that behavioral solution
is remembered, then it's it's.

1344
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,290
Stored for future.

1345
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:52,294
Use, ready to be repeated,
but also adapted if necessary,

1346
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:54,630
but in humans.

1347
01:08:54,630 --> 01:09:00,236
So the baby example reaching for the
bottle, let's say it misses the bottle.

1348
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:03,873
It won't get a reward signal,
it won't get a little surge of dopamine.

1349
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:07,877
So if it corrects and it gets closer,
it gets a little reward signal.

1350
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:09,912
This is reinforcement learning.

1351
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:14,450
But basically this adaptive learning
process is a process of making theories

1352
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:18,354
and eliminating those theories
that our ears.

1353
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:24,193
So Popper saw.

1354
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:26,529
That scientific knowledge.

1355
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:26,862
And the.

1356
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:30,032
Evolutionary process were also connected.

1357
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:34,303
So not only is science adaptive learning,

1358
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:39,008
both of those things are extensions
of the evolutionary process.

1359
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:42,545
So he says in science,
theories are highly competitive

1360
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:43,679
we discuss them critically,

1361
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,382
we test them, and we eliminate the series
which we judged to be less

1362
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:48,417
good in solving the problems
which we wish to solve.

1363
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:49,351
So only the.

1364
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:51,720
Best theories, those which are most fit,
survive in the struggle.

1365
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,923
This is the way science grows.

1366
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:56,692
So that's kind of nice, like showing you

1367
01:09:57,159 --> 01:10:00,329
really how
this is an evolutionary process,

1368
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:02,064
not only is

1369
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:05,167
science, not illusionary process,
the converse is true.

1370
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:07,102
Evolution is a scientific process.

1371
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:10,206
So it is clear.

1372
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:11,407
This is another quote.

1373
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,776
It is clear
that this view of the progress of science

1374
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:16,178
is very similar to Darwin's
view of natural selection,

1375
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:18,447
by the way, of the elimination
of the. Bit.

1376
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:21,650
Of the errors in the evolution of life,
the errors,

1377
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:24,720
the attempts to adaptation,
which is a trial and error process.

1378
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:28,257
Analogously,
science works by trial theory making

1379
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,826
and by the elimination of errors.

1380
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:36,298
I. Might pause in a second just to see

1381
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:39,902
if everybody understands this,
but I have a few more slides.

1382
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,871
So evolutionary algorithms.

1383
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:43,939
Also.

1384
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:46,575
Use this mechanism,
but it's called generate and test.

1385
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,645
So I didn't mention this.

1386
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:52,715
The mechanism of evolution
is variation in selection.

1387
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:56,218
So we have these algorithms

1388
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:59,321
that are equivalent
conjecture and refutation trial and error

1389
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:02,725
variation in selection
we also have generate and test.

1390
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,860
So in machine learning, evolutionary.

1391
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:05,728
Algorithms.

1392
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:09,698
Have this method. Of.

1393
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:11,533
Generating. Tests.

1394
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:15,070
Possible solutions are generated
into an actual solution is found

1395
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:17,640
and these solutions accumulate
in some memory store

1396
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,376
while the errors are filtered out
and forgotten

1397
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:20,943
in science.

1398
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:24,046
The solutions are theories or models that
actually predicts the natural phenomena

1399
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:24,947
and the.

1400
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,615
Successful ones.

1401
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,917
Accumulate in peer
reviewed journals and. Textbooks.

1402
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:34,657
So we see that
these processes are equivalent.

1403
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:39,161
We're actually going to see that it's
this Bayesian process that adaptation.

1404
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:41,497
Is. Also a process.

1405
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:43,632
Of the model.

1406
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:48,871
Of the organism becoming optimized,
decreasing it's prediction error

1407
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:51,740
so that can more efficiently extract
free energy

1408
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:55,110
from an edge to stay ordered.

1409
01:11:55,110 --> 01:12:01,717
So we get this principle
that all evolutionary processes

1410
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:06,188
are learning processes, and all learning
processes are evolutionary processes.

1411
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:10,225
Conrad Lorenz, Nobel Prize
winning zoologist.

1412
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:12,428
Was also a.

1413
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:16,465
Pioneer of evolutionary epistemology,
and he made this statement Life is

1414
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:17,733
a cognitive process.

1415
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:23,505
So if this is true and there's
this functional equivalence

1416
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:26,308
between the mechanisms
driving evolution, learning and science.

1417
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:27,242
And that.

1418
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:30,512
Implies that adaptation.

1419
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:31,180
Or the.

1420
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,049
Genetic information that

1421
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:36,518
corresponds
to those physical adaptations.

1422
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,221
Are equivalent.

1423
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:42,958
Is equivalent to scientific knowledge,
they're actually the same thing.

1424
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:46,128
So to kind of make this relationship
clear,

1425
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:50,299
biological adaptation
represents knowledge of the environment

1426
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:50,833
and the knowledge

1427
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:54,002
we acquire through learning and science
reflects adaptation to the environment.

1428
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:57,873
So we see that there's no meaningful
distinction between adaptive information

1429
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:58,874
and scientific knowledge.

1430
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:02,010
Both allow life to predict
an uncertain world control matter, train

1431
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:04,413
chaos and construct order from disorder.

1432
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:08,250
So the very same property
that is responsible for organic matter

1433
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:09,952
leaving the planet in spaceships.

1434
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:13,021
So this entire creation is the same

1435
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:15,391
property that allows

1436
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:19,828
organisms to climb uphill, seemingly
defying the force of gravity.

1437
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:21,230
Of course.

1438
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,031
The laws of physics aren't
violated in any.

1439
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:24,533
Way, but.

1440
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:28,203
Living systems are not constrained

1441
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:31,073
by the laws of physics,
the way inanimate systems are

1442
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:36,145
so some examples of dolphin
streamlined design,

1443
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:39,181
which is a product of the information
storage genome, contains the.

1444
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:41,550
Knowledge of hydrodynamics.

1445
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:45,120
An eagle swing design contains
the knowledge of aerodynamics.

1446
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,321
Not only can we be certain

1447
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:48,724
that engineers see knowledge
in these functional structures,

1448
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:53,996
there should be little doubt
that they inspired

1449
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:54,797
our machines.

1450
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:58,000
And without that information,
I don't think we would have come

1451
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,137
to those inventions,
at least not any time soon.

1452
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,407
Camouflage

1453
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:08,677
on an organism represents
knowledge of the environment.

1454
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:13,482
So kind of bridging this.

1455
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:17,286
Idea of evolutionary cosmology,
that evolution builds up knowledge,

1456
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:20,756
and that science is an extension
of the evolutionary process.

1457
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:23,492
Making a bridge.

1458
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:26,962
Between that and Bayesian inference

1459
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:29,097
requires this

1460
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:32,000
relationship between adaptation
and statistical correlation.

1461
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:37,906
So physicist Carlo Rivoli, which who has
gotten really interested in explaining.

1462
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:43,745
How. This information that underlies
agency, that behavior that we see

1463
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:46,448
with living
systems, gets built up through evolution

1464
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,952
he wrote a great essay,

1465
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:52,488
won the Foundational Questions Institute

1466
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,423
essay contest.

1467
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:57,626
A few years ago, but.

1468
01:14:57,626 --> 01:15:01,296
This work was based on the work of David
Wolpert and Artem

1469
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:06,468
Kinski, Artemis Kuczynski,
and basically shows

1470
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:10,572
how this adaptation
builds up information in the system.

1471
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:12,107
That information

1472
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:16,111
is really statistical correlation
between the organism and its environment.

1473
01:15:16,111 --> 01:15:18,614
So here's the simplest example.

1474
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:21,450
It's a bacterium performing chemo taxes.

1475
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:23,385
So a bacteria.

1476
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:26,822
So chemo tax is basically

1477
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:28,757
a bacterium will swim

1478
01:15:28,757 --> 01:15:32,394
in the direction of food
and swim away from toxins.

1479
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:36,365
So basically it's detecting this chemical
gradient that follows.

1480
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:40,602
But so we can see in this example

1481
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:44,940
and this isn't the case for all species,
but you can imagine that

1482
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,376
a bacterium that swings to the left
when nutrients are on.

1483
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:48,410
The left.

1484
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:51,380
Prospers compared to a bacterium

1485
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:54,182
that swims at random.

1486
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:58,420
So with this

1487
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:01,189
behavior
where it's swimming towards food,

1488
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:03,025
that is the.

1489
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:04,927
Product of a chance mutation.

1490
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:07,262
So in some sense it's an accident.

1491
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:10,399
But when it discovers that solution.

1492
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,936
That organism
is more likely to reproduce.

1493
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:17,306
So that solution gets retained

1494
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:20,542
in the population,
it gets sort of frozen, hardwired in.

1495
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:25,781
And so the process of adaptation
is a process.

1496
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:27,349
That builds up a.

1497
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:29,418
Statistical correlation between.

1498
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:31,820
The system, the agent.

1499
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,855
And its environment.

1500
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:39,194
And so that shared this correlation
represents mutual information.

1501
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:42,331
So mutual information is information
that's shared

1502
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:45,834
between the environment
and the organism. And

1503
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:48,270
just to

1504
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:51,540
explain that a little bit more,
this correlation.

1505
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:57,112
Basically as this correlation gets built
up, it's creating predictive knowledge.

1506
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,515
So. John Maynard Smith

1507
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:04,319
cites Fred Dread Ski,
who did kind of the pioneering

1508
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:08,790
work applying Shannon's information
theory to try to quantify evolution.

1509
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:12,527
So Jet Ski argues
that if some variable is correlated

1510
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:13,695
with the second variable, B,

1511
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:16,932
then we can say that B carries
information about A, for example,

1512
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:19,801
if the occurrence of rain is correlated
with a particular cloud,

1513
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:22,070
then the type of cloud tells us
whether it would rain.

1514
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,741
So that's from a great essay
called Concepts of Information Biology.

1515
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:31,513
So we can see that you have this little.

1516
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:33,348
Rhyming equation here.

1517
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:38,520
Adaptation equals statistical correlation
equals mutual information.

1518
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:40,088
And because.

1519
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:42,557
That shared. Information.

1520
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:43,792
Allows the.

1521
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:46,061
Organism
to predict its environment better,

1522
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:50,332
this process is also a process
of model optimization.

1523
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,968
So the predictive model of the organism

1524
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:55,170
as it adapts,

1525
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,239
starts to become more accurate.

1526
01:17:58,073 --> 01:18:00,275
And so this whole process can be seen

1527
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:03,845
as a free energy minimization process.

1528
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,983
Of. Course,
that's information theoretic free energy.

1529
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:10,385
It's the free energy of, for instance,
principle.

1530
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,754
We're not talking about thermodynamic
free energy.

1531
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:16,224
We once asked a questioner
gets confused about that,

1532
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:18,226
let me know.

1533
01:18:18,226 --> 01:18:20,395
But it's basically those.

1534
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,631
Things are related and it's something
that's not mentioned in.

1535
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:25,801
Minimizing.

1536
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:30,038
Information theoretic free energy,
which is just minimizing

1537
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:34,142
the prediction error of your model
is what allows the organism

1538
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:37,312
to minimize environmental free energy.

1539
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:40,882
So by acquiring information, producing

1540
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:44,786
information theoretic energy, allows

1541
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:47,556
the organism to extract energy

1542
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:52,627
and reduce thermodynamic free energy,
it minimizes the free energy

1543
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:56,298
and the environment
converts it into entropy.

1544
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:02,938
So we kind of see how this is fitting
into universal Bayesian ism.

1545
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:04,139
As it becomes more correlated,

1546
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:05,941
it gains information about its nature
and therefore.

1547
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:08,744
Becomes
a better. Predictor of that niche.

1548
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:12,414
So that's what adaptation is.

1549
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:15,617
It's the genome of the species
accumulating information that reduces

1550
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:18,653
the average organisms, uncertainty
regarding the environment.

1551
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:23,592
So the.

1552
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:26,962
Genome is a knowledge
repository of solutions to environmental.

1553
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,830
Challenges that allows.

1554
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:33,168
An organism with no brain and no mind
to anticipate events in the environment.

1555
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:36,538
So in this theory, as I mentioned before,
consciousness comes later,

1556
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:39,841
it comes with self
modeling capacity. And.

1557
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:44,279
A bacterium
would be kind of a zombie agent.

1558
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:47,215
It would have agency
and it would move with purpose.

1559
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:49,518
But that is not enough.

1560
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,820
For the. Mind or at least mind

1561
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:55,223
defined as consciousness.

1562
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:58,260
If you want to say
that mind is just information processing,

1563
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:02,297
then yes, there is mind in these systems
but that's very different than saying

1564
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:04,933
that the system
has a subjective experience

1565
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,804
in a first person perspective
that will come in the next talk.

1566
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:11,406
But it's it's harder

1567
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:17,145
so. That information stored
memory is integrated into a discourse

1568
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:21,116
or predictive model that determines
the causal control systems, behavioral.

1569
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:22,150
Repertoire.

1570
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,920
Or the full range of behaviors
an organism is capable of.

1571
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:29,391
And it is this mapping of sensory inputs,
motor outputs that makes the organism

1572
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:32,994
move in ways that we normally associate
with mind or consciousness.

1573
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:37,132
First in integration article says

1574
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:40,769
all biological processes can be construed
as performing some form of inference.

1575
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:42,904
I think I already read that.

1576
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:43,705
But the free.

1577
01:20:43,705 --> 01:20:46,341
Energy principle for those familiar,

1578
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:48,977
we've already explained it.

1579
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:49,744
But the.

1580
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:54,149
Bayesian brain hypothesis and the free
energy principle are the same thing.

1581
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:58,286
The difference is that the free energy
principle applies to.

1582
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:02,724
All. Other adaptive systems, where
the other one is just focusing on brains.

1583
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:05,093
But first realize that this

1584
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:08,230
is a model and a process that

1585
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:09,731
applies to

1586
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:12,934
any system that's trying to resist
the tendency towards disorder.

1587
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:15,103
So any system.

1588
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:20,375
To stay to continue persisting longer
than we would expect, naturally

1589
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:24,813
it must engage in Bayesian like learning
to deal with environmental uncertainty.

1590
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:27,215
How much time do I have left?

1591
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:28,183
Roughly

1592
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:34,656
still more than enough.

1593
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:35,557
To go on.

1594
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:38,760
I'm definitely more than halfway through.

1595
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,929
I'd say I'm two thirds of the way here.

1596
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:44,199
So John Campbell has this great

1597
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:48,236
paper called Universal Darwinism
as a process of Bayesian inference

1598
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:51,840
that I kept coming across
as I was trying to understand

1599
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:55,577
non equilibrium, thermodynamics
and information theory.

1600
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,281
Yeah, I should say actually

1601
01:21:59,781 --> 01:22:02,350
I should have gotten the books showed.

1602
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:06,421
You each book, but there's a great book
called The Origin and Nature of Life

1603
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:06,855
on Earth.

1604
01:22:06,855 --> 01:22:09,691
By Stanford Institute's
Eric Smith. And here Moritz.

1605
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:12,360
Moritz was a professor of mine.

1606
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:17,432
Eric is a friend that we would have
these foundations of the mind

1607
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:18,967
guilt.

1608
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:22,737
It was like a consciousness club
that would meet at the Krasno Institute

1609
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:25,273
where I got my Ph.D. And.

1610
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:26,975
So their book.

1611
01:22:26,975 --> 01:22:28,810
The Origin of Life on the Origin of.

1612
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:31,046
Life in Chapter eight.

1613
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:34,082
Actually
gets into this information theory.

1614
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:35,417
And this

1615
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:39,621
this Bayesian inference and describes
the origin of life and the evolution.

1616
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:42,324
Of life as.

1617
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:44,492
A process of Bayesian model selection.

1618
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,996
And so that was kind of what connected
non equilibrium

1619
01:22:47,996 --> 01:22:51,533
statistical mechanics to these,
to this Bayesian brain hypothesis.

1620
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:54,803
And I realized that,
you know, these theories were kind of

1621
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:57,639
converging on the same ideas.

1622
01:22:57,872 --> 01:23:00,909
So John Campbell.
Wrote this paper in 2016.

1623
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:02,711
He says Bayesian
inference is an algorithm

1624
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:04,913
for the accumulation of evidence
based knowledge.

1625
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:08,883
This algorithm is now seem to operate
over a wide range of evolutionary

1626
01:23:08,883 --> 01:23:12,287
processes, including natural selection,
the evolution of mental models

1627
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:15,924
and cultural evolutionary processes,
notably including science itself.

1628
01:23:17,726 --> 01:23:20,128
So when

1629
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:24,599
we say that evolution is a process
of Bayesian model selection, in the book

1630
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:25,600
I mentioned with Eric

1631
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,304
and it's actually characterized evolution
as an inference engine,

1632
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:34,109
we're basically saying
that when organisms that aren't

1633
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:37,312
fit get weeded out,

1634
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:39,247
that's basically models

1635
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:42,050
that aren't predictive
getting eliminated.

1636
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:44,753
So the organisms that persist

1637
01:23:45,286 --> 01:23:48,990
are the models that were able
to predict the environment best.

1638
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:52,560
So inference and prediction
are kind of the same thing

1639
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,764
since the word inferences
they're not scary.

1640
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:59,401
I guess. So

1641
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:02,637
just to make this point
a little more clear,

1642
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:05,640
since nature is complex
and intrinsically unpredictable,

1643
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:10,378
the model of an organism is at some point
guaranteed to fail

1644
01:24:10,612 --> 01:24:13,848
when reality surprises it
with the unexpected.

1645
01:24:14,282 --> 01:24:20,422
So and that's what the free energy
principle is about, minimizing surprises.

1646
01:24:20,422 --> 01:24:22,891
The same thing is minimizing
prediction error.

1647
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:26,961
So an organism gets eaten by a predator,
a baby fails

1648
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:30,799
to reach his bottle, a scientific theory
fails to explain new data

1649
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:35,904
basically,
when any of these things happens,

1650
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,673
it means that the model used to predict
reality is not completely accurate.

1651
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:40,909
It contains a certain amount
of prediction error

1652
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:43,111
and needs to be corrected.
So what's the solution?

1653
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:44,012
Try something new.

1654
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:44,913
The old model worked

1655
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,115
well enough up to that point,
so don't ditch it

1656
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:49,217
just varied a bit and see if it performs
better.

1657
01:24:49,517 --> 01:24:52,787
If it does not reduce surprise,
eliminate that variant and try again.

1658
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:55,790
If. Prediction errors reduce or replace
the old model with the new one.

1659
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:58,793
So that becomes the reigning theory
and the design template for new variants.

1660
01:24:58,793 --> 01:25:00,295
We based upon

1661
01:25:00,562 --> 01:25:03,498
when a model has been updated
in this way due to natural selection,

1662
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:05,733
adaptive learning
or experimental testing,

1663
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:06,601
we can say that knowledge

1664
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:09,671
has been acquired
and environmental uncertainty reduced.

1665
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:13,808
So. Here we have an image.

1666
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:17,278
I should say that Infinity Maps German

1667
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:22,250
software mapping company helped me
create these images Oliver Wagner.

1668
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:25,453
I have to give a big thanks to him.

1669
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:26,788
This image has.

1670
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,857
A little bit more going on
than I would want.

1671
01:25:28,857 --> 01:25:31,259
Right now, but you could see that

1672
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:34,863
basically

1673
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:37,699
this represents two

1674
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:39,868
different mechanisms. For.

1675
01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:42,203
Learning and adaptation.

1676
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:44,372
So this one on the top
that we're going to talk about first.

1677
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:46,708
Is the normal.

1678
01:25:46,741 --> 01:25:49,744
Competitive evolution,
sort of Darwinian survival of the.

1679
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:50,712
Fittest

1680
01:25:51,546 --> 01:25:52,080
while this.

1681
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:55,583
Mechanism over here
is the mechanism of self-organization.

1682
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:58,653
So let's first

1683
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:01,189
talk about the normal type of evolution

1684
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:03,625
where you're with and show that.

1685
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:06,461
How. This process of evolution

1686
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:10,165
that works, the variation in selection
actually

1687
01:26:11,566 --> 01:26:14,536
generates predictive information and

1688
01:26:15,703 --> 01:26:16,137
creates.

1689
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:18,573
A model which is

1690
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:21,042
which.

1691
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:23,378
Encodes knowledge. Of the.

1692
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:27,182
Biologically relevant
regularities in the environment.

1693
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:30,084
So first we have this.

1694
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:31,386
This is a.

1695
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:33,021
Bacterium over here.

1696
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:35,256
And so.

1697
01:26:35,256 --> 01:26:37,525
This is the simplest. Model.

1698
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:40,895
You have an organism
that's an embodied theory or a best guess

1699
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:43,031
about how to stay far from equilibrium.

1700
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:46,067
So evolutionary physiology sees

1701
01:26:46,067 --> 01:26:49,170
organisms themselves as embodied theory.

1702
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:53,775
So evolution is basically testing
these different models.

1703
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:58,680
So it basically reproduces

1704
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:02,450
and we know that
because there are going to be

1705
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:06,321
errors in

1706
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:08,523
in that process,

1707
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:11,526
the genome will get changed

1708
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:13,595
slightly and you will get.

1709
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:16,831
A. Generation of progeny that.

1710
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:18,266
All are.

1711
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:21,502
Slightly different they have slightly
different configurations.

1712
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:24,739
Some of these configurations
will be better

1713
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:27,408
at extracting energy and predicting
the environment than others.

1714
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:28,943
And the ones that

1715
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:31,546
are good at predicting the

1716
01:27:31,546 --> 01:27:34,082
environment, they get filtered out
by natural selection.

1717
01:27:34,782 --> 01:27:35,783
So here we see design.

1718
01:27:35,783 --> 01:27:37,485
For is the winning.

1719
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:40,588
Design because it's the best predictor
and it's the best predictor

1720
01:27:40,888 --> 01:27:43,558
because it's
the best attractor of energy.

1721
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:47,462
And so that design

1722
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,733
that that organism gets to reproduce.

1723
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:53,868
And then you have another generation

1724
01:27:55,236 --> 01:27:57,272
of designs that are slightly different

1725
01:27:57,672 --> 01:28:01,576
and this process is an iterative process,
just like science.

1726
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,511
And. Hypothesis testing.

1727
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:10,118
So over generations
you will start to get designs that. Are.

1728
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:12,954
Better adapted to the environment,

1729
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:16,024
which we've explain means that

1730
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:19,661
they will be more correlated
with the environment.

1731
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:22,864
And being more correlated means

1732
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:26,267
being a better predictor

1733
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:27,835
so the knowledge

1734
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:32,040
that's left over after this process
is the adaptive information

1735
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:35,910
stored in genetic material
that produces environmental certainty.

1736
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:38,179
And you see it this process. Will.

1737
01:28:38,446 --> 01:28:42,850
Ultimately lead to the evolution
towards the best possible design.

1738
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:44,786
So it's it's an optimization.

1739
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:48,389
A lot of people don't think
that evolution is optimizing anything.

1740
01:28:48,389 --> 01:28:49,023
There's been this

1741
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:52,393
kind of philosophy that evolution does.

1742
01:28:52,727 --> 01:28:54,262
Just good enough.

1743
01:28:54,262 --> 01:28:57,632
But we actually see that
in terms of the computation

1744
01:28:57,632 --> 01:28:59,634
that it does
to stay far from equilibrium,

1745
01:29:00,301 --> 01:29:03,571
that it's actually optimized
for being almost

1746
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:07,108
maximally efficient
with its use of energy.

1747
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:10,144
The approach is something close
to what's called the Landauer limit,

1748
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:12,613
which David Wolpert
it SFI is written about.

1749
01:29:13,214 --> 01:29:16,918
But life is much more efficient

1750
01:29:17,785 --> 01:29:19,987
with computation in terms of energy

1751
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:23,825
supply needed
compared to all of our technology.

1752
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:27,195
So the human brain can do

1753
01:29:27,228 --> 01:29:30,631
solve problems
that even our best systems can't solve.

1754
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:32,734
And it does so running. On.

1755
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:35,570
The equivalent of one.

1756
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:37,438
Household light bulb.

1757
01:29:37,505 --> 01:29:40,508
So we'll come back
to this self-organization process.

1758
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:42,243
Oh, well, actually.

1759
01:29:42,243 --> 01:29:43,378
We'll get into that right now.

1760
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:46,047
So this is the normal.

1761
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:50,151
Process that we think about
when we think about evolution generating

1762
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:51,919
knowledge, predictive knowledge.

1763
01:29:53,087 --> 01:29:55,390
And so that's called phylogenetic
learning.

1764
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:58,826
Phylogenetic refers
to these like generations.

1765
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:01,129
So the learning is generational.

1766
01:30:01,129 --> 01:30:03,398
The organisms don't really learn.

1767
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,266
Because they. Don't have brains.
They're not able to.

1768
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:07,802
Update their. Model in real time.

1769
01:30:07,802 --> 01:30:08,703
So learning is at.

1770
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:11,005
The level of the population.

1771
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:15,042
And for learning to occur,
organisms have to die before brains.

1772
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:18,212
Basically, you have to have this

1773
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:20,148
competition

1774
01:30:20,615 --> 01:30:23,951
for there to be a learning process
however.

1775
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:25,420
There's also.

1776
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,256
Self-Organization when these organisms.

1777
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:29,757
Don't compete, but.

1778
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:31,592
Actually find a configuration,

1779
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:34,395
find it, discover
collective configuration through their.

1780
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:36,564
Somewhat random.

1781
01:30:36,564 --> 01:30:38,533
Interactions with each other.

1782
01:30:38,533 --> 01:30:41,436
And when they find this collective
configuration

1783
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,538
through trial and error,

1784
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:46,908
basically the configurations

1785
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:49,811
that are better at attracting energy
will be the ones.

1786
01:30:50,378 --> 01:30:51,312
That are.

1787
01:30:51,312 --> 01:30:52,747
Retained.

1788
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:57,752
So Donald Campbell.

1789
01:30:58,119 --> 01:30:59,854
Father Evolutionary Epistemology.

1790
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:01,789
Explained.

1791
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:06,227
This process, this evolutionary process
by which self-organization

1792
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:09,797
works as blind variation
and selective retention,

1793
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:13,501
or we can think of it as selection
for persistence or stability.

1794
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:16,637
So fitness kind of

1795
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:17,572
here's the Dawkins quote.

1796
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:20,408
I think I come out where Richard Dawkins
said, Darwin's.

1797
01:31:21,876 --> 01:31:23,311
Survival. Of the fittest is.

1798
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:24,479
Really

1799
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:26,280
just.

1800
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:31,252
More specific instance of a more general
law of survival of the stable.

1801
01:31:31,953 --> 01:31:34,522
So when we think about being fit

1802
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:37,725
at the beginning we're talking about

1803
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:40,862
just being stable,
being able to find energy.

1804
01:31:41,195 --> 01:31:42,263
If you can't do that,

1805
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:46,000
it doesn't matter whether you have agents
that you're competing with or not.

1806
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:49,770
Because if you can't get energy,
it doesn't matter if there are other

1807
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:52,673
people competing for it,
then you won't survive. So

1808
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:54,375
you don't need.

1809
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:58,513
Replication with variation to evolve.

1810
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:00,581
That's
what this is, this model is saying.

1811
01:32:01,616 --> 01:32:04,051
And Stuart Kaufman from the Santa
Fe Institute. Has.

1812
01:32:04,785 --> 01:32:07,188
Been talking about the importance
of this marriage between

1813
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:10,191
Darwinian evolution
and self-organization.

1814
01:32:10,758 --> 01:32:12,627
But basically.

1815
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:13,594
Because.

1816
01:32:13,594 --> 01:32:15,963
There's not this replication process,

1817
01:32:17,098 --> 01:32:19,033
this is how evolution occurs.

1818
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:21,903
So you have a system that's.

1819
01:32:22,336 --> 01:32:25,072
A collection. Of components, parts.

1820
01:32:25,072 --> 01:32:28,809
These parts can be molecules
or they can be agents.

1821
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:34,482
And when these molecules are pushed
far from equilibrium by flow of energy

1822
01:32:34,815 --> 01:32:37,919
of course, humans are eating food
and metabolizing energy,

1823
01:32:37,919 --> 01:32:40,087
so they're being powered
by energy flows as well.

1824
01:32:41,355 --> 01:32:43,190
The system blindly explores.

1825
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:47,395
Various configurations in the space
with possible designs via trial and.

1826
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:48,062
Error.

1827
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:52,133
So this system will move through
a series of configurations.

1828
01:32:52,466 --> 01:32:52,900
And those.

1829
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:57,071
Configurations that allow the system
to extract sufficient energy

1830
01:32:57,471 --> 01:33:00,107
to stay out of equilibrium
will get retained.

1831
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:04,845
While the configurations that don't allow
for energy extraction.

1832
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:05,980
Will.

1833
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:11,052
Get filtered out, the system will collapse and have to try a new configuration.

1834
01:33:12,553 --> 01:33:13,788
Or it will just.

1835
01:33:13,788 --> 01:33:15,923
Revert to the previous stable

1836
01:33:17,525 --> 01:33:19,660
configuration and it will continue

1837
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:24,265
trying to explore
that configuration space.

1838
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:27,568
I. Should have said, here's
a good example.

1839
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:30,638
Here's
a depiction of this configuration space.

1840
01:33:30,638 --> 01:33:33,874
We're talking about life
exploring the design space. So

1841
01:33:35,042 --> 01:33:38,613
basically you have a designer
configuration and.

1842
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:39,246
Then.

1843
01:33:40,581 --> 01:33:43,951
You get these different
this exploration. Of.

1844
01:33:44,552 --> 01:33:47,855
Different configurations
that are very close

1845
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:51,325
to the configuration
you started out with.

1846
01:33:51,325 --> 01:33:55,896
So I was thinking about giving a talk

1847
01:33:55,896 --> 01:33:59,200
on the origin of life, but I couldn't
get into all this cool Bayesian stuff.

1848
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,502
That's
what the first part of the book is about.

1849
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:04,472
What's really interesting is that
we're finding that self-organization,

1850
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:06,841
as mentioned, is a Darwinian process.

1851
01:34:06,841 --> 01:34:10,111
So there's actually a name for this
disruptive adaptation, and it shows that.

1852
01:34:10,778 --> 01:34:11,212
This.

1853
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:15,516
Relation towards these more stable
configurations dissipate more energy.

1854
01:34:16,117 --> 01:34:17,351
When this happens at the level of

1855
01:34:17,351 --> 01:34:20,621
organisms that we're talking about,
it shouldn't be surprising that

1856
01:34:21,222 --> 01:34:24,659
it dissipates more energy
because basically.

1857
01:34:25,192 --> 01:34:27,695
As. The organism evolves to be better

1858
01:34:27,695 --> 01:34:31,532
at extracting energy, all that energy
it's extracting to maintain

1859
01:34:31,532 --> 01:34:34,669
far from equilibrium
is being converted into thermal entropy.

1860
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:40,541
So all self-organizing processes
are really dissipated.

1861
01:34:40,574 --> 01:34:43,377
Adaptation
processes. At different. Levels.

1862
01:34:43,377 --> 01:34:47,982
So this process, philosophers would say,
is multiply realizable.

1863
01:34:47,982 --> 01:34:50,618
So this process can happen
at different scales.

1864
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:52,520
And that's exactly what we see.

1865
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:55,623
Like right here, the same process.

1866
01:34:55,990 --> 01:35:00,361
So you would have a society like
exploring different governance systems

1867
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:03,597
and it doesn't know
which governance system is going to work

1868
01:35:04,098 --> 01:35:06,667
the best beforehand. It tries it.

1869
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:09,036
If it doesn't work well.

1870
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:10,137
Like the fall of Rome.

1871
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:12,473
It will collapse

1872
01:35:12,473 --> 01:35:15,710
and then it will reassemble.

1873
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:23,050
So just to wrap up the.

1874
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:23,851
Origin of life.

1875
01:35:23,851 --> 01:35:25,586
So we have this process of disruptive

1876
01:35:25,586 --> 01:35:29,290
adaptation, and if it's being pushed
by the full of energy

1877
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:33,060
and it's doing this process here
where it's finding increasingly

1878
01:35:34,095 --> 01:35:37,565
stable configurations,
collective configurations.

1879
01:35:38,032 --> 01:35:42,436
Then basically what.

1880
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:45,706
Will emerge is an auto catalytic
said, we'll define that later.

1881
01:35:45,706 --> 01:35:47,975
But basically.

1882
01:35:47,975 --> 01:35:48,209
It's.

1883
01:35:48,209 --> 01:35:50,778
An I'm
losing a lot of cancer for philosophy.

1884
01:35:50,778 --> 01:35:51,812
I was going to say.

1885
01:35:52,046 --> 01:35:54,115
It's the.
Beginning of an auto poetic agent.

1886
01:35:54,115 --> 01:35:56,751
So like a self maintaining agent

1887
01:35:56,751 --> 01:36:00,020
in its simplest form is a chemical system
that produces.

1888
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:01,155
Outputs.

1889
01:36:01,155 --> 01:36:03,824
Which are then fed back into the system

1890
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:07,628
so that the system can self amplify.

1891
01:36:07,628 --> 01:36:12,900
It's basically creating all of
the molecules that it needs to grow.

1892
01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:16,504
And it's thought that this process

1893
01:36:17,571 --> 01:36:18,339
occurred.

1894
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:20,007
That the auto.

1895
01:36:20,007 --> 01:36:23,677
Catalytic asset is kind of the precursor
for the first cell.

1896
01:36:24,011 --> 01:36:26,347
So it's kind of like a protocell.

1897
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:30,951
And it was thought to occur around
hydrothermal vents.

1898
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:33,287
Which are under water, volcanoes.

1899
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:35,289
There's all this energy.

1900
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:39,393
Flowing up from the, the,
the hot core running through.

1901
01:36:39,393 --> 01:36:41,762
Geochemical energy,

1902
01:36:41,762 --> 01:36:44,932
and there's these rocky pores
in the rocks around

1903
01:36:44,932 --> 01:36:48,335
hydrothermal vents,
which provides something like.

1904
01:36:48,869 --> 01:36:52,006
A membrane, like a lipid membrane
to hold.

1905
01:36:52,006 --> 01:36:54,875
The components in a mark off
blankets for the pores in the.

1906
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:56,043
Rocks or.

1907
01:36:56,043 --> 01:36:59,313
The mark off
blanket for the auto catalytic set.

1908
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:03,284
And Eric
Smith and Horowitz showed that basically

1909
01:37:04,351 --> 01:37:06,687
feeding off inorganic inputs.

1910
01:37:07,188 --> 01:37:07,621
Like.

1911
01:37:07,621 --> 01:37:09,123
Carbon molecules, like not

1912
01:37:09,123 --> 01:37:13,160
not anything, not organic chemistry,
where it's like life, which is like.

1913
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:14,829
Simple.

1914
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:17,431
Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen feeding off.

1915
01:37:17,431 --> 01:37:18,966
Those inputs.

1916
01:37:20,734 --> 01:37:22,970
Basically the metabolic.

1917
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:26,140
Process,
it's called a reverse Krebs cycle.

1918
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:28,843
So that. Process.

1919
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:31,145
Allowed the.

1920
01:37:31,145 --> 01:37:35,649
First
auto catalytic set to continuously self.

1921
01:37:35,649 --> 01:37:37,284
Amplify

1922
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:39,053
through this through.

1923
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:40,254
This process.

1924
01:37:40,254 --> 01:37:41,922
So if this. Process is allowed to.

1925
01:37:41,922 --> 01:37:43,357
Continue.

1926
01:37:43,724 --> 01:37:46,427
Further self-organization
may eventually lead to the emergence

1927
01:37:46,427 --> 01:37:48,562
of an organic computer
that can process, integrate

1928
01:37:48,562 --> 01:37:49,830
and store information about the world.

1929
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:52,266
So what dissipated adaptation.

1930
01:37:52,566 --> 01:37:55,803
Is doing is as it's.

1931
01:37:55,803 --> 01:37:59,006
Doing this blind variation
and selective retention

1932
01:37:59,006 --> 01:38:01,809
process, and it's
finding more stable configurations.

1933
01:38:02,309 --> 01:38:02,810
Those more.

1934
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:04,511
Stable configurations are.

1935
01:38:04,511 --> 01:38:07,381
Also predictive. Of the environment.

1936
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:12,486
So this disruptive adaptation process
is this auto catalytic asset.

1937
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:15,656
Modeling.
The surrounding energy landscape.

1938
01:38:16,056 --> 01:38:19,393
So I'm arguing that
this is where modeling begins.

1939
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:23,397
It even begins before what we call life
like self-replicating life

1940
01:38:23,764 --> 01:38:26,667
and its dissipated adaptation,
which is a process

1941
01:38:27,334 --> 01:38:31,405
of modeling the the energy
in the environment, the energy.

1942
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:31,872
Sources

1943
01:38:33,874 --> 01:38:37,745
so. This
isn't just one continuous process.

1944
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:41,215
There are these leaps
that are phase transitions.

1945
01:38:41,215 --> 01:38:43,350
Basically,
we've heard of phase transitions in

1946
01:38:44,518 --> 01:38:46,487
physics and chemistry.

1947
01:38:46,553 --> 01:38:47,221
Courses.

1948
01:38:47,221 --> 01:38:50,324
Where you have like.

1949
01:38:51,358 --> 01:38:52,660
Water.

1950
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:55,863
Being heated up
and in transitioning into a gas

1951
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:58,832
or the reverse,
when a gas becomes frozen,

1952
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,469
you get a state of order that emerges.

1953
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:05,272
These.

1954
01:39:05,272 --> 01:39:07,675
Transitions. Towards.

1955
01:39:07,675 --> 01:39:11,312
These configurations
that are good at extracting energy.

1956
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:16,650
Those have also been characterized
as phase transitions.

1957
01:39:17,117 --> 01:39:19,853
So Eric Smith,
who I mentioned before, and Harold Moritz

1958
01:39:19,853 --> 01:39:22,690
they have this phase transition
theory of life.

1959
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:24,692
Which basically

1960
01:39:25,092 --> 01:39:27,494
explains how.

1961
01:39:27,494 --> 01:39:28,562
Information gains.

1962
01:39:28,562 --> 01:39:29,897
Control in.

1963
01:39:29,897 --> 01:39:31,699
These. Systems.

1964
01:39:33,133 --> 01:39:34,802
In Sarah Walker and Paul Davies

1965
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:38,639
work on this, basically show that
through this process, the blind variation

1966
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:42,743
and selective retention information
gets built up in this auto catalytic set.

1967
01:39:43,043 --> 01:39:46,580
And at some point there's what they
call algorithmic takeover

1968
01:39:47,915 --> 01:39:51,452
or informational
control, and the system becomes an agent

1969
01:39:51,452 --> 01:39:55,055
that can start to steer and control
itself.

1970
01:39:55,956 --> 01:39:58,525
In. Ways
that wouldn't be predicted by physics. So

1971
01:39:59,626 --> 01:40:03,797
living system is very much like we didn't
talk about dissipated structures.

1972
01:40:03,797 --> 01:40:04,565
But like.

1973
01:40:04,565 --> 01:40:07,401
Tornadoes, whirlpools,
those things emerge

1974
01:40:07,401 --> 01:40:09,470
to dissipate an energy gradient.

1975
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:14,008
Living things because of the.

1976
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:15,843
Process of metabolism.

1977
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:19,446
We are this cycling system,
this thermodynamic

1978
01:40:19,446 --> 01:40:21,181
energetic loop.

1979
01:40:23,617 --> 01:40:26,420
But was going to see that

1980
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:32,926
OK, so yeah, we are like the storm,
but we do.

1981
01:40:32,926 --> 01:40:34,928
Have. Control over this.

1982
01:40:35,095 --> 01:40:37,464
We're a storm with control.
So it doesn't really make sense.

1983
01:40:37,464 --> 01:40:42,002
Going back to Sam Harris's quote that
you are the storm, you do not control it.

1984
01:40:42,436 --> 01:40:43,237
It's literally.

1985
01:40:43,237 --> 01:40:47,174
The information that gets built up
through evolution that allows

1986
01:40:48,275 --> 01:40:50,411
us being this dissipated structure
like a.

1987
01:40:50,411 --> 01:40:51,445
Storm.

1988
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:54,348
To start controlling its own behavior.

1989
01:40:57,885 --> 01:40:59,319
So the last.

1990
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:02,823
Part is just an argument for that.

1991
01:41:02,823 --> 01:41:06,493
Second question,
why should complexity increase as.

1992
01:41:07,928 --> 01:41:10,497
We. Know that this evolutionary process

1993
01:41:10,497 --> 01:41:13,700
where you build up this model?

1994
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:17,671
So we would think that this after
these generations of evolution,

1995
01:41:17,671 --> 01:41:21,375
this organism is going to be
well adapted to its environment.

1996
01:41:21,842 --> 01:41:26,547
But we know that adaptation
doesn't mean becoming more complex so.

1997
01:41:27,214 --> 01:41:30,651
So. Sharks and crocodiles are cited
as species

1998
01:41:30,651 --> 01:41:35,055
that haven't evolved much at all
in many millions of years.

1999
01:41:35,956 --> 01:41:40,027
Cave fish
actually evolved to become more simple.

2000
01:41:40,027 --> 01:41:43,831
So basically fish with eyes yet isolated

2001
01:41:43,831 --> 01:41:47,101
and like an underground environment
where there was no

2002
01:41:48,168 --> 01:41:49,603
need for sunlight.

2003
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:51,605
And so.

2004
01:41:52,172 --> 01:41:54,208
Basically.

2005
01:41:54,608 --> 01:41:59,079
Fish like processing light like ice.

2006
01:41:59,079 --> 01:42:00,647
Didn't have any survival advantage.

2007
01:42:00,647 --> 01:42:04,218
So basically fish lost their eyes

2008
01:42:05,419 --> 01:42:05,853
over many

2009
01:42:05,853 --> 01:42:08,822
generations of evolution
becoming simpler.

2010
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:11,391
So if that's true, why.

2011
01:42:11,391 --> 01:42:14,995
Should evolution increase complexity

2012
01:42:15,496 --> 01:42:16,930
the answer to that,

2013
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:20,701
it comes from this understanding
that evolutionary cosmology

2014
01:42:20,701 --> 01:42:24,505
says that a species adapted to a niche
is like a scientific theory.

2015
01:42:24,505 --> 01:42:26,406
Being tested for viability,

2016
01:42:26,406 --> 01:42:29,476
species will evolve
not to become increasingly complex.

2017
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:30,611
But to match.

2018
01:42:30,611 --> 01:42:32,946
The complexity of the environment.

2019
01:42:32,946 --> 01:42:34,014
A sort of simple.

2020
01:42:34,014 --> 01:42:37,818
Solution to the thermodynamic problem
of staying far from equilibrium.

2021
01:42:38,252 --> 01:42:40,888
So Einstein
famously said a theory should be.

2022
01:42:41,388 --> 01:42:43,457
As simple as possible, but no simpler.

2023
01:42:44,525 --> 01:42:46,426
The same can be said about an organism.

2024
01:42:46,426 --> 01:42:48,061
You want it to be.

2025
01:42:48,061 --> 01:42:49,363
As simple as possible.

2026
01:42:49,363 --> 01:42:50,264
While it.

2027
01:42:50,264 --> 01:42:53,700
Accomplishes
its task of extracting energy.

2028
01:42:54,101 --> 01:42:56,904
It has to be complex enough to be.

2029
01:42:56,904 --> 01:43:00,507
Able to extract energy
in a competitive environment.

2030
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:03,210
But a bacterium.

2031
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:05,679
Doesn't have to do
it, doesn't need intelligence.

2032
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:08,882
Any extra information
processing, higher level cognition.

2033
01:43:09,483 --> 01:43:12,419
Would. Be energy wasted.

2034
01:43:13,887 --> 01:43:15,189
That could.

2035
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:15,989
Be energy that

2036
01:43:15,989 --> 01:43:19,693
allows it to stay far from equilibrium
for longer and replicate more.

2037
01:43:19,693 --> 01:43:22,796
So it's not the case

2038
01:43:22,796 --> 01:43:25,532
that everything will
evolve towards higher complexity.

2039
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:27,668
But the.

2040
01:43:27,668 --> 01:43:29,436
Reason that we do. Get.

2041
01:43:29,436 --> 01:43:31,872
Increasingly complex species. Over.

2042
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:34,942
Evolutionary time
in a way that I'm saying is inevitable.

2043
01:43:36,143 --> 01:43:39,713
So there is a progressive evolutionary
process that leads to higher forms.

2044
01:43:40,414 --> 01:43:43,250
It has to do with nature emergent.

2045
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:47,054
So so basically a species will evolve

2046
01:43:47,054 --> 01:43:50,791
to become as complex
as its niche, as its environmental niche.

2047
01:43:52,259 --> 01:43:56,096
But there will be increasingly complex
niches that.

2048
01:43:56,096 --> 01:43:57,864
Emerge for.

2049
01:43:57,864 --> 01:44:02,102
Reasons that will be explained. But.

2050
01:44:02,102 --> 01:44:04,771
I will pause there

2051
01:44:04,838 --> 01:44:07,641
before I get to that,
which will be what we end on.

2052
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:11,912
There are no other questions right now.

2053
01:44:11,912 --> 01:44:16,617
So if anyone does have questions,
how about they can feel free to ask it

2054
01:44:16,617 --> 01:44:21,788
during this last section
give you a second to catch your breath.

2055
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:22,623
I know it's been a.

2056
01:44:22,623 --> 01:44:23,857
Ton of information.

2057
01:44:23,857 --> 01:44:26,627
Like my goal is that

2058
01:44:27,127 --> 01:44:29,796
since this is being recorded
it will be something that's up.

2059
01:44:30,797 --> 01:44:33,200
Hopefully I've cited enough.

2060
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:34,134
Literature.

2061
01:44:34,134 --> 01:44:37,537
That people can explore
this stuff themselves and see that like,

2062
01:44:38,038 --> 01:44:40,607
OK, it's not this guy that's like.

2063
01:44:40,607 --> 01:44:42,576
Kook. Claiming
to have like a theory of everything.

2064
01:44:42,576 --> 01:44:44,111
This isn't my theory.

2065
01:44:44,111 --> 01:44:47,147
It's a synthesis that's emerging and

2066
01:44:48,782 --> 01:44:52,085
really this story has been there
for quite some time,

2067
01:44:52,085 --> 01:44:56,456
and the cybernetics pioneers,
actually a lot of them,

2068
01:44:56,456 --> 01:45:00,093
where you could call them
like cosmic cardiologists,

2069
01:45:00,093 --> 01:45:03,797
a lot of them did see this
continual increase in complexity.

2070
01:45:04,498 --> 01:45:07,534
Of course, there's nothing mystical
about it or supernatural about it.

2071
01:45:08,935 --> 01:45:11,038
It's a mechanistic process

2072
01:45:11,038 --> 01:45:15,175
that doesn't change the fact that nature
seems to have these built.

2073
01:45:15,175 --> 01:45:16,443
In goals.

2074
01:45:16,443 --> 01:45:21,248
That emerge from the fundamental laws
and constants, the parameters,

2075
01:45:21,248 --> 01:45:24,851
the fine tuning,
but it's a completely natural,

2076
01:45:25,052 --> 01:45:28,021
progressive,
teleological, evolutionary process,

2077
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:30,857
and so I'll just

2078
01:45:30,857 --> 01:45:33,960
end, you know, this is just finishing up.

2079
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,028
It's along those same lines.

2080
01:45:35,028 --> 01:45:37,898
So that's good
questions can come after this.

2081
01:45:38,065 --> 01:45:40,567
I know it's been quite a lot
so I will just try to.

2082
01:45:42,002 --> 01:45:44,638
Sum this up simply.

2083
01:45:44,838 --> 01:45:48,842
So two important
principles from cybernetics

2084
01:45:49,242 --> 01:45:53,647
these came from Ross Ashby,
who also created the principle

2085
01:45:53,647 --> 01:45:54,881
of self-organization,

2086
01:45:54,881 --> 01:45:59,052
which was really the first time
people took self-organization seriously.

2087
01:45:59,086 --> 01:46:03,123
So we think of complexity science
as being the science

2088
01:46:03,123 --> 01:46:05,792
of self-organization,
but it really goes back to cybernetics.

2089
01:46:07,194 --> 01:46:10,030
I think the term
I think might have talked about it,

2090
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:13,400
but it was Ross
Ashby who tried to give it up,

2091
01:46:13,834 --> 01:46:17,337
make it a principle
and a formalized concept.

2092
01:46:18,405 --> 01:46:18,805
So there are.

2093
01:46:18,805 --> 01:46:24,077
These two concepts that really
I think anybody interested in I call,

2094
01:46:24,111 --> 01:46:27,481
for instance, Bayesian brain hypothesis,
free energy principle should be aware.

2095
01:46:27,481 --> 01:46:30,183
Of because. All of the way he talks about

2096
01:46:31,518 --> 01:46:34,020
evolution comes from this.

2097
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:36,556
Ashby's work, the Good Regulator Theorem.

2098
01:46:38,058 --> 01:46:39,760
It was also updated.

2099
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:43,263
There was the internal model principle,
which came like a decade later.

2100
01:46:43,764 --> 01:46:46,533
Good Regulator
Theorem came is both these laws,

2101
01:46:46,533 --> 01:46:49,269
I think came in the fifties
and the forties or fifties.

2102
01:46:49,269 --> 01:46:53,006
And then I think in the seventies
the internal model principle was created.

2103
01:46:53,006 --> 01:46:53,940
But it basically says that

2104
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:56,643
any system that regulates or controls
another system.

2105
01:46:56,977 --> 01:46:59,613
Must have. A model of that system.

2106
01:46:59,613 --> 01:47:01,081
Otherwise it can't regulate it.

2107
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:02,416
So it seems pretty obvious.

2108
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:06,353
But this talk of models
kind of starts here

2109
01:47:06,353 --> 01:47:08,021
that that is very familiar

2110
01:47:08,021 --> 01:47:10,824
to anyone interested
in like the free energy principle.

2111
01:47:11,792 --> 01:47:14,828
So this

2112
01:47:14,828 --> 01:47:17,397
this can be applied to inanimate systems.

2113
01:47:17,397 --> 01:47:19,599
I mean, controllers are like. House.

2114
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:21,368
Like thermostats and stuff.

2115
01:47:21,368 --> 01:47:24,571
But Ashby was really interested
in adaptive systems,

2116
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:26,072
so he was thinking about evolution.

2117
01:47:26,072 --> 01:47:29,943
So applied to evolution,
an organism must model its environment

2118
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:33,580
if it's going to extract free energy.

2119
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:36,082
And an organism is a model of its niche.

2120
01:47:36,416 --> 01:47:37,150
Like a key.

2121
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:39,419
Is a model of the lock it opens.

2122
01:47:39,419 --> 01:47:43,056
So when we talk about these models
can be kind of it's kind of abstract.

2123
01:47:43,723 --> 01:47:46,793
But I think this model A.

2124
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:49,429
T is a model to lock
it opens really explains.

2125
01:47:49,963 --> 01:47:50,330
How an.

2126
01:47:50,330 --> 01:47:52,666
Organism fits into a niche.

2127
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:56,303
You can also say
like a hand fits into a glove.

2128
01:47:56,703 --> 01:48:00,407
But it really the.

2129
01:48:00,407 --> 01:48:02,976
Organism is a model of its environment.

2130
01:48:02,976 --> 01:48:07,013
So natural selection is essentially
an information channel

2131
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:12,018
that through evolution, is pumping
in information from the external world,

2132
01:48:12,018 --> 01:48:16,590
from the environment into the organism
such that the organism. Is.

2133
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:20,660
Encoded in the structure of reality,
in encoding the structure of the.

2134
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:23,163
World and. Its design.

2135
01:48:24,130 --> 01:48:25,165
Include

2136
01:48:26,233 --> 01:48:26,700
encodes.

2137
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:28,935
Information about the outside. World.

2138
01:48:28,935 --> 01:48:30,770
So it's kind of a.

2139
01:48:30,770 --> 01:48:32,372
New way to think about evolution.

2140
01:48:32,372 --> 01:48:35,008
Is this process of

2141
01:48:35,075 --> 01:48:36,710
basically

2142
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:40,447
the universe is modeling itself
and waking up through this process.

2143
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:42,449
Pretty interesting.

2144
01:48:42,449 --> 01:48:44,117
Kind of psychedelic.

2145
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:45,185
Cell.

2146
01:48:46,286 --> 01:48:47,220
The law of requisite.

2147
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:51,358
Variety is just telling you
about the sophistication of that.

2148
01:48:51,358 --> 01:48:52,192
Model.

2149
01:48:52,192 --> 01:48:54,895
So how complex does the model have to be

2150
01:48:55,195 --> 01:48:57,230
for the organism
to stay far from equilibrium?

2151
01:48:58,398 --> 01:49:01,134
Ross Ashby's lawyer says.

2152
01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:07,340
So. John, I'm a researcher at Cambridge.

2153
01:49:07,807 --> 01:49:10,010
Kind of summed it up this way in
colloquial terms,

2154
01:49:10,277 --> 01:49:13,346
Ashby's law has come to be understood
as a simple proposition.

2155
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:14,347
If the system.

2156
01:49:14,347 --> 01:49:15,982
Is to be able to deal successfully

2157
01:49:15,982 --> 01:49:18,451
with the diversity of challenges
that its environment produces,

2158
01:49:18,919 --> 01:49:22,856
then it needs to have a repertoire of
responses, which is at least as nuanced

2159
01:49:22,856 --> 01:49:24,991
as the problems
thrown up by the environment.

2160
01:49:25,458 --> 01:49:29,563
So a viable system is one that can handle
the variability of its environment.

2161
01:49:29,563 --> 01:49:31,097
For, as Ashley put it.

2162
01:49:31,097 --> 01:49:33,867
Only variety can absorb variety.

2163
01:49:35,235 --> 01:49:35,902
So it's

2164
01:49:35,902 --> 01:49:39,172
what we said before with evolutionary
epistemology.

2165
01:49:39,639 --> 01:49:43,209
An organism evolves to become as complex

2166
01:49:43,209 --> 01:49:46,613
as its environmental niche requires.

2167
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:47,581
It has.

2168
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:51,585
To. Specifically have enough behavioral.

2169
01:49:51,718 --> 01:49:53,453
Responses.

2170
01:49:53,453 --> 01:49:55,722
Which. Map on to internal states.

2171
01:49:55,722 --> 01:49:58,024
So it has to have enough cognitive
states.

2172
01:49:58,592 --> 01:50:01,428
To respond.

2173
01:50:01,428 --> 01:50:05,332
To the number of challenges
that the environment

2174
01:50:05,332 --> 01:50:08,468
presents, challenges

2175
01:50:08,468 --> 01:50:11,972
in its ability
to extract energy And when.

2176
01:50:12,539 --> 01:50:13,306
When.

2177
01:50:13,306 --> 01:50:16,409
You get organisms and you get other

2178
01:50:16,409 --> 01:50:18,812
you get other agents, other organisms,
then.

2179
01:50:19,412 --> 01:50:20,647
Of course.

2180
01:50:21,381 --> 01:50:24,784
What the organism has to
model is much more complicated

2181
01:50:24,784 --> 01:50:28,888
because it doesn't have to just model
the energy source in its environment

2182
01:50:29,489 --> 01:50:32,192
to get food. It also has to. Model other.

2183
01:50:32,559 --> 01:50:34,728
Modelers, other cognitive agents.

2184
01:50:36,196 --> 01:50:39,466
So, yeah, basically

2185
01:50:41,267 --> 01:50:43,536
any adaptive system as

2186
01:50:45,005 --> 01:50:47,474
they are.

2187
01:50:47,474 --> 01:50:51,244
Behavioral repertoire
and a repertoire of accessible.

2188
01:50:51,678 --> 01:50:52,112
Mental.

2189
01:50:52,112 --> 01:50:55,115
States or for things
without brains, computational states

2190
01:50:55,682 --> 01:50:58,518
and the number of states
that the organism can access

2191
01:50:59,552 --> 01:51:02,489
should match the number of challenges,
the number.

2192
01:51:02,822 --> 01:51:04,724
Of states.

2193
01:51:04,858 --> 01:51:08,461
That could surprise the organism
by the environment.

2194
01:51:09,462 --> 01:51:12,732
So a cat must have
at least as many states as the ways

2195
01:51:12,732 --> 01:51:15,902
the mouse can evaded, and the mouse
has to have enough behavioral states

2196
01:51:15,902 --> 01:51:18,538
to get away So they model each other.

2197
01:51:19,739 --> 01:51:24,210
A sports fan, like a fencer, must have
many blocks as his opponent has attacks.

2198
01:51:25,111 --> 01:51:27,414
And as we said,

2199
01:51:27,414 --> 01:51:31,151
because behavioral responses
map on to unique internal states,

2200
01:51:31,751 --> 01:51:34,921
the loss of an organism
must have as many accessible states

2201
01:51:34,921 --> 01:51:38,191
as required by the complexity of niche.

2202
01:51:38,191 --> 01:51:41,861
So we set this organism
as some simple solution

2203
01:51:41,861 --> 01:51:44,164
to the thermodynamic problem
of being far from equilibrium.

2204
01:51:46,466 --> 01:51:48,535
So well-adapted species represents

2205
01:51:48,535 --> 01:51:52,238
a biological solution to an existential
thermodynamically dilemma.

2206
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:53,740
It's a sort of living.

2207
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:57,243
Evolving scientific theory about how to
most efficiently attract the free energy,

2208
01:51:57,544 --> 01:52:00,246
the lifeblood of existence
out of a particular niche.

2209
01:52:00,714 --> 01:52:03,650
Some niches present
a changing variety of challenges

2210
01:52:03,650 --> 01:52:06,786
that must be adapted to,
while others present hardly any at all.

2211
01:52:08,955 --> 01:52:10,390
So almost done here.

2212
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:11,825
I know it's a lot.

2213
01:52:12,225 --> 01:52:15,695
Hopefully this can kind of wrap up the
ideas of show how they're all connected.

2214
01:52:17,163 --> 01:52:18,698
But this is still on this question

2215
01:52:18,698 --> 01:52:21,768
of how complex is the universe?

2216
01:52:23,169 --> 01:52:26,673
How complex can it get? So

2217
01:52:26,673 --> 01:52:29,375
Olivia, Olivia, Judson wrote this

2218
01:52:31,111 --> 01:52:31,444
published.

2219
01:52:31,444 --> 01:52:33,947
This paper called The Energy Expansions
of Evolution.

2220
01:52:34,414 --> 01:52:36,850
It's really nice.
You should check it out.

2221
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:39,285
So she says. The history of the.

2222
01:52:39,285 --> 01:52:42,489
Earth system can be divided
into five energetic epochs, each

2223
01:52:42,489 --> 01:52:45,759
featuring the evolution of lifeforms
that can exploit a new source of energy.

2224
01:52:46,292 --> 01:52:50,330
These forces are geochemical energy,
sunlight, oxygen, flesh and fire.

2225
01:52:50,830 --> 01:52:52,232
The first two were present at the start,

2226
01:52:52,232 --> 01:52:55,535
but oxygen flush and fire,
all consequences of evolutionary events.

2227
01:52:56,169 --> 01:52:58,605
And then she. Makes this statement.

2228
01:52:58,605 --> 01:53:00,173
By the way. Read is.

2229
01:53:00,173 --> 01:53:02,175
Quotes if people haven't.

2230
01:53:03,143 --> 01:53:03,910
Figured that out.

2231
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:05,578
So these are her words.

2232
01:53:05,578 --> 01:53:06,312
I forgot to put.

2233
01:53:06,312 --> 01:53:10,083
Quote marks so no.

2234
01:53:10,083 --> 01:53:12,218
Category of energy
source has disappeared.

2235
01:53:12,218 --> 01:53:14,587
This has over
time, resulted in an expanding

2236
01:53:14,587 --> 01:53:17,423
realm of the sources of energy available
to living organisms.

2237
01:53:17,423 --> 01:53:19,359
And a. Commitment.

2238
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:23,730
Increase in diversity
and complexity of ecosystems.

2239
01:53:24,297 --> 01:53:28,101
So here's the way to think about it.

2240
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:32,572
So taking the thermodynamic perspective

2241
01:53:32,572 --> 01:53:35,475
and looking at organisms
as energy flow channels,

2242
01:53:36,142 --> 01:53:38,912
we can think of each nation on Earth
as a sort of energy slot

2243
01:53:39,179 --> 01:53:42,515
for a given species
and an evolving population of organisms

2244
01:53:42,515 --> 01:53:46,252
efficiently searching the solution space
will eventually just by chance.

2245
01:53:46,653 --> 01:53:47,086
Discover a.

2246
01:53:47,086 --> 01:53:49,989
Solution to a thermodynamic problem
that it didn't know existed.

2247
01:53:50,523 --> 01:53:53,993
The discovery of a novel energy source
or energy extraction technique is both

2248
01:53:53,993 --> 01:53:56,462
how a new niche and a new species
come into existence.

2249
01:53:57,297 --> 01:53:59,566
So phylogenetic learning,
which we saw in that

2250
01:54:00,233 --> 01:54:03,937
chart, will naturally lead to speciation
because organisms.

2251
01:54:04,237 --> 01:54:05,805
Will stumble upon new.

2252
01:54:05,805 --> 01:54:10,176
Ways to exploit thermodynamic niches
that were previously inaccessible to.

2253
01:54:10,176 --> 01:54:12,612
Life. Purely for design reasons.

2254
01:54:12,645 --> 01:54:14,314
We're going to give
examples on the next slide.

2255
01:54:16,316 --> 01:54:17,417
So as.

2256
01:54:17,417 --> 01:54:20,587
The biosphere accumulates knowledge
through phylogenetic learning,

2257
01:54:20,587 --> 01:54:22,856
not only is the solution space
corresponding

2258
01:54:22,856 --> 01:54:25,291
to one kind of thermodynamic problem
being.

2259
01:54:25,291 --> 01:54:27,393
Explored here's a growing problem.

2260
01:54:27,393 --> 01:54:30,196
Space, each with its own unique solution.

2261
01:54:30,196 --> 01:54:31,231
Space

2262
01:54:32,732 --> 01:54:33,867
So in an evolution.

2263
01:54:33,867 --> 01:54:36,870
So there's an evolutionary trajectory.

2264
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:41,507
That's not determined in the strict sense
envisioned by.

2265
01:54:41,507 --> 01:54:45,511
Laplace where like there's no freedom in
the future is like set in stone.

2266
01:54:46,012 --> 01:54:48,314
But there is a sort of.

2267
01:54:48,314 --> 01:54:51,851
Statistical determinism,
what I've been calling a non equilibrium

2268
01:54:51,851 --> 01:54:56,256
statistical determinism,
that guarantees that basically the.

2269
01:54:56,256 --> 01:54:57,924
Inevitability of this.

2270
01:54:57,924 --> 01:55:01,594
Emergence of a distribution of far
from equilibrium attractors.

2271
01:55:02,996 --> 01:55:04,264
Of varying varying.

2272
01:55:04,264 --> 01:55:05,431
Degrees of complexity.

2273
01:55:05,431 --> 01:55:08,968
So each species can be seen
as an attractor

2274
01:55:09,269 --> 01:55:12,505
that's exploiting this niche
and you get this

2275
01:55:13,606 --> 01:55:17,176
basically this diversity where you have.

2276
01:55:18,444 --> 01:55:20,179
Organisms

2277
01:55:20,346 --> 01:55:20,980
exploiting.

2278
01:55:20,980 --> 01:55:24,517
Like the energy niches that were kind
of. The.

2279
01:55:24,884 --> 01:55:28,421
Easy ones to exploit on Earth,
like the geochemical free energy

2280
01:55:28,421 --> 01:55:31,791
we mentioned with the origin of life
and sunlight was.

2281
01:55:31,791 --> 01:55:33,126
A little bit of.

2282
01:55:33,126 --> 01:55:34,560
A more difficult challenge.

2283
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:36,362
To extract. Sunlight.

2284
01:55:36,362 --> 01:55:39,332
It took some time for evolution
to be able to do that.

2285
01:55:41,534 --> 01:55:45,104
So extracting energy
from the hydrothermal.

2286
01:55:45,104 --> 01:55:46,005
Vents.

2287
01:55:46,272 --> 01:55:49,943
Source of energy is really simple
because the energy is already

2288
01:55:49,943 --> 01:55:52,812
like flowing through the system,
doesn't have to do much work

2289
01:55:53,313 --> 01:55:54,380
to extract sunlight.

2290
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:56,950
You have, you know, a moving sun.

2291
01:55:57,450 --> 01:55:59,252
It's a little bit more complicated.

2292
01:55:59,252 --> 01:56:01,154
But not nearly as complicated.

2293
01:56:01,154 --> 01:56:05,491
To it as organisms that eat other
organisms so better at trophic organisms

2294
01:56:07,093 --> 01:56:10,563
because they will have to model
not just like a sun

2295
01:56:10,563 --> 01:56:14,000
moving predictably feed the air, but
have to model all of these other agents,

2296
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:19,172
many of which are trying
to eat them to kill you. So

2297
01:56:22,008 --> 01:56:23,309
basically, so

2298
01:56:23,309 --> 01:56:26,312
answering this question why
increasingly intelligent species emerge?

2299
01:56:26,713 --> 01:56:27,647
We started off with.

2300
01:56:27,647 --> 01:56:29,248
Reductive order tropes.

2301
01:56:29,248 --> 01:56:31,718
Those organisms
around hydrothermal vents.

2302
01:56:31,718 --> 01:56:33,453
They were a solution to the problem

2303
01:56:33,453 --> 01:56:35,955
of how to extract the energy
from geochemical gradients,

2304
01:56:37,390 --> 01:56:41,794
photosynthetic bacteria, the ancestors
of plants for the solution to extract

2305
01:56:41,894 --> 01:56:45,565
of how to extract all the solar energy
that was flowing to the planetary system.

2306
01:56:45,965 --> 01:56:49,802
So that was a big discovery
made by life is that nation

2307
01:56:50,737 --> 01:56:55,074
energy directly from sunlight, hetero
organisms, organisms

2308
01:56:55,074 --> 01:56:57,110
that eat other organisms
were the solution

2309
01:56:57,110 --> 01:56:59,645
to the problem of how to extract energy
from life itself.

2310
01:57:00,413 --> 01:57:02,715
Once life starts having to model life,

2311
01:57:02,715 --> 01:57:05,184
other agents with causal power
and adaptive behavior,

2312
01:57:05,785 --> 01:57:09,355
the computational task of extracting
free energy gets increasingly difficult

2313
01:57:09,389 --> 01:57:11,791
as increasingly complex species arise.

2314
01:57:12,925 --> 01:57:14,160
So by virtue of having to model.

2315
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:17,163
Each other, the complexity
of some species gets ratcheted up by

2316
01:57:17,163 --> 01:57:19,932
what's known
as an evolutionary arms race.

2317
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:23,069
So the line is evolving.

2318
01:57:23,269 --> 01:57:26,406
You know, lions. Are producing offspring.

2319
01:57:26,406 --> 01:57:30,510
Some of those lines will be better
at predicting the gazelles movements.

2320
01:57:30,943 --> 01:57:32,512
The gazelle will.

2321
01:57:32,512 --> 01:57:34,714
Also be creating offspring,
and some of those.

2322
01:57:35,148 --> 01:57:36,516
Will be better.

2323
01:57:36,516 --> 01:57:38,818
At predicting the lions attack.

2324
01:57:39,652 --> 01:57:43,923
The ones that are better predicting
are the ones that get to stick around.

2325
01:57:43,923 --> 01:57:48,127
So you see how you have this ratcheting
mechanism that ratchets that ratchet.

2326
01:57:48,127 --> 01:57:50,196
Is up. Complexity.

2327
01:57:51,564 --> 01:57:52,832
There's actually a principle.

2328
01:57:52,832 --> 01:57:53,933
Called

2329
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:55,101
the Red.

2330
01:57:55,101 --> 01:57:57,136
Queen principle.

2331
01:57:57,203 --> 01:57:58,471
That. Says that.

2332
01:57:58,471 --> 01:57:59,972
For an.

2333
01:57:59,972 --> 01:58:04,777
Organism to simply stay in the game
of existence, certain organisms,

2334
01:58:05,178 --> 01:58:08,848
a certain species, they will have
to become increasing highly complex.

2335
01:58:09,482 --> 01:58:10,716
And that comes from

2336
01:58:11,717 --> 01:58:12,752
Alice in Wonderland.

2337
01:58:12,752 --> 01:58:14,287
Basically,

2338
01:58:15,588 --> 01:58:18,958
There's a scene
with the Red Queen in Alsace.

2339
01:58:19,292 --> 01:58:20,927
They're all running as fast as they can.

2340
01:58:20,927 --> 01:58:24,931
And Alice is like, you know,
I'm running fast as I keep running.

2341
01:58:24,931 --> 01:58:27,066
But I'm going nowhere.

2342
01:58:27,066 --> 01:58:30,536
So they're all running, but they're not
making any decisions or staying in place.

2343
01:58:30,536 --> 01:58:33,873
And the queen says something like,
Oh, you see here.

2344
01:58:33,873 --> 01:58:34,974
For that

2345
01:58:36,209 --> 01:58:38,077
to go somewhere, you'll have to run.

2346
01:58:38,077 --> 01:58:40,546
Much faster than. That.

2347
01:58:40,546 --> 01:58:45,651
So the idea is that for a species.

2348
01:58:46,619 --> 01:58:46,886
That.

2349
01:58:46,886 --> 01:58:50,690
Has to deal with this complex environment
just to stay where it is,

2350
01:58:50,690 --> 01:58:55,828
just to stay in the game of existence,
it has to become increasingly complex.

2351
01:58:55,828 --> 01:58:58,064
It has to keep adapting.

2352
01:58:58,064 --> 01:58:59,932
So one thing.

2353
01:58:59,932 --> 01:59:02,368
That I wanted to get into more,
but I'm not going to.

2354
01:59:02,835 --> 01:59:04,704
Is this idea of empowerment.

2355
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:07,573
It's comes from the computational
neuroscience literature.

2356
01:59:08,074 --> 01:59:08,908
It's similar.

2357
01:59:08,908 --> 01:59:11,477
It comes from Daniel Colony,
but it's very similar to.

2358
01:59:11,911 --> 01:59:14,013
Harvard's Alex.

2359
01:59:14,013 --> 01:59:16,015
Wisner. Business grows.

2360
01:59:16,015 --> 01:59:18,651
He has an idea causal and tropic forcing.

2361
01:59:18,651 --> 01:59:20,887
But basically these
people are arguing that.

2362
01:59:23,456 --> 01:59:24,390
Well.

2363
01:59:24,690 --> 01:59:26,959
Isn't it gross is arguing that a causal.

2364
01:59:27,026 --> 01:59:29,061
Entropic force.

2365
01:59:29,862 --> 01:59:32,965
Means that like basically
it's like evolution.

2366
01:59:32,965 --> 01:59:38,070
You'll get a system systems
that are trying to maximize.

2367
01:59:38,905 --> 01:59:40,740
The number of.

2368
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:44,443
States
they can respond to so that maximize.

2369
01:59:44,844 --> 01:59:46,712
And the number of.

2370
01:59:46,712 --> 01:59:50,316
States they can respond to
is mirrored by their internal diversity.

2371
01:59:50,683 --> 01:59:54,086
So systems naturally
try to increase the number of states.

2372
01:59:54,453 --> 01:59:57,557
And it's. This ability that.

2373
01:59:57,557 --> 02:00:02,662
Allows for intelligence,
because if you have more states going

2374
02:00:02,662 --> 02:00:06,465
back to this law of requisite variety,
you can respond to more challenges.

2375
02:00:07,233 --> 02:00:08,935
So not every.

2376
02:00:08,935 --> 02:00:11,470
Species is increasing empowerment.

2377
02:00:11,470 --> 02:00:12,038
But you.

2378
02:00:12,038 --> 02:00:14,340
Will get the emergence of increasing

2379
02:00:15,575 --> 02:00:17,610
increasingly complex.

2380
02:00:17,610 --> 02:00:19,845
Species because each.

2381
02:00:19,845 --> 02:00:21,581
Species.

2382
02:00:21,714 --> 02:00:24,684
Serves as food for a potential.

2383
02:00:24,684 --> 02:00:26,485
New species.

2384
02:00:27,086 --> 02:00:27,453
You will.

2385
02:00:27,453 --> 02:00:29,722
Get increasingly. Complex.

2386
02:00:29,722 --> 02:00:31,891
Species that emerge over time,

2387
02:00:32,491 --> 02:00:36,963
and they will be increasingly empowered,
meaning that they can respond

2388
02:00:37,496 --> 02:00:42,168
to more environmental states
and that they have more accessible

2389
02:00:43,135 --> 02:00:45,137
mental or cognitive states.

2390
02:00:46,405 --> 02:00:48,741
I explained some of this in the last.

2391
02:00:49,342 --> 02:00:51,344
Slide,
but I'll just explain a little more.

2392
02:00:51,377 --> 02:00:53,379
So open ended nature emergence.

2393
02:00:53,379 --> 02:00:55,147
Why has the evolutionary record shown

2394
02:00:55,147 --> 02:00:58,317
a trend of the emergence
of increasingly complex forms?

2395
02:00:59,852 --> 02:01:03,089
Because when all conceivable niches on
earth were filled, that wasn't the end.

2396
02:01:03,522 --> 02:01:06,125
New species created new niches
because the free energy slot

2397
02:01:06,125 --> 02:01:08,227
they provide is themselves their food.

2398
02:01:09,629 --> 02:01:13,532
So cybernetics
guys kind of like the last living

2399
02:01:14,066 --> 02:01:16,736
cybernetics, this kind of.

2400
02:01:16,736 --> 02:01:17,503
I'm sure there are.

2401
02:01:17,503 --> 02:01:20,706
Other people that call themselves that,
but he's kind of kept

2402
02:01:20,706 --> 02:01:23,342
that title even when it wasn't trendy.

2403
02:01:24,510 --> 02:01:27,213
He says it is well documented
by evolutionary biologists

2404
02:01:27,213 --> 02:01:28,681
that ecosystems tend to become.

2405
02:01:28,681 --> 02:01:30,349
More complex the number.

2406
02:01:30,349 --> 02:01:32,852
Of different species increases
and the number of dependencies

2407
02:01:32,852 --> 02:01:35,821
in other languages
linkages between species increases.

2408
02:01:36,656 --> 02:01:37,423
He cites E.O.

2409
02:01:37,423 --> 02:01:39,525
Wilson, who recently passed. Away.

2410
02:01:41,027 --> 02:01:41,927
Who did a lot of

2411
02:01:41,927 --> 02:01:46,232
work that that kind of inspired
a lot of the concepts in the book,

2412
02:01:47,366 --> 02:01:52,004
not just this niche emergence,
but also talking about superorganism.

2413
02:01:52,004 --> 02:01:56,242
So collectives and colonies,
self-organizing systems that all scales.

2414
02:01:56,876 --> 02:02:00,179
But he said not only do ecosystems
contain typically lots of niches

2415
02:02:00,179 --> 02:02:02,748
that will eventually
be filled by new species,

2416
02:02:02,748 --> 02:02:06,319
but there is a self-reinforcing tendency
to create new niches.

2417
02:02:07,286 --> 02:02:08,654
What does that. Mean?

2418
02:02:08,654 --> 02:02:10,923
It means the. Biosphere.

2419
02:02:11,557 --> 02:02:15,127
Certainly ecosystems are themselves
auto catalytic sets.

2420
02:02:16,429 --> 02:02:18,130
So Seth

2421
02:02:18,130 --> 02:02:21,500
Lloyd, he's talking about these chemical
auto catalytic sets.

2422
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:23,836
But it's I should have had this.
On the earlier slide.

2423
02:02:23,836 --> 02:02:27,606
But it'll be a good way
to kind of show the equivalence.

2424
02:02:27,606 --> 02:02:30,009
Between ecosystems

2425
02:02:30,176 --> 02:02:31,410
satellite is auto catalytic.

2426
02:02:31,410 --> 02:02:34,146
Sets of reactions are powerful systems.
In addition to computing,

2427
02:02:34,146 --> 02:02:36,382
they can produce a wide variety
of chemical outputs.

2428
02:02:36,816 --> 02:02:39,652
In effect, an auto catalytic
set of reactions is like a tiny

2429
02:02:39,885 --> 02:02:42,221
computer controlled factory
for producing chemicals.

2430
02:02:42,688 --> 02:02:45,024
Some of these chemicals are constituents
of life.

2431
02:02:45,825 --> 02:02:47,993
Stuart Kaufman, big

2432
02:02:48,027 --> 02:02:51,697
you know, one of the main names
is kind of this whole talk.

2433
02:02:51,931 --> 02:02:53,799
He's kind of put these ideas out there

2434
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:55,801
since like

2435
02:02:55,801 --> 02:02:58,938
the early nineties,
actually going back farther than that.

2436
02:02:58,938 --> 02:03:00,973
But he started
writing books in the nineties

2437
02:03:00,973 --> 02:03:03,909
and really gaining exposure for the Santa
Fe Institute.

2438
02:03:04,877 --> 02:03:07,780
He's written a recent paper,
a semi recent.

2439
02:03:09,348 --> 02:03:10,383
About.

2440
02:03:11,016 --> 02:03:13,419
Nature emergence
as an auto catalytic process.

2441
02:03:13,652 --> 02:03:15,821
So ecosystems are auto catalytic.

2442
02:03:15,821 --> 02:03:17,289
Auto categorically closed.

2443
02:03:17,289 --> 02:03:19,592
Self-Sustaining, reaction networks.

2444
02:03:19,592 --> 02:03:22,261
So there are auto agents.

2445
02:03:22,261 --> 02:03:23,362
That reliably drive up.

2446
02:03:23,362 --> 02:03:26,365
Biological diversity and complexity
as they self amplify and.

2447
02:03:26,365 --> 02:03:27,366
Evolve.

2448
02:03:27,867 --> 02:03:30,202
So when you think about it, really
all integrated

2449
02:03:30,202 --> 02:03:33,239
networks of adaptive systems
function as AutoCAD sets.

2450
02:03:33,239 --> 02:03:37,943
There's been a lot of papers showing
this is in a sense, are all kind

2451
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:41,580
of assets, including the social organisms
we call societies

2452
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:43,516
or civilizations.

2453
02:03:45,317 --> 02:03:46,886
So these networks are common

2454
02:03:46,886 --> 02:03:51,157
because they emerge spontaneously
when many organisms repeatedly interact

2455
02:03:51,157 --> 02:03:54,894
with one another and discover
synergistic collective configurations

2456
02:03:55,361 --> 02:03:57,463
as nature often pressures them to do.

2457
02:03:57,997 --> 02:04:01,000
So at the end, almost.

2458
02:04:02,067 --> 02:04:04,170
We've explained why complexity increases

2459
02:04:05,004 --> 02:04:09,475
evolution will not increase
the complexity of every species.

2460
02:04:09,909 --> 02:04:11,877
They will become adapted to their niche.

2461
02:04:11,877 --> 02:04:15,448
They will match the complexity
of the niche However, because new

2462
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:18,517
niches are always emerging,
because species act.

2463
02:04:18,517 --> 02:04:20,486
As food for a.

2464
02:04:20,486 --> 02:04:22,922
Potential new species.

2465
02:04:23,322 --> 02:04:24,790
Because of. That process, you.

2466
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:27,193
Will get this. Increase.

2467
02:04:27,193 --> 02:04:29,094
You will get species that emerged.

2468
02:04:29,094 --> 02:04:34,266
That have a higher number of a larger
repertoire of mental.

2469
02:04:34,266 --> 02:04:35,234
And behavioral states.

2470
02:04:35,234 --> 02:04:38,804
So the law of requisite variety
really explains why

2471
02:04:38,804 --> 02:04:42,041
more complex environments
create more complex niches.

2472
02:04:42,341 --> 02:04:44,844
And this is open ended There's really. No

2473
02:04:46,912 --> 02:04:49,181
limit to how far this.

2474
02:04:49,181 --> 02:04:51,784
Process can go, especially since.

2475
02:04:51,784 --> 02:04:53,619
Humans who are the.

2476
02:04:53,619 --> 02:04:56,589
Pinnacle of this process, we're not

2477
02:04:56,589 --> 02:04:58,591
a lot of people have been against

2478
02:04:58,591 --> 02:05:01,427
these kinds of uses because it seems like
it's saying that humans are.

2479
02:05:01,427 --> 02:05:03,529
Superior or superior.

2480
02:05:03,529 --> 02:05:07,366
Maybe computationally,
but not superior in any other sense

2481
02:05:07,366 --> 02:05:09,602
for actually part of the biosphere,

2482
02:05:09,602 --> 02:05:12,271
which is this integrated,
interconnected system.

2483
02:05:12,805 --> 02:05:14,073
So it's.

2484
02:05:14,073 --> 02:05:15,040
Really, you know,

2485
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:17,977
it doesn't make sense to think of
as this like superior to nature, because.

2486
02:05:18,344 --> 02:05:18,644
The whole.

2487
02:05:18,644 --> 02:05:22,381
Biosphere is an organism
that we're just sort of an organ for.

2488
02:05:23,582 --> 02:05:25,684
We're basically the nervous system.

2489
02:05:25,684 --> 02:05:26,519
Of the planet.

2490
02:05:26,519 --> 02:05:30,122
The cybernetic global system
that people have called Gaia.

2491
02:05:30,155 --> 02:05:31,490
Some people don't like that name.

2492
02:05:31,490 --> 02:05:33,792
I think it's perfectly good name.

2493
02:05:33,792 --> 02:05:38,430
But that's
why complexity gets ratcheted up.

2494
02:05:38,430 --> 02:05:40,733
But the final

2495
02:05:41,901 --> 02:05:44,303
I guess part of.

2496
02:05:44,336 --> 02:05:47,706
This complexity increase story
is that not only do

2497
02:05:47,706 --> 02:05:49,742
you get increasingly complex species,

2498
02:05:50,809 --> 02:05:54,947
those species will interact
naturally to form.

2499
02:05:55,347 --> 02:05:57,182
Higher level.

2500
02:05:57,983 --> 02:06:01,754
Adaptive systems,
which are collectives. So.

2501
02:06:04,023 --> 02:06:06,525
I call this the principle
of recursive self-organization

2502
02:06:06,525 --> 02:06:09,361
based on Ashby's principle
self-organization.

2503
02:06:10,696 --> 02:06:13,065
What I'm arguing
is that when you have a biosphere

2504
02:06:13,065 --> 02:06:15,467
with these agents
and you have some are simple

2505
02:06:15,467 --> 02:06:18,470
and some are complex,
naturally those agents will interact.

2506
02:06:19,071 --> 02:06:20,539
When they interact.

2507
02:06:20,539 --> 02:06:23,342
They will in many cases discover

2508
02:06:23,909 --> 02:06:26,145
synergistic collective configurations.

2509
02:06:26,612 --> 02:06:30,249
So configurations
that make it easier for each agent

2510
02:06:30,249 --> 02:06:33,285
to extract the energy
they need to stay far from equilibrium.

2511
02:06:34,386 --> 02:06:35,688
So why do.

2512
02:06:35,688 --> 02:06:37,957
Interacting agents link up to. Form
stable?

2513
02:06:38,891 --> 02:06:41,894
The exact same reason that molecules
with the right chemical diversity

2514
02:06:41,894 --> 02:06:45,631
will form stable auto catalytic reaction
sets when pushed by a flow of energy

2515
02:06:46,165 --> 02:06:47,232
working collectively

2516
02:06:47,232 --> 02:06:51,036
allows the whole system to extract
more free energy with less work.

2517
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:52,638
We can.

2518
02:06:52,638 --> 02:06:55,774
That's the whole point of synergy
is that working together

2519
02:06:56,208 --> 02:06:59,979
makes your workload easier
because there's distribution of labor.

2520
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:02,481
And it's it's really.

2521
02:07:02,481 --> 02:07:04,683
Nice that this

2522
02:07:06,118 --> 02:07:06,852
distribution.

2523
02:07:06,852 --> 02:07:09,688
Of species
with some simple and some complex,

2524
02:07:10,889 --> 02:07:13,492
that's really
what you need to create this, like,

2525
02:07:13,792 --> 02:07:16,595
cybernetic adaptive system
at the level of the planet.

2526
02:07:17,029 --> 02:07:19,698
Because a system needs.

2527
02:07:19,698 --> 02:07:21,967
Diversity among its components.

2528
02:07:22,267 --> 02:07:22,935
In. Structure.

2529
02:07:22,935 --> 02:07:26,672
And function for there
to be this distribution of labor, labor

2530
02:07:26,705 --> 02:07:27,573
which makes it this

2531
02:07:28,874 --> 02:07:29,875
collective whole.

2532
02:07:29,875 --> 02:07:32,311
This is synergistic,

2533
02:07:32,311 --> 02:07:34,313
holistic, unit.

2534
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:37,383
So it's actually.

2535
02:07:37,383 --> 02:07:41,820
Good that evolution and adaptation
isn't increasing this

2536
02:07:42,054 --> 02:07:45,991
the complexity of each species,
like each species

2537
02:07:45,991 --> 02:07:48,427
isn't becoming intelligent,
like roaches aren't becoming.

2538
02:07:48,427 --> 02:07:49,328
Like more and.

2539
02:07:49,328 --> 02:07:51,397
More intelligent over time
with no. Limit.

2540
02:07:52,498 --> 02:07:55,167
The biosphere wouldn't be stable
if that were the case.

2541
02:07:55,968 --> 02:08:00,372
It's really ecosystems
need this diversity among components.

2542
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:03,642
Just as a car with made of all.

2543
02:08:03,642 --> 02:08:05,010
Engines isn't going to be.

2544
02:08:05,010 --> 02:08:06,578
Functional or an.

2545
02:08:06,578 --> 02:08:08,180
Organism made of all brains.

2546
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:10,983
You need a variety. Of parts,
some simple.

2547
02:08:11,116 --> 02:08:14,119
Some complex
because they all do different functions.

2548
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:17,923
So nature promotes
cooperation, collaboration, and synergy

2549
02:08:17,923 --> 02:08:20,993
because it is thermodynamically
beneficial for all parties.

2550
02:08:22,795 --> 02:08:25,731
Synergistic collective configurations
will eventually be discovered

2551
02:08:25,731 --> 02:08:28,801
by many components systems
that are exploding.

2552
02:08:28,801 --> 02:08:30,402
Greatest states are configurations.

2553
02:08:30,402 --> 02:08:33,405
The blind variation
and selective retention mechanism.

2554
02:08:33,572 --> 02:08:35,441
Mentioned organisms.

2555
02:08:35,441 --> 02:08:37,643
Only compete until they finally figure.

2556
02:08:37,643 --> 02:08:38,744
Out what that.

2557
02:08:38,744 --> 02:08:40,779
Working together
makes everyone's task easier.

2558
02:08:41,447 --> 02:08:42,715
And that goes for humans, too.

2559
02:08:42,715 --> 02:08:45,918
So it's kind of a moral lesson
for everybody.

2560
02:08:46,285 --> 02:08:48,654
The nations have to work together.

2561
02:08:48,654 --> 02:08:49,388
We shouldn't

2562
02:08:50,923 --> 02:08:52,291
get rid of the nations.

2563
02:08:52,291 --> 02:08:53,792
There shouldn't just be this.

2564
02:08:53,792 --> 02:08:54,927
Evolution. Into this.

2565
02:08:54,927 --> 02:08:56,762
Like global government.

2566
02:08:56,762 --> 02:08:58,130
Because the nations are.

2567
02:08:58,130 --> 02:09:00,132
Actually provide.

2568
02:09:00,132 --> 02:09:02,901
This diverse city
that we're saying is important.

2569
02:09:03,635 --> 02:09:04,169
Because.

2570
02:09:04,169 --> 02:09:09,074
You need this diversity of component
parts to create a division of labor.

2571
02:09:09,508 --> 02:09:11,877
So there's strength in diversity.

2572
02:09:11,877 --> 02:09:13,846
This is different
than the evolutionary picture

2573
02:09:13,846 --> 02:09:17,850
of survival of the fittest, whereas
there's like this idea that the strong,

2574
02:09:17,916 --> 02:09:19,585
the most intelligent survive.

2575
02:09:19,585 --> 02:09:21,086
This is saying that that's not true.

2576
02:09:21,086 --> 02:09:22,921
It's the most adaptive that survive

2577
02:09:22,921 --> 02:09:25,090
has nothing to do with strength
or intelligence.

2578
02:09:25,090 --> 02:09:27,993
Spots have been around
for many millions of years

2579
02:09:27,993 --> 02:09:30,996
despite being lost, being slow.

2580
02:09:31,296 --> 02:09:33,332
Because they exploit a.

2581
02:09:33,465 --> 02:09:35,734
Source of free energy that's not being.

2582
02:09:35,734 --> 02:09:38,537
Exploited by another species.

2583
02:09:38,904 --> 02:09:44,009
So going back
to this kind of global message,

2584
02:09:44,343 --> 02:09:46,879
you want nations
to retain their identities,

2585
02:09:47,246 --> 02:09:51,183
but you also want them at the same time
to come together

2586
02:09:51,550 --> 02:09:54,720
and to work synergistically.

2587
02:09:55,020 --> 02:09:57,256
So you basically want.

2588
02:09:57,256 --> 02:10:01,360
Something like a global system but this.

2589
02:10:01,727 --> 02:10:06,031
There has to be the optimal balance between centralization and decentralization.

2590
02:10:07,566 --> 02:10:10,068
Neither approach will.

2591
02:10:10,068 --> 02:10:11,236
Be good on its own.

2592
02:10:11,236 --> 02:10:13,272
There needs to be this balance.

2593
02:10:14,439 --> 02:10:19,411
So as long as the biosphere
is creating a growing variety

2594
02:10:19,411 --> 02:10:20,612
of complex adaptive systems,

2595
02:10:20,612 --> 02:10:23,782
some of those winter activities,
higher level, complex adaptive systems,

2596
02:10:24,049 --> 02:10:28,320
which will come together to form
even larger ones, this process continues.

2597
02:10:28,987 --> 02:10:30,055
At higher scales.

2598
02:10:30,055 --> 02:10:32,257
So I didn't go into this

2599
02:10:33,292 --> 02:10:36,461
kind of a picture that shows a brain

2600
02:10:36,461 --> 02:10:39,598
and then the planet,
and it's like information networks. But.

2601
02:10:40,432 --> 02:10:43,735
I do I hope that you talk about

2602
02:10:43,735 --> 02:10:46,772
Gaia and Global Brain will become

2603
02:10:46,772 --> 02:10:48,907
will be taken
as seriously as it should be.

2604
02:10:49,608 --> 02:10:50,475
They really only.

2605
02:10:50,475 --> 02:10:51,276
Weren't taken seriously

2606
02:10:51,276 --> 02:10:55,214
because they were mystical notions
associated with this word, Gaia.

2607
02:10:55,647 --> 02:10:56,315
Which wasn't. Even.

2608
02:10:56,315 --> 02:10:59,585
James Lovelock's fault.

2609
02:10:59,585 --> 02:11:03,555
He actually the name Gaia came
from his neighbor, who is actually.

2610
02:11:03,555 --> 02:11:05,824
The author of Lord of the Flies.

2611
02:11:05,824 --> 02:11:06,625
William Golding.

2612
02:11:06,625 --> 02:11:11,730
So blame him for the
for the flowery metaphor with Gaia.

2613
02:11:13,165 --> 02:11:15,901
But yeah,
the the biosphere is a cybernetic

2614
02:11:16,301 --> 02:11:19,171
organism, and we are forming something
like the global brain

2615
02:11:19,771 --> 02:11:23,709
and a self-replicating biosphere

2616
02:11:23,709 --> 02:11:25,978
is essentially the next step.

2617
02:11:25,978 --> 02:11:30,215
And when we are trying to care form
planets like Mars

2618
02:11:30,349 --> 02:11:33,185
that can be seen as the biosphere
replicating.

2619
02:11:35,053 --> 02:11:37,055
For humans to at.

2620
02:11:37,055 --> 02:11:39,391
This point in our stage of development.

2621
02:11:39,925 --> 02:11:40,626
We would have to.

2622
02:11:40,626 --> 02:11:45,364
Kind of convert Mars to like something
like a biosphere to have like oxygen.

2623
02:11:45,364 --> 02:11:48,867
And so you can see how it's replication
with variation,

2624
02:11:49,501 --> 02:11:50,869
you get the same sort of thing.

2625
02:11:50,869 --> 02:11:54,172
But because it's a different planet,
there's going to be variation.

2626
02:11:54,172 --> 02:11:55,474
It's not going to be exactly the same,

2627
02:11:55,474 --> 02:11:57,976
but that's how the evolutionary process
continues.

2628
02:11:58,644 --> 02:11:59,811
I should show this earlier.

2629
02:11:59,811 --> 02:12:02,514
This is just showing how like eukaryotic.

2630
02:12:03,015 --> 02:12:03,515
Single celled.

2631
02:12:03,515 --> 02:12:07,219
Organisms like amoebas will come together
to form communities like a slime.

2632
02:12:07,219 --> 02:12:08,921
Mold. These

2633
02:12:10,055 --> 02:12:12,257
multicellular organisms.

2634
02:12:12,257 --> 02:12:14,293
Come together to form colonies.

2635
02:12:14,293 --> 02:12:19,231
You see this and colony ants
actually really do form a super organism.

2636
02:12:19,231 --> 02:12:20,365
You can see here.

2637
02:12:20,365 --> 02:12:21,967
They actually build a bridge.

2638
02:12:21,967 --> 02:12:26,571
Out of their bodies so that some ants can
like climb across that bridge.

2639
02:12:26,571 --> 02:12:31,176
So it really makes sense to call it
a super organism, or at least like a

2640
02:12:31,410 --> 02:12:34,780
a super adaptive system or like a meta

2641
02:12:36,214 --> 02:12:37,115
system,

2642
02:12:38,050 --> 02:12:41,753
because without it, we can't make sense
of this collective behavior that's.

2643
02:12:41,753 --> 02:12:42,754
Functional.

2644
02:12:43,188 --> 02:12:47,025
Of course, human civilization,
we again see this hierarchy now.

2645
02:12:47,025 --> 02:12:49,194
It makes more. Sense.

2646
02:12:49,227 --> 02:12:51,930
We see that
these evolutionary transitions.

2647
02:12:51,930 --> 02:12:54,132
Oh, yeah, these are called
evolutionary transitions.

2648
02:12:54,633 --> 02:12:57,436
Sometimes I use the name system
transition because.

2649
02:12:59,471 --> 02:12:59,871
If we were.

2650
02:12:59,871 --> 02:13:02,708
Talking about the brain,
I would also talk about like

2651
02:13:03,709 --> 02:13:06,211
the emergence of a prefrontal cortex,
which is like.

2652
02:13:06,578 --> 02:13:08,814
A high level controller.

2653
02:13:08,814 --> 02:13:11,450
That's
also like a med assistant transition

2654
02:13:11,717 --> 02:13:14,052
so that a system
transitions are a. Little.

2655
02:13:14,553 --> 02:13:18,457
Extend this where it's not talking
necessarily about evolutionary

2656
02:13:18,857 --> 02:13:23,161
transitions, but these other transitions
where systems.

2657
02:13:24,329 --> 02:13:24,896
Start.

2658
02:13:24,896 --> 02:13:26,932
To model themselves.

2659
02:13:26,932 --> 02:13:27,566
So here we.

2660
02:13:27,566 --> 02:13:30,402
See how.

2661
02:13:31,169 --> 02:13:33,271
Evolution has created these.

2662
02:13:33,705 --> 02:13:36,174
Different memory.

2663
02:13:36,174 --> 02:13:37,209
Systems, these knowledge.

2664
02:13:37,209 --> 02:13:40,512
Repositories so it's that process.

2665
02:13:40,512 --> 02:13:42,514
Of recursive self-organization.

2666
02:13:43,682 --> 02:13:45,217
That creates new. Memory systems.

2667
02:13:45,217 --> 02:13:46,818
When you get go from single

2668
02:13:46,818 --> 02:13:49,821
celled life to multicellular life
to life with brains,

2669
02:13:51,223 --> 02:13:55,927
it's these are in revolutions
in information storage machinery.

2670
02:13:56,528 --> 02:13:59,965
So you can see how the information
the biosphere gets accumulated

2671
02:14:00,866 --> 02:14:03,869
through an evolutionary process.

2672
02:14:04,836 --> 02:14:07,472
These are the final points.

2673
02:14:09,007 --> 02:14:11,009
Yeah. So knowledge is power.

2674
02:14:11,009 --> 02:14:13,378
It's not just the hollow buzz
phrase of the digital age.

2675
02:14:13,378 --> 02:14:15,213
It's showing the most fundamental. Way.

2676
02:14:15,213 --> 02:14:15,781
Uncertainty.

2677
02:14:15,781 --> 02:14:18,116
Reducing information
is life's first and last weapon in.

2678
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:20,252
Ongoing war with disorder.

2679
02:14:20,252 --> 02:14:23,221
Without knowledge, life cannot exist
for more than a moment, much less

2680
02:14:23,221 --> 02:14:25,490
colonize the galaxy and beyond.

2681
02:14:25,490 --> 02:14:27,192
It suggests that setting out on the path
toward

2682
02:14:27,192 --> 02:14:28,960
cosmic superiority is not a choice

2683
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:32,397
that intelligent agents like Homosapiens
make upon careful reflection.

2684
02:14:32,898 --> 02:14:35,033
Nor is it
just some quirky ambition we stumbled.

2685
02:14:35,033 --> 02:14:35,834
Onto by chance.

2686
02:14:36,902 --> 02:14:37,202
This is the

2687
02:14:37,202 --> 02:14:41,173
main point humanity's collective desire
to transcend mortality.

2688
02:14:41,673 --> 02:14:43,442
And. Expand outward into space.

2689
02:14:43,442 --> 02:14:47,913
So apparently our current scientific
and technological endeavors, Space X,

2690
02:14:49,047 --> 02:14:51,049
this doesn't emerge as an accident.

2691
02:14:51,049 --> 02:14:54,319
This is an inevitable consequence
of the fact that continual knowledge

2692
02:14:54,319 --> 02:14:57,656
acquisition is a fundamental
biological imperative.

2693
02:14:58,223 --> 02:15:02,828
If life wants to persist and stay far
from equilibrium, at some point

2694
02:15:02,828 --> 02:15:07,332
it has to get off the planet
because the sun is going to die.

2695
02:15:07,833 --> 02:15:11,403
And it's these sorts of problems,
these existential.

2696
02:15:11,403 --> 02:15:13,338
Problems which.

2697
02:15:13,338 --> 02:15:15,941
Create progress
because it's our awareness of this.

2698
02:15:15,941 --> 02:15:19,978
Problem which forces us. To.

2699
02:15:21,580 --> 02:15:22,114
Search.

2700
02:15:22,114 --> 02:15:26,017
That configuration space
for the solutions that solve the problem.

2701
02:15:26,485 --> 02:15:27,853
So as natural selection plants

2702
02:15:27,853 --> 02:15:31,056
information from the inanimate world
into life, nature begins modeling itself

2703
02:15:31,056 --> 02:15:34,126
and coding its own structure
and the universe begins to wake up.

2704
02:15:34,759 --> 02:15:36,128
Where the cosmos come alive.

2705
02:15:36,128 --> 02:15:37,596
Not metaphorically, but literally.

2706
02:15:38,964 --> 02:15:40,699
This is Ray Kurzweil.

2707
02:15:40,699 --> 02:15:41,600
Image. From his book.

2708
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:45,637
This clarity is near
you can see that he sees this.

2709
02:15:45,637 --> 02:15:48,540
He calls this the the destiny.

2710
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:49,407
Of of.

2711
02:15:49,407 --> 02:15:50,308
Life in the universe.

2712
02:15:50,308 --> 02:15:52,878
And he's not shy about using that word.

2713
02:15:52,878 --> 02:15:55,881
Again, it's not determined
in the strict sense of replace

2714
02:15:55,881 --> 02:15:59,818
this kind of a statistical determinism
that creates these

2715
02:16:00,986 --> 02:16:03,755
series of attractors and

2716
02:16:05,857 --> 02:16:08,326
you've seen famous people.

2717
02:16:08,627 --> 02:16:12,931
So some people see that idea and
they'll have been reading Brian Greene

2718
02:16:12,931 --> 02:16:16,701
and listening to all these reductionist
think that's not a scientific view.

2719
02:16:17,102 --> 02:16:18,069
Well.

2720
02:16:18,370 --> 02:16:19,504
That's not true.

2721
02:16:19,504 --> 02:16:23,475
And I hope to see more of these people
speaking out about it.

2722
02:16:23,475 --> 02:16:27,512
So Christof Koch, can Confessions
of a Romantic Reductionist says

2723
02:16:27,512 --> 02:16:30,582
the rise of sentient life within Time's
Wide Circuit was inevitable.

2724
02:16:31,683 --> 02:16:34,052
Kierkegaard,
Descartes in really came up with this.

2725
02:16:34,052 --> 02:16:35,187
Don't have time to talk about him.

2726
02:16:35,187 --> 02:16:37,322
French philosopher and Jesuit
you should look into

2727
02:16:37,956 --> 02:16:40,425
is correct in his view
that the islands within the universe,

2728
02:16:40,425 --> 02:16:42,394
if not the whole cosmos, are evolving.

2729
02:16:42,394 --> 02:16:43,895
Toward ever greater.

2730
02:16:43,895 --> 02:16:45,931
Complexity and self-knowledge.

2731
02:16:45,931 --> 02:16:49,801
To be clear, he's not saying that Earth
had to bear life, that, you know,

2732
02:16:51,403 --> 02:16:53,638
primates
had to walk the African grasslands

2733
02:16:54,406 --> 02:16:57,576
but he says, I do believe that the laws
of physics overwhelmingly favored

2734
02:16:57,576 --> 02:16:59,110
the emergence of consciousness.

2735
02:16:59,110 --> 02:17:01,413
The universe is a. Work in progress.

2736
02:17:01,713 --> 02:17:04,649
Such a belief evokes
Jeremiah I don't know

2737
02:17:05,684 --> 02:17:06,117
from any.

2738
02:17:06,117 --> 02:17:09,120
Biologists and fosters,
but the evidence from cosmology,

2739
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:11,256
biology and history is compelling.

2740
02:17:12,991 --> 02:17:15,160
So there's some

2741
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:17,295
advanced blurbs for this book.

2742
02:17:17,562 --> 02:17:18,630
If you want to preorder it.

2743
02:17:19,698 --> 02:17:21,967
It comes out in June.

2744
02:17:21,967 --> 02:17:23,702
But every order.

2745
02:17:23,702 --> 02:17:27,606
That I get from now until then will count
towards my first week sales totals

2746
02:17:27,639 --> 02:17:29,674
that will help me get on sellers list.

2747
02:17:29,674 --> 02:17:32,310
If you want to preorder now
and you email. Me.

2748
02:17:32,777 --> 02:17:34,312
I will send you a copy.

2749
02:17:34,312 --> 02:17:35,280
Soon.

2750
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:37,916
Of this novel
I also wrote called Rachel Mega.

2751
02:17:38,116 --> 02:17:40,552
I was pretty busy in the last five years.

2752
02:17:41,286 --> 02:17:41,853
Hey, I was I.

2753
02:17:41,853 --> 02:17:44,422
Went into a cave for like four
or five years, but.

2754
02:17:44,723 --> 02:17:46,091
This is.

2755
02:17:46,091 --> 02:17:49,294
A vehicle for the science and philosophy
in the book, kind of like an anti

2756
02:17:49,828 --> 02:17:52,430
Ayn Rand at this shrug maybe

2757
02:17:52,430 --> 02:17:56,468
the opposite philosophy
and the road to Omega

2758
02:17:56,468 --> 02:17:59,871
sets that kind of turns this phosphor
into a kind of an effort to.

2759
02:18:01,740 --> 02:18:04,142
Save the world with science.

2760
02:18:04,142 --> 02:18:06,244
Epistemology and blockchain technology.

2761
02:18:07,345 --> 02:18:08,380
Blockchains are part of

2762
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:11,683
this self-organization process,
and that's long talk.

2763
02:18:11,683 --> 02:18:13,251
I never given.

2764
02:18:13,318 --> 02:18:14,019
That's the longest.

2765
02:18:14,019 --> 02:18:16,921
I ever talked at one time,
probably my wife will probably say,

2766
02:18:16,955 --> 02:18:17,989
Yeah, it's not true.

2767
02:18:17,989 --> 02:18:20,292
But I'm tired, so let's.

2768
02:18:20,859 --> 02:18:22,160
Open it up to questions.

2769
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:24,329
And thank you for your immense patience.

2770
02:18:25,430 --> 02:18:28,533
It's awesome to hear and think about it.

2771
02:18:29,167 --> 02:18:31,803
So there are two questions in the chat.

2772
02:18:31,803 --> 02:18:33,972
First, is from Dean.

2773
02:18:33,972 --> 02:18:37,776
Dean asks, How would we explain caring

2774
02:18:38,076 --> 02:18:40,912
through a lens of free will or no free
will?

2775
02:18:41,279 --> 02:18:42,013
Would free will.

2776
02:18:42,013 --> 02:18:45,784
Deniers say there is no caring
when it appears that agents can or do

2777
02:18:45,784 --> 02:18:47,252
fully care?

2778
02:18:48,353 --> 02:18:50,989
Yeah, so great question.

2779
02:18:50,989 --> 02:18:53,958
Unfortunately,
I don't have much to say without

2780
02:18:54,726 --> 02:18:57,662
saying the things
that I was going to bring up in the next.

2781
02:18:57,962 --> 02:19:00,398
Talk, really. Explaining
what free will is.

2782
02:19:00,732 --> 02:19:04,903
I guess I should just say right now
kind of a brief explanation of what

2783
02:19:04,903 --> 02:19:06,204
I mean by free will.

2784
02:19:06,204 --> 02:19:10,075
So I hope I've made the
argument that agency emerges.

2785
02:19:11,176 --> 02:19:14,479
In. Adaptive systems that start off.

2786
02:19:14,479 --> 02:19:18,083
This biological organisms and to.

2787
02:19:18,083 --> 02:19:18,583
The person.

2788
02:19:18,583 --> 02:19:19,584
Self driving.

2789
02:19:19,584 --> 02:19:22,520
Car thing,
I just mention that real quick.

2790
02:19:22,821 --> 02:19:25,290
I don't think they're agents,
but I do think

2791
02:19:26,591 --> 02:19:29,461
it's possible to create systems
with agency

2792
02:19:30,362 --> 02:19:33,098
for reasons that I haven't gone into

2793
02:19:35,333 --> 02:19:36,434
it seems important

2794
02:19:36,434 --> 02:19:39,738
that these systems
have a certain type of architecture.

2795
02:19:39,738 --> 02:19:42,974
So not like standard computers have.

2796
02:19:42,974 --> 02:19:43,208
I know.

2797
02:19:43,208 --> 02:19:44,542
I mean, architecture

2798
02:19:44,542 --> 02:19:48,646
and it's not distributed
or integrated in the way the brain is.

2799
02:19:49,147 --> 02:19:52,951
So it's not integrating much information
so these systems

2800
02:19:52,951 --> 02:19:55,920
won't have causal power,
they won't be agents.

2801
02:19:57,455 --> 02:19:59,290
So neuromorphic.

2802
02:19:59,290 --> 02:20:01,526
Hardware has been.

2803
02:20:01,526 --> 02:20:04,162
A. Lot of people think
that's going to allow machines

2804
02:20:04,162 --> 02:20:07,031
that can think
and perhaps even be conscious.

2805
02:20:07,899 --> 02:20:09,801
I think maybe that's the way to go.

2806
02:20:10,802 --> 02:20:12,337
It's probably a lot more complicated
than that.

2807
02:20:12,337 --> 02:20:14,839
It's a step in the right direction.

2808
02:20:14,839 --> 02:20:16,307
So agency is real.

2809
02:20:16,307 --> 02:20:19,978
It's due to information gain
causal power in a system.

2810
02:20:20,278 --> 02:20:21,780
And it starts

2811
02:20:22,881 --> 02:20:25,150
it starts steering the system.

2812
02:20:25,150 --> 02:20:29,487
So you'll see like a bacterium performing
Teemo Texas.

2813
02:20:29,988 --> 02:20:31,022
But it doesn't.

2814
02:20:31,022 --> 02:20:33,258
Make sense to say
that the bacterium has free

2815
02:20:33,258 --> 02:20:35,960
will when it's going this way
and that just because it's

2816
02:20:36,361 --> 02:20:38,596
not predictable in the way in in an IT
system is.

2817
02:20:39,197 --> 02:20:39,964
So I would say that they.

2818
02:20:39,964 --> 02:20:42,133
Have agency,
but they don't have free will.

2819
02:20:42,400 --> 02:20:46,037
What free will is
and this is not my idea.

2820
02:20:46,070 --> 02:20:48,072
Other people have kind of been talking
in this way.

2821
02:20:48,072 --> 02:20:49,441
Kevin Mitchell.

2822
02:20:49,607 --> 02:20:52,177
Has a book. Neuro Geneticists.

2823
02:20:52,177 --> 02:20:55,513
He's coming out with a book
called Agents, which is all about agency

2824
02:20:55,914 --> 02:20:58,249
and free will. But the idea is that

2825
02:20:59,317 --> 02:21:01,352
we are agents with causal power.

2826
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:03,855
But we're sort of

2827
02:21:05,957 --> 02:21:08,660
where our.

2828
02:21:08,660 --> 02:21:11,496
Responses like are basically.

2829
02:21:11,830 --> 02:21:14,899
Programed responses that are a.

2830
02:21:14,899 --> 02:21:18,002
Response is that. Occur.

2831
02:21:18,002 --> 02:21:22,073
Automatically
that are informed by this information

2832
02:21:22,073 --> 02:21:24,843
that's been built up through evolution
and adaptive learning.

2833
02:21:25,376 --> 02:21:27,479
So a lot of the time
we go through the day

2834
02:21:27,479 --> 02:21:30,748
and we're not really thinking
about things like driving

2835
02:21:30,748 --> 02:21:34,219
or like waking up
and like going to the fridge.

2836
02:21:34,219 --> 02:21:35,653
We're not putting conscious

2837
02:21:35,653 --> 02:21:38,189
thought into that,
so that wouldn't seem to be free.

2838
02:21:38,289 --> 02:21:39,123
Well.

2839
02:21:39,891 --> 02:21:42,360
To me you're kind of acting on autopilot.

2840
02:21:42,727 --> 02:21:45,063
So what free will is, is.

2841
02:21:45,063 --> 02:21:46,865
A higher level of control.

2842
02:21:46,865 --> 02:21:48,666
That emerges with something like a.

2843
02:21:48,666 --> 02:21:51,402
Prefrontal cortex
and a global. Workspace?

2844
02:21:51,736 --> 02:21:54,739
Basically, free will. Allow

2845
02:21:54,739 --> 02:21:58,810
a prefrontal cortex
allows an agent to override.

2846
02:21:58,943 --> 02:22:02,180
Its instinctive and automatic behaviors.

2847
02:22:03,681 --> 02:22:06,217
And so free will is something that

2848
02:22:07,285 --> 02:22:09,420
that we have, but only if.

2849
02:22:09,420 --> 02:22:12,490
We're exercising
this higher level of control.

2850
02:22:12,490 --> 02:22:15,493
It's associated with cognitive control
or executive control.

2851
02:22:15,827 --> 02:22:17,428
Effortful control.

2852
02:22:17,428 --> 02:22:20,131
And basically.

2853
02:22:20,732 --> 02:22:21,366
If you have.

2854
02:22:21,366 --> 02:22:23,535
A healthy functioning prefrontal cortex,

2855
02:22:25,370 --> 02:22:27,171
you're going to basically

2856
02:22:27,171 --> 02:22:29,240
the conscious mind is monitoring

2857
02:22:30,341 --> 02:22:32,644
consciousness as a monitor.

2858
02:22:32,644 --> 02:22:36,781
So it's it's monitoring your behaviors.

2859
02:22:36,781 --> 02:22:37,815
And if it.

2860
02:22:38,249 --> 02:22:40,351
Detects that there's suboptimal behavior

2861
02:22:40,351 --> 02:22:43,421
for whatever reason, like it's
just automatic kind of instinctual.

2862
02:22:43,688 --> 02:22:48,393
Let's say someone says something
that makes us angry and we respond.

2863
02:22:48,393 --> 02:22:50,194
Immediately with like pushing them.

2864
02:22:50,194 --> 02:22:53,631
Or something that's not a wise move.

2865
02:22:53,631 --> 02:22:56,301
And that may be may happen
when we're fearful

2866
02:22:56,834 --> 02:22:59,704
because of the amygdala response
and we just have

2867
02:22:59,704 --> 02:23:02,974
this automatic behavior.

2868
02:23:02,974 --> 02:23:04,475
But free will would.

2869
02:23:04,475 --> 02:23:09,414
Be when the conscious mind overrides
that process.

2870
02:23:09,781 --> 02:23:11,449
And the bit.

2871
02:23:11,449 --> 02:23:12,717
Actually the free will studies

2872
02:23:12,717 --> 02:23:16,721
that everybody cites
as saying that we don't have free will.

2873
02:23:17,288 --> 02:23:21,492
He actually never said that he said free
will is in this veto power.

2874
02:23:21,826 --> 02:23:23,428
Like maybe some of our voluntary.

2875
02:23:23,428 --> 02:23:25,830
Movements
occur. Without conscious. Thought.

2876
02:23:26,998 --> 02:23:27,565
But it's

2877
02:23:27,565 --> 02:23:30,168
our ability to override those movements.

2878
02:23:31,069 --> 02:23:33,771
That is the source. Of free will.

2879
02:23:33,771 --> 02:23:35,306
But there is more problems with that.

2880
02:23:35,306 --> 02:23:37,575
Actually. The studies have.

2881
02:23:38,509 --> 02:23:41,779
Collected a study showing that basically.

2882
02:23:44,749 --> 02:23:46,918
That free will.

2883
02:23:48,319 --> 02:23:50,521
Readiness potential,
which is like a spike

2884
02:23:50,521 --> 02:23:53,992
in electrical activity that occurs
before you do this voluntary movement.

2885
02:23:53,992 --> 02:23:56,394
This movement, we think is voluntary.

2886
02:23:56,394 --> 02:23:59,397
And everyone thought that this meant
that you're not really making

2887
02:23:59,397 --> 02:24:00,331
a conscious decision

2888
02:24:00,331 --> 02:24:04,869
that you could see this spike in brain
activity earlier than the person thought.

2889
02:24:04,869 --> 02:24:07,305
They made a voluntary,
voluntary decision.

2890
02:24:08,339 --> 02:24:08,773
But a new.

2891
02:24:08,773 --> 02:24:12,543
Study has shown that that's only the case
when we're making arbitrary decisions.

2892
02:24:12,944 --> 02:24:13,878
And when they had.

2893
02:24:13,878 --> 02:24:18,416
People making a decision about when
when to donate a large amount of money

2894
02:24:18,416 --> 02:24:22,320
to a charity, you actually saw this
readiness potential disappear.

2895
02:24:23,021 --> 02:24:25,757
And so it seems like deliberate thinking,

2896
02:24:25,923 --> 02:24:28,326
which is still the secretary
or frontal cortex.

2897
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:32,196
And there's this distinction
between access consciousness

2898
02:24:32,196 --> 02:24:35,199
and phenomenal consciousness
that I didn't go into that

2899
02:24:35,199 --> 02:24:38,436
I would in the next talk
that Adam Safra on an integrated world

2900
02:24:38,436 --> 02:24:39,804
model in theory really gets at.

2901
02:24:41,072 --> 02:24:43,841
But the idea
is that the prefrontal cortex does allow.

2902
02:24:44,008 --> 02:24:46,644
Us to override. Automatic behaviors and.

2903
02:24:46,878 --> 02:24:51,349
That is a sort of freedom that we have.

2904
02:24:51,349 --> 02:24:53,685
And we also lose it

2905
02:24:53,685 --> 02:24:55,086
in cases of schizophrenia.

2906
02:24:55,086 --> 02:24:56,654
You see impaired.

2907
02:24:56,854 --> 02:24:57,355
Prefrontal.

2908
02:24:57,355 --> 02:24:59,157
Cortex activity and drug addicts.

2909
02:24:59,157 --> 02:24:59,791
You see impaired.

2910
02:24:59,791 --> 02:25:02,293
Activity in drive drug. Addicts.

2911
02:25:02,293 --> 02:25:06,330
You see they do repetitive behavior
even when they know that it's.

2912
02:25:07,598 --> 02:25:10,735
Not. Beneficial to them,
they will still engage in that.

2913
02:25:10,735 --> 02:25:13,671
So they're kind of stuck in this loop
for this unhealthy.

2914
02:25:13,671 --> 02:25:14,872
Attractor

2915
02:25:15,273 --> 02:25:16,340
with. Schizophrenia.

2916
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:18,843
There's patients that. Report being.

2917
02:25:18,843 --> 02:25:22,380
Pushed around by forces
that are beyond their control.

2918
02:25:23,581 --> 02:25:26,617
I think that's
because when the prefrontal cortex is

2919
02:25:27,652 --> 02:25:30,455
basically activated.

2920
02:25:31,022 --> 02:25:31,389
People.

2921
02:25:31,389 --> 02:25:35,526
Lose this sense, this ability
to override their automatic behaviors.

2922
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:39,163
And I think that's what those people are
experiencing is sort of

2923
02:25:39,163 --> 02:25:42,100
loss of this higher level agency
that we've called free.

2924
02:25:42,200 --> 02:25:42,467
Will.

2925
02:25:44,736 --> 02:25:45,737
Another interesting

2926
02:25:45,737 --> 02:25:48,072
just a final interesting thing
to mention about that.

2927
02:25:48,873 --> 02:25:50,308
Is Cotard's.

2928
02:25:50,308 --> 02:25:51,075
Syndrome.

2929
02:25:51,075 --> 02:25:54,512
Cotard's delusion is this delusion
where people think they're dead,

2930
02:25:55,079 --> 02:25:57,782
they think they're like ghost
or just not alive.

2931
02:25:57,782 --> 02:25:58,382
It's really weird.

2932
02:25:58,382 --> 02:26:01,886
A lot of people die from starvation
because they think they don't have to eat

2933
02:26:01,886 --> 02:26:04,021
because they think they're already dead.

2934
02:26:04,021 --> 02:26:06,691
You actually see from narrow
imaging studies, they've.

2935
02:26:06,691 --> 02:26:07,558
Showed

2936
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:09,494
impaired.

2937
02:26:09,494 --> 02:26:11,195
Activity in the prefrontal cortex.

2938
02:26:11,195 --> 02:26:13,898
So maybe these people
who think they're dead.

2939
02:26:14,599 --> 02:26:18,970
Have lost this high level. Agency
and they feel like they're ghosts or.

2940
02:26:18,970 --> 02:26:19,804
Something.

2941
02:26:20,805 --> 02:26:22,974
As far as caring

2942
02:26:24,375 --> 02:26:26,043
so. Caring

2943
02:26:26,043 --> 02:26:30,047
is a part of like emerged
through evolution because. You.

2944
02:26:30,047 --> 02:26:33,151
Do have this benefit
to cooperating with each other.

2945
02:26:33,551 --> 02:26:35,853
Is self-organization process
that we talked about.

2946
02:26:35,853 --> 02:26:39,557
That happens naturally
because basically you find

2947
02:26:39,557 --> 02:26:42,660
that when you work together,
you minimize conflicts and

2948
02:26:45,196 --> 02:26:47,165
align it, you align interests.

2949
02:26:47,165 --> 02:26:50,835
And so caring, altruism, empathy,

2950
02:26:50,835 --> 02:26:53,437
all of those things are as natural

2951
02:26:54,639 --> 02:26:56,507
and as Darwinian as anything else.

2952
02:26:56,507 --> 02:26:58,643
But you have. To.

2953
02:26:59,677 --> 02:27:01,679
Add on to evolutionary theory.

2954
02:27:01,679 --> 02:27:05,183
All of this stuff about self-organization
and cooperative evolution.

2955
02:27:06,951 --> 02:27:08,019
As. Far as you see.

2956
02:27:08,019 --> 02:27:10,321
He said something about why people.

2957
02:27:11,489 --> 02:27:14,625
Who don't believe in free will, I.

2958
02:27:14,625 --> 02:27:16,360
Forget the exact point about.

2959
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:18,396
The caring was that.

2960
02:27:18,396 --> 02:27:22,233
When when it appears that agents can

2961
02:27:22,233 --> 02:27:24,101
or do fully care.

2962
02:27:25,236 --> 02:27:26,304
Which I was.

2963
02:27:26,304 --> 02:27:28,272
What was the first part of it?

2964
02:27:29,173 --> 02:27:32,777
How would you explain caring through
a lens of free will or no free will?

2965
02:27:32,777 --> 02:27:36,047
Would free will deniers
say there is no caring when it appears

2966
02:27:36,047 --> 02:27:39,283
that agents can or do fully care?

2967
02:27:39,283 --> 02:27:42,220
Yeah, no, it's it flies in the face of

2968
02:27:43,421 --> 02:27:45,122
our everyday experience.

2969
02:27:45,122 --> 02:27:50,461
So like, yeah, I guess the.

2970
02:27:50,928 --> 02:27:54,031
The amount of contradictions
and like logic that doesn't make sense

2971
02:27:54,031 --> 02:27:57,201
when you go down that path of there
being no free will or agency,

2972
02:27:58,736 --> 02:28:02,406
you just,
you just get into absurd territory.

2973
02:28:02,406 --> 02:28:07,411
It's, I think when we look back, it's
kind of quaint that for so long

2974
02:28:07,411 --> 02:28:10,414
that we thought that everything
was determined in the strict sense.

2975
02:28:10,882 --> 02:28:13,651
And it's really a big issue
because these people who believe

2976
02:28:13,651 --> 02:28:15,853
that if they believe it,
if they take it to heart,

2977
02:28:17,455 --> 02:28:20,424
they're experiencing cognitive dissonance
at every moment,

2978
02:28:20,625 --> 02:28:24,061
you know, and the people
who argue against the agency,

2979
02:28:24,562 --> 02:28:28,666
they talk about religious people
having to compartmentalize, to deal with.

2980
02:28:29,333 --> 02:28:30,001
The real world.

2981
02:28:30,001 --> 02:28:32,036
But anybody who believes
that we don't have

2982
02:28:32,036 --> 02:28:34,705
agency has a compartment
you eyes in the same way.

2983
02:28:35,806 --> 02:28:38,409
Funny little conversation between
Sam Harris and his.

2984
02:28:39,110 --> 02:28:44,715
Wife Anika Harris,
who wrote a book called Conscious.

2985
02:28:44,715 --> 02:28:46,951
That is a great, accessible book.

2986
02:28:46,951 --> 02:28:48,386
But it leaves out.

2987
02:28:48,386 --> 02:28:52,323
Like everything that I've discussed
and that I would discuss about like

2988
02:28:52,890 --> 02:28:56,160
the Bayesian brain
hypothesis, global workspace

2989
02:28:56,160 --> 02:28:59,030
theory that's really going to integrate
information theory in any depth.

2990
02:28:59,397 --> 02:29:01,732
So like all of the.

2991
02:29:01,732 --> 02:29:05,102
Things that they're missing
that do explain, a lot of this.

2992
02:29:05,102 --> 02:29:05,903
Stuff.

2993
02:29:06,270 --> 02:29:08,205
Can be found in like modern neuroscience.

2994
02:29:08,205 --> 02:29:10,675
So we are making a lot of progress.

2995
02:29:10,675 --> 02:29:11,642
Towards.

2996
02:29:11,876 --> 02:29:14,278
Understanding the hard problem
of consciousness.

2997
02:29:14,278 --> 02:29:17,148
So subjective experience,
but also for your own agency.

2998
02:29:18,182 --> 02:29:18,549
It's funny.

2999
02:29:18,549 --> 02:29:20,651
Because they're having
this conversation in the podcast.

3000
02:29:21,185 --> 02:29:26,057
And they're discussing
whether since a belief in No Free Will.

3001
02:29:26,057 --> 02:29:28,592
As mentioned,
that New York Times. Article.

3002
02:29:28,592 --> 02:29:31,262
I think 2011 showed that

3003
02:29:31,262 --> 02:29:34,865
they have less moral behavior
and it can cause depression.

3004
02:29:35,166 --> 02:29:37,301
They're discussing
whether they should tell their daughter

3005
02:29:37,301 --> 02:29:40,037
about free will or not,
that she doesn't have any free will

3006
02:29:40,504 --> 02:29:42,373
the discussion is like,
should we tell our daughter

3007
02:29:42,373 --> 02:29:44,241
that she doesn't have free will?

3008
02:29:44,241 --> 02:29:45,910
But the actual. Discussion.

3009
02:29:47,111 --> 02:29:47,845
Implies that they.

3010
02:29:47,845 --> 02:29:50,414
Believe that they have some choice
whether to tell her or not

3011
02:29:50,414 --> 02:29:52,984
they're having a discussion
about whether they should do this or not.

3012
02:29:52,984 --> 02:29:56,520
So there's a contradiction
in their conversation

3013
02:29:57,121 --> 02:29:58,456
that contradicts what they believe.

3014
02:29:58,456 --> 02:30:02,693
What's interesting is that if they do
tell her that she has no free will.

3015
02:30:02,893 --> 02:30:06,731
And she believes it, she's
actually going to have negative mental.

3016
02:30:06,731 --> 02:30:08,966
Effects like it. Will.

3017
02:30:08,966 --> 02:30:10,668
You know, be. Harmful.

3018
02:30:10,668 --> 02:30:12,670
Assuming that she really believes it.

3019
02:30:12,670 --> 02:30:14,872
I don't know if it has that
in everyone, but.

3020
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:18,075
You do. See studies that show that.

3021
02:30:18,075 --> 02:30:22,847
So if we do have free will, it's
a very bad.

3022
02:30:22,847 --> 02:30:24,949
Thing to be. Telling people.

3023
02:30:26,417 --> 02:30:27,952
And the last thing I'll say about that.

3024
02:30:27,952 --> 02:30:32,990
Is well, it's it's interesting
because if she's familiar with.

3025
02:30:32,990 --> 02:30:35,426
Epistemology
and they tell her that she doesn't have.

3026
02:30:35,426 --> 02:30:37,628
Free will, but she goes, OK.

3027
02:30:37,928 --> 02:30:40,264
That's based on a model
that has uncertainty

3028
02:30:40,264 --> 02:30:42,500
and that model may be disproved.

3029
02:30:42,500 --> 02:30:44,602
Then she might not.

3030
02:30:44,602 --> 02:30:46,237
Have the negative effects of free will.

3031
02:30:46,237 --> 02:30:50,441
So I think everyone should practice
being a good Bayesian and understand

3032
02:30:50,441 --> 02:30:53,677
that our models, our theories,
even the one that I just talked about,

3033
02:30:54,512 --> 02:30:58,883
will have errors and will be shown
to be wrong and if reductionist

3034
02:30:58,883 --> 02:31:02,153
do that, they won't call free
will belief in free will.

3035
02:31:02,153 --> 02:31:02,820
Like.

3036
02:31:02,987 --> 02:31:07,291
Comparing them to horoscopes, which is
just, I think, a horrible statement and.

3037
02:31:08,192 --> 02:31:08,826
Kind of funny.

3038
02:31:08,826 --> 02:31:11,328
That physicists don't like it
when like neuroscientists.

3039
02:31:11,328 --> 02:31:14,365
Start and biologists
start talking about physics.

3040
02:31:14,865 --> 02:31:15,466
It's kind of.

3041
02:31:15,466 --> 02:31:19,003
Strange that physicists are so sure
that we don't have free will

3042
02:31:19,003 --> 02:31:23,441
when they're not familiar at all
with the neuroscience behind agency and.

3043
02:31:23,441 --> 02:31:23,841
Freewill.

3044
02:31:25,543 --> 02:31:27,311
So would

3045
02:31:27,311 --> 02:31:30,448
you like
me to just read a comment in the chat?

3046
02:31:30,448 --> 02:31:32,850
Otherwise,
I think we can kind of come to a close.

3047
02:31:34,552 --> 02:31:35,453
If there's anything.

3048
02:31:35,453 --> 02:31:37,088
Yeah, I can do one more question.

3049
02:31:37,088 --> 02:31:41,025
Yeah, well, Marco and Dave and others,

3050
02:31:41,025 --> 02:31:44,462
thanks a lot for the great comments
and commentary in the chat.

3051
02:31:44,462 --> 02:31:48,299
I hope that Bobby,
I hope you check the live chat replay.

3052
02:31:49,633 --> 02:31:54,305
And Shawn O'Connor wrote,
Thanks for the good and informative talk.

3053
02:31:55,039 --> 02:31:58,576
Dr. Azarian mentioned
the idea of evolutionary arms race.

3054
02:31:58,576 --> 02:32:02,613
I was hoping to recommend
that he consider, if he hasn't, how

3055
02:32:02,613 --> 02:32:06,317
an interest specific evolutionary arms
race may relate.

3056
02:32:07,985 --> 02:32:10,588
I'm not familiar
with the interest specific. So

3057
02:32:11,589 --> 02:32:14,692
perhaps if you a game theory Red Queen

3058
02:32:14,692 --> 02:32:19,096
not between two species, but within one

3059
02:32:20,331 --> 02:32:21,899
species.

3060
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:25,369
Yes. So you would have.

3061
02:32:25,369 --> 02:32:26,971
An evolutionary arms race there too?

3062
02:32:26,971 --> 02:32:27,771
Yeah, certainly.

3063
02:32:27,771 --> 02:32:30,808
If you're competing with other organisms.

3064
02:32:30,808 --> 02:32:34,111
And John.

3065
02:32:34,111 --> 02:32:37,448
Maynard Smith, who I mentioned earlier,
talking about like

3066
02:32:37,481 --> 02:32:40,317
this causal power of information
in biology.

3067
02:32:40,751 --> 02:32:42,486
He was the.

3068
02:32:42,486 --> 02:32:46,590
Person to bring by Norman's game theory
to biological evolution.

3069
02:32:47,091 --> 02:32:48,425
So he did.

3070
02:32:48,425 --> 02:32:51,462
He basically showed that there is

3071
02:32:51,462 --> 02:32:55,499
this game theory
sort of process being play it out.

3072
02:32:55,499 --> 02:32:58,569
I think he has examples,
use different species,

3073
02:32:59,103 --> 02:33:03,040
but I think within species,
you would see the.

3074
02:33:03,641 --> 02:33:04,875
Same sort of thing.

3075
02:33:04,875 --> 02:33:06,177
Of course, if it's.

3076
02:33:06,177 --> 02:33:08,245
Not humans, you know, if you. Have other.

3077
02:33:08,612 --> 02:33:10,681
Species, people are competing.

3078
02:33:11,182 --> 02:33:11,782
Organisms.

3079
02:33:11,782 --> 02:33:15,219
Are competing, you will get increased
complexity, but there are limits.

3080
02:33:15,219 --> 02:33:18,155
So just because theory sees
evolutionary arm races

3081
02:33:19,023 --> 02:33:22,126
within and between species,
there will still be a.

3082
02:33:22,126 --> 02:33:23,294
Limit because.

3083
02:33:24,395 --> 02:33:26,030
They have to model the environment.

3084
02:33:26,030 --> 02:33:28,132
And just modeling all these unnecessary.

3085
02:33:28,132 --> 02:33:31,168
Variables. Is wasteful.

3086
02:33:31,402 --> 02:33:34,305
So it will ratchet up.

3087
02:33:34,305 --> 02:33:36,674
Complexity in species. But

3088
02:33:38,409 --> 02:33:40,044
I think at least with. The.

3089
02:33:40,044 --> 02:33:42,746
Planet Earth and our biosphere, that

3090
02:33:44,582 --> 02:33:47,351
that humans are this sort of leading.

3091
02:33:47,351 --> 02:33:49,887
Envelope of. Complexity.

3092
02:33:49,887 --> 02:33:55,259
And so it really just is open
ended with the most complex.

3093
02:33:55,259 --> 02:33:55,893
Species.

3094
02:33:55,893 --> 02:33:58,696
So the most complex species
is the one that will.

3095
02:33:59,129 --> 02:34:01,298
Evolve toward. Higher complexity.

3096
02:34:01,298 --> 02:34:04,501
And really there might be a limit.

3097
02:34:05,069 --> 02:34:06,570
There are reasons to think
there are limits

3098
02:34:06,570 --> 02:34:09,773
to how far human biological intelligence
can emerge.

3099
02:34:09,773 --> 02:34:12,977
There's I mean, can evolve towards
there's something called

3100
02:34:12,977 --> 02:34:16,413
a centralization limit,
which is like how big our brain can get

3101
02:34:16,614 --> 02:34:18,315
because of reasons
like having to do with.

3102
02:34:18,315 --> 02:34:20,050
Like the skull and

3103
02:34:21,552 --> 02:34:24,955
so but
what's interesting is part of this.

3104
02:34:24,955 --> 02:34:30,561
Process, this evolutionary process
is as Popper and newer people

3105
02:34:30,561 --> 02:34:34,698
like Dennett have mentioned, continues
with science and culture and technology.

3106
02:34:35,165 --> 02:34:38,769
So humans really have open
ended complexity because.

3107
02:34:39,036 --> 02:34:40,571
Where where.

3108
02:34:40,571 --> 02:34:42,973
Augmenting ourselves with technology.

3109
02:34:42,973 --> 02:34:44,408
So while.

3110
02:34:44,408 --> 02:34:46,777
Biology, biological complexity may have.

3111
02:34:46,777 --> 02:34:50,080
Limits, there's no limits once.

3112
02:34:50,080 --> 02:34:53,384
We start merging with our technology
and we shouldn't

3113
02:34:53,384 --> 02:34:56,353
see technology as separate from.

3114
02:34:56,654 --> 02:34:57,721
Life.

3115
02:34:57,821 --> 02:35:00,190
It's an extension of biology
so the extended

3116
02:35:00,190 --> 02:35:03,160
phenotype, Richard Dawkins
explains, like beaver dams

3117
02:35:03,494 --> 02:35:06,630
considers like the Damned at the Beaver
instinctually builds.

3118
02:35:06,930 --> 02:35:08,532
As part of the. Whole phenotype.

3119
02:35:08,532 --> 02:35:10,701
So the ecosystem, the organism,

3120
02:35:10,701 --> 02:35:13,971
there's really no clear division
between the organism and the ecosystem.

3121
02:35:13,971 --> 02:35:16,807
And David Chalmers
has the extended mind hypothesis,

3122
02:35:17,141 --> 02:35:20,744
which says that our phones
are extensions of our minds. And

3123
02:35:21,845 --> 02:35:22,313
all of our.

3124
02:35:22,313 --> 02:35:24,214
Devices are. And

3125
02:35:24,948 --> 02:35:27,017
for that reason
we need to be worried about privacy.

3126
02:35:27,017 --> 02:35:30,387
But we also need
to not be scared of technology.

3127
02:35:30,387 --> 02:35:34,091
We just need to use technology
to become more human.

3128
02:35:34,091 --> 02:35:36,360
So we're not transcending.

3129
02:35:37,094 --> 02:35:40,230
Like humanity and biology technology

3130
02:35:40,230 --> 02:35:42,733
will allow us to become hyper biological.

3131
02:35:45,903 --> 02:35:47,805
Very interesting note

3132
02:35:47,805 --> 02:35:50,874
perhaps to close it on

3133
02:35:50,908 --> 02:35:54,611
any time you want the dot to,
we can make it happen.

3134
02:35:54,611 --> 02:35:55,846
It can be any format.

3135
02:35:55,846 --> 02:35:59,583
We can invite anyone else on

3136
02:35:59,817 --> 02:36:03,153
really awesome
and interesting to think about.

3137
02:36:03,153 --> 02:36:06,056
Do you want any last words?

3138
02:36:06,056 --> 02:36:07,524
If if I come back to talk about.

3139
02:36:07,524 --> 02:36:08,659
Free will and agency, it'd be great

3140
02:36:08,659 --> 02:36:12,629
to have Kevin Mitchell or maybe Eric
while who's done a lot of work on

3141
02:36:13,197 --> 02:36:16,333
top down causation and causal emergence
that was really influenced.

3142
02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:17,868
By influential. In the book.

3143
02:36:19,503 --> 02:36:20,571
If you know

3144
02:36:20,571 --> 02:36:25,943
people, you can Twitter tag them
or email us and email them and cc us

3145
02:36:25,943 --> 02:36:29,546
or just contact us
and we'll do that on our site.

3146
02:36:30,881 --> 02:36:32,850
Thanks. Been super fun. Thanks, Daniel.

3147
02:36:32,850 --> 02:36:33,884
