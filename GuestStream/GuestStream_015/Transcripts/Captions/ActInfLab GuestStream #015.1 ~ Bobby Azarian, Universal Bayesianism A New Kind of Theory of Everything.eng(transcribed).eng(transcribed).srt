1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,360
yep

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,120
all right thanks daniel for having me

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,440
everyone at the active inference lab uh

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,279
sorry for canceling twice

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,760
uh life's been kind of crazy with uh

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,840
finishing uh this book that this talk

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,719
will be

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,599
about and having a kid i'm six months

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,680
old and i i got sick like a week ago

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,039
like right

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,279
leading up to like you know didn't want

12
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,680
to cancel a third time and look crazy so

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,320
this is a very rushed presentation

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,400
um it'll be better if it's more of like

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,720
a conversation since i haven't even gone

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,920
through the slides myself once um

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,079
and it's gonna get into a lot of things

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,239
like immediately like open up bags of

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,399
worms like there's just philosophical

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,280
issues

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,640
um

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,960
things that people won't agree about

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,840
like immediately but um

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,000
yeah so this is just going to be like a

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,920
small introduction

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,440
to the thesis in the book um and yeah

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,399
i'll explain more i guess uh after i

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,520
begin

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,000
so yeah it's uh

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,920
call this the integrated evolutionary

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,199
synthesis

32
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,439
um compared to like the modern synthesis

33
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,960
or even the extended evolutionary

34
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,080
synthesis this is integrated because it

35
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,880
uh

36
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,920
kind of reconceptualizes evolution

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,000
uh biology and evolution in terms of the

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,920
in terms of thermodynamics and

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,640
information theory or energy flows

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,600
energy and information flows um takes

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,680
from cybernetics

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,560
so

43
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,720
yeah it's a non-reductive theory of

44
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,920
everything

45
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,520
that includes emergent phenomena like

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,000
life mind and civilization

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,240
um i say that because most theories of

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,840
everything we're used to are fundamental

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,280
physics theories that don't have

50
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,720
anything to say about life and

51
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,240
consciousness

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,720
they ignore them um

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,680
and uh i don't think those should be

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,280
called theories of everything because

55
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,520
theories of everything should be

56
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,680
uh an explanation for everything and if

57
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,520
you leave the things that we care about

58
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,040
most out then

59
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,520
it's not much of a theory of everything

60
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,119
so this is the book i've spent the last

61
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,560
two to three years riding obsessively

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,599
and uh it's available for pre-order now

63
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,680
so if you want to check that out

64
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,720
um you can find it with a google search

65
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,200
uh here's the table of contents

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,360
um so the book is broken into three

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,480
sections uh part one uh talks about the

68
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,599
origins of life and part two

69
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,000
about evolution while part three focuses

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,879
on

71
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,760
uh

72
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,040
consciousness and free will and the fate

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,560
of life in the universe so these like

74
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,879
really big questions but we're gonna

75
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,080
focus on

76
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,760
part two

77
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,920
and uh give a pretty

78
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,840
like a superficial overview of part two

79
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,560
um but you can feel free to ask me

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,480
uh any questions about

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,720
uh any of the other topics that are

82
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,440
related and i'll try to see what i can

83
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,760
answer without going into like all of

84
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
the

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,879
information i would i would need to

86
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,480
explain those things um so thomas huxley

87
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,440
known as darwin's bulldog

88
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
because he was such a strong advocate

89
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,680
for darwin's theory said that the

90
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
question of questions for mankind the

91
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,040
problem which underlies all others is

92
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,200
more deeply interesting than any other

93
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,120
is the ascertainment and of the place

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,080
which man occupies in nature and of his

95
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,280
relations to the universe of things so

96
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,519
where do we fit into the grand cosmic

97
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,400
scheme

98
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,440
um most scientists in the 20th century

99
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,200
and i would even say

100
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,120
now um

101
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,360
believe uh that we are an accident so uh

102
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,799
jacques mano

103
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,720
french

104
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,920
biochemist who won the nobel prize for

105
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,720
uh physiology and medicine um wrote a

106
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,400
book called chance of necessity which

107
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,799
was really influential and

108
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,959
he was just as reductionist as you can

109
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,280
get man at last knows that he is alone

110
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,439
in the unfeeling immensity of the

111
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,319
universe out of which he emerged only by

112
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,360
chance

113
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,480
neither so some of the words are covered

114
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,680
by uh by daniel so neither is his

115
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,880
destiny spelled out or his duty have

116
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,320
been written down i think there's

117
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
something wrong with that quote but um

118
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,839
so if there are times where i'm trying

119
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,120
to read something where the picture's

120
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,360
over i might have to skip you can

121
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,120
you can move that because

122
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,199
it looks on my side it

123
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,280
it looks fine perfect thank you great

124
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,320
yeah um neither his destiny or his duty

125
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,840
have been written down

126
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,160
so that was kind of based on this old

127
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,440
idea that

128
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,320
uh

129
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,199
the emergence of life uh was a product

130
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,800
of chance assembly so like this uh just

131
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,919
a

132
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,919
statistical fluctuation

133
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,759
that brought together all the molecules

134
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,160
needed to create the first cell

135
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,479
we now know that that's probably not

136
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,639
what happened it's this gradual process

137
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,520
of self-organization jeremy england has

138
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,479
uh been in the media a lot about his

139
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,800
theory of dissipative adaptation

140
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,440
so um

141
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,880
let's

142
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,080
so we will see uh this is kind of like a

143
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,160
different point of view not everybody

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,199
was convinced by a mono uh carl sagan

145
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,800
said the origin of life must be a highly

146
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
probable affair as soon as conditions

147
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,840
permit

148
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,199
up it pops

149
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,960
um so this is an important question um

150
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,160
whether life was uh improbable or

151
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,479
inevitable so if life is highly

152
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,560
improbable we're likely to be alone in

153
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,400
the universe but if the emergence of

154
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,880
life is inevitable given a certain set

155
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,759
of common uh physical conditions then

156
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,080
it's likely that we have life

157
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,160
um at least on planets that are

158
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,120
sufficiently earth-like uh specifically

159
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,000
have

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,199
uh geochemistry like earth's uh uh have

161
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,000
a

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,880
star

163
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,160
uh some

164
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,080
uh like the earth's because that's what

165
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,160
uh provides the energy that pushes it

166
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,240
far from equilibrium so we're going to

167
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,080
get in to all that stuff pretty soon um

168
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,520
christian to do

169
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,240
this quote is kind of a

170
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,560
response to stephen j gould who just

171
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,160
really emphasized uh to both mono and

172
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,600
stephen jay gould

173
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,880
the

174
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,919
the importance of chance uh in nature

175
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,160
and that everything is basically

176
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,639
you know a contingency that came from a

177
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,479
chance process

178
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,199
um where did says that you know you can

179
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,360
have this inevitability that some

180
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,960
philosophers would see as as teleology

181
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,319
but it doesn't mean that uh this

182
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,120
inevitable progress is being driven by

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,759
the supernatural force he explains that

184
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,759
the natural constraints within which

185
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,759
chance operates are such that evolution

186
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,520
in the direction of increasing

187
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,599
complexity was virtually bound to take

188
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,599
place if given the opportunity chance

189
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,919
does not exclude inevitability so he was

190
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,039
also a nobel prize winning uh biologist

191
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,160
the same

192
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,960
category as mono but had a complete

193
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,199
opposite opinion

194
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,080
and we can talk about that too basically

195
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,039
uh

196
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,319
when uh systems are open systems and

197
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,479
they're pushed far from equilibrium

198
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,400
by a flow of energy you basically uh get

199
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,080
something like

200
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,800
a statistical bias away from what we

201
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,120
would expect with isolated systems

202
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,000
closed systems that aren't uh open to

203
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,720
energy will relax the thermodynamic

204
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,080
equilibrium

205
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,880
and

206
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,400
when a system is being pushed far from

207
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,120
equilibrium uh it will naturally

208
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,160
organize because uh organization

209
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,280
uh

210
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,599
happens uh under the flow of energy and

211
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,879
we're gonna see exactly why it's a

212
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,960
darwinian process

213
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,759
but

214
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,000
basically um

215
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,720
you get inevitability if you have the

216
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,440
right ingredients

217
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,400
so

218
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,520
um

219
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,120
we'll talk about to kind of frame this

220
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,960
we already kind of mentioned those two

221
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,280
world views so the first world view

222
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
would be the reductionist world view and

223
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,720
i should be clear that um productionism

224
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,400
is uh

225
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,879
also it's it's a method and an ideology

226
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,280
and we shouldn't uh confuse those two

227
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,240
things

228
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,840
um and daniel i guess just so i'm

229
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,519
you know know where i'm at maybe when

230
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,440
you when i've gone 30 minutes you can

231
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,640
let me know

232
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,799
okay i'll hoot

233
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,000
okay great um so

234
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,800
uh reductionism the method uh basically

235
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,640
says that reality can be understood by

236
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
breaking down all physical phenomena

237
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,959
into their simplest parts so that we may

238
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,200
observe the basic behavior of the

239
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,720
fundamental constituents of nature so

240
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,920
um

241
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,839
i'm just going to

242
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,080
plug in this charger i might need to do

243
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,200
that

244
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,920
a little bit but um basically uh the

245
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,560
method is how science works if we want

246
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,880
to understand emergence we also have to

247
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,040
understand how the components that

248
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,519
systems are made of uh work in isolation

249
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,399
so

250
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,360
it's an essential part of the story but

251
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,240
it's not the whole part we'll see um so

252
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,959
the method inspired an ideology and

253
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,959
ideology is is is just that it's it's an

254
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,200
ideology and it's rigid

255
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,120
and um

256
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
basically uh the method uh doesn't

257
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,000
really

258
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,040
um

259
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,160
imply that the ideology is true so um

260
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,640
when i'm attacking reductionism i'm not

261
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,040
attacking the method i'm i'm attacking

262
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,920
the worldview and so that view we can

263
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,360
say that um

264
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,519
basically um

265
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,320
so

266
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,160
hard determinism is is part of the

267
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,680
reductionist worldview

268
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,279
so uh

269
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,279
thought experiment that some people are

270
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,920
familiar with i'm sure la place is demon

271
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,600
but basically uh laplace was a

272
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,519
french mathematician that

273
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,040
uh took uh

274
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,320
newton's kind of model of reality uh and

275
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,640
applied it to everything newton himself

276
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,240
was kind of a mystic when it comes to

277
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,079
life he didn't really think that physics

278
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,440
applied to

279
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,600
to organisms or at least to humans but

280
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,640
um

281
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,240
laplace really you know

282
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,519
came up with the idea that like uh

283
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,760
basically the evolution of the universe

284
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,600
is just this like

285
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,640
um

286
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,920
clockwork universe where it's like um

287
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,160
a machine with cogs that are just

288
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,240
turning so there are no uh there's no

289
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,640
room for agency and free will in that

290
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,839
picture

291
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,120
when boltzmann came along uh in the 19th

292
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,800
century and

293
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,160
uh

294
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,720
came up with statistical mechanics

295
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,880
the clockwork universe kind of became

296
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,800
the billiard ball universe but it's just

297
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,399
the idea that

298
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,920
everything in the universe is made of

299
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,959
atoms and that these atoms are um

300
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,839
interacting and that's the whole picture

301
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,680
so the ideology says we're nothing more

302
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,279
than our atoms so we don't make

303
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,480
decisions

304
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,399
uh consciousness is just

305
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,480
an epic phenomenon and it

306
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,560
feels to us like we are but actually

307
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,760
this trajectory was determined basically

308
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,560
uh not basically from the moment of the

309
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,760
big bang

310
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,279
and there's kind of no freedom in

311
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,079
anything and uh no future

312
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,200
um

313
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,640
other than what was determined from the

314
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,760
beginning

315
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,720
so

316
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
the second law of thermodynamics also

317
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,000
sort of shaped the reduction of soil

318
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,440
abuse as the

319
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,120
universe is becoming increasingly

320
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,680
disordered there's actually kind of two

321
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,279
different interpretations of the second

322
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,839
law uh the first one

323
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,880
uh

324
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,360
kind of emerged from the work of uh

325
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,839
carnell and clausius the kind of

326
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,600
original thermodynamics work where

327
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,200
entropy was about

328
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,320
um a measure of uh

329
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,959
energy that can't be used for work so a

330
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,279
kind of measure of like useless

331
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,880
energy um

332
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,839
where later with boltzmann he tried to

333
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,519
uh

334
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,040
put the second law on like a statistical

335
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,079
basis based on like atomic theory so

336
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:22,839
um

337
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,120
basically uh

338
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
people applied uh boltzmann's

339
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,279
statistical interpretation of the second

340
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,079
law

341
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,320
to the universe and came up with this

342
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,160
notion that the universe is becoming

343
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,079
increasingly disordered which isn't

344
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,680
great for life because it means that

345
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,480
life is transient and likely cosmically

346
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
insignificant

347
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,240
and this worldview is associated with

348
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,839
materialism

349
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,800
uh which doesn't recognize consciousness

350
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,040
is real certainly doesn't recognize it

351
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,200
as having causal power

352
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,000
and historically it often ignored

353
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,480
apparently a material phenomenon like

354
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,320
energy and information and mental

355
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,600
processes

356
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,480
um

357
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,959
i am just going to

358
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,480
grab my charger so

359
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,680
um

360
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,040
sounds good this doesn't die but i will

361
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,959
be right back take your time

362
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,880
so

363
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,560
those who are watching live please feel

364
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,320
free to leave a

365
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,240
comment or a question i'm writing some

366
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,079
things down

367
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,079
we'll look forward to the return of

368
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,599
electrical power to bobby

369
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,360
all right

370
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,120
my first live stream i will be more

371
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,199
prepared when i return

372
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,639
to part two that's something else i've

373
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,720
told daniel is that this is kind of like

374
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,320
part one and i like to come back and

375
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,519
talk about

376
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,480
uh

377
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,399
the ideas that come after

378
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,120
so

379
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,639
it will have 15.2 it'll be awesome it's

380
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,560
an infinite sequence it's the sequence

381
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,839
is always yours

382
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,199
great

383
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,800
okay um so

384
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,560
reductionist worldview says that all

385
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,079
life forms including humans are nothing

386
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,760
more than collections of atoms

387
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,880
obligatory following fixed and arbitrary

388
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,560
mechanical trajectories determined

389
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,000
solely by math and not by mine

390
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,519
so

391
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,440
um

392
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,760
this world view if

393
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,000
if you convince someone that they don't

394
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,160
have free will because you tell them

395
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,360
about the

396
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,839
reductionist worldview um there was

397
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,440
actually a study where they did this and

398
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,399
they

399
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,360
read participants a passage from francis

400
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,120
crick explaining

401
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,519
that uh it appears that we don't have

402
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,959
any free will

403
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,199
um the participants

404
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,240
actually on subsequent tests

405
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,320
uh were more like more likely to cheat

406
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,519
on the test

407
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,199
because they felt like they didn't have

408
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,040
any personal responsibility they weren't

409
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,800
making the decisions therefore they

410
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,079
could cheat that's kind of funny because

411
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,880
they are actually you can see that like

412
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,839
by what they're like being told they are

413
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,959
changing

414
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,519
uh their behavior so it is having some

415
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,160
kind of effect if we do in fact have an

416
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,120
agency or free will and we're kind of

417
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,360
talking about agency uh we don't really

418
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,199
get into free will but those are related

419
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,480
topics but if that's not true

420
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,279
then uh that's really bad that the

421
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,800
majority of scientists are telling

422
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,160
people we don't have free will because

423
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,000
the people that believe this

424
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,880
um

425
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,959
it's having negative effects on for

426
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,800
example mental health other studies have

427
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,920
shown that belief and no free will can

428
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,240
lead to depression and belief in free

429
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,839
will can have all these

430
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,000
positive effects um

431
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,680
of course soon as i start talking about

432
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,720
free will

433
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,160
i'm sure a lot of people

434
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,399
have objections uh might think that

435
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,480
there's no way that we can have room for

436
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,360
free will in a physical world view um

437
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,880
but that's exactly what we're going to

438
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,680
begin to talk about today uh the causal

439
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,519
power of information

440
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,480
and that basically organisms are agents

441
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,680
that are

442
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,440
cybernetic control units so

443
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
as controllers

444
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,199
we do have agency

445
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,040
so

446
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,279
and the belief that were accidents of

447
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,040
nature rather than natural

448
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,800
manifestations of

449
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,519
physical laws uh i'm sure also

450
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,600
uh impacts our sense

451
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,680
of well-being just so you know i'm not

452
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,720
making this up um i can i'll give you

453
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,600
some

454
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,040
quotes from really famous physicists

455
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,360
who are uh kind of militant reductionist

456
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,399
so

457
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,680
brian green says i think it's very

458
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,040
important to face up to the truth of

459
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,360
reality which is in fact that life and

460
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,480
consciousness

461
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,639
is a fleeting phenomenon on the entire

462
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,639
cosmological timeline

463
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,560
um

464
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,920
brian green just came out with a book

465
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,320
and he's like going on interviews just

466
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,839
saying this and it's really interesting

467
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,119
because some other famous physicists

468
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,959
don't agree at all and he's stating it

469
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,799
like it's a complete fact so for example

470
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,880
david deutsch would not agree with this

471
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,439
and we'll get into that um sabine

472
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,559
hostenfelder is another person um

473
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,400
i know some of the

474
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,439
some of my friends in the community um

475
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,480
who are

476
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,720
these people you know working on

477
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,919
emergence and causation and stuff uh get

478
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,000
bothered by her statements because she's

479
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,200
also very

480
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
uh ultra reductionistic so i wish people

481
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,480
would stop insisting they have free will

482
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,240
it's terribly annoying insisting that

483
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,160
free will exist as bad science like

484
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,520
insisting that horoscopes tell you

485
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,200
something about the future it's not

486
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,799
compatible with our knowledge about

487
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,039
nature so uh

488
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,360
i'm saying that's wrong we won't get

489
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,080
into free will that much but if you have

490
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,000
questions at the end we will

491
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,200
talk about how information adaptive

492
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,480
information

493
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,160
uh gets built up by evolution in uh

494
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,919
adaptive systems complex adaptive

495
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,880
systems and you will see how uh these

496
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,880
systems actually do control their own

497
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,240
future

498
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,120
so sam harris is another anti-freewheel

499
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
person says you're not controlling the

500
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
storm and you are not lost in it you are

501
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,200
the storm so it's kind of funny because

502
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,679
he's using a metaphor here but what this

503
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,679
story kind of reveals

504
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,760
is that uh

505
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,480
yes we are a storm that's right we are a

506
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,360
dissipative structure like a storm uh

507
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,240
emerges to dissipate uh an energy

508
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,280
gradient

509
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,960
and uh we're not really gonna talk about

510
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,640
that that's what the first part of the

511
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,080
book is about the origins part but um

512
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,600
i'm just pointing it out because it's

513
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,000
interesting because we are like a storm

514
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,440
in that aspect but we also differ from a

515
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,320
storm because a storm does not have

516
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,600
agency a storm does not have the ability

517
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,960
to seek out new energy gradients it's

518
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,400
just kind of

519
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,240
um

520
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,039
being pushed around by these gradients

521
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,600
in nature where uh

522
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,760
organisms are actually controllers and

523
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,679
so you are storm

524
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,160
but you do have control over the storm

525
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,039
so

526
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,000
uh

527
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,640
these people are kind of

528
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,200
have the opposite view so julio tinoni

529
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,600
uh creator of integrated information

530
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,760
theory says there is true free will

531
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
a great lecture that just popped up i

532
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,840
think months ago where he gives a

533
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,280
two-hour talk on

534
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,919
uh basically integrate information and

535
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,080
uh how it shows that

536
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,000
systems do have causal power and uh

537
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,960
in a way uh have free will so

538
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,400
depending on your definition of free

539
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,200
will

540
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,320
um

541
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,000
we do have free will according to his

542
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,880
model

543
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,480
david deutsch said in an interview with

544
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,039
john horgan just uh a year ago or so i'm

545
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,640
sure we have free will

546
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,039
christoph koch says explains how you

547
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,559
know there are a lot of experiments the

548
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,480
lebet experiments

549
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,720
which we will talk about next time

550
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,799
that uh

551
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,520
basically yeah some people interpret it

552
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,480
as as not having free will but actually

553
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,440
uh we will see later um

554
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,039
when you deliberate

555
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,559
uh that's actually an act of free will

556
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,960
these choices were actually where you

557
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,400
bring your entire conscious being to

558
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,080
that question and try to analyze it

559
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,240
under all the various conditions and

560
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,039
actually uh there was a study coke did

561
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,400
that kind of

562
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,840
showed that the lebate lebet study uh

563
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,240
um was kind of interpreted wrong and um

564
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,600
for anyone

565
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,520
who understands that stuff uh the

566
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,600
readiness potential that was supposed to

567
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,400
be

568
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,840
proof that there was no free will

569
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,799
disappeared when the decisions uh

570
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,240
involved uh deliberation so yeah that's

571
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,440
kind of

572
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,000
meandering but i'm sure a lot of people

573
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,480
are interested in this bigger picture of

574
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
why this emergence

575
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,200
paradigm is so radically different from

576
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,200
the reductionist paradigm it kind of uh

577
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,320
puts information front and center and

578
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,799
systems that process information

579
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,960
uh complex adaptive systems are

580
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,039
computational systems

581
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,159
and these systems uh

582
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,240
in the with these systems information

583
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,840
actually does have causal power we're

584
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,880
gonna explain what we mean by that so

585
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,039
paradigm of emergence uh

586
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,960
the collective says the collective

587
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,280
behavior of interacting parts not simply

588
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,200
how they function in isolation is key to

589
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,320
understanding the emergence and

590
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,360
evolution

591
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,039
of all the fascinating organisms and

592
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,679
ecosystems that make up the biosphere so

593
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,000
it's really not about

594
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,240
just like particles it's about the

595
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,440
patterns that emerge when uh these

596
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,640
systems find these certain

597
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,720
configurations uh through basically

598
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,039
darwinian mechanisms and we'll see that

599
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,840
self-organization too uh has a darwinian

600
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,280
dynamic

601
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,640
each emergence in the cosmic

602
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,320
self-organization process is brought

603
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,240
about by higher order phase transition

604
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,320
that moves life ever further away from a

605
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,480
state of thermodynamic equilibrium and

606
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,840
total disorder

607
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,200
i'm assuming the audience knows uh that

608
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,440
what thermodynamic equilibrium is it's

609
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,880
basically

610
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,679
uh if you have for example boltzmann

611
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,559
took a model of um

612
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,039
an ideal gas and explained that for

613
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,000
example if the gas molecules are bunched

614
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,799
up in the corner uh naturally it's going

615
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,159
the gas is going to spread out until

616
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,400
there's no pattern and uh basically it's

617
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,559
like a completely mixed up state um

618
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,440
so equilibrium is associated with death

619
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,600
and disorder uh because systems

620
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,120
naturally tend toward this more

621
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,960
mixed up

622
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,640
unpatterned

623
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,000
completely chaotic state

624
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,520
of course

625
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
later we're gonna talk about uh why open

626
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,320
systems that that rule doesn't apply

627
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,480
basically systems that are open to the

628
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,960
flow of energy can resist this tendency

629
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,880
towards a disorder and that's really

630
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,600
what the whole story is kind of

631
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,679
based on um

632
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,760
so through a nested series of such phase

633
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,159
transitions these are also called

634
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,240
these higher order phase transitions are

635
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
major evolutionary transitions john

636
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,240
maynard smith talked about them and meta

637
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,440
system transitions by the cyberneticist

638
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,679
valentine terchin basically the same

639
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,919
concept of some subtle differences

640
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,919
so the idea is that cosmic

641
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,200
self-organization is a series of these

642
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,799
transitions where functional things come

643
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,400
together to make larger functional ones

644
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
which come together to even

645
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,240
make even larger ones and so on and

646
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,720
through this process adaptive complexity

647
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,440
or life so that's a more general way to

648
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,039
talk about life

649
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,880
becomes better equipped to dominate the

650
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,679
cosmos life requires an organization

651
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,679
that is increasingly hierarchical and

652
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,760
integrated and therefore more resilient

653
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,120
and computationally powerful

654
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,919
so

655
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,480
here are just a couple of figures

656
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,279
you see this hierarchy uh in this

657
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,600
structural hierarchy of matter in life

658
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,360
this was adapted from

659
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,840
a big physics journal i can't remember

660
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,240
which one it was but um

661
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,799
basically you know physicists are

662
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,320
recognizing

663
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,200
this hierarchy even when it extends to

664
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,679
life so jeffrey west's book scale comes

665
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,000
to mind

666
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,080
and so we see the

667
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,039
hierarchy of science kind of naturally

668
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,760
mirror this hierarchy

669
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,440
of matter and life

670
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,679
and um the reductionist picture would

671
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,000
say that these things at the top here

672
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,039
um

673
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,360
are kind of insignificant

674
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,960
parts of the story transient but we will

675
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,200
see that this

676
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,760
you know the more we go up the more

677
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,120
influence

678
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,200
on cosmic evolution the phenomena have

679
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,279
so

680
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,240
uh thomas huxley's question about a

681
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,039
man's place in the cosmos uh

682
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,200
is um

683
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,600
basically the emergence of paradigm uh

684
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,919
the paradigm of emergence i'm going to

685
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,840
discuss and actually this is kind of

686
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,400
maybe like in a specific or a new

687
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,840
paradigm of emergence because it

688
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,600
includes all this stuff about

689
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,159
thermodynamics and information theory um

690
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,320
says that emergence the emergence and

691
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,240
evolution of life mind societies and

692
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,000
technology are all part of one

693
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,240
thermodynamic process one evolutionary

694
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,720
process one computational process

695
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,360
unified by the concept of knowledge

696
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,080
so

697
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,039
uh this theory is a theory of knowledge

698
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,600
creation

699
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,279
and so knowledge is going to be the

700
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,360
unifying theme and we'll briefly talk

701
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,120
about epistemology i wanted to talk

702
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,720
about it more but it just would have

703
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,159
been too long um cosmic evolution

704
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,720
uh in this paradigm is a universal

705
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,880
process of becoming as opposed to being

706
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,440
so the universe isn't this static thing

707
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,279
uh it's actually evolving

708
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,679
very much like an organism or a complex

709
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,200
adaptive system

710
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,520
um so it's not a pan psychic theory in

711
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,840
this theory consciousness emerges that's

712
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,799
very important um but you might call it

713
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,480
emergent pan-psychism uh because

714
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,600
uh as this evolutionary process proceeds

715
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,240
uh inanimate matter as life spreads gets

716
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,440
converted into animate matter

717
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,840
um so in this picture humans are neither

718
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,000
a cosmic accident nor the end goal of

719
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,360
evolution

720
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,520
so we are instead a step on the

721
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,679
evolutionary ladder of becoming

722
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,240
and we are also potentially an essential

723
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,720
driver of increasing cosmic complexity

724
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,960
so this big idea is that the universe is

725
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,760
undergoing this majestic self-organizing

726
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,240
process and at this moment of time at

727
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,480
least in this corner of the universe we

728
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,400
are the stars of the show

729
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,640
um this picture is from eric chasen's uh

730
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,600
book the rise of complexity uh cosmic

731
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,000
evolution the rise of complexity

732
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,799
he's a harvard astrophysicist

733
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,960
but i just used freeman dyson code here

734
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,640
because it seemed relevant

735
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,240
it's conceivable that life may have a

736
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,159
larger role to play than we have yet

737
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,080
imagined life may succeed against all

738
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,840
odds and molding the universe to its own

739
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,880
purpose

740
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,120
so i guess brian green doesn't buy that

741
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,799
at all but um

742
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,919
if that's true then uh

743
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,399
as phys as cosmology cosmologists have

744
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,760
to think about the

745
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,000
role of life there's a lot of people

746
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
who've said similar things like seth

747
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,039
lloyd and

748
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,760
famously raker as well um

749
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,120
so

750
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,760
just a couple quotes here so you know

751
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,520
you know when when people hear these

752
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,840
terms progress there's just the stigma

753
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,200
immediately they thought like oh

754
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,520
someone's trying to sneak in religion or

755
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,919
some intelligent design theory

756
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,799
so you see these trusted names

757
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,240
of physics here david deutsch has

758
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,480
narrowly conceived evolutionary theory

759
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,159
considers as mere vehicles for the

760
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,320
replication of our genes our memes and

761
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,919
it refuses to address the question of

762
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,919
why evolution has tended to create ever

763
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,480
greater adaptive complexity or the role

764
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,720
that such complexity plays in the wider

765
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,480
scheme of things so

766
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,559
there is clearly implying that adaptive

767
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,120
complexity does have this larger role to

768
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,880
play

769
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,559
we now see how it is possible for the

770
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,880
universe to increase both organization

771
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,480
and entropy at the same time the

772
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,399
optimistic and pessimistic arrows of

773
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:39,919
time can coexist the universe can

774
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,399
display creative unidirectional

775
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,320
unidirectional progress even in the face

776
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,240
of the second law because this is paul

777
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,679
davies says that

778
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,559
um so that's really uh

779
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,559
kind of a key point

780
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,840
uh in this is that um

781
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,960
the second law actually is in a sense

782
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,279
driving this increasing progress so not

783
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,120
only can we have unidirectional progress

784
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,279
in the face of the second law it seems

785
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,440
that this progress requires the second

786
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,320
law

787
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,080
because we'll see that the second law is

788
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,120
the

789
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
basically the natural selection pressure

790
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,320
for uh self-organizing systems so in a

791
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,960
sense the second law is both uh shiva

792
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,640
the destroyer and brahma the creator um

793
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,000
so

794
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,440
a goal of this unifying theory of

795
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,399
reality

796
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,159
uh

797
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,760
i've been calling the great consilience

798
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,919
it was actually a name

799
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,799
uh suggested by marco lin

800
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,399
who is uh

801
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,360
is a fristonian in influenced uh some of

802
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,399
this talk

803
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,399
um so

804
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,120
basically the unifying theory of reality

805
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,720
illuminates the connection between

806
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,880
complexity cognition consciousness and

807
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,440
cosmic evolution or matter mind and

808
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,799
cosmos

809
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,720
um and it's really based on complexity

810
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,159
science it's a lot broader than

811
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,559
complexity science but i guess that

812
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,080
name kind of

813
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,919
in a way includes everything so it's a

814
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,840
unification of major sciences of our

815
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,520
time including but not limited to

816
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,279
physics biology neuroscience computer

817
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,640
science evolutionary theory and

818
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,919
statistics

819
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,440
and basically it describes complex

820
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,200
adaptive systems of all scales in terms

821
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,440
of energy and information flows

822
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,720
so

823
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,559
it uses statistical thermodynamics

824
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,000
information theory and cybernetics um so

825
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,559
we will talk about those a bit

826
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,320
uh coming up so if you want to see kind

827
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,600
of like a

828
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,440
a map of what sort of informs uh

829
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,000
this non-reductive theory of everything

830
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,919
here you go so

831
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,760
i know there's a lot of information so

832
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,760
i'll kind of try to simplify this for

833
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,880
everyone

834
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,120
um there are some unifying paradigms

835
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,720
that have emerged so basically this

836
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,559
theory is nothing new it's basically

837
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,640
evolutionary epistemology

838
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,080
um after that came universal darwinism

839
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,960
and later uh right now we're seeing this

840
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,440
kind of revolution with like bayesian

841
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,840
inference and these ideas being applied

842
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,120
to everything

843
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,360
um so

844
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,640
uh

845
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,760
being informed uh by these

846
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,200
um

847
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,640
paradigms

848
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,600
and

849
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,919
uh combining those paradigms are

850
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,320
updating them i should say with uh

851
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,320
information from non-equilibrium

852
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,840
thermodynamics so we're talking about

853
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,480
the thermodynamics of open systems

854
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,720
uh information theory so shannon's

855
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,799
theory

856
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,960
some of you will know that information

857
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,519
theory is related very closely to

858
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,080
non-equilibrium thermodynamics and

859
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,039
basically uh boltzmann's statistical

860
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,440
entropy is mathematically the same as

861
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,760
shannon entropy or information entropy

862
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,679
which is a measure of uncertainty um

863
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,480
if i had more time i would go through

864
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,320
thermodynamics and the different types

865
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,480
of entropy but

866
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,080
we don't have time for that but if

867
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,640
anyone has any questions i can clarify

868
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
um cybernetics was

869
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,039
basically information theory

870
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,519
applied to biology adaptive systems it

871
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,720
was the first

872
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,600
science of adaptive systems really and

873
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,000
uh it's funny while writing this uh i

874
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,480
found out because you know i hadn't

875
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
i had heard the name cybernetics but it

876
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,880
wasn't clear how important it was

877
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,399
um

878
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,679
in a talk by uh jim crutchfeld uh santa

879
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,679
fe institute basically

880
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,399
revealed that uh because cybernetics got

881
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,120
associated with like the russian

882
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,039
uh like during the cold war kind of like

883
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,440
the russian agenda um cybernetics was

884
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,760
used to design like heat-seeking

885
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,720
missiles uh norbert weiner's

886
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,360
theory was almost immediately applied

887
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,080
for military uses and because of that it

888
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,039
stopped being taught in american

889
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,720
colleges

890
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,919
so

891
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,679
yeah it's really important and it was

892
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,360
actually

893
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,200
emerging at the same time as information

894
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,760
theory people were already uh thinking

895
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,720
about

896
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,960
systems in terms of information flows

897
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,559
but it's more than information theory

898
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,840
because it's a science of feedback

899
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,720
um

900
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,279
so dynamical systems theory or complex

901
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,519
adaptive systems is kind of like an

902
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,320
offshoot of that all of these inform

903
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,399
what i've called universal basianism not

904
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,360
the only person to call it that

905
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,240
i had searched that term and found adam

906
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,200
saffron's uh paper on integrated world

907
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,760
modeling theory that used that same term

908
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
but uh john campbell has been a

909
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,519
researcher

910
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,320
um

911
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,159
who has done a lot to show this

912
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,760
equivalence between

913
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,880
uh

914
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,880
evolutionary processes and processes of

915
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,240
bayesian inference we're going to talk

916
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,440
about that in a little bit um

917
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,360
so yeah if anybody has any questions

918
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,200
about that but really all of these

919
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,279
things origin of life research

920
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,640
integrated evolutionary theory um

921
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,000
if you haven't checked out the work of

922
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,399
these people like everybody here is

923
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,039
worth reading their work but uh so from

924
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,440
that we get a unifying theory of reality

925
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,199
that is based on

926
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,320
what i call the evolutionary

927
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,079
epistemology universal darwinism

928
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,159
universal bayesianism framework that's a

929
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,639
long name i'm aware of that but it's

930
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,639
just to show that these three theories

931
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,240
are basically the same theory

932
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,520
so

933
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,079
universal darwinism says that the

934
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,679
universe is evolving at every scale

935
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,839
through both competitive evolution and

936
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,918
through self-organization which is

937
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,760
cooperative evolution among agents that

938
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,599
have formed a collective unit

939
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,599
so it started with richard dawkins and

940
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,359
this concept of the meme and the selfish

941
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:42,560
gene that

942
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,199
uh memes uh were these uh cultural units

943
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,679
that were equivalent to genes

944
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,960
and so we started to see how information

945
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,079
was this

946
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,760
uh paradigm that

947
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,240
could be extended beyond biology and

948
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,839
then we had dan dinnett and darwin's

949
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,240
dangerous idea really extend this to

950
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,040
like everything to

951
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,280
self-organizing systems to cultural and

952
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,760
technological systems

953
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,839
uh evolutionary cosmology came before

954
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,920
that it was based on karl popper's

955
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,920
philosophy but it was actually invented

956
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,000
by cognitive psychologist donald

957
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,200
campbell

958
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,119
and basically that said that the

959
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,880
evolutionary process

960
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,040
is a problem-solving procedure that

961
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,359
creates knowledge so

962
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,880
uh

963
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,720
the information stored in genomes and in

964
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,560
uh brains and cultural memory uh

965
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,000
basically

966
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,760
that all that knowledge accumulates from

967
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,400
an evolutionary process and

968
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
it's really helpful to think of it as

969
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,079
knowledge especially when we start to

970
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,760
talk about this

971
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,720
in in uh the context of thermodynamics

972
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,400
and information because uh basically

973
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,800
this knowledge is what allows

974
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,040
life adaptive systems

975
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,119
to stay far from equilibrium they can

976
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,920
resist this tendency towards decay

977
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,880
life can uh continue to persist

978
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,640
if it can acquire

979
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,040
the knowledge that it needs

980
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,760
to essentially to find free energy

981
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,359
that will allow it to sustain itself um

982
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,800
so we'll talk about that in a second

983
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,000
more

984
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,079
um so universal bayesianism is a

985
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,760
bayesian update of the first two

986
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,480
paradigms knowledge is encoded so the

987
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,640
knowledge that evolutionary epistemology

988
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,000
can describe

989
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,680
it's actually encoded in biological

990
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,720
systems

991
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,119
uh in the form of a world model

992
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,880
so this model is an internal

993
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,359
representation and statistical mapping

994
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,960
of the environment which gets updated

995
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,440
through adaptation and adaptive learning

996
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,680
we're going to talk about that process

997
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,359
um

998
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,760
really the

999
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,040
the whole

1000
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,960
bayesian brain hypothesis and free

1001
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,880
energy principle is inspired by

1002
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,240
cybernetics heavily so ross ashby's

1003
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,920
good regulator theorem and law of

1004
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,240
requisite variety which we'll talk about

1005
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,240
was kind of the first talk of

1006
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,400
systems having models and having to

1007
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,520
model the environment um so kaufristen

1008
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,040
says inference is actually quite close

1009
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,040
to a theory of everything including

1010
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,839
evolution consciousness and life itself

1011
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,680
we're not going to go into

1012
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,800
those bigger implications that

1013
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,560
would be at the

1014
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
end of the book in the last chapter but

1015
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,119
basically this isn't just a theory about

1016
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,720
evolution

1017
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,040
um well it is evolution but evolution

1018
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,599
applied way more broadly so quantum

1019
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,040
mechanics has a an interpretation that's

1020
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,000
consistent with this and bigger problems

1021
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,560
like the fine-tuning of the constants

1022
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,480
and parameters that allow for the

1023
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,599
emergence

1024
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,240
of life in the universe we can actually

1025
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,320
uh probably have the best explanation

1026
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,079
for the fine-tuning problem and the

1027
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,240
measurement problem of quantum mechanics

1028
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,880
uh with this theory um

1029
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,640
we won't talk about it but just so you

1030
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,280
know next time uh cosmological natural

1031
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,520
selection by lee smolin is the theory

1032
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,119
that kind of addresses the fine-tuning

1033
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,960
problem from a universal darwinism

1034
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,079
perspective

1035
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,160
while quantum darwinism

1036
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,880
uh addresses the measurement problem

1037
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,960
um so we will save that for next time

1038
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,200
but feel free to ask questions about any

1039
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,560
of those so

1040
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
what does this do i have this name

1041
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,480
poetic meta naturalism i meant to take

1042
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,520
that out but uh next time we'll get into

1043
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,400
why

1044
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,760
uh i chose that name it's actually um it

1045
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,560
sounds kind of like you know like

1046
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,480
complex or buzzword or jargony but

1047
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,160
there's actually very practical reasons

1048
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,200
for having that name um

1049
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,320
so this uh unifying theory bridges

1050
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,880
matter with mine so universal darwinism

1051
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,280
gives us a picture of the open-ended

1052
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,040
complexity growth

1053
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,000
uh

1054
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,160
that this whole idea is based on the

1055
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,920
idea that evolution

1056
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,400
keeps producing increasingly complex

1057
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,359
intelligent forms of life

1058
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,640
excuse me

1059
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,680
um

1060
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,359
so uh

1061
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,560
yeah universal bayesianism is uh the

1062
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,560
link that kind of connects those

1063
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,079
paradigms with

1064
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,720
uh consciousness so again we won't get

1065
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,359
into that today but

1066
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,520
when uh you understand that knowledge is

1067
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,440
stored stored in the form of a world

1068
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,920
model that a system that models itself

1069
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,640
can experience then we start to

1070
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,640
get a better understanding of like what

1071
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,920
conscious consciousness

1072
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,839
consciousness is it's a it's a mental

1073
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,400
model so it's not a traditional pan

1074
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,760
psychic theory even though i know

1075
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,119
firsthand and

1076
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,800
levin and some of his colleagues have

1077
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,640
kind of been flirting with fan psychism

1078
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,760
this

1079
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,000
theory would say that's wrong and it's

1080
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,760
kind of uh

1081
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,520
reduces consciousness to something

1082
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,400
trivial um by saying that it's in

1083
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,760
everything like

1084
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,839
a proton is conscious because it's a

1085
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,520
triad of corks that have to be in a

1086
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,400
certain configuration so there is some

1087
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,040
minimal level of integrated information

1088
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,760
um that's not enough uh

1089
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,839
to get a conscious experience again

1090
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,800
observer um so saffron's integrated

1091
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
world modern theory says that you need a

1092
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,560
model with spatial temporal and causal

1093
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,760
coherence

1094
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,680
i would also argue that it requires

1095
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,319
self-modeling capacity

1096
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,599
talk about that a little bit at the end

1097
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,000
if anyone's interested but this theory

1098
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,839
is supposed to bridge mine with cosmic

1099
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,240
evolution

1100
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,920
so the story starts

1101
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,319
with the second law um

1102
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,920
daniel if there's any questions about

1103
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,640
that like intro let me know

1104
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,440
yeah i can just proceed could i ask two

1105
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,880
questions from the chat

1106
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,520
sure okay the first question is from

1107
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,599
blue blue wrote

1108
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,000
do you think that non-living autonomous

1109
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,599
agents with multiple competing

1110
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,240
priorities such as self-driving cars

1111
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,520
have free will

1112
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,680
if not what is the defining difference

1113
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,800
between these systems and humans

1114
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,880
uh no i don't think they have free will

1115
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,079
so um adaptive information is a special

1116
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,240
type of information i do think

1117
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,920
those things and this is kind of

1118
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,040
following sarah walker's lead

1119
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,680
who's at arizona state and she's also

1120
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,000
sfi faculty now but

1121
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,599
basically um

1122
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,839
to have self-driving cars you first need

1123
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:16,640
life

1124
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,520
so

1125
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,760
anything like a self-driving car that's

1126
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,240
like this information processing system

1127
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,760
uh if you

1128
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,240
were to come across a

1129
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,560
broken down self-driving car

1130
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,720
on some planet and you saw that you

1131
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,040
would have to infer that there was also

1132
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,800
life there because life is part of the

1133
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,280
trajectory to get to that

1134
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,920
but i wouldn't say that it has free will

1135
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,319
because it's just this input output

1136
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,760
machine uh with a defined set of

1137
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,040
algorithms

1138
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,920
and

1139
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,760
adaptive systems

1140
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,599
are more flexible uh and

1141
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,400
there

1142
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,720
okay so in the next

1143
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,800
next time we'll talk about

1144
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,359
actually the emergence of agency

1145
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,280
which occurs with the origin apply for

1146
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,880
abiogenesis

1147
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,599
and you basically um

1148
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,119
because this self-organized system that

1149
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,720
would be kind of like the protocell

1150
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,880
is evolving through a mechanism that a

1151
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,280
darwinian dynamic for self-organization

1152
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,599
that will explain in a bit it builds up

1153
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,079
information and at some point there's a

1154
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,839
phase transition or the information

1155
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,880
that's getting built up in the system uh

1156
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,520
basically uh gains

1157
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,599
what sarah walker and paul davies call

1158
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,119
informational control so there's a point

1159
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,760
where information actually starts

1160
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,359
calling the shots

1161
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,400
and

1162
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
you can see the difference

1163
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,160
between uh

1164
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,400
systems that where there is

1165
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,200
informational control uh so living

1166
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,920
systems and inanimate systems because

1167
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,119
for example

1168
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:55,920
um

1169
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,200
inanimate systems uh their movement can

1170
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,040
be predicted with newton's laws so

1171
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,599
anyone who's taken first year physics uh

1172
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,800
probably had to do an exercise where

1173
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,560
you're trying to predict the movement of

1174
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,359
some

1175
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,240
macroscopic system like a ball that gets

1176
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,000
kicked or pushed by

1177
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,520
a gust of wind and what you do is

1178
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,720
you um

1179
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,319
you have to draw out all the forces

1180
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,480
acting on the system and then you can

1181
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,760
understand where the system is going to

1182
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,480
go

1183
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,200
with life you don't need an external

1184
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,280
force for it to start for example

1185
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,240
climbing up hill um that's internally

1186
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,040
generated of course it's not magic

1187
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,720
the adaptive system the agent

1188
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,880
has stored energy that it's extracted

1189
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,040
from the environment so for example

1190
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,720
humans that have eaten food and there's

1191
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,599
a metabolic process that's driving this

1192
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:48,480
but

1193
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,280
uh still yeah you with living systems

1194
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,720
that where information has causal power

1195
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,880
basically the trajectory of the system

1196
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,480
can't be predicted

1197
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,520
by these fundamental laws of physics

1198
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,160
philip ball a journalist that

1199
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,800
has been talking about this

1200
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,720
his recent article which caused a lot of

1201
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,800
controversy between like

1202
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,560
the reductionists like talking about

1203
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,960
free will and agency um and there's a

1204
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,880
lot of confusion around that so people

1205
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,880
like jerry coyne were like trying to

1206
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,800
shoot it down and

1207
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,040
yeah hopefully i can talk about that um

1208
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,560
i guess we'll talk about that next time

1209
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,079
because there's a lot of

1210
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,240
uh confusion

1211
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,560
about what we're saying when we say

1212
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,800
something has agency or free will but

1213
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,599
his example is if you throw throw a ball

1214
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,760
and a bird off a tower

1215
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,640
and

1216
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,160
you can predict

1217
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,440
what one is going to do you can't

1218
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,800
predict what the other is going to do

1219
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,960
interestingly though i would say that

1220
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,800
the bird's not completely unpredictable

1221
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,480
you can predict that it's not going to

1222
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,000
hit the ground it's not going to splat

1223
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,119
on the ground

1224
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,040
it's going to fly away you have to

1225
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,960
understand the bird in terms of its

1226
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,200
goals so you have to understand

1227
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,359
you know the bird and its environment

1228
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,119
and the information that got built up

1229
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,119
through evolution

1230
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,800
and then we can start to predict the

1231
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,920
bird uh its statistical behavior so

1232
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,160
inanimate systems you can pretty much

1233
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,720
precisely predict the movement

1234
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,400
unless they're chaotic systems which is

1235
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,760
another story but with life um

1236
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,520
yeah it's not predictable in that same

1237
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,520
way with like low-level

1238
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,400
laws of physics but uh i'm arguing that

1239
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,400
actually life is more predictable than

1240
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,520
we thought

1241
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,760
but you need things like

1242
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,760
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics

1243
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,800
and

1244
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,480
for example uh

1245
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,040
free energy principle um

1246
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,119
so you can say that you know an organism

1247
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:41,920
will

1248
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,720
try to minimize free energy or

1249
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,200
minimize the difference between uh its

1250
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,240
model's

1251
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,160
prediction and reality so it will try to

1252
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,960
minimize prediction error and that's

1253
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,640
a way that we can start to describe uh

1254
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,839
behavior statistically

1255
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,440
um

1256
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,040
yo is there another one yep can i ask

1257
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,480
the second question

1258
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,880
yeah i i know i didn't completely

1259
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,440
answer that but uh that will require

1260
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,599
like the all the points that i would get

1261
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,200
into in the second talk but it's a great

1262
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,200
question yeah i would have written in a

1263
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,400
larger margin if i had more time

1264
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,720
the second question is from joseph clark

1265
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,839
who wrote

1266
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,319
uh first complimented your talk and let

1267
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,240
you knew that you were an interesting

1268
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,040
guy

1269
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,200
so then the question was

1270
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,240
how far

1271
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,560
do you think the universe can organize

1272
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,760
itself and what does that look like

1273
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,760
okay great that's a perfect question to

1274
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,440
lead into the next part and hopefully by

1275
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,599
the end of this

1276
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,359
we will have some sort of answer for

1277
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,079
that

1278
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,680
which is good because i when i started

1279
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,200
making the beginning of the presentation

1280
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,119
i was going to get to consciousness and

1281
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,040
free will and i ran out of time so

1282
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,400
there's been a lot of talk about things

1283
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,319
that i won't get to but that we will get

1284
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,119
to

1285
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,599
um so

1286
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,440
the story starts with the second law um

1287
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,680
so the second law of thermodynamics has

1288
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,599
popularly popularly understood says that

1289
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,480
uh systems naturally become increasingly

1290
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,599
disordered

1291
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,839
um that's really just because of the

1292
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,400
large-scale effects of chance so

1293
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,359
there are many ways to be disordered and

1294
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,640
there are relatively fewer ways to be

1295
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,160
patterned

1296
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,359
so

1297
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,440
a system that's this

1298
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,559
collective of particles so this evolving

1299
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:35,119
ensemble of particles

1300
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,079
will naturally tend to move towards a

1301
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,079
configuration that's completely spread

1302
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,800
out and mixed up there are no

1303
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,000
uh

1304
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,319
energy gradients so no work can be

1305
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,359
extracted that's a state of equilibrium

1306
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,920
so we are going to use this word

1307
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,240
thermodynamic equilibrium

1308
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,720
to mean death and disorder so life wants

1309
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,359
to resist the tendency towards

1310
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,839
equilibrium it wants to stay ordered

1311
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,680
uh what's interesting about this is that

1312
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,359
it applies to all this is kind of like

1313
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:08,720
where

1314
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,559
the free energy principle and for

1315
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,359
instance bayesian brain hypothesis it

1316
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,200
frames everything this way so i thought

1317
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,160
it was

1318
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,079
a good way to kind of frame it here is

1319
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,480
that you start with the second law and

1320
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,800
any conceivable system any ordered

1321
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,920
system for it to continue to persist has

1322
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,280
to resist this uh tendency

1323
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,240
so

1324
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,760
um

1325
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,960
basically

1326
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,000
uh schroedinger the guy everybody knows

1327
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,640
from quantum mechanics in the in the cat

1328
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,480
thought experiment he wrote a book

1329
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,000
called what is life in the 40s and

1330
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,319
basically kind of solved his paradox

1331
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,079
like if there's a second law and things

1332
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:49,599
become more disordered than what's with

1333
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,200
life and what's with the biosphere and

1334
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,520
all this complexity that we see around

1335
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,960
us

1336
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,119
and he explained actually boltzmann

1337
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,800
explained this before him

1338
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,839
um

1339
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,520
bud boltzmann said a lot to contradict

1340
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,559
this as well

1341
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:03,760
um

1342
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,599
or just didn't follow this to its

1343
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,520
implications but uh schrodinger

1344
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,559
explained that open systems uh by

1345
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,640
feeding off uh free energy in the

1346
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,559
environment so free energy is just

1347
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,440
energy that uh you can extract work from

1348
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,760
so it's ordered energy as opposed to

1349
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,920
energy that's been dissipated in the

1350
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,200
form of heat you can't extract energy uh

1351
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,119
uh useful energy from that energy it's

1352
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,559
still there it's just spread out and

1353
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,960
it's it's you can't harness it

1354
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,680
collecting it would cost more than you'd

1355
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,319
get out of it so um

1356
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,040
schrodinger explained that uh if a

1357
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,880
system can get free energy which he

1358
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,640
called negative entropy

1359
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,720
or energy uh neg entropies was called by

1360
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,359
uh someone later

1361
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,280
so to understand

1362
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,760
how ordered systems stay ordered

1363
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,559
uh

1364
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,000
you basically need to understand that

1365
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,599
they have to

1366
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,400
constantly be extracting free energy

1367
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,160
from the environment

1368
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,319
the moment that they can't

1369
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,800
extract more free energy is the moment

1370
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,440
that the system dies and decays to

1371
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,559
equilibrium so

1372
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,400
basically uh the second law is not

1373
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,720
violated by life because

1374
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,920
um

1375
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,839
in this effort to stay far from

1376
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,559
equilibrium life it keeps extracting

1377
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,480
that ordered free energy and keeps

1378
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,480
dissipating it as heat

1379
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,559
so and so it's basically exporting

1380
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:31,599
entropy

1381
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,640
into the environment so the order

1382
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,000
um

1383
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,160
that is maintained

1384
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,680
is paid for

1385
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,400
by

1386
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,119
the dissipated energy which come becomes

1387
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,359
thermal entropy so there are multiple

1388
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,960
definitions of entropy so you have

1389
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,559
thermal entropy which is heat entropy

1390
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,520
and then statistical entropy

1391
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,920
which explains thermal entropy but it

1392
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,440
has a broader domain of application so

1393
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,119
you can talk about

1394
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,359
shuffling a deck of cards

1395
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,920
and you can talk about like the

1396
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,800
statistical entropy increasing

1397
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,400
if the deck is ordered and it starts

1398
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,720
becoming mixed up through the shuffling

1399
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,040
but the deck of cards the thermal

1400
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,119
entropy uh isn't changing much at all so

1401
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,880
there's different types of entropy

1402
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,640
there's also information entropy which

1403
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,839
has to do with the um

1404
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,319
uh the number of messages that could be

1405
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,079
sent across the channel

1406
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:29,760
instead of um

1407
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,680
the number of states that a system can

1408
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,000
be in the number of microstates without

1409
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,440
changing the macro state macro state or

1410
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,800
the kind of

1411
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,359
collective properties of the system

1412
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:42,720
there's a really neat

1413
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,800
relationship between statistical entropy

1414
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,040
and information entropy

1415
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,559
which i won't talk about here it was

1416
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,880
really fleshed out by

1417
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,280
e.t janes

1418
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,839
but yeah so

1419
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,160
information and entropy like go hand in

1420
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,359
hand

1421
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,720
um just to

1422
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,319
give a little more context before we get

1423
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,720
into the details uh david deutsch and

1424
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,480
this great ted talk

1425
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,400
um called after billions of years of

1426
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,079
monotony the universe is waking up says

1427
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,920
if one can speak of a cosmic war it's a

1428
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,559
war between monotony and novelty between

1429
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,640
stasis and creativity and in this war

1430
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,440
our side is not destined to lose if we

1431
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,839
choose to apply our unique capacity to

1432
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,160
create explanatory knowledge we could

1433
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,040
win

1434
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,800
so that's very different than brian

1435
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,960
green's story and it kind of gets at the

1436
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,440
second question that was asked there how

1437
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,800
how far can this complexity increase go

1438
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,200
and so this kind of foreshadows that

1439
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,040
maybe it doesn't have a limit

1440
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,720
and that seems you know most people

1441
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,920
think that would go against the second

1442
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,960
half of their own dynamics we're going

1443
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,920
to see why that's not necessarily true

1444
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,400
but you can also see this cosmic war as

1445
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,720
this fight between order versus disorder

1446
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,640
life versus entropy

1447
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,319
and knowledge versus uncertainty or

1448
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,839
ignorance

1449
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,040
um but

1450
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,839
is life's battle against disorder uh

1451
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:02,559
good versus evil or yin and yang so i'm

1452
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,880
gonna kind of argue that these two

1453
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,720
things kind of

1454
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,400
have this uh

1455
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,240
you could describe their relationship as

1456
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,599
causally

1457
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,119
dependent and it's kind of like this

1458
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,800
dialectic between

1459
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,400
life and

1460
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,960
uh disorder um

1461
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,119
and it is through this

1462
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,440
sort of uh interaction

1463
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,839
that uh creates progress so we have some

1464
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:30,720
eastern ideas mentioned again um but i

1465
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,480
when i was writing the book a friend

1466
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,760
that

1467
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,520
practices buddhism called me and told me

1468
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,760
about this interdependent colorizing

1469
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,920
idea which i thought was really cool so

1470
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,119
we're going to come up with this what we

1471
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,599
call poppers principle which is

1472
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,839
problems create progress we're going to

1473
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,599
see that this problem

1474
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,599
of entropy that this tendency towards

1475
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:50,559
decay

1476
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,880
is what actually

1477
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,480
forces systems

1478
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,520
to evolve basically it forces them to

1479
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,480
search

1480
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,400
what's called the configuration space

1481
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,240
for the phase space for the state space

1482
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,160
to find configurations that are good at

1483
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,800
extracting energy and

1484
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,240
that allows it to stay far from

1485
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,599
equilibrium

1486
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,839
so we're going to have some figures soon

1487
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:14,160
so this stuff that's kind of abstract

1488
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,599
becomes a little bit more concrete

1489
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,400
just

1490
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,720
out of respect to the earlier request

1491
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,040
how about you check the time

1492
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,680
and feel then how fast you'd like to

1493
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,040
continue however much you want to

1494
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,480
present and then if you want to take any

1495
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,160
questions but first just

1496
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,599
check the time and let

1497
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,040
just i i

1498
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,800
i didn't uh

1499
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,160
i didn't

1500
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,160
notice when we started so about how long

1501
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,000
have i been going i would say five zero

1502
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,200
minutes

1503
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,480
really

1504
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,359
okay how long can we go

1505
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,359
we can go another

1506
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:52,799
uh 99 minutes okay

1507
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,400
um i'll try to go through it a little

1508
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,720
bit faster um

1509
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,160
but yeah so um

1510
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,480
but if we use all the time i told you

1511
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,119
yesterday that i was feeling uh oh i had

1512
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:07,280
a sore throat and uh the sore throat's

1513
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,880
better today i'm hopped up on cold

1514
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,559
medicine i'm sure i'm gonna

1515
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,280
i'm gonna pay for tomorrow but um

1516
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,960
yeah if we use all the time with

1517
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,200
questions that would be good uh so

1518
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,680
in our everyday experiment experience

1519
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,960
things don't

1520
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,160
naturally

1521
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,240
become ordered unless someone intervenes

1522
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,119
rooms get messier buildings erode

1523
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,839
uh so we already talked about this

1524
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,440
schrodinger's

1525
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,760
solution so we can think of life as a

1526
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,200
game

1527
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,040
so life has always been playing a game

1528
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,079
against the second law of thermodynamics

1529
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,319
there is another narrative that i won't

1530
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,119
go into but life is also an energy flow

1531
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,280
channel so life

1532
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,440
by existing in computing and trying to

1533
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,839
stay far from equilibrium

1534
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,359
is also increasing entropy uh actually

1535
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:00,000
the universe of life will increase

1536
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,160
entropy at a faster rate than a universe

1537
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,599
without life

1538
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,079
um which is pretty interesting so it's

1539
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,440
again not necessarily that life is like

1540
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,760
battling against entropy in in many ways

1541
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,920
it increases entropy but

1542
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,079
there's also this story i guess what

1543
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,520
it's trying to battle is a tendency

1544
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,200
towards disorder so it depends on what

1545
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,280
type of entropy you're talking about

1546
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,160
um

1547
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,240
so the challenge in the game of life

1548
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,400
which applies to you as well as other

1549
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,799
simpler adaptive systems is to resist

1550
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,599
that tendency so this gives life a goal

1551
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,720
or a tediology so two algae was

1552
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,400
associated with kind of this mystical

1553
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,000
thing but

1554
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,079
basically we'll we're seeing that

1555
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,079
tediology is just uh agency it's just a

1556
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:45,119
result

1557
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,799
goal-oriented behavior as a result of

1558
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,119
the information that's been

1559
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:52,720
accumulated over evolution so teleology

1560
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,280
the book uh tries to naturalize the

1561
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,920
theology and just say that they're these

1562
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,520
goal-oriented systems that behave

1563
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,559
different

1564
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,319
uh because

1565
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,240
they are acquiring information through

1566
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,079
darwinian evolution

1567
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:06,960
um

1568
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,720
so life has to extract free energy

1569
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,200
that's how it stays in the game of life

1570
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,760
and to extract free energy it's it's not

1571
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,119
a simple task so the computational task

1572
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,359
of extracting free energy

1573
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,480
uh requires that the uh system acquire

1574
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,319
information about its environment

1575
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,559
otherwise it can't find energy

1576
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,280
uh it also requires that the system

1577
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,520
model its environment so the information

1578
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,760
is creating this predictive model this

1579
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,119
generative model

1580
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,359
and it is

1581
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:40,640
um that model that allows it to

1582
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,000
continuously

1583
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,520
find free energy

1584
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,040
um so we will explain that life strategy

1585
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,119
is it searches through a configuration

1586
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,960
space for solutions to the problem of

1587
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,920
survival through trial and error search

1588
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,559
uh variation and selection so we we know

1589
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:59,119
about evolution there's this

1590
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,599
genetic variation in natural selection

1591
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,920
and uh we're going to argue that that

1592
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,799
process that mechanism is much broader

1593
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,720
the evolutionary mechanism is actually

1594
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,200
the mechanism of the scientific method

1595
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,839
and of adaptive learning um and that

1596
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:15,680
mechanism is also a process that

1597
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,520
accumulates evidence-based knowledge so

1598
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,200
it's also a process

1599
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,559
of bayesian inference we're going to

1600
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:22,799
explain why so here we have those

1601
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,079
different mechanisms with different

1602
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:25,440
names

1603
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,680
um

1604
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,960
so it's not included here but uh so if

1605
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,359
life is a game there are levels to this

1606
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,599
game uh and the levels we're going to

1607
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,240
see are these uh evolutionary

1608
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,200
transitions every time life graduates to

1609
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,119
this uh more

1610
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,480
uh complex uh hierarchical system like

1611
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,359
when

1612
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:49,440
single-celled organisms come together to

1613
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,200
form a multi-cellular organism and

1614
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,119
multicellular organisms come together to

1615
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,000
form

1616
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,599
communities like societies uh that you

1617
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:58,480
can

1618
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,599
view these evolutionary transitions as

1619
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,839
life graduating to a new level

1620
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:08,400
so um

1621
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,319
we're going to talk about how adaptive

1622
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:11,680
information gets built up through

1623
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,599
evolution and

1624
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,839
we're calling that knowledge it's nice

1625
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,319
to have that word knowledge because this

1626
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,400
process of an adaptive system acquiring

1627
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,880
this information is actually reducing

1628
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,040
its uncertainty about the environment so

1629
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,760
it's it's reducing its ignorance about

1630
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,400
all the ways the surrounding world could

1631
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,640
potentially surprise it

1632
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,760
uh so knowledge is a nice word some

1633
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,760
philosophers like old school

1634
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,640
philosophers might have issue with that

1635
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,200
um because in some

1636
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,799
teachings like knowledge is something

1637
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:46,799
that like conscious beings with like

1638
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:49,520
awareness have but we're calling any

1639
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,319
adaptive information knowledge and it's

1640
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:53,920
got more of a technical definition

1641
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,480
because knowledge is that information

1642
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,000
which reduces

1643
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,640
uh uncertainty and you could actually

1644
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,559
quantify this process of evolution

1645
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,000
terence deakin

1646
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,920
has talked a lot about how you can do

1647
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,720
that with uh information measures

1648
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,319
um

1649
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:13,520
so just to explain this why is knowledge

1650
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,280
something that matters like does it have

1651
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,160
causal power or is it all just this this

1652
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,920
billiard ball universe where it's like

1653
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,000
these particles bumping into each other

1654
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,240
and you can basically use

1655
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,160
uh fundamental laws of physics to

1656
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,559
describe like the trajectory of all the

1657
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,319
particles in the universe this is saying

1658
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:31,200
no

1659
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,200
that uh the information that gets built

1660
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,200
up through evolution has causal power

1661
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,240
such that these systems start to behave

1662
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,920
in ways that are different than what

1663
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,559
would be predicted from uh something our

1664
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,079
newton's laws

1665
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,040
so

1666
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,280
we also have this process of

1667
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,400
anti-accretion that sarah walker likes

1668
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,040
to talk about uh but anti so

1669
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,799
anti-accretion is

1670
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:55,200
uh basically we're familiar with uh

1671
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,319
planets pulling in matter so bodies like

1672
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,960
asteroids because uh gravity pulls

1673
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,079
matter in

1674
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,160
naturally but anti-accretion is when a

1675
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,319
planet is ejecting matter

1676
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:09,440
and uh in many cases what

1677
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,720
well so the the only time we really see

1678
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,160
anti-accretion uh is when you have a

1679
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,640
planet with life on it so

1680
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,400
um

1681
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,640
right now

1682
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,280
uh bits of biosphere so humans and space

1683
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,720
rockets are being sent to other

1684
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,160
celestial bodies so that's a form of

1685
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,079
anti-accretion uh sending up satellites

1686
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:35,680
you won't see a satellite get sent out

1687
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,240
if you see that in the universe like

1688
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,680
you're looking at some other solar

1689
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,599
system and you see

1690
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:42,720
a body

1691
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,799
uh sent out and put into orbit from a

1692
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:46,799
planet that's an indication that life is

1693
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:49,119
there that's a biosignature

1694
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,799
so she says that

1695
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,720
anti-christian requires comprehenders

1696
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,799
specifically the existence of physical

1697
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:58,720
systems with knowledge of newton's laws

1698
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,400
um

1699
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,400
so

1700
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,400
what does it all mean

1701
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,160
um it means we need knowledge uh to uh

1702
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,359
keep us out of thermodynamic equilibrium

1703
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,119
um

1704
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:14,480
so

1705
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,359
how do we acquire knowledge uh science

1706
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:18,720
is the most

1707
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,680
uh is the most salient example of the

1708
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,760
causal power of knowledge so

1709
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,400
science uh

1710
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,520
has uh eradicated lethal diseases built

1711
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,119
a global communication network called

1712
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:32,559
the internet and created weapons of

1713
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,359
apocalyptic power it's not always good

1714
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:38,000
this power of knowledge but um

1715
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,559
uh we see that there's something about

1716
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,480
the scientific method

1717
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,599
which is efficient at

1718
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,680
uh accumulating

1719
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,359
knowledge so we're going to talk about

1720
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,359
why and that's where we get into karl

1721
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,920
popper and evolutionary epistemology

1722
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:54,960
um

1723
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,240
so we know knowledge is important

1724
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,839
karl popper says we're always faced with

1725
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,760
practical problems and out of these grow

1726
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,599
sometimes theoretical problems before we

1727
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,920
try to solve some of our problems by

1728
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,760
proposing theories

1729
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,559
so uh

1730
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,359
popper stresses that all of science

1731
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:16,000
starts with a problem either theoretical

1732
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,359
or practical

1733
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:20,799
um and it is that problem that forces us

1734
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:23,440
to seek out a solution so we can already

1735
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,200
see why this

1736
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,839
principle that called poppers principle

1737
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:33,440
uh uh says that problems create progress

1738
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,359
so

1739
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:38,160
some of these theories that we make to

1740
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,000
try to solve our problems will be wrong

1741
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,440
they'll be errors

1742
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,680
um but the idea with science is that

1743
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,839
those errors get filtered out

1744
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,559
by a process of testing your theories

1745
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:51,119
and a peer review process which gives

1746
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,559
criticism

1747
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:56,319
so uh knowledge is really uh for

1748
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:58,559
knowledge for us to know

1749
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,799
that some piece of information is

1750
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:01,760
knowledge

1751
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,760
it really needs to be tested

1752
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,119
and uh we call that evidence-based

1753
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:08,799
knowledge or evidence-based information

1754
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:10,400
so it's really the only true kind of

1755
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,799
knowledge because you don't know if

1756
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:16,000
something's true until you test it

1757
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,960
for example um

1758
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,720
the world doesn't look round from a

1759
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,760
naive perspective it looks flat so for

1760
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,359
example um

1761
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:30,799
someone who had the first idea you know

1762
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:32,880
and i'm sure it was before anybody

1763
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,799
famous we knew someone had this idea and

1764
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:36,720
probably people blew it off

1765
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,279
but um

1766
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,760
some things that are true about reality

1767
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,079
are not immediate immediately apparent

1768
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:46,400
from like sensory observation from since

1769
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,480
data so we really need to test our

1770
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,039
theories if we are going to be sure

1771
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:53,440
about them um so what popper found out

1772
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,039
was the scientific method is an

1773
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,520
algorithm he called that algorithm

1774
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,760
conjecture and refutation

1775
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,760
and uh

1776
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,839
basically this is the method of

1777
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:05,839
hypothesis testing so you have a problem

1778
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:07,200
you believe can be solved you make an

1779
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,599
informed guess or conjecture to see if

1780
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,680
your theory can be refuted uh prove

1781
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,799
false by testing its predictions

1782
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:15,839
so

1783
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,000
uh people have pointed out like john

1784
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,119
campbell

1785
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,039
uh carl fristen that

1786
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,440
science is a process of inference so it

1787
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,119
recognizes statistical patterns and

1788
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:26,720
trends in nature that we can use to make

1789
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,200
increasingly accurate predictions

1790
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,720
it would not be inaccurate then to say

1791
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,079
that the functional purpose of science

1792
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:35,200
is to generate predictive knowledge

1793
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,359
and we can characterize that as process

1794
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:39,280
of inference which basically means that

1795
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,960
scientists draw logical conclusions

1796
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,720
about the way the world works

1797
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,280
uh based on evidence-based information

1798
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,960
acquired in the past

1799
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,559
but with never present awareness that

1800
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:52,079
the information can and will lead to

1801
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,319
um

1802
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,319
to new conclusions and deeper

1803
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,240
understanding so

1804
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,839
when we recognize this we also have to

1805
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:01,359
recognize that all of our models will

1806
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:03,200
have uncertainty

1807
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,400
so we should never think that our

1808
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,559
model's right every model is going to be

1809
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:08,720
proved wrong in some way but through the

1810
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,319
scientific process uh the idea is that

1811
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:14,640
we get closer and closer to truth so we

1812
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,440
can never reach perfect truth but in

1813
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,240
this model you can actually get closer

1814
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,480
to it so in some senses it's different

1815
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,400
than like post-modernist philosophy that

1816
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,480
says there is no objective truth there

1817
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,119
is an objective truth um

1818
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:31,280
uh but we can never know it but we can

1819
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,200
get closer to it

1820
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,720
so

1821
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,400
once popper understood that knowledge

1822
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,760
the knowledge generating mechanism

1823
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,760
behind science success was conjecture

1824
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,680
and reputation he realized that human

1825
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:42,960
learning which begins at birth and

1826
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,960
continues to adapt uses the same

1827
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,640
problem-solving algorithm

1828
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,240
although the developmental psychology

1829
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,160
literature called the method trial and

1830
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,599
error

1831
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,280
so because life is constantly presenting

1832
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,799
us with new challenges such as the need

1833
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:56,319
to get from one place to another a

1834
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:57,920
problem that inspires babies to learn to

1835
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,839
walk we must constantly try out new

1836
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:01,839
behavioral solutions we can think of

1837
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:03,839
these actions as guesses about how to

1838
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:05,920
survive or if you prefer experiments in

1839
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,400
evading equilibrium or predictions for

1840
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,680
persistence

1841
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,839
and they will often fail

1842
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:15,359
um so

1843
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,119
this is dan dinette's idea of life

1844
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,799
exploring this design space we're going

1845
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:20,160
to talk about how it does so through

1846
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,760
evolution but we're still talking about

1847
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,839
science here and adaptive learning on

1848
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,440
abstract level we can imagine a certain

1849
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,039
practical problem as a challenge one

1850
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:28,480
with a solution that exists somewhere

1851
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,559
out there in the space of possibilities

1852
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:31,920
just waiting to be found by someone

1853
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,319
sufficiently motivated and clever

1854
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:35,680
it may take some time but if the

1855
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,599
possibilities face the space of possible

1856
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,599
solutions is continuously explored in an

1857
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,119
efficient way

1858
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,920
eventually a solution will be discovered

1859
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,920
so excuse me trial and error learning

1860
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:50,240
explores the solution space um

1861
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,119
so

1862
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:52,640
just to give you a

1863
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,760
clear example of how adaptive learning

1864
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,400
uh is kind of this form of hypothesis

1865
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,559
testing so whenever we have a problem in

1866
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:01,920
life and we don't know the correct

1867
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,000
solution to a problem in advance

1868
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
um we naturally begin with those

1869
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,680
potential solutions that are closer to

1870
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,839
our starting point in the solution space

1871
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:12,079
for sampling so for example if a baby

1872
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:14,400
reaches for its bottle and barely misses

1873
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,399
it'll adjust its behavior slightly which

1874
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:20,399
minimizes the chances of making an error

1875
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:21,359
so

1876
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,040
our instincts may nudge us in the

1877
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,120
general direction of a solution but the

1878
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,359
instinct alone is not enough

1879
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:28,799
uh

1880
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,120
we have to try out what you could call a

1881
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:34,000
behavioral conjecture and when it fails

1882
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,279
uh we

1883
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,600
try something new so that's kind of like

1884
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,960
a new theory

1885
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,960
and it's essentially the old one but

1886
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,960
with a little twist

1887
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,880
and if that behavioral solution is

1888
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,839
remembered then it gets stored for

1889
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:50,399
future use ready to be repeated

1890
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,799
but also adapted if necessary

1891
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:53,759
um

1892
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,679
but in humans so

1893
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,799
the baby example reaching for the bottle

1894
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:00,560
let's say it misses the bottle it won't

1895
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,238
get a reward signal it won't get a

1896
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,399
little surge of dopamine so if it

1897
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:06,719
corrects and it gets closer it gets a

1898
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:08,719
little reward signal this is

1899
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:10,560
reinforcement learning but basically

1900
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,399
this adaptive learning process is a

1901
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,520
process of making theories and

1902
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,839
eliminating those theories that are

1903
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:20,479
errors

1904
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:21,759
so

1905
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:23,198
uh

1906
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:26,479
popper saw that scientific knowledge

1907
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:28,799
and the evolutionary process

1908
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:31,600
were also connected so not only is

1909
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,719
science

1910
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:34,719
uh adaptive learning

1911
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,600
uh both of those things are extensions

1912
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,080
of the evolutionary process so he says

1913
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,920
in science theories are highly

1914
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,600
competitive we discuss them critically

1915
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,960
we test them and we eliminate those

1916
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,479
theories which we judge to be less good

1917
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:48,000
in solving the problems which we wish to

1918
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
solve so only the best theories those

1919
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,279
which are most fit survive in the

1920
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:53,520
struggle this is the way science grows

1921
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,320
um so that's kind of nice like showing

1922
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,199
you

1923
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,760
really how this is an evolutionary

1924
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:00,800
process

1925
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,120
um not only is science an evolutionary

1926
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,760
process the converse is true evolution

1927
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,360
is a scientific process so

1928
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,600
it is clear this is another quote it is

1929
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,360
clear that this view of the progress of

1930
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,280
science is very similar to darwin's view

1931
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,719
of natural selection by the way of the

1932
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:19,120
elimination of the unfit

1933
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,719
of the errors in the evolution of life

1934
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:23,040
the errors the attempts at adaptation

1935
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,719
which is a trial and error process

1936
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:27,520
analogously science works by trial

1937
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,320
theory making and by the elimination of

1938
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,480
heirs um

1939
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,000
i might pause in a second just to

1940
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,719
see if everybody understands this but i

1941
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:40,800
have a few more slides so

1942
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,000
um evolutionary algorithms uh also use

1943
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,920
this mechanism but it's called generate

1944
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,120
and test

1945
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,239
so i didn't mention this uh the

1946
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:52,159
mechanism of evolution is variation in

1947
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,520
selection so

1948
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,640
we have

1949
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,040
these algorithms that are equivalent

1950
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,880
conjecture and reputation trial and

1951
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,520
error variation and selection we also

1952
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,600
have generate and test so in machine

1953
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,199
learning evolutionary algorithms

1954
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:09,600
have this method

1955
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,520
generating tests

1956
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,679
possible solutions are generated into an

1957
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:15,679
actual solution is found and these

1958
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:17,280
solutions accumulate in some memory

1959
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,640
store while the errors are filtered out

1960
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,320
and forgotten

1961
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,840
in science solutions our theories are

1962
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,040
models that activate predicts the

1963
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,560
natural phenomenon

1964
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,360
and the successful ones accumulate in

1965
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,360
peer-reviewed journals and textbooks

1966
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,400
so

1967
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,080
um

1968
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,000
we see that these processes are

1969
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,360
equivalent we're actually going to see

1970
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,520
that it's this bayesian process

1971
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,520
uh that adaptation

1972
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,400
is also a process of

1973
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,600
uh the model of the organism uh becoming

1974
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,560
optimized uh decreasing its prediction

1975
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,480
error so that can more efficiently

1976
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,360
extract free energy from an itch to stay

1977
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,199
ordered

1978
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:57,440
so

1979
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:00,320
we get this principle um that all

1980
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,159
evolutionary processes are learning

1981
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,800
processes and all learning processes are

1982
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,120
evolutionary processes

1983
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,360
conrad lawrence a nobel prize-winning

1984
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,960
zoologist

1985
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,600
was also a pioneer of evolutionary

1986
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,000
epistemology and he made the statement

1987
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,400
life is a cognitive process

1988
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,760
um

1989
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,040
so

1990
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,400
if this is true and there's this

1991
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,760
functional equivalence between the

1992
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,600
mechanisms driving evolution learning

1993
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,719
and science

1994
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:30,080
then that implies that adaptation

1995
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:34,000
uh or the genetic information that

1996
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,600
corresponds to those physical

1997
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,040
adaptations

1998
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,480
are uh

1999
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,679
equivalent

2000
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,760
is equivalent to scientific knowledge

2001
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,920
they're actually the same thing so

2002
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,360
to kind of make this relationship clear

2003
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,120
biological adaptation represents

2004
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,400
knowledge of the environment and the

2005
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,679
knowledge we acquire through learning

2006
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,440
and science reflects adaptation to the

2007
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,560
environment

2008
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,920
so we see that there's no meaningful

2009
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,760
distinction between adaptive information

2010
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,600
and scientific knowledge both allow life

2011
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,199
to predict an uncertain world control

2012
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:03,280
matter constrain chaos and construct

2013
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,120
order from this order

2014
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,640
so the very same property that is

2015
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,480
responsible for organic matter leaving

2016
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,560
the planet in spaceships so this

2017
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,440
anti-aggression uh is the same

2018
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,320
uh property that allows organisms to

2019
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,760
climb up hill

2020
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,159
seemingly defying the force of gravity

2021
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,080
of course uh the laws of physics aren't

2022
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,120
violated in any way but uh

2023
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,239
living systems are not uh constrained by

2024
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:30,239
the laws of physics the way inanimate

2025
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,360
systems are

2026
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,520
so some examples a dolphin streamline

2027
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,199
design which is a product of the

2028
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,640
information stored in its genome

2029
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,840
contains the knowledge of hydrodynamics

2030
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,760
an eagle's wing design contains the

2031
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,520
knowledge of aerodynamics not only can

2032
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,040
we be certain that engineers see

2033
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,440
knowledge in these functional structures

2034
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,400
uh

2035
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,679
there should be little doubt that they

2036
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:53,920
inspired uh

2037
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,000
our machines and and without that

2038
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,679
information i don't think we would have

2039
01:13:57,679 --> 01:13:58,960
come to those

2040
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,640
inventions at least not any time soon

2041
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,760
um

2042
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,360
camouflage

2043
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,880
on an organism

2044
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,239
represents knowledge of the environment

2045
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:11,679
so

2046
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,239
kind of bridging this idea of

2047
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:16,239
evolutionary epistemology that evolution

2048
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:18,560
builds up knowledge and that science is

2049
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,560
an extension of the evolutionary process

2050
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:24,159
making a bridge between that and

2051
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,840
bayesian inference

2052
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,920
uh requires this uh relationship between

2053
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,640
adaptation and statistical correlation

2054
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,280
so physicist carlo revelli which who has

2055
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,239
gotten really interested in explaining

2056
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:40,719
how this information

2057
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:43,280
that underlies agency that behavior that

2058
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,520
we see with living systems gets built up

2059
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,360
through evolution uh

2060
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,000
he wrote a great essay it

2061
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,480
won the foundational questions institute

2062
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,080
essay contest

2063
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,520
um

2064
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,320
a few years ago but um this work was

2065
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,800
based on the work of david wolpert and

2066
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,560
artem kolczynski artemy kolczynski and

2067
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,840
basically

2068
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,760
uh shows how this

2069
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,159
adaptation builds up information in the

2070
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,080
system that information

2071
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,159
is really statistical correlation

2072
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,159
between the organism and its environment

2073
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:17,120
so

2074
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,040
here's the simplest example it's a

2075
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,320
bacterium performing chemotaxis

2076
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,760
so bacteria so chemotaxis is basically

2077
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:26,719
uh

2078
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:28,880
a bacterium will uh swim in the

2079
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,679
direction of food and swim away from

2080
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:34,480
toxins so basically it's detecting this

2081
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,840
chemical gradient that follows

2082
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,880
um but

2083
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,960
so we can see in this example

2084
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,280
um and this isn't the case for all

2085
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,880
species but you can imagine that a

2086
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,480
bacterium that swings to the left when

2087
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,400
nutrients are on the left

2088
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,760
uh prospers compared to a bacterium that

2089
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,560
swims at random

2090
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:55,760
so

2091
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,520
uh

2092
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,880
with this

2093
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,719
behavior where it's swimming towards

2094
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:02,480
food

2095
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,960
that is the product of a chance mutation

2096
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,719
so it's in in some sense it's an

2097
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,719
accident but when it discovers that

2098
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:10,320
solution

2099
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,320
that organism

2100
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,560
is more likely to reproduce

2101
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,480
so that solution

2102
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,560
gets retained in the population it gets

2103
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,199
sort of frozen hardwired in

2104
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:22,480
and

2105
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,040
so the process of adaptation is a

2106
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,239
process that builds up a statistical

2107
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:29,840
correlation between

2108
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,840
the system the agent

2109
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,840
and its environment

2110
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,080
and so that

2111
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,679
shared statistical correlation

2112
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,760
represents mutual information so mutual

2113
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,560
information is information that's shared

2114
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,199
between the environment and the organism

2115
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:46,840
and

2116
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:49,120
uh just to explain that a little bit

2117
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,239
more

2118
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,159
uh this correlation

2119
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:54,800
uh basically as this correlation gets

2120
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,640
built up it's creating predictive

2121
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:57,679
knowledge

2122
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,280
so um

2123
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:02,960
john maynard smith cites friedretzky who

2124
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,199
did kind of the pioneering work applying

2125
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:07,440
shannon's information theory to try to

2126
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,920
quantify evolution

2127
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,679
so dredsky argues that if some variable

2128
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:13,360
a is correlated with the second variable

2129
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,040
b then we can say that b carries

2130
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,120
information about a for example if the

2131
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,640
occurrence of rain is correlated with a

2132
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,719
particular cloud then the type of cloud

2133
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,480
tells us whether it would rain

2134
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,760
so that's from a great essay called the

2135
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,960
concept of information biology

2136
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,080
so

2137
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,520
we can see

2138
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,000
that you have this little

2139
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,800
rhyming equation here adaptation

2140
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,360
equals statistical correlation equals

2141
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,120
mutual information

2142
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,360
uh and because that uh

2143
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:44,400
shared information allows the organism

2144
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,800
to predict its environment better

2145
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,520
this process is also a process of model

2146
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,920
optimization so the predictive model of

2147
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,000
the organism

2148
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,840
as it adapts starts to become more

2149
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,600
accurate and so this whole process can

2150
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,640
be seen

2151
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:05,360
as a free energy minimization process

2152
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,360
of course that's information theoretic

2153
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,440
free energy it's the free energy of for

2154
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:10,800
instance principle we're not talking

2155
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,840
about thermodynamic free energy anyone

2156
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,679
wants to ask a question or gets confused

2157
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:17,120
about that

2158
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,239
let me know

2159
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:20,719
but it's basically uh those things are

2160
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:22,080
related and it's something that's not

2161
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,719
mentioned enough uh

2162
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:27,199
minimizing information theoretic free

2163
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:29,120
energy which is just

2164
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,199
minimizing the prediction error of your

2165
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:32,159
model

2166
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:35,920
is what allows the organism to minimize

2167
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,920
environmental free energy

2168
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:38,640
so

2169
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,760
by acquiring information reducing

2170
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,000
your information theoretic free energy

2171
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,360
allows

2172
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,159
the organism to extract energy

2173
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:49,440
and reduce

2174
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,719
thermodynamic

2175
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:52,560
free energy it minimizes the free energy

2176
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:53,920
in the environment converts it into

2177
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,400
entropy

2178
01:18:58,239 --> 01:18:59,840
so

2179
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,760
we kind of see how this is getting into

2180
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,520
universal bayesianism as it becomes more

2181
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,040
correlated it gains information about

2182
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,440
its niche and therefore becomes a better

2183
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,280
predictor of that niche

2184
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,480
um

2185
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,800
so that's what adaptation is it's the

2186
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,400
genome of the species accumulating

2187
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,159
information that reduces the average

2188
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:18,000
organism's uncertainty regarding the

2189
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,560
environment

2190
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,640
so um the genome is a knowledge

2191
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,960
repository of solutions to environmental

2192
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,159
challenges

2193
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:30,159
that allows an organism with no brain

2194
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:32,640
and no mind to anticipate events in the

2195
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,239
environment so in this theory as i

2196
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,080
mentioned before consciousness comes

2197
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,000
later it comes with self-modeling

2198
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,199
capacity

2199
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:42,000
and a bacterium

2200
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,640
would be kind of a zombie agent it would

2201
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,560
have agency and it would move with

2202
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,840
purpose

2203
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:51,040
but that is not enough for mind or at

2204
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,960
least mind

2205
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,800
defined as consciousness

2206
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,960
uh if you want to say that mind is just

2207
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,040
information processing then yes there is

2208
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,199
mind in these systems but that's

2209
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:02,560
very different than saying that the

2210
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,360
system has a subjective experience

2211
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,520
and a first person perspective

2212
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,600
that will come in the next talk but that

2213
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,880
uh it's it's harder

2214
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:13,920
so

2215
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,440
that information stored in memory is

2216
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,120
integrated into a statistical or

2217
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,120
predictive model that determines the

2218
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,040
causal control system's behavioral

2219
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,960
repertoire or the full range of

2220
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,440
behaviors an organism is capable of and

2221
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,360
it is this mapping of sensory inputs to

2222
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,679
motor outputs that makes the organism

2223
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:31,520
move in ways that we normally associate

2224
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,760
with mind or consciousness

2225
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,719
um carl fursten in a great eon article

2226
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:38,639
says all biological processes can be

2227
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:40,320
construed as performing some form of

2228
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:43,040
inference i think i already read that

2229
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,520
but the free energy principle for those

2230
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,760
aren't familiar

2231
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,920
we've already explained it but the

2232
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,000
bayesian brain hypothesis

2233
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,440
and the free energy principle are the

2234
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,639
same thing

2235
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:56,159
uh the difference is that the free

2236
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:58,719
energy principle applies to

2237
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,960
all other adaptive systems where the

2238
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,440
other one is just focusing on brains but

2239
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:06,080
first and realize that this you know is

2240
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,120
a model

2241
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,199
and a process that

2242
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:11,120
applies to any system that's trying to

2243
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,600
resist the tendency towards disorder so

2244
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,040
any system

2245
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,440
to stay to continue persisting longer

2246
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,199
than we would expect

2247
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:22,159
uh naturally it must engage in bayesian

2248
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:24,159
like learning to deal with environmental

2249
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:25,920
uncertainty

2250
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,840
how much time do i have left roughly

2251
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,679
uh

2252
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:33,840
still more than enough

2253
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,600
okay keep going

2254
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,600
um i'm definitely

2255
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,600
more than half through i'd say i'm two

2256
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,960
thirds of the way through

2257
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:44,719
so uh john campbell has this great uh

2258
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:46,800
paper called universal darwinism as a

2259
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,320
process of bayesian inference that i

2260
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,239
kept coming across

2261
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,239
as i was trying to understand

2262
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:54,480
uh non-equilibrium thermodynamics and

2263
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,280
information theory um

2264
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,600
yeah i should say actually

2265
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,320
i should have gotten the books uh showed

2266
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,159
you each book but um

2267
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:05,520
there's a great book called the origin

2268
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,840
and nature of life on earth by santa fe

2269
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,040
institutes eric smith and harold

2270
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,840
morowitz uh morowitz was a professor of

2271
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,040
mine eric uh is a friend that uh we

2272
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:18,000
would have these foundations of the mind

2273
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,159
uh guild it was like a consciousness

2274
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,080
club that would meet at the krasnow

2275
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,800
institute where i got my phd

2276
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,080
and um so their book the origin of life

2277
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:31,040
on the origin of life in chapter eight

2278
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,960
actually gets into this

2279
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,000
information theory and uh this this

2280
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,600
bayesian inference and describes the

2281
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,000
origin of life and the evolution

2282
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,480
of life as a

2283
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,960
process of bayesian model selection

2284
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,120
and so that was kind of what connected

2285
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,199
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to

2286
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:52,080
these to this bayesian brain hypothesis

2287
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,679
and i realized that you know these

2288
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:55,360
theories were kind of

2289
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,880
converging on the same ideas so john

2290
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,960
campbell wrote this paper in 2016 he

2291
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,639
says bayesian inference is an algorithm

2292
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:04,400
for the accumulation of evidence-based

2293
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,639
knowledge this algorithm is now seen to

2294
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:08,159
operate over a wide range of

2295
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:10,239
evolutionary processes including natural

2296
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:12,239
selection the evolution of mental models

2297
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:14,320
and cultural evolutionary processes

2298
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,840
notably including science itself

2299
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,199
so

2300
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,600
uh when we say that evolution is a

2301
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,159
process of bayesian model selection and

2302
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:25,600
the book i mentioned with eric and

2303
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,080
morowitz actually characterize evolution

2304
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,159
as an inference engine

2305
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:32,719
uh we're basically saying that when

2306
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:36,480
organisms that aren't fit get weeded out

2307
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,280
uh

2308
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,679
that's basically models that aren't

2309
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:40,880
predictive

2310
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,000
getting eliminated so the organisms that

2311
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,199
persist

2312
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:46,639
are the models

2313
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:47,840
that were able to predict the

2314
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,920
environment best so inference and

2315
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,360
prediction

2316
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,600
are kind of the same thing uh since the

2317
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:54,960
word inference is

2318
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:59,199
a little obscure i guess um so

2319
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,800
just to make this point a little more

2320
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,560
clear

2321
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,159
since nature is complex and

2322
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:06,080
intrinsically unpredictable

2323
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,040
uh

2324
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,960
the model of an organism is at some

2325
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,440
point guaranteed to fail when reality

2326
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,719
surprises it

2327
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:14,840
with the unexpected

2328
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,600
so and that's what the free energy

2329
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,159
principle is about minimizing surprise

2330
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:22,080
is the same thing as minimizing

2331
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,679
prediction error

2332
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:26,000
so an organism gets eaten by a predator

2333
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,320
a baby fails to reach his bottle a

2334
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,400
scientific theory fails to explain new

2335
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,440
data

2336
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,280
um

2337
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,440
basically when any of these things

2338
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:36,880
happens it means that the model used to

2339
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,159
predict reality is not completely

2340
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:39,199
accurate

2341
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,239
it contains a certain amount of

2342
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:41,679
prediction error needs to be corrected

2343
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:43,920
so what's the solution try something new

2344
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,520
the old model worked well enough up to

2345
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,520
that point so don't ditch it just vary

2346
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,440
it a bit and see if it performs better

2347
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,440
if it does not reduce surprise eliminate

2348
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,600
that variant and try again if prediction

2349
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,120
error is reduced replace the old model

2350
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,480
with the new one so that it becomes the

2351
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,920
reigning theory and the design template

2352
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,480
for new variants to be based upon

2353
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,000
when a model has been updated in this

2354
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,159
way due to natural selection adaptive

2355
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:05,920
learning or experimental testing we can

2356
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,600
say that knowledge has been acquired and

2357
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,520
environmental uncertainty reduced

2358
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,320
so here we have an image um i should say

2359
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,840
that uh infinity maps uh german software

2360
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,760
mapping company uh helped me create

2361
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,040
these images

2362
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,440
uh oliver wanna i have to give a big

2363
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,639
thanks to him

2364
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:27,280
um this image has a little bit more

2365
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,080
going on than i would want right now but

2366
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,880
you could see that um

2367
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,199
basically

2368
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:37,760
this represents two

2369
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,280
different mechanisms for learning

2370
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,120
and adaptation so this one on the top

2371
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,880
that we're going to talk about first is

2372
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,080
the normal

2373
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,480
uh competitive evolution sort of

2374
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,520
darwinian survival of the fittest

2375
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,600
while this mechanism over here is the

2376
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:56,639
mechanism of self-organization

2377
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:58,639
so let's first

2378
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:00,320
talk about the normal

2379
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,639
type of evolution we're familiar with

2380
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:04,400
and show that

2381
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,280
how this process of evolution that works

2382
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,520
through variation and selection

2383
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,520
actually uh

2384
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,639
generates

2385
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:15,679
predictive information and

2386
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:18,000
creates a a model

2387
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,159
which is

2388
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:21,120
which

2389
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,400
encodes knowledge

2390
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,600
of the

2391
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,600
biologically relevant

2392
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,400
regularities in the environment so first

2393
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,000
we have this

2394
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,760
this is a

2395
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,120
bacterium over here and so

2396
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,760
this is the simplest model um you have

2397
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,159
an organism that's an embodied theory or

2398
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:41,920
a best guess about how to stay far from

2399
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,080
equilibrium so

2400
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,800
evolutionary epistemology sees organisms

2401
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,920
themselves

2402
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,719
as embodied theories so evolution is

2403
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:52,239
basically

2404
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:54,639
testing these different models

2405
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:55,840
so

2406
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:59,520
uh it basically reproduces and we know

2407
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:03,679
that because there are going to be um

2408
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:06,719
heirs in uh

2409
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:09,440
in that process uh the genome will get

2410
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,560
changed

2411
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,520
uh

2412
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,520
slightly and you will get

2413
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,360
a generation

2414
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,639
of progeny that all are slightly

2415
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:19,520
different

2416
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,480
they have slightly different

2417
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,960
configurations

2418
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,400
some of these configurations will be

2419
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,760
better at extracting energy in

2420
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,840
predicting the environment than others

2421
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,400
and the ones that

2422
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:31,520
aren't good at predicting the

2423
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,040
environment they get filtered out by

2424
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,639
natural selection

2425
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:36,880
so here we see design four

2426
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:38,320
is the winning design because it's the

2427
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:39,840
best predictor and it's the best

2428
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,920
predictor because it's the best

2429
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,159
extractor of energy

2430
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:45,120
and

2431
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,920
so that uh design

2432
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:48,960
uh

2433
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,840
that that organism gets to reproduce and

2434
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,639
then you have another generation

2435
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:56,800
uh of designs that are slightly

2436
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:57,679
different

2437
01:27:57,679 --> 01:28:00,480
and this process is an iterative process

2438
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,159
just like science

2439
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:04,320
and hypothesis testing so

2440
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,320
um over generations

2441
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,679
you will start to get uh designs that

2442
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:10,639
are

2443
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:12,840
better adapted to the

2444
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,600
environment which we've explained means

2445
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:16,880
that

2446
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,040
they will be more correlated with the

2447
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,639
environment

2448
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:23,679
and being more correlated means being a

2449
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:25,920
better predictor

2450
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:26,880
um

2451
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,600
so the knowledge that's left over after

2452
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,920
this process is the adaptive information

2453
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,480
stored in genetic material that reduces

2454
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,159
environmental uncertainty and you see

2455
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:37,600
that this process

2456
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,480
will

2457
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,639
ultimately lead to the evolution

2458
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:42,960
towards the the best possible design so

2459
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,040
it's it's an optimization a lot of

2460
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:46,480
people don't think

2461
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,239
that evolution is optimizing anything

2462
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,400
there's been this you know kind of

2463
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:53,280
philosophy that evolution does just good

2464
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,159
enough

2465
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:56,800
but we actually see that in terms of the

2466
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,560
computation that it does to stay far

2467
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,320
from equilibrium

2468
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,960
that it's actually optimized for being

2469
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,239
almost

2470
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:06,560
maximally efficient with its use of

2471
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,520
energy

2472
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,880
it approaches something close to what's

2473
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,960
called the land hour limit which david

2474
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,199
wahlberg at sfi is written about

2475
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:15,199
but uh

2476
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:18,000
life is much more efficient uh with

2477
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,560
computation in terms of energy

2478
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:23,120
uh supply needed compared to all of our

2479
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:26,480
technology so the human brain can do

2480
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,880
uh solve problems that even our best

2481
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,040
like ai systems can't solve and it does

2482
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:35,520
so running on uh the equivalent of one

2483
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,440
household light bulb

2484
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,320
so we'll come back to this

2485
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,920
self-organization

2486
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,040
process

2487
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,800
oh well actually we'll get into that

2488
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,400
right now so

2489
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:47,440
this is the normal uh process that we

2490
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:48,800
think about when we think about

2491
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,560
evolution generating

2492
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,040
knowledge predictive knowledge

2493
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,880
and so that's called phylogenetic

2494
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,760
learning uh phylogenetic refers to these

2495
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,760
like generations so

2496
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,920
learning is generational the organisms

2497
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,760
don't really learn because they don't

2498
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,480
have brains they're not able to update

2499
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,560
their model in real time so learning is

2500
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,960
at the level of the population

2501
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:13,280
and for learning to occur organisms have

2502
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,440
to die before brains

2503
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:17,600
basically you have to have this

2504
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,639
uh competition uh

2505
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:23,280
for there to be a learning process

2506
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,800
however

2507
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,800
there's also self-organization when

2508
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,760
these organisms don't compete but

2509
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,920
actually find a configuration find it

2510
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,920
discover collective configuration

2511
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,679
through their

2512
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:37,600
somewhat random interactions with each

2513
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,560
other

2514
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,560
and when they find this collective

2515
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,320
configuration through trial and error

2516
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:47,440
basically the configurations that are

2517
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,280
better at extracting energy will be the

2518
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,400
ones

2519
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,639
that are retained

2520
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:53,920
um

2521
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,159
so

2522
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:58,080
donald campbell

2523
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,639
father of evolutionary epistemology

2524
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:02,800
uh explain this process this

2525
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,800
evolutionary process

2526
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:07,040
by which self-organization works as

2527
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:10,320
blind variation and selective retention

2528
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,000
or we can think of it as selection for

2529
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,080
persistence or stability

2530
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,480
so fitness kind of

2531
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,159
there's a dawkins quote i think i come

2532
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:20,639
out where richard dawkins said darwin's

2533
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:21,840
uh

2534
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:24,239
survival of the fittest is really

2535
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:25,440
um

2536
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,120
just a

2537
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,360
more specific instance of a more general

2538
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,920
law of survival of the stable

2539
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,760
so when we think about

2540
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,120
being fit

2541
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,760
at the beginning we're talking about

2542
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:40,320
just being uh stable being able to find

2543
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,560
energy if you can't do that it doesn't

2544
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,560
matter whether you have agents that

2545
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,199
you're competing with or not because

2546
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:48,960
if you can't get energy it doesn't

2547
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:49,920
matter if there are other people

2548
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,239
competing for it that you won't survive

2549
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:53,600
so

2550
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,000
you don't need replication

2551
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,600
with variation

2552
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,080
to evolve that's what this is this model

2553
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,040
is saying

2554
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,120
um and stuart kaufman from the santa fe

2555
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,719
institute has

2556
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:06,080
been talking about the importance of

2557
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,840
this marriage between

2558
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,000
darwinian evolution and

2559
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,639
self-organization

2560
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:14,159
but basically uh because there's not

2561
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:17,120
this replication process

2562
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,760
this is how evolution occurs so you have

2563
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,440
a system

2564
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:24,960
that's a collection of components parts

2565
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,719
these parts can be molecules or they

2566
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:28,239
could be

2567
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:29,440
agents

2568
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,199
and when

2569
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:32,880
these molecules are pushed far from

2570
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,880
equilibrium by a flow of energy of

2571
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,719
course humans are eating food and

2572
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:38,480
metabolizing energy so they're being

2573
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,280
powered by energy flows as well

2574
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,520
the system blindly explores various

2575
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:45,600
configurations in the space of possible

2576
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,719
designs via trial and error so this

2577
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:50,920
system will move through a series of

2578
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:53,840
configurations and those configurations

2579
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,679
that allow the system to extract

2580
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:58,000
sufficient energy to stay out of

2581
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,639
equilibrium will get retained

2582
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:03,280
while the configurations that don't

2583
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:05,679
allow for energy extraction

2584
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:07,600
will get filtered out either the system

2585
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,080
will collapse and have to try a new

2586
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,560
configuration

2587
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,360
or it'll just revert to the the previous

2588
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,440
stable

2589
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,080
configuration and it will continue

2590
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,840
trying to

2591
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:25,440
explore that configuration space um

2592
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,040
i should have said like here's a good

2593
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,520
example like here's a depiction of this

2594
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,600
configuration space we're talking about

2595
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,040
life exploring the design space so

2596
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,560
basically you have a

2597
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,360
a designer configuration and then

2598
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:40,480
uh

2599
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,719
you get these uh different this

2600
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,560
exploration of

2601
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,199
different configurations that are

2602
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:48,880
very close to the configuration you

2603
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,360
started out with

2604
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,280
so

2605
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,600
you know i was thinking about giving a

2606
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:56,960
talk on the origin of life but i

2607
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,719
couldn't get into all this cool daisy

2608
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:00,239
and stuff that's what the first part of

2609
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:01,840
the book is about what's really

2610
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,280
interesting is that we're finding that

2611
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:04,960
self-organization

2612
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,880
as mentioned is a darwinian process so

2613
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:07,920
there's actually a name for this

2614
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:10,639
dissipative adaptation and it shows that

2615
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:13,360
this evolution towards these more stable

2616
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:16,000
configurations dissipate more energy

2617
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,360
when this happens at the level of

2618
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,360
organisms that we're talking about it

2619
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,120
shouldn't be surprising that

2620
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,840
it dissipates more energy because

2621
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,120
basically

2622
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,760
as the organism evolves to be better at

2623
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,679
extracting energy all that energy it's

2624
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:31,760
extracting to maintain far from

2625
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,840
equilibrium is being converted into

2626
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,360
thermal entropy

2627
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,400
so

2628
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:39,840
all self-organizing processes are really

2629
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,560
dissipative adaptation processes at

2630
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,880
different levels so this process

2631
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,960
philosophers would say is multiply

2632
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:49,679
realizable so this process can happen at

2633
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:52,000
different scales and that's exactly what

2634
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,679
we see like

2635
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:56,320
right here the same process so you would

2636
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:59,119
have a society like exploring different

2637
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:01,040
governance systems

2638
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,560
and it doesn't know which government

2639
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,000
system is going to work

2640
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,639
the best beforehand it tries it

2641
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:09,040
if it doesn't work well

2642
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:11,119
like the fall of rome

2643
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:13,280
um it will collapse and then it will

2644
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,840
reassemble

2645
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,759
so

2646
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,080
just to wrap up the origin of life so we

2647
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:25,520
have this process of dissipative

2648
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,360
adaptation and

2649
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,880
if it's being pushed by the flow of

2650
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:29,760
energy

2651
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,600
and it's doing this process here where

2652
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,480
it's finding increasingly uh stable

2653
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,000
configurations

2654
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,080
collective configurations

2655
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:40,840
then um

2656
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:43,360
uh basically what will emerge is an auto

2657
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,679
catalytic set we'll define that later

2658
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:47,600
but basically

2659
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:48,800
uh it's um

2660
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,719
i'm using a lot of terms for philosophy

2661
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:52,000
i was gonna say like

2662
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,760
it's the beginning of an autopoetic

2663
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,639
agent so like a self-maintaining agent

2664
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,560
in its simplest form is a chemical

2665
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,119
system that produces outputs

2666
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:02,400
which are then

2667
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,639
fed back into the system so that the

2668
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:05,760
system

2669
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,400
can uh self-amplify it's basically

2670
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:09,679
creating

2671
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:11,360
all of the molecules

2672
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:13,360
uh that it needs to grow

2673
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,880
and uh

2674
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,199
it's thought that this process

2675
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:19,520
you know occurred

2676
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,360
the auto catalytic set is kind of the

2677
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:24,239
precursor for the first cell so it's

2678
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:26,320
kind of like a protocell

2679
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:29,760
and um it was thought to occur uh around

2680
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,920
hydrothermal vents which are under water

2681
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,199
volcanoes

2682
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:34,639
there's all this

2683
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:38,719
energy flowing up from the the hot core

2684
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:41,679
running through geochemical energy

2685
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:44,080
and there's these rocky pores

2686
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,920
in the rocks around hydrothermal vents

2687
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,280
which

2688
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:49,920
provide something like a a membrane like

2689
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,960
a lipid

2690
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,880
membrane to hold the components in a

2691
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,800
mark off blankets so that the pores and

2692
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:55,760
the rocks

2693
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,080
were the mark off blanket for the

2694
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:00,719
auto catalytic set and eric smith and

2695
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:02,400
marwitz showed that

2696
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,400
basically

2697
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:07,199
feeding off inorganic inputs

2698
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:09,360
like carbon molecules like not not

2699
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,679
anything not organic chemistry where

2700
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:14,480
it's like life but just like simple

2701
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:17,199
like carbon hydrogen and oxygen feeding

2702
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:18,239
off those

2703
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:20,719
inputs um

2704
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:24,639
basically the metabolic process uh it's

2705
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:27,520
called the reverse krebs cycle so

2706
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,199
uh that process

2707
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:30,960
allowed uh

2708
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:33,920
the first autocatalytic set to

2709
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,280
continuously

2710
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,800
self-amplify

2711
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,000
um

2712
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,239
through this through this process

2713
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:41,920
so if this process is allowed to

2714
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,280
continue

2715
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:44,960
um further self-organization may

2716
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,639
eventually lead to the emergence of an

2717
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:48,159
organic computer that can process

2718
01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:49,440
integrate and store information about

2719
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:50,639
the world so

2720
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:54,080
what dissipative adaptation is doing

2721
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:57,280
is uh as it's doing this blind variation

2722
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:00,000
and selective retention process and it's

2723
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,480
finding more stable configurations those

2724
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:05,760
more stable configurations are also

2725
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,679
predictive of the environment so this

2726
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:10,239
dissipative adaptation process

2727
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:13,040
is this auto catalytic set

2728
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,960
modeling the surrounding energy

2729
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,920
landscape so i'm arguing that this is

2730
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:20,400
where modeling begins it even begins

2731
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,159
before what we call life like rep

2732
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:24,480
self-replicating life and it's

2733
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,080
dissipative adaptation which is a

2734
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:27,280
process

2735
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,600
of modeling the the energy in the

2736
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:30,880
environment

2737
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,719
the energy sources

2738
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:33,920
um

2739
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:34,880
so

2740
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,199
uh this isn't just one continuous

2741
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:39,440
process there are these leaps

2742
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,679
that are phase transitions basically

2743
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:44,400
we've heard of phase transitions and

2744
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,560
physics and chemistry uh

2745
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,560
courses where you have like

2746
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,800
water

2747
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,960
being heated up and then transitioning

2748
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,360
into a gas or the reverse when a gas

2749
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,280
becomes frozen

2750
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:02,800
uh you get a state of order that emerges

2751
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,239
um

2752
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:08,600
these uh transitions towards uh these

2753
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:10,239
configurations that are good at

2754
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:11,760
extracting energy

2755
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:15,199
those uh have also been characterized

2756
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,040
as phase transitions

2757
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:19,199
so eric smith who i mentioned before

2758
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:20,480
herald morwitz they have this phase

2759
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,639
transition theory of life

2760
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:24,320
which basically

2761
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,119
uh

2762
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:28,560
explains how um information gains

2763
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,679
control

2764
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:31,199
in these systems

2765
01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:33,040
um

2766
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:35,119
and sarah walker and paul davies work on

2767
01:39:35,119 --> 01:39:36,639
this basically show that through this

2768
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:37,760
process

2769
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,040
of blind variation and selective

2770
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,520
retention information gets built up in

2771
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,440
this auto catalytic set and at some

2772
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,320
point

2773
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,920
there's what they call algorithmic

2774
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,119
takeover

2775
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:50,000
uh or informational control and the

2776
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,080
system becomes an agent that can start

2777
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,280
to

2778
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:56,000
steer and control itself

2779
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,679
in ways that wouldn't be predicted by

2780
01:39:57,679 --> 01:39:59,280
physics so

2781
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:02,000
a living system is very much like we

2782
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,760
didn't talk about dissipative structures

2783
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,320
but like tornadoes whirlpools those

2784
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,880
things emerge to dissipate an energy

2785
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:09,920
gradient

2786
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,119
uh

2787
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:14,400
living things uh because of the process

2788
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,840
of metabolism

2789
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,119
we are this

2790
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:19,440
cycling system this thermodynamic

2791
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,800
energetic loop

2792
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:23,280
um

2793
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,440
uh but uh

2794
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:29,040
what's it gonna say about that um

2795
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,880
so yeah we are like the storm but we do

2796
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,400
have control

2797
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:35,760
over this storm we're a storm with

2798
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:37,360
control so it doesn't really make sense

2799
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,600
going back to sam harris's quote that

2800
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:42,400
you are the storm you do not control it

2801
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,560
it's literally the information that gets

2802
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:46,320
built up through evolution

2803
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,840
that allows

2804
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,679
you know us being this dissipative

2805
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:51,360
structure like a storm

2806
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,360
to start controlling

2807
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:56,239
its own behavior

2808
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:00,960
um so the last part is just

2809
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:02,400
an argument

2810
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,719
for that second question why should

2811
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:07,040
complexity increase

2812
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,000
um

2813
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,400
we know that this evolutionary process

2814
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:13,360
where you build up this model

2815
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:16,159
uh so we would think that this after

2816
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:18,000
these generations of evolution this

2817
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,840
organism is going to be well adapted to

2818
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:20,639
its

2819
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:24,080
environment but we know that adaptation

2820
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,320
doesn't mean becoming more complex

2821
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,800
always so sharks and crocodiles are

2822
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:32,159
cited as species that haven't evolved

2823
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:33,280
much at all

2824
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:36,000
in many millions of years

2825
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,159
cave fish actually

2826
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:40,239
evolved to become more simple so

2827
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:41,360
basically

2828
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:45,199
fish with eyes got isolated and like an

2829
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:46,719
underground environment where there was

2830
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:47,600
no

2831
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:52,159
uh need for sunlight and uh so

2832
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:53,360
basically

2833
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:54,639
um

2834
01:41:54,639 --> 01:41:56,400
fish

2835
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:57,280
like

2836
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:59,440
processing light like eyes didn't have

2837
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,360
any survival advantage so

2838
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:02,159
um

2839
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:04,560
basically fish lost their eyes

2840
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,679
uh over many generations of evolution

2841
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:11,280
becoming simpler so if that's true why

2842
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:15,400
should evolution increase complexity

2843
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:16,960
the answer to that

2844
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:19,360
it comes from this understanding that

2845
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,119
evolutionary epistemology says that a

2846
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:23,600
species adapting to a niche is like a

2847
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,199
scientific theory being tested for

2848
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:27,760
viability species will evolve not to

2849
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:30,560
become increasingly complex but to match

2850
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,880
the complexity of the environment

2851
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,880
a sort of simplest solution to the

2852
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:36,880
thermodynamic problem of staying far

2853
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,679
from equilibrium so einstein famous we

2854
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:41,360
said a theory should be

2855
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:44,400
as simple as possible but no simpler

2856
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,320
the same could be said about an organism

2857
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,000
you want it to be

2858
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,320
as simple as possible while it

2859
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:53,199
accomplishes its task of extracting

2860
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:56,480
energy it has to be complex enough

2861
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:59,119
to be able to extract energy in a

2862
01:42:59,119 --> 01:43:01,199
competitive environment

2863
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:02,239
but

2864
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:04,480
a bacterium doesn't have to do it

2865
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:06,480
doesn't need intelligence any extra

2866
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:08,159
information processing higher level

2867
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:09,600
cognition

2868
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,880
would be energy wasted

2869
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:13,920
um

2870
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,119
that could

2871
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:16,960
be energy that allows it to stay far

2872
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,800
from equilibrium for longer and

2873
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,760
replicate more so

2874
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,840
it's not the case that everything will

2875
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:26,639
evolve towards higher complexity

2876
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:27,440
but

2877
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,440
the reason that we do get

2878
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,760
increasingly complex species over

2879
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,600
evolutionary time in a way that i'm

2880
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:36,080
saying is inevitable

2881
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:38,000
so there is a progressive evolutionary

2882
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,400
process that leads to higher forms

2883
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:43,920
it has to do with uh niche emergence so

2884
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,600
so basically

2885
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,159
a species will evolve to become as

2886
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:49,760
complex as its niche as its

2887
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,320
environmental niche

2888
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:55,040
but there will be increasingly complex

2889
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:57,600
niches that emerge

2890
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:01,360
for reasons that will be explained

2891
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:04,719
but i will pause there

2892
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:06,960
before i get to that which will be what

2893
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,520
we end on

2894
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:11,920
there are no other questions right now

2895
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,400
so if anyone does have questions how

2896
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,560
about they can feel free to ask it

2897
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:19,280
during this last section give you a

2898
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:21,040
second to

2899
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,560
catch your breath and i know it's been a

2900
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,040
ton of information like

2901
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,600
my goal is that you know since this is

2902
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,520
being recorded it'll be something that's

2903
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:33,280
up um hopefully i've cited enough

2904
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,760
literature that people can explore this

2905
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,239
stuff themselves and see that like okay

2906
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:40,239
it's not this guy that's like

2907
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:42,159
uh claiming to have like a theory of

2908
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:44,080
everything this isn't my theory

2909
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:48,159
it's a synthesis that's emerging and um

2910
01:44:48,159 --> 01:44:51,119
uh really the story has been there for

2911
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:53,040
quite some time and

2912
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:56,000
the cybernetics pioneers actually a lot

2913
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,800
of them were you could call them like

2914
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:00,719
cosmic teleologists a lot of them did

2915
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:02,960
see this continual increase in

2916
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,480
complexity

2917
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:06,080
of course there's nothing mystical about

2918
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,080
it or supernatural about it

2919
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:08,880
um

2920
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:10,960
it's a mechanistic process

2921
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:13,119
that doesn't change the fact that

2922
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:15,280
nature seems to have these built-in

2923
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:16,400
goals

2924
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,239
that emerge from

2925
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:20,480
the fundamental laws and constants the

2926
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:23,199
parameters the the fine-tuning

2927
01:45:23,199 --> 01:45:25,040
but it's a completely natural

2928
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,600
progressive teleological evolutionary

2929
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,000
process

2930
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,920
and so i'll just and you know this is

2931
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,280
just

2932
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,040
finishing up it's along the same line so

2933
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:37,520
that's good the questions can come after

2934
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,600
this and i know it's been quite a lot so

2935
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,000
i will just try to

2936
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,880
sum this up simply um

2937
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,639
so uh

2938
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:47,920
two important principles from

2939
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:49,199
cybernetics

2940
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:52,560
these came from ross ashby who also

2941
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:53,719
created the principle of

2942
01:45:53,719 --> 01:45:55,920
self-organization which was really the

2943
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:58,400
first time people took self-organization

2944
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,320
seriously so

2945
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,400
we think of complexity science as being

2946
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,239
the science of self-organization but it

2947
01:46:04,239 --> 01:46:06,239
really goes back to cybernetics

2948
01:46:06,239 --> 01:46:08,880
um i think the term i think kant might

2949
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,199
have talked about it but it was

2950
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:13,280
ross ashby who tried to you know give it

2951
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:16,800
a make it a principle and a formalized

2952
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,320
concept

2953
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,560
so there are these two concepts that

2954
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,320
really i think

2955
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,400
anybody interested in like coffers and

2956
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,480
spacing brain hypothesis free energy

2957
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,960
principle should be aware of because all

2958
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:31,520
of the way he talks about like

2959
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:34,000
evolution comes from this

2960
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,000
ashby's work the good regulator theorem

2961
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,159
it was also updated there there was the

2962
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:42,320
internal model principle which came like

2963
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:43,679
a decade later

2964
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:45,520
good regulator theorem came

2965
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,520
these both these laws i think came in

2966
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:49,920
the 50s in the 40s or 50s and then i

2967
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:51,440
think in the 70s the internal model

2968
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,520
principle was created but it basically

2969
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,360
says that any system that regulates or

2970
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,760
controls another system must have a

2971
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:59,600
model of that system

2972
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,199
otherwise it can't regulate it so it

2973
01:47:01,199 --> 01:47:03,199
seems pretty obvious but

2974
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:05,520
this talk of models kind of

2975
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,080
starts here that is very familiar to

2976
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:09,840
like anyone interested in like the free

2977
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,840
energy principle

2978
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,199
so

2979
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:14,800
this

2980
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:17,360
this can be applied to inanimate systems

2981
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:20,080
i mean controllers are like house like

2982
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:22,639
thermostats and stuff but ashby was

2983
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:24,639
really interested in adaptive systems so

2984
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:26,159
he was thinking about evolution so

2985
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:27,760
applied to evolution

2986
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:30,480
an organism must model its environment

2987
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:33,520
uh if it's going to extract free energy

2988
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:36,320
and an organism is a model of its niche

2989
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,400
like a key is a model of the lock it

2990
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,639
opens so when we talk about these models

2991
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:43,679
it can be kind of extra kind of abstract

2992
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:44,400
but

2993
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:45,760
i think this

2994
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:46,719
model

2995
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:48,400
a key is a model of the lock it opens

2996
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:51,679
really explains how an organism fits

2997
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:53,760
into a niche

2998
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,679
you could also say like a hand fits into

2999
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:59,600
a glove but it really

3000
01:48:00,159 --> 01:48:02,400
the organism is a model of its

3001
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:05,280
environment so natural selection is

3002
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,600
essentially an information channel that

3003
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,280
through evolution is pumping in

3004
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:10,800
information

3005
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,239
from the external world from the

3006
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:14,800
environment into the organism such that

3007
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,239
the organism

3008
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:17,119
is

3009
01:48:17,119 --> 01:48:19,360
encoding the structure of reality and

3010
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,600
encoding the structure of the world

3011
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,159
and its design uh

3012
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:25,840
include uh

3013
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:28,000
uh encodes information about the outside

3014
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:28,880
world

3015
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:30,719
so it's kind of a

3016
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:32,960
new way to think about evolution as this

3017
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:35,040
process of

3018
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:36,719
basically

3019
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:38,960
the universe is modeling itself and

3020
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:40,480
waking up through this process it's

3021
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,639
pretty interesting um kind of

3022
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:44,840
psychedelic

3023
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:48,400
so um the law of requisite variety

3024
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:49,920
is just telling you about the

3025
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:52,800
sophistication of that model so how

3026
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,199
complex does the model have to be for

3027
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:56,560
the organism to stay far from

3028
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:57,840
equilibrium

3029
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:00,480
um ross ashby's law

3030
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:02,799
says

3031
01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:07,360
so john naughton researcher at cambridge

3032
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:08,960
uh kind of summed it up this way in

3033
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,360
colloquial terms ashby's laws come to be

3034
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:13,760
understood as a simple proposition if

3035
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,280
the system is to be able to deal

3036
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:16,719
successfully with the diversity of

3037
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:18,800
challenges that its environment produces

3038
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,560
then it needs to have a repertoire of

3039
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:22,800
responses which is at least as nuanced

3040
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:24,400
as the problems thrown up by the

3041
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:26,960
environment so a viable system is one

3042
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,960
that can handle the variability of its

3043
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,440
environment or as ashby put it only

3044
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:35,199
variety can absorb variety

3045
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:37,520
so it's what we said before with

3046
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:39,599
evolutionary epistemology

3047
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:41,440
an organism

3048
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:44,320
evolves to become as complex as its

3049
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,960
environmental niche requires

3050
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:48,239
it has to

3051
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:50,080
specifically

3052
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:53,440
have enough behavioral responses

3053
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:56,080
which map onto internal states so it has

3054
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:58,560
to have enough cognitive states

3055
01:49:58,560 --> 01:49:59,599
to

3056
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:00,639
uh

3057
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:03,599
respond to the number of challenges

3058
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:04,480
that

3059
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:08,480
the environment presents challenges

3060
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:11,360
in its ability to extract energy

3061
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:12,560
and when

3062
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:15,920
when you get organisms and you get other

3063
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:18,480
uh you get other agents other organisms

3064
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:19,360
then

3065
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:21,360
of course

3066
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:23,760
what the organism has to model is much

3067
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:25,520
more complicated because it doesn't have

3068
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:28,159
to just model the energy source in its

3069
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:30,880
environment like to get food it also has

3070
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:32,639
to model other

3071
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:35,760
modelers other cognitive agents

3072
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:36,840
um

3073
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:41,199
so yeah basically

3074
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,760
any adaptive system has

3075
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:45,360
a

3076
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:47,280
uh

3077
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:50,080
a behavioral repertoire and a repertoire

3078
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:51,679
of accessible

3079
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:53,520
mental states or for things without

3080
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,679
brains computational states

3081
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:57,119
and the number of states that the

3082
01:50:57,119 --> 01:50:59,040
organism can access

3083
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:01,840
uh should match the number of challenges

3084
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:04,800
the number of states

3085
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:07,920
that could surprise the organism by the

3086
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:08,960
environment

3087
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:11,199
um so a cat must have at least as many

3088
01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:13,520
states as the ways the mouse can invade

3089
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:15,040
it and the mouse has to have enough

3090
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:17,280
behavioral states to get away

3091
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:19,599
so they model each other

3092
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:22,000
a swordsman like a fencer must have many

3093
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,119
blocks as his opponent has attacks

3094
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:27,280
and as we said

3095
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:30,159
because bigger responses map onto unique

3096
01:51:30,159 --> 01:51:31,679
internal states

3097
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:33,440
the loss of an organism must have as

3098
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:35,599
many accessible states as required by

3099
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:38,080
the complexity of niche

3100
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:40,560
so we already said this uh organism is

3101
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:42,000
some simplest solution to the

3102
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,520
thermodynamic problem of seeing far from

3103
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:46,159
equilibrium

3104
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:48,560
so a well-adapted species represents a

3105
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:50,400
biological solution to an existential

3106
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:51,679
thermodynamic

3107
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:54,080
dilemma it's a sort of living evolving

3108
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:55,599
scientific theory about how to most

3109
01:51:55,599 --> 01:51:57,599
efficiently extract the free energy the

3110
01:51:57,599 --> 01:51:59,280
lifeblood of existence out of a

3111
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:00,719
particular niche

3112
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:02,800
some niches present a changing variety

3113
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,639
of challenges that must be adapted to

3114
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:06,560
you while others present hardly any at

3115
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:08,719
all

3116
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:12,159
so almost done here i know it's a lot um

3117
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:13,760
hopefully this can kind of wrap up the

3118
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:15,199
ideas and kind of show how they're all

3119
01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:17,040
connected um

3120
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:19,040
but this is still on this question of

3121
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,800
how complex

3122
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,480
is the universe

3123
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:26,639
uh how complex can it get so

3124
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:27,679
olivia

3125
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:31,040
olivia judson wrote this uh

3126
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:32,400
published this paper called the energy

3127
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:34,960
expansions of evolution it's really nice

3128
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:36,480
people should check it out

3129
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:39,040
uh so she says the history of the earth

3130
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:40,880
life earth system can be divided into

3131
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:42,880
five energetic epochs each featuring the

3132
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,560
evolution of life forms that can exploit

3133
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:47,040
a new source of energy these sources are

3134
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:49,599
geochemical energy sunlight oxygen flesh

3135
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:50,719
and fire

3136
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:52,080
the first two are present at the start

3137
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:53,599
but oxygen flushing fire all

3138
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:56,080
consequences of evolutionary events

3139
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:58,480
and then she makes this statement

3140
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,159
by the way red is

3141
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:01,520
quotes if

3142
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:02,719
people haven't

3143
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:05,119
uh figured that out so these are her

3144
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:09,760
words i forgot to put quote marks um so

3145
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:11,520
no category of energy source has

3146
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:13,679
disappeared this has over time resulted

3147
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:15,520
in an expanding realm of the sources of

3148
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,520
energy available to living organisms and

3149
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:18,960
a commitment

3150
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:22,000
uh increase in the diversity and

3151
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,320
complexity of ecosystems

3152
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:26,800
so

3153
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:30,159
here's the way to think about it um

3154
01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:32,480
so taking the thermodynamic perspective

3155
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:34,880
and looking at organisms as energy flow

3156
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:37,119
channels uh we can think of each niche

3157
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:39,360
on earth as a sort of energy slot for a

3158
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:41,760
given species and an evolving population

3159
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,440
of organisms efficiently searching the

3160
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:45,760
solution space will eventually just by

3161
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:47,599
chance discover a solution to a

3162
01:53:47,599 --> 01:53:49,119
thermodynamic problem that it didn't

3163
01:53:49,119 --> 01:53:50,400
know existed

3164
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,239
the discovery of a novel energy source

3165
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:53,920
or energy extraction technique is both

3166
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,599
how a new niche and a new species come

3167
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:57,199
into existence

3168
01:53:57,199 --> 01:53:59,280
so phylogenetic learning which we saw in

3169
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:00,239
that

3170
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:01,199
chart

3171
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:02,880
will naturally lead to speciation

3172
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,760
because organisms will stumble upon new

3173
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:07,840
ways to exploit thermodynamic niches

3174
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:10,159
that were previously inaccessible to

3175
01:54:10,159 --> 01:54:12,719
life purely for design reasons we're

3176
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:16,239
going to give examples on the next slide

3177
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,560
so as the biosphere accumulates

3178
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:20,560
knowledge through phylogenetic learning

3179
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:22,159
not only is the solution space

3180
01:54:22,159 --> 01:54:23,920
corresponding to one kind of

3181
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:26,000
thermodynamic problem being explored

3182
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,320
there's a growing problem space each

3183
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:31,360
with its own unique solution space

3184
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:32,719
um

3185
01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:34,400
so in an evolution so there's an

3186
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,800
evolutionary trajectory

3187
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:39,599
that's not determined in the strict

3188
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:40,719
sense

3189
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:43,119
envisioned by laplace where like there's

3190
01:54:43,119 --> 01:54:44,880
no freedom in the future it's like set

3191
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,080
in stone

3192
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:49,119
but there is a sort of uh statistical

3193
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:50,800
determinism what i've been calling a

3194
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:53,440
non-equilibrium statistical determinism

3195
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:56,159
that guarantees that basically the

3196
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:58,800
inevitability of this emergence of a

3197
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:00,960
distribution of far from equilibrium

3198
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:02,960
attractors

3199
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:05,360
of varying varying degrees of complexity

3200
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:08,159
so each species can be seen as a an

3201
01:55:08,159 --> 01:55:11,280
attractor that's exploiting this niche

3202
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,599
and you get this uh

3203
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:17,599
basically this diversity where you have

3204
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:18,480
uh

3205
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:21,679
organisms uh exploiting like the the

3206
01:55:21,679 --> 01:55:22,639
energy

3207
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:24,880
niches that were kind of the

3208
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:27,119
easy ones to exploit on earth like the

3209
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:28,880
geochemical free energy we mentioned

3210
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,800
with the origin of life and then

3211
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,480
sunlight was a

3212
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,560
little bit of a more difficult challenge

3213
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:37,599
to extract sunlight it took some time

3214
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:39,920
for evolution to be able to do that

3215
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:41,520
um

3216
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:44,400
so uh extracting energy from the

3217
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:47,280
hydrothermal vents uh source of energy

3218
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,440
is really simple because the energy is

3219
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:51,679
already like flowing through the system

3220
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:53,360
it doesn't have to do much work to

3221
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:55,440
extract sunlight you have you know a

3222
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:56,480
moving

3223
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:57,280
sun

3224
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:59,599
it's a little bit more complicated but

3225
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:02,159
not nearly as complicated as organisms

3226
01:56:02,159 --> 01:56:04,000
that eat other organisms so

3227
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,119
heterotrophic organisms

3228
01:56:07,119 --> 01:56:09,520
because they will have to model not just

3229
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:11,679
like a sun moving predictably through

3230
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:13,280
the air but have to model all these

3231
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:14,480
other agents

3232
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:17,599
many of which are trying to eat them

3233
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:20,800
to kill you um so

3234
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,320
basically so answering this question why

3235
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:26,560
increasingly intelligent species emerge

3236
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:29,199
we started off with reductive autotrophs

3237
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:31,360
those organisms around hydrothermal

3238
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,960
vents they were a solution to the

3239
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:34,480
problem of how to extract free energy

3240
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:36,880
from geochemical gradients

3241
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:39,760
um photosynthetic bacteria the ancestors

3242
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:42,000
of plants for the solution to extract of

3243
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,760
how to extract all the solar energy that

3244
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:45,840
was flowing through the planetary system

3245
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:47,360
so that was a big

3246
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:50,239
discovery made by life is that you can

3247
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:52,719
get energy directly from sunlight

3248
01:56:52,719 --> 01:56:55,199
heterotrophic organisms organisms that

3249
01:56:55,199 --> 01:56:56,960
eat other organisms where the solution

3250
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:58,719
to the problem of how to extract energy

3251
01:56:58,719 --> 01:57:00,320
from life itself

3252
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:02,639
once life starts having to model life

3253
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:04,080
other agents with causal power and

3254
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:05,599
adaptive behavior

3255
01:57:05,599 --> 01:57:07,520
the computational task of extracting

3256
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:09,280
free energy gets increasingly difficult

3257
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:12,800
as increasingly complex species arise

3258
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,320
so by virtue of having to model each

3259
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:15,920
other the complexity of some species

3260
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:18,239
gets ratcheted up by what's known as an

3261
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:20,719
evolutionary arms race

3262
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:21,599
so

3263
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:24,719
the lion is evolving you know lions are

3264
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:27,360
producing offspring some of those lions

3265
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:29,280
will be better at predicting the

3266
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:32,719
gazelles movements the gazelle will also

3267
01:57:32,719 --> 01:57:35,040
be creating offspring and some of those

3268
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:36,000
will be

3269
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,520
better at predicting the lions attack

3270
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:41,199
the ones that are better at predicting

3271
01:57:41,199 --> 01:57:43,040
are the ones that get to

3272
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:45,440
uh stick around so you see how you have

3273
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:47,440
this ratcheting mechanism that ratchets

3274
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:49,119
that ratchet is

3275
01:57:49,119 --> 01:57:51,440
up complexity um

3276
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:54,639
there's actually a principle called

3277
01:57:54,639 --> 01:57:56,719
the red queen principle

3278
01:57:56,719 --> 01:57:59,679
uh that says that for

3279
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:02,239
an organism to simply stay in the game

3280
01:58:02,239 --> 01:58:03,679
of existence

3281
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:06,159
certain organisms a certain species they

3282
01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:09,440
will have to become increasingly complex

3283
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:11,360
and that comes from

3284
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:15,280
uh alex in wonderland basically

3285
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:18,239
there's a scene with the red queen and

3286
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:20,000
alice's they're they're all running as

3287
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,400
fast as they can and alice is like

3288
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:24,320
you know i'm running fast as i i'm i

3289
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:26,719
keep running but i'm i'm going nowhere

3290
01:58:26,719 --> 01:58:28,239
like so they're they're all running but

3291
01:58:28,239 --> 01:58:29,679
they're they're not making any distance

3292
01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:30,880
they're staying in place and the queen

3293
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:32,320
says something like

3294
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:34,960
oh you see here for that

3295
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:36,159
uh

3296
01:58:36,159 --> 01:58:38,320
to go somewhere you'll have to run much

3297
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:39,920
faster than that

3298
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:42,080
um so

3299
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:44,239
the idea is that

3300
01:58:44,239 --> 01:58:46,560
for a species

3301
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,159
that has to deal with this complex

3302
01:58:48,159 --> 01:58:50,639
environment just to stay where it is

3303
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:53,280
just to stay in the game of existence it

3304
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:55,840
has to become increasingly complex it

3305
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:58,159
has to keep adapting

3306
01:58:58,159 --> 01:58:59,040
so

3307
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:01,040
one thing that i wanted to get into more

3308
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:02,800
but i'm not going to

3309
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:05,360
is this idea of empowerment it comes

3310
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:06,800
from the computational neuroscience

3311
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:08,000
literature

3312
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,159
it's similar it comes from daniel palani

3313
01:59:10,159 --> 01:59:11,840
but it's very similar to

3314
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:14,000
harvard's uh alex

3315
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,719
wisner visner gross he has an idea

3316
01:59:16,719 --> 01:59:18,880
called causal and tropic forcing but

3317
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:22,239
basically these people are arguing that

3318
01:59:22,239 --> 01:59:23,440
um

3319
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:24,639
well

3320
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:26,960
visitor growth is arguing that a causal

3321
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:28,840
entropic force

3322
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:32,239
uh means that like basically with like

3323
01:59:32,239 --> 01:59:35,040
evolution you'll get a system systems

3324
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:36,400
that uh

3325
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:38,800
are trying to maximize

3326
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:40,320
the number

3327
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:43,520
of states they can respond to so the

3328
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:44,880
maximize

3329
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:46,080
and

3330
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:48,000
the number of states they can respond to

3331
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,719
is mirrored by their internal diversity

3332
01:59:50,719 --> 01:59:53,040
so systems naturally try to increase the

3333
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:54,480
number of states

3334
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:56,239
and it's this

3335
01:59:56,239 --> 01:59:59,520
ability that allows for intelligence

3336
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:02,560
because if you have more states going

3337
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,480
back to this law of requisite variety

3338
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:07,199
you can respond to more challenges

3339
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:08,080
so

3340
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:10,239
not every species is increasing

3341
02:00:10,239 --> 02:00:11,440
empowerment

3342
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:13,520
but you will get the emergence of

3343
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:15,040
increasing

3344
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:17,599
uh increasingly complex

3345
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:21,679
species because uh each species

3346
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:23,360
serves as food

3347
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:27,040
for a potential new species um

3348
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:29,760
you will get increasingly complex

3349
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:32,480
species that emerge over time

3350
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:35,199
and they will be increasingly empowered

3351
02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:37,440
meaning that they can respond

3352
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:40,080
to more environmental states and that

3353
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:43,199
they have more accessible

3354
02:00:43,199 --> 02:00:45,760
mental or cognitive states

3355
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:48,080
um i explained some of this

3356
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:49,360
in the last

3357
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:51,040
slide but i'll just explain a little

3358
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:53,520
more so open-ended niche emergence why

3359
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:55,520
is the evolutionary record shown a trend

3360
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:57,760
of the emergence of increasingly complex

3361
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:58,960
forms

3362
02:00:58,960 --> 02:00:59,760
um

3363
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:01,520
because when all conceivable niches on

3364
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:03,440
earth were filled that wasn't the end

3365
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:05,199
new species created new niches because

3366
02:01:05,199 --> 02:01:06,800
the free energy spot they provide is

3367
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:09,599
themselves their food

3368
02:01:09,599 --> 02:01:10,400
so

3369
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:12,159
cybernetics guy he's kind of like the

3370
02:01:12,159 --> 02:01:13,040
last

3371
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:14,080
living

3372
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:17,119
cyberneticist kind of um i'm sure there

3373
02:01:17,119 --> 02:01:18,880
are other people that call themselves

3374
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:21,199
that but he's kind of kept that title

3375
02:01:21,199 --> 02:01:22,480
even when it like

3376
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:24,159
wasn't trendy

3377
02:01:24,159 --> 02:01:26,000
um he says it is well documented by

3378
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
evolutionary biologists that ecosystems

3379
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,239
tend to become more complex the number

3380
02:01:30,239 --> 02:01:31,760
of different species increases and the

3381
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:33,040
number of dependencies and other

3382
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:35,119
linkages linkages between species

3383
02:01:35,119 --> 02:01:36,560
increases

3384
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:39,040
he cites eo wilson who recently passed

3385
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:39,920
away

3386
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:40,960
um

3387
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:43,280
who did a lot of work that that kind of

3388
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:45,040
inspired a lot of the

3389
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:47,280
concepts in the book um

3390
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,840
not just this niche emergence but also

3391
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:52,159
talking about super organisms so

3392
02:01:52,159 --> 02:01:54,239
collectives like ant colonies

3393
02:01:54,239 --> 02:01:56,719
self-organizing systems that all scales

3394
02:01:56,719 --> 02:01:58,320
but he said not only do ecosystems

3395
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:00,159
contain typically lots of niches that

3396
02:02:00,159 --> 02:02:02,639
will eventually be filled by new species

3397
02:02:02,639 --> 02:02:05,040
but there is a self-reinforcing tendency

3398
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:07,199
to create new niches

3399
02:02:07,199 --> 02:02:08,639
what does that mean

3400
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:11,520
it means uh the biosphere

3401
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:14,080
certainly ecosystems are themselves auto

3402
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:16,400
catalytic sets

3403
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:17,760
so

3404
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:19,840
seth lloyd he's talking about these

3405
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:22,239
chemical auto catalytic sets but it's i

3406
02:02:22,239 --> 02:02:23,440
should have had this on the earlier

3407
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:25,760
slide but it'll be a good way to

3408
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:27,920
kind of show the equivalence between

3409
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:30,080
ecosystems

3410
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:31,760
cethloid says auto catalytic sets of

3411
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:33,280
reactions are powerful systems in

3412
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:34,719
addition to computing they can produce a

3413
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:36,880
wide variety of chemical outputs in

3414
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:38,320
effect an auto catalytic set of

3415
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:40,159
reactions is like a tiny computer

3416
02:02:40,159 --> 02:02:41,599
controlled factory for producing

3417
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:42,639
chemicals

3418
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:43,920
some of these chemicals are the

3419
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:45,520
constituents of life

3420
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:47,599
now stuart kaufman

3421
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:48,880
big you know

3422
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:51,040
one of the main names who's kind of this

3423
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:53,360
whole talk he's kind of put these ideas

3424
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:54,560
out there

3425
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:56,960
uh since like the early 90s well

3426
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,880
actually going back farther than that

3427
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:00,960
but he started writing books in the 90s

3428
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:02,880
and really gaining exposure for the

3429
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:04,800
santa fe institute

3430
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:06,960
he's written a recent paper well

3431
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:09,360
semi-recent

3432
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:10,960
about

3433
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:12,800
niche emergence as an auto catalytic

3434
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:15,760
process so ecosystems are auto catalytic

3435
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:17,280
auto catalytically closed

3436
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:19,679
self-sustaining reaction networks so

3437
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:22,159
they're auto poetic agents

3438
02:03:22,159 --> 02:03:23,840
that reliably drive up biological

3439
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:25,599
diversity and complexity as they self

3440
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:27,760
amplify and evolve

3441
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:29,679
so when you think about it really all

3442
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:31,440
integrated networks of adaptive systems

3443
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:33,119
functions out of auto catalytic sets

3444
02:03:33,119 --> 02:03:34,880
there's been a lot of papers showing

3445
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:36,400
this economies

3446
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:38,800
in a sense are autocad sets including

3447
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:41,520
the social organisms we call societies

3448
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:44,480
or civilizations

3449
02:03:45,199 --> 02:03:47,280
so these networks are common because

3450
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:49,280
they emerge spontaneously when many

3451
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,360
organisms repeatedly interact with one

3452
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:53,440
another and discover synergistic

3453
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:55,280
collective configurations

3454
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:58,000
as nature often pressures them to do

3455
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:01,440
so we're at the end um almost

3456
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:03,599
uh we've explained why complexity

3457
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:04,960
increases

3458
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:07,040
evolution will not increase the

3459
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:10,159
complexity of every species they will

3460
02:04:10,159 --> 02:04:12,079
become adapted to their niche they will

3461
02:04:12,079 --> 02:04:14,079
match the complexity of the niche

3462
02:04:14,079 --> 02:04:16,239
however because new niches are always

3463
02:04:16,239 --> 02:04:19,920
emerging because species act as food for

3464
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:22,159
a potential new species

3465
02:04:22,159 --> 02:04:23,199
um

3466
02:04:23,199 --> 02:04:25,360
because of that process you will get

3467
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:28,079
this increase uh you will get species

3468
02:04:28,079 --> 02:04:31,040
that emerge that have a higher number

3469
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:34,320
of uh a larger repertoire of mental and

3470
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:35,679
behavioral states so the law of

3471
02:04:35,679 --> 02:04:38,800
requisite variety really explains why

3472
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:41,040
more complex environments create more

3473
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:43,840
complex niches and this is open-ended

3474
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:45,599
there's really no

3475
02:04:45,599 --> 02:04:46,960
uh

3476
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:48,079
limit

3477
02:04:48,079 --> 02:04:50,639
to how far this process can go

3478
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:52,960
especially since humans

3479
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:54,719
who are the pinnacle of this process

3480
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:55,920
we're not

3481
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:57,599
you know a lot of people have been

3482
02:04:57,599 --> 02:04:58,560
against

3483
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:00,159
these kinds of views because it seems

3484
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:01,360
like it's saying that humans are

3485
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:02,639
superior

3486
02:05:02,639 --> 02:05:05,199
we're superior maybe computationally but

3487
02:05:05,199 --> 02:05:07,520
not superior in any other sense we're

3488
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:09,840
actually part of the biosphere which is

3489
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:12,800
this integrated interconnected system

3490
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:13,760
so

3491
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:15,360
it's really you know it doesn't make

3492
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:17,119
sense to think of us as like superior to

3493
02:05:17,119 --> 02:05:19,760
nature because the whole biosphere is an

3494
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:21,679
organism that we're just sort of an

3495
02:05:21,679 --> 02:05:22,880
organ for

3496
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:25,679
uh we're basically the nervous system

3497
02:05:25,679 --> 02:05:27,760
of the planet the cybernetic

3498
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:29,599
uh global system that people have called

3499
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:31,440
gaia some people don't like that name i

3500
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:33,679
think it's a perfectly good name

3501
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:34,960
but um

3502
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:38,159
that's why uh complexity gets ratcheted

3503
02:05:38,159 --> 02:05:39,920
up but the final

3504
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:41,440
um

3505
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:45,119
uh i guess uh part of this complexity

3506
02:05:45,119 --> 02:05:46,639
increase story

3507
02:05:46,639 --> 02:05:48,480
is that not only do you get increasingly

3508
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:50,079
complex species

3509
02:05:50,079 --> 02:05:53,520
uh those species will interact

3510
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:55,360
naturally to form

3511
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:56,960
higher level

3512
02:05:56,960 --> 02:05:58,000
uh

3513
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:01,199
adaptive systems which are collectives

3514
02:06:01,199 --> 02:06:03,920
so um

3515
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:05,440
i call this the principle of recursive

3516
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:07,440
self-organization based on ashby's

3517
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:10,639
principle of self-organization

3518
02:06:10,639 --> 02:06:12,400
what i'm arguing is that when you have a

3519
02:06:12,400 --> 02:06:14,639
biosphere with these agents and you have

3520
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:16,480
some are simple and some are complex

3521
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:19,040
naturally those agents will interact

3522
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:20,480
when they interact

3523
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:21,520
they will

3524
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:24,000
in many cases discover

3525
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,719
synergistic collective configurations so

3526
02:06:26,719 --> 02:06:29,199
configurations that make it easier for

3527
02:06:29,199 --> 02:06:31,599
each agent to extract the energy they

3528
02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:34,400
need to stay far from equilibrium

3529
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:35,199
so

3530
02:06:35,199 --> 02:06:37,199
why do interacting agents link up to

3531
02:06:37,199 --> 02:06:39,520
form stable holes for the exact same

3532
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:40,880
reason that molecules with the right

3533
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:42,960
chemical diversity will form stable auto

3534
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:44,880
catalytic reaction sets when pushed by a

3535
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:46,079
flow of energy

3536
02:06:46,079 --> 02:06:47,920
working collectively allows the whole

3537
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:50,400
system to extract more free energy with

3538
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:51,840
less work

3539
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:54,320
we can that's the whole point of synergy

3540
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:56,239
is that working together

3541
02:06:56,239 --> 02:06:58,239
makes your workload easier because

3542
02:06:58,239 --> 02:07:01,280
there's a distribution of labor

3543
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:04,159
and it's it's really nice um that you

3544
02:07:04,159 --> 02:07:05,280
know this

3545
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:06,079
uh

3546
02:07:06,079 --> 02:07:08,560
distribution of species with some simple

3547
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:10,079
and some complex

3548
02:07:10,079 --> 02:07:12,800
uh that's really what you need to create

3549
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:15,360
this like uh cybernetic adaptive system

3550
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:17,760
at the level of a planet because a

3551
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:21,119
system uh needs diversity among its

3552
02:07:21,119 --> 02:07:24,079
components in structure and function for

3553
02:07:24,079 --> 02:07:26,320
there to be this distribution of labor

3554
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:28,000
labor which makes it this

3555
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,800
uh

3556
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:32,320
collective whole this synergistic uh

3557
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:35,280
holistic unit um

3558
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:36,079
so

3559
02:07:36,079 --> 02:07:38,320
it's actually good

3560
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:40,960
that evolution in adaptation isn't

3561
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:43,520
increasing this the complexity of each

3562
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:44,880
species

3563
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:46,560
like each species isn't becoming

3564
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:48,400
intelligent like roaches aren't becoming

3565
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:50,639
like more and more intelligent over time

3566
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:53,280
with no limit um the biosphere wouldn't

3567
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:56,239
be stable if that were the case uh it's

3568
02:07:56,239 --> 02:07:59,360
really uh ecosystems need this diversity

3569
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:00,960
among components

3570
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:02,400
just as a car

3571
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:04,800
with made of all engines isn't going to

3572
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:06,320
be functional or

3573
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:08,320
our organism made of all brains you need

3574
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:11,440
a variety of parts some simple some

3575
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:13,440
complex because they all do different

3576
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:14,639
functions

3577
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:16,639
um so nature promotes cooperation

3578
02:08:16,639 --> 02:08:18,400
collaboration and synergy because it is

3579
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:20,320
thermodynamically beneficial for all

3580
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:22,719
parties

3581
02:08:22,719 --> 02:08:24,400
synergistic collective configurations

3582
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:26,480
will eventually be discovered by many

3583
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:28,719
component systems that are exploring

3584
02:08:28,719 --> 02:08:30,480
various states or configurations through

3585
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:32,159
the blind variation and selective

3586
02:08:32,159 --> 02:08:34,719
retention mechanism mentioned

3587
02:08:34,719 --> 02:08:36,880
organisms only compete until they

3588
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:38,960
finally figure out what that working

3589
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:41,360
together makes everyone's task easier

3590
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:42,960
and that goes for humans too so it's

3591
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:45,280
kind of a moral lesson for

3592
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:47,280
everybody the nations have to work

3593
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:48,639
together

3594
02:08:48,639 --> 02:08:50,880
we shouldn't um

3595
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:52,719
get rid of the nations there shouldn't

3596
02:08:52,719 --> 02:08:55,280
just be this evolution into this like

3597
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:57,840
global government because the nations

3598
02:08:57,840 --> 02:08:59,199
are actually

3599
02:08:59,199 --> 02:09:01,840
uh provide this diversity that we're

3600
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:04,560
saying is important uh because you need

3601
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:07,599
this uh diversity of component parts to

3602
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:09,520
create a division of labor

3603
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:10,400
so

3604
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:12,159
there's strength in diversity this is

3605
02:09:12,159 --> 02:09:13,760
different than the evolutionary picture

3606
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:15,280
of survival of the fittest whereas

3607
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:17,840
there's like this idea that the stronger

3608
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:19,840
the most intelligent survive this is

3609
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:21,280
saying that that's not true it's the

3610
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:23,280
most adaptive that survive has nothing

3611
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:25,119
to do with strength or intelligence

3612
02:09:25,119 --> 02:09:27,040
sloths have been around for many

3613
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:29,119
millions of years despite

3614
02:09:29,119 --> 02:09:32,239
being sloths being slow because they

3615
02:09:32,239 --> 02:09:34,560
exploit a source of free energy that's

3616
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:35,679
not being

3617
02:09:35,679 --> 02:09:37,440
exploited by another

3618
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:39,840
uh species so

3619
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,040
um

3620
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:43,440
going back to this kind of global

3621
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:46,079
message you want nations to retain their

3622
02:09:46,079 --> 02:09:48,800
identities but you also want them at the

3623
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:51,599
same time to come together

3624
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:53,360
and to

3625
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:55,920
work synergistically so

3626
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:58,159
you basically want something like a

3627
02:09:58,159 --> 02:10:00,880
global system but

3628
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:01,679
this

3629
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:03,599
there has to be the optimal balance

3630
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:04,880
between centralization and

3631
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:06,400
decentralization

3632
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:07,679
um

3633
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:08,880
neither

3634
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:11,679
approach will be good on its own there

3635
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:14,480
needs to be this balance

3636
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:15,599
so

3637
02:10:15,599 --> 02:10:16,960
um

3638
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:18,560
as long as the biosphere is creating a

3639
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:20,159
growing variety of complex adaptive

3640
02:10:20,159 --> 02:10:21,520
systems some of those will interact to

3641
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:23,199
produce higher level complex adaptive

3642
02:10:23,199 --> 02:10:25,119
systems which will come together to form

3643
02:10:25,119 --> 02:10:26,639
even larger ones

3644
02:10:26,639 --> 02:10:28,639
this process continues

3645
02:10:28,639 --> 02:10:30,880
uh at higher scales so

3646
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:33,440
i didn't go into this uh left out a kind

3647
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:35,520
of a neat picture that

3648
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:37,760
shows a brain and then the planet and

3649
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:40,000
it's like information networks but

3650
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:43,440
uh i do i i hope that you know talk

3651
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:46,320
about gaia and global brain will become

3652
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:48,320
uh will be taken as seriously as it

3653
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:49,280
should be

3654
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:50,800
uh they really only weren't taken

3655
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:52,960
seriously because there were mystical

3656
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:55,520
notions associated with this word gaia

3657
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:57,679
which wasn't even james uh

3658
02:10:57,679 --> 02:10:58,800
lovelock's

3659
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:01,360
uh fault he act the name guy came from

3660
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:02,639
his neighbor

3661
02:11:02,639 --> 02:11:04,560
who is actually the author of lord of

3662
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:05,760
the flies

3663
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:07,520
william golding so

3664
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:10,560
blame him for the for the flowery

3665
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:13,119
metaphor with gaia um

3666
02:11:13,119 --> 02:11:15,199
but yeah the the biosphere is a

3667
02:11:15,199 --> 02:11:17,920
cybernetic organism and we are forming

3668
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:19,679
something like the global brain

3669
02:11:19,679 --> 02:11:22,400
and a self-replicating biosphere

3670
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:23,679
uh

3671
02:11:23,679 --> 02:11:25,119
is essentially

3672
02:11:25,119 --> 02:11:27,199
the next step and when we are trying to

3673
02:11:27,199 --> 02:11:28,719
terraform

3674
02:11:28,719 --> 02:11:31,440
planets like mars that can be seen as

3675
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:33,840
the biosphere replicating

3676
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:35,040
uh

3677
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:36,800
for humans to

3678
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:38,639
at this point in our stage of

3679
02:11:38,639 --> 02:11:39,840
development

3680
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:42,079
we would have to kind of convert mars to

3681
02:11:42,079 --> 02:11:43,119
like

3682
02:11:43,119 --> 02:11:44,800
something like a biosphere to have like

3683
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:47,199
oxygen and so you can see how it's

3684
02:11:47,199 --> 02:11:49,440
replication with variation

3685
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:50,880
you get the same sort of thing but

3686
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:52,239
because it's a different planet there's

3687
02:11:52,239 --> 02:11:53,199
going to be

3688
02:11:53,199 --> 02:11:55,040
a variation it's not going to be exactly

3689
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:56,800
the same but that's how the evolutionary

3690
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:58,560
process continues

3691
02:11:58,560 --> 02:11:59,920
i should have showed this earlier this

3692
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:01,599
is just showing how like

3693
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:02,960
eukaryotic

3694
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:04,719
single-celled organisms like amoebas

3695
02:12:04,719 --> 02:12:06,560
will come together to form communities

3696
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:08,400
like a slime mold

3697
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:10,000
these

3698
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,239
multicellular organisms

3699
02:12:12,239 --> 02:12:14,560
come together to form colonies you see

3700
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:15,520
this

3701
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:18,320
ant colony ants actually really do form

3702
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:20,480
a super organism you can see here they

3703
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:22,400
actually build a bridge out of their

3704
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,960
bodies so that some ants can like climb

3705
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:27,440
across that bridge so

3706
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:29,360
it really makes sense to call it a super

3707
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:32,800
organism or at least like a super

3708
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:35,920
adaptive system or like a meta

3709
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:38,000
meta system um

3710
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,920
because without it we can't make sense

3711
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:41,760
of this collective behavior that's

3712
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:43,679
functional um of course human

3713
02:12:43,679 --> 02:12:46,719
civilization we again see this hierarchy

3714
02:12:46,719 --> 02:12:48,800
now it makes more sense

3715
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:51,119
uh we see that these evolutionary

3716
02:12:51,119 --> 02:12:52,639
transitions oh yeah these are called

3717
02:12:52,639 --> 02:12:54,639
evolutionary transitions

3718
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:56,239
sometimes i use the name meta-system

3719
02:12:56,239 --> 02:12:57,920
transition because

3720
02:12:57,920 --> 02:12:59,440
um

3721
02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:01,040
if we were talking about the brain i

3722
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:03,760
would also talk about like uh the

3723
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:05,760
emergence of a prefrontal cortex which

3724
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:08,800
is like a high level controller um

3725
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:10,719
that's also like a meta system

3726
02:13:10,719 --> 02:13:13,360
transition so meta system transitions

3727
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:14,560
are a little

3728
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:16,639
extendous where it's not talking

3729
02:13:16,639 --> 02:13:18,880
necessarily about evolutionary

3730
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:21,599
transitions but these other transitions

3731
02:13:21,599 --> 02:13:22,400
where

3732
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:24,480
systems

3733
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:26,560
start to model themselves

3734
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:29,760
um so here we see uh

3735
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:31,119
how

3736
02:13:31,119 --> 02:13:33,760
evolution has created these

3737
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:36,079
different memory

3738
02:13:36,079 --> 02:13:38,639
systems these knowledge repositories

3739
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:40,000
so it's that

3740
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:43,840
process of recursive self-organization

3741
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:45,840
creates new memory systems when you get

3742
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:47,360
go from single cell life to

3743
02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:50,400
multi-cellular life to life with brains

3744
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:54,239
uh it's uh these are in revolutions in

3745
02:13:54,239 --> 02:13:56,480
information storage machinery

3746
02:13:56,480 --> 02:13:58,159
so you can see how the information in

3747
02:13:58,159 --> 02:14:00,719
the biosphere gets accumulated

3748
02:14:00,719 --> 02:14:03,599
through an evolutionary process

3749
02:14:03,599 --> 02:14:04,800
um

3750
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:05,760
these

3751
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:09,040
are the final points

3752
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:11,440
yeah so knowledge is powers not just the

3753
02:14:11,440 --> 02:14:13,280
hollow buzz phrase of the digital age

3754
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:15,119
it's true in the most fundamental way

3755
02:14:15,119 --> 02:14:16,719
uncertainty reducing information is

3756
02:14:16,719 --> 02:14:18,480
life's first and last weapon in ongoing

3757
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:20,159
war with disorder

3758
02:14:20,159 --> 02:14:21,920
without knowledge life cannot exist for

3759
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:23,760
more than a moment much less colonize

3760
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:25,360
the galaxy and beyond

3761
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:26,639
this suggests that setting out on the

3762
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:28,560
path toward cosmic superiority is not a

3763
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:30,400
choice that intelligent agents like homo

3764
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:33,040
sapiens make upon careful reflection nor

3765
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:34,639
is it just some quirky ambition we

3766
02:14:34,639 --> 02:14:36,719
stumbled onto by chance

3767
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:38,719
this is the main point humanity's

3768
02:14:38,719 --> 02:14:41,599
collective desire to transcend mortality

3769
02:14:41,599 --> 02:14:43,599
and expand outward into space so

3770
02:14:43,599 --> 02:14:44,880
apparent from our

3771
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:46,639
current scientific and technological

3772
02:14:46,639 --> 02:14:48,400
endeavors spacex

3773
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:50,960
uh this doesn't emerge as an accident

3774
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:52,880
this is inevitable consequence of the

3775
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:54,239
fact that continual knowledge

3776
02:14:54,239 --> 02:14:55,440
acquisition

3777
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:58,159
is a fundamental biological imperative

3778
02:14:58,159 --> 02:15:00,400
if life wants to persist

3779
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:02,560
and stay far from equilibrium at some

3780
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:04,159
point it has to get off the planet

3781
02:15:04,159 --> 02:15:05,599
because the sun

3782
02:15:05,599 --> 02:15:06,480
is

3783
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:10,000
going to die and uh it's these sorts of

3784
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,560
problems these existential problems

3785
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:14,800
which uh create progress because it's

3786
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:17,119
our awareness of this problem

3787
02:15:17,119 --> 02:15:18,400
which uh

3788
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:20,960
forces us to

3789
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:23,520
uh search the configuration space for

3790
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:26,560
the solutions that solve the problem so

3791
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:28,320
as natural selection pumps information

3792
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:29,679
from the inanimate world into life

3793
02:15:29,679 --> 02:15:31,360
nature begins modeling itself encoding

3794
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:33,199
its own structure and the universe

3795
02:15:33,199 --> 02:15:34,639
begins to wake up

3796
02:15:34,639 --> 02:15:36,239
where the cosmos come alive not

3797
02:15:36,239 --> 02:15:38,800
metaphorically but literally

3798
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:41,280
this is ray kurzweil's uh image from his

3799
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:43,360
book the singularity is near

3800
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:44,719
you can see that

3801
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:47,280
he sees this he calls this the

3802
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:49,760
the the destiny of of life in the

3803
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:51,520
universe and he's not shy about using

3804
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:52,480
that word

3805
02:15:52,480 --> 02:15:54,960
um again it's not determined in a strict

3806
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:56,719
sense of replace this

3807
02:15:56,719 --> 02:15:58,960
uh kind of a statistical determinism

3808
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:00,400
that creates these

3809
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:03,119
uh series of attractors

3810
02:16:03,119 --> 02:16:05,760
and um

3811
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:08,639
you've seen famous people uh

3812
02:16:08,639 --> 02:16:10,880
so you know some people see that idea

3813
02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:12,560
and they'll have been reading brian

3814
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:13,840
green and listening to all these

3815
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:15,599
reductionists and think that's not a

3816
02:16:15,599 --> 02:16:17,119
scientific view

3817
02:16:17,119 --> 02:16:18,400
well uh

3818
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:20,960
that's not true and um

3819
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:22,480
i hope to see more of these people

3820
02:16:22,480 --> 02:16:24,320
speaking out about it so christoph coke

3821
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:25,280
in

3822
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:27,119
confessions of a romantic reductionist

3823
02:16:27,119 --> 02:16:28,880
says the rise of sentient life within

3824
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:31,599
times wide circuit was inevitable

3825
02:16:31,599 --> 02:16:33,519
teohara deschard in who really came up

3826
02:16:33,519 --> 02:16:34,959
with this don't have time to talk about

3827
02:16:34,959 --> 02:16:36,558
him french philosopher and jesuit you

3828
02:16:36,558 --> 02:16:37,920
should look into

3829
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:39,519
is correct in his view that the islands

3830
02:16:39,519 --> 02:16:41,120
within the universe if not the whole

3831
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:43,840
cosmos are evolving toward ever greater

3832
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:46,160
complexity and self-knowledge to be

3833
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:47,920
clear he's not saying that earth had to

3834
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:49,359
bear life that

3835
02:16:49,359 --> 02:16:51,359
you know

3836
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:53,200
primates had to walk the african glass

3837
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:54,240
lands

3838
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:55,840
but he says i do believe that the laws

3839
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:57,679
of physics overwhelmingly favored the

3840
02:16:57,679 --> 02:16:59,760
emergence of consciousness the universe

3841
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:02,398
is a work in progress such a belief

3842
02:17:02,398 --> 02:17:03,599
evokes

3843
02:17:03,599 --> 02:17:05,760
jeremiah i don't know the same word for

3844
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:07,599
many biologists and philosophers but the

3845
02:17:07,599 --> 02:17:09,840
evidence from cosmology biology and

3846
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:12,959
history is compelling

3847
02:17:12,959 --> 02:17:15,120
so there's some uh

3848
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:17,679
advanced blurbs for this book uh if you

3849
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:19,120
want to pre-order it

3850
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:23,280
um it comes out in june uh but every uh

3851
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:25,359
order that i get from now until then

3852
02:17:25,359 --> 02:17:27,120
will count towards my first week sales

3853
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:28,318
total so that will help me get on

3854
02:17:28,318 --> 02:17:29,599
bestsellers list

3855
02:17:29,599 --> 02:17:31,519
if you want to program it now and you

3856
02:17:31,519 --> 02:17:35,200
email me um i will send you a copy soon

3857
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:37,200
of this novel i also wrote called road

3858
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:39,840
to omega i was pretty busy in the last

3859
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,200
five years

3860
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:43,599
yeah i went into a cave for like four or

3861
02:17:43,599 --> 02:17:45,519
five years but this

3862
02:17:45,519 --> 02:17:47,280
uh it's a vehicle for the science and

3863
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:49,080
phosphate about kind of like an

3864
02:17:49,080 --> 02:17:52,478
anti-iron rand at this shrug maybe the

3865
02:17:52,478 --> 02:17:56,080
opposite phosphate um and the road to

3866
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:57,599
omega sub stack kind of turns his

3867
02:17:57,599 --> 02:18:00,799
philosophy into kind of an effort to

3868
02:18:00,799 --> 02:18:01,760
um

3869
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:04,000
save the world with uh science

3870
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,799
epistemology and blockchain technology

3871
02:18:06,799 --> 02:18:08,478
uh blockchains are part of this

3872
02:18:08,478 --> 02:18:10,558
self-organization process

3873
02:18:10,558 --> 02:18:12,000
and that's the longest talk i've ever

3874
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:13,200
given

3875
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:14,879
that's the longest i ever talked at one

3876
02:18:14,879 --> 02:18:17,040
time probably my wife will probably say

3877
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:18,959
that's not true but

3878
02:18:18,959 --> 02:18:20,879
i'm tired so let's

3879
02:18:20,879 --> 02:18:22,879
open it up to questions and thank you

3880
02:18:22,879 --> 02:18:25,359
for your immense patience

3881
02:18:25,359 --> 02:18:27,840
it's awesome to hear and

3882
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:29,120
think about it

3883
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:31,760
so there are two questions in the chat

3884
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:33,920
first is from dean

3885
02:18:33,920 --> 02:18:35,679
dean asks

3886
02:18:35,679 --> 02:18:38,558
how would we explain caring through a

3887
02:18:38,558 --> 02:18:41,439
lens of free will or no free will would

3888
02:18:41,439 --> 02:18:43,599
free will deniers say there is no caring

3889
02:18:43,599 --> 02:18:45,760
when it appears that agents can or do

3890
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:48,318
fully care

3891
02:18:48,318 --> 02:18:50,879
yeah so great question

3892
02:18:50,879 --> 02:18:53,359
unfortunately i don't have much to say

3893
02:18:53,359 --> 02:18:54,799
without

3894
02:18:54,799 --> 02:18:56,478
saying the things that i was going to

3895
02:18:56,478 --> 02:18:58,718
bring up in the next talk really

3896
02:18:58,718 --> 02:19:01,200
explaining what free will is i guess i

3897
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:03,359
should just say right now uh kind of a

3898
02:19:03,359 --> 02:19:05,439
brief explanation of what i mean by free

3899
02:19:05,439 --> 02:19:07,599
will so i've i hope i've made the

3900
02:19:07,599 --> 02:19:10,478
argument that agency emerges

3901
02:19:10,478 --> 02:19:12,318
uh in

3902
02:19:12,318 --> 02:19:14,638
adaptive systems that start off as

3903
02:19:14,638 --> 02:19:16,879
biological organisms

3904
02:19:16,879 --> 02:19:19,760
and um to the person itself driving car

3905
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:22,160
thing i uh uh just to mention that real

3906
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:24,638
quick i don't think they're agents but i

3907
02:19:24,638 --> 02:19:26,558
do think uh

3908
02:19:26,558 --> 02:19:28,799
it's possible to create systems with

3909
02:19:28,799 --> 02:19:29,920
agency

3910
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:33,439
um for reasons that i haven't gone into

3911
02:19:33,439 --> 02:19:35,040
um

3912
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:37,599
uh it seems important that the systems

3913
02:19:37,599 --> 02:19:40,398
have a certain type of architecture so

3914
02:19:40,398 --> 02:19:43,040
not like a standard computer as a von

3915
02:19:43,040 --> 02:19:45,760
neumann architecture and it's not uh

3916
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:48,000
distributed or integrated in the way the

3917
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,200
brain is

3918
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:51,359
so it's not integrating much information

3919
02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:54,399
so these systems won't have causal power

3920
02:19:54,399 --> 02:19:57,520
they won't be agents um

3921
02:19:57,520 --> 02:19:58,479
so

3922
02:19:58,479 --> 02:20:01,680
neuromorphic hardware has been a lot of

3923
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:03,520
people think that's going to allow

3924
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:04,960
machines that can

3925
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:08,000
think and perhaps even be conscious um i

3926
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,160
think maybe that's the way to go

3927
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:11,920
uh it's probably a lot more complicated

3928
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:13,040
than that it's a step in the right

3929
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:14,720
direction

3930
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:17,520
so agency is real it's uh due to

3931
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:19,520
information gaining causal power in a

3932
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:21,680
system and starts

3933
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:22,880
uh

3934
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:24,080
it starts

3935
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:26,399
steering the system so

3936
02:20:26,399 --> 02:20:28,560
you'll see like a bacterium performing

3937
02:20:28,560 --> 02:20:31,760
chemotaxis but does it make sense to say

3938
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:33,840
that the bacterium has free will when

3939
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:35,600
it's going this way in that just because

3940
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:37,439
it's not predictable in the way an

3941
02:20:37,439 --> 02:20:39,120
inanimate system is

3942
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:40,880
so i would say that they have agency but

3943
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:42,560
they don't have free will

3944
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:43,439
what

3945
02:20:43,439 --> 02:20:46,000
uh free will is and it's not my idea

3946
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:47,359
other people have kind of been talking

3947
02:20:47,359 --> 02:20:50,080
in this way kevin mitchell uh has a book

3948
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:52,080
neurogeneticist uh

3949
02:20:52,080 --> 02:20:53,600
he's coming out with a book called

3950
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:56,000
agents which is all about agency and

3951
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:59,280
free will but um the idea is that

3952
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:01,840
we are agents with causal power

3953
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:06,000
but um we're sort of uh

3954
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
where

3955
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:11,840
um our responses like are basically uh

3956
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:14,880
programmed responses uh that are

3957
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:17,120
responses that occur

3958
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:18,000
um

3959
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,399
automatically uh that are informed by

3960
02:21:20,399 --> 02:21:22,720
this uh information that's been built up

3961
02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:25,359
through evolution and adaptive learning

3962
02:21:25,359 --> 02:21:26,960
so a lot of the time we go through the

3963
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:28,960
day and we're not really thinking about

3964
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:30,080
things like

3965
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:32,800
driving or like waking up and like

3966
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:34,720
you know going to the fridge we're not

3967
02:21:34,720 --> 02:21:36,399
putting conscious thought into that so

3968
02:21:36,399 --> 02:21:37,920
that wouldn't seem to be

3969
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:39,840
free will

3970
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:41,680
to me you're you're kind of acting on

3971
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:45,120
autopilot so what free will is is a

3972
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:47,840
higher level of control that emerges

3973
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:50,080
with something like a prefrontal cortex

3974
02:21:50,080 --> 02:21:52,640
in a global workspace basically free

3975
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:56,479
will allow a prefrontal cortex allows an

3976
02:21:56,479 --> 02:21:57,439
agent

3977
02:21:57,439 --> 02:22:00,880
to override its uh instinctive and

3978
02:22:00,880 --> 02:22:03,680
automatic behaviors

3979
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:04,720
and so

3980
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:07,359
free will is something that uh

3981
02:22:07,359 --> 02:22:09,680
that we have but only if we're

3982
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:12,399
exercising this higher level of control

3983
02:22:12,399 --> 02:22:14,319
it's associated with cognitive control

3984
02:22:14,319 --> 02:22:17,359
or executive control effort full control

3985
02:22:17,359 --> 02:22:19,520
and basically

3986
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:20,720
um

3987
02:22:20,720 --> 02:22:22,319
if you have a healthy functioning

3988
02:22:22,319 --> 02:22:24,000
prefrontal cortex

3989
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:25,280
uh

3990
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:27,760
you're going to basically the conscious

3991
02:22:27,760 --> 02:22:29,680
mind is monitoring

3992
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:33,760
uh consciousness is a monitor uh so it's

3993
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:36,880
it's monitoring uh your uh behaviors and

3994
02:22:36,880 --> 02:22:38,160
if it uh

3995
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:39,760
detects that there's some optimal

3996
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:41,600
behavior for whatever reason like it's

3997
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:43,760
just automatic kind of instinctual let's

3998
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:45,520
say someone says something that

3999
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:47,040
makes us angry

4000
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:49,600
and we respond immediately with like

4001
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:51,600
pushing them or something uh that's not

4002
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:52,720
a wise

4003
02:22:52,720 --> 02:22:55,359
uh move and that maybe may happen when

4004
02:22:55,359 --> 02:22:56,800
we're fearful

4005
02:22:56,800 --> 02:22:59,280
because of the amygdala response and we

4006
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:02,399
just have this automatic behavior

4007
02:23:02,399 --> 02:23:05,680
um but uh free will would be when uh the

4008
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:07,359
conscious mind

4009
02:23:07,359 --> 02:23:09,760
overrides that process

4010
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:10,880
and uh

4011
02:23:10,880 --> 02:23:12,640
the bet actually the free will studies

4012
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:15,040
that everybody cites as saying that we

4013
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:17,200
don't have free will

4014
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:19,600
he actually never said that he said free

4015
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:22,319
will is in this veto power like maybe

4016
02:23:22,319 --> 02:23:24,399
some of our voluntary movements occur

4017
02:23:24,399 --> 02:23:26,960
without conscious thought

4018
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:29,439
but it's our ability to override those

4019
02:23:29,439 --> 02:23:32,160
movements uh that is the source of free

4020
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:33,680
will

4021
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:35,280
but there was more problems with that

4022
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:38,479
actually um the studies have

4023
02:23:38,479 --> 02:23:40,560
coked at a study showing that

4024
02:23:40,560 --> 02:23:42,240
uh basically

4025
02:23:42,240 --> 02:23:44,479
um

4026
02:23:44,720 --> 02:23:47,280
that free will um

4027
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:48,240
uh

4028
02:23:48,240 --> 02:23:50,080
readiness potential which is like a

4029
02:23:50,080 --> 02:23:52,080
spike in electrical activity that occurs

4030
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:53,840
before you do this voluntary movement

4031
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:56,319
this movement you think is voluntary

4032
02:23:56,319 --> 02:23:57,920
and everyone thought that this meant

4033
02:23:57,920 --> 02:23:59,359
that you're not really making a

4034
02:23:59,359 --> 02:24:00,960
conscious decision that you could see

4035
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:03,840
this spike in brain activity earlier

4036
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:05,359
than the person thought they made the

4037
02:24:05,359 --> 02:24:08,240
voluntary voluntary decision

4038
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:09,920
but a new study has shown that that's

4039
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:11,359
only the case when we're making like

4040
02:24:11,359 --> 02:24:13,840
arbitrary decisions and when they had

4041
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:15,760
people making a decision about

4042
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:17,920
when when to donate like a large amount

4043
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:20,240
of money to a charity you actually saw

4044
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:22,960
this readiness potential disappear

4045
02:24:22,960 --> 02:24:25,920
and so it seems like deliberate thinking

4046
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:27,600
which is still this like prefrontal

4047
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:29,120
cortex

4048
02:24:29,120 --> 02:24:31,040
and there's this distinction between

4049
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:32,880
access consciousness and phenomenal

4050
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:35,120
consciousness that i didn't go into that

4051
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:36,960
i would in the next talk that adam

4052
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:38,720
saffron and integrated world modeling

4053
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:40,960
theory really gets at

4054
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:42,640
but the idea is that the prefrontal

4055
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:44,960
cortex does allow us to override

4056
02:24:44,960 --> 02:24:48,560
automatic behaviors and that is a sort

4057
02:24:48,560 --> 02:24:50,240
of freedom

4058
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:53,120
that we have and we also lose it

4059
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:55,359
uh in cases of schizophrenia you see

4060
02:24:55,359 --> 02:24:56,399
impaired

4061
02:24:56,399 --> 02:24:58,720
uh prefrontal cortex activity and drug

4062
02:24:58,720 --> 02:25:01,040
addicts you see impaired activity

4063
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:03,280
in drug addicts you see

4064
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:05,439
they do repetitive behavior even when

4065
02:25:05,439 --> 02:25:06,720
they know that it's

4066
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:07,600
uh

4067
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:10,000
not beneficial to them they will still

4068
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:11,840
engage in that so they're kind of stuck

4069
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:13,600
in this loop for this unhealthy

4070
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:15,200
attractor

4071
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:17,680
with schizophrenia there's patients that

4072
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:20,399
report being pushed around by

4073
02:25:20,399 --> 02:25:23,520
forces that are beyond their control

4074
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:24,800
i think that's because when the

4075
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:27,600
prefrontal cortex is uh

4076
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:31,040
basically deactivated um

4077
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:33,280
people lose this sense this ability to

4078
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:36,160
override their automatic behaviors

4079
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:38,080
and i think that's what those people are

4080
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:39,920
experiencing this sort of loss of this

4081
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:41,840
higher level agency that we've called

4082
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:44,720
free will um

4083
02:25:44,720 --> 02:25:46,319
another interesting just the final

4084
02:25:46,319 --> 02:25:48,800
interesting thing to mention about that

4085
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:51,600
is uh cotard's syndrome cotard's

4086
02:25:51,600 --> 02:25:53,760
delusion is this delusion where people

4087
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:56,080
think they're dead they think they're um

4088
02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:58,080
like ghost or just not alive it's really

4089
02:25:58,080 --> 02:25:59,200
weird a lot of people die from

4090
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:01,280
starvation because they think they don't

4091
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:02,479
have to eat because they think they're

4092
02:26:02,479 --> 02:26:03,600
already dead

4093
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:06,160
um you actually see from narrow imaging

4094
02:26:06,160 --> 02:26:08,240
studies they've showed uh

4095
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:10,560
like impaired activity in the prefrontal

4096
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:13,200
cortex so maybe these people who think

4097
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:14,560
they're dead

4098
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:17,520
have lost this high level agency and and

4099
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:18,960
they feel like they're ghosts or

4100
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:20,720
something um

4101
02:26:20,720 --> 02:26:22,640
as far as caring

4102
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:24,479
uh

4103
02:26:24,479 --> 02:26:27,680
so um caring is a part of like

4104
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:30,240
emerge through evolution because you do

4105
02:26:30,240 --> 02:26:32,640
have this benefit to cooperating with

4106
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:34,640
each other this self-organization

4107
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:35,920
process that we talked about that

4108
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:37,840
happens naturally because

4109
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:40,319
basically you find that when you work

4110
02:26:40,319 --> 02:26:44,479
together you minimize conflict and

4111
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:47,200
align it you align interest

4112
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:51,200
and so caring altruism empathy all of

4113
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:54,240
those things are as natural

4114
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:57,680
uh and as darwinian as anything else but

4115
02:26:57,680 --> 02:26:59,680
you have to

4116
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:01,920
add on to evolutionary theory all of

4117
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:03,840
this stuff about self-organization and

4118
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:06,000
cooperative evolution

4119
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:06,880
um

4120
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:08,479
as far as you see he said something

4121
02:27:08,479 --> 02:27:10,960
about why people

4122
02:27:10,960 --> 02:27:13,120
uh who uh

4123
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:14,880
don't believe in free will i forget the

4124
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:17,200
exact point about the caring what was

4125
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:20,479
that um when

4126
02:27:20,479 --> 02:27:22,479
when it appears that agents can or do

4127
02:27:22,479 --> 02:27:25,039
fully care

4128
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:26,800
sorry what was that what was the first

4129
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:28,720
part of it

4130
02:27:28,720 --> 02:27:30,720
um how would you explain caring through

4131
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:32,960
a lens a free will or no free will would

4132
02:27:32,960 --> 02:27:35,200
free will deniers say there is no caring

4133
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:37,040
when it appears that agents can or do

4134
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:39,280
fully care

4135
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:42,160
yeah no it's it it flies in the face of

4136
02:27:42,160 --> 02:27:45,280
like uh our our everyday experience so

4137
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:46,160
like

4138
02:27:46,160 --> 02:27:47,520
yeah um

4139
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:49,520
i

4140
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:50,640
the

4141
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:52,560
the the amount of contradictions and

4142
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:54,080
like logic that doesn't make sense when

4143
02:27:54,080 --> 02:27:55,920
you go down that path of there being no

4144
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:58,720
free will or agency

4145
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:00,000
you just

4146
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,640
you just get into absurd territory it's

4147
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:04,640
i think when we look back it's gonna

4148
02:28:04,640 --> 02:28:06,000
look quaint

4149
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,399
that for so long that we thought that

4150
02:28:08,399 --> 02:28:10,000
everything was determined in this strict

4151
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:10,880
sense

4152
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:12,560
and it's really a big issue because

4153
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:14,319
these people who believe that if they

4154
02:28:14,319 --> 02:28:17,439
believe it if they take it to heart

4155
02:28:17,439 --> 02:28:18,800
they're experiencing cognitive

4156
02:28:18,800 --> 02:28:21,359
dissonance at every moment you know and

4157
02:28:21,359 --> 02:28:22,560
the people who

4158
02:28:22,560 --> 02:28:24,479
argue against agency

4159
02:28:24,479 --> 02:28:26,160
they talk about religious people having

4160
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:27,840
to compartmentalize

4161
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:29,920
to deal with you know the the real world

4162
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:31,760
but anybody who believes that we don't

4163
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:34,000
have agency has to compartmentalize in

4164
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:35,359
the same way

4165
02:28:35,359 --> 02:28:37,600
uh funny little conversation between sam

4166
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:40,800
harris and his uh wife um

4167
02:28:40,800 --> 02:28:43,680
uh annika harris uh who wrote a book

4168
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:46,000
called conscious that is a great

4169
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,640
accessible book but it leaves out like

4170
02:28:48,640 --> 02:28:50,960
everything that i've discussed and that

4171
02:28:50,960 --> 02:28:52,720
i would discuss about like

4172
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:54,880
the bayesian brain hypothesis

4173
02:28:54,880 --> 02:28:56,640
uh global workspace theory doesn't

4174
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:58,000
really go into integrated information

4175
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:01,680
theory in any depth so like all of the

4176
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:03,439
things that they're missing

4177
02:29:03,439 --> 02:29:06,240
that do explain a lot of this stuff uh

4178
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:07,840
can be found in like modern neural

4179
02:29:07,840 --> 02:29:09,280
science so we are making a lot of

4180
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:10,640
progress

4181
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:11,520
towards

4182
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:13,439
you know understanding the hard problem

4183
02:29:13,439 --> 02:29:14,880
of consciousness so subjective

4184
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:16,560
experience but also a free will and

4185
02:29:16,560 --> 02:29:17,920
agency

4186
02:29:17,920 --> 02:29:19,040
but it's funny because they're having

4187
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:21,120
this conversation in the podcast

4188
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:24,319
and they're discussing whether since

4189
02:29:24,319 --> 02:29:26,560
a belief and no free will as mentioned

4190
02:29:26,560 --> 02:29:28,479
that new york times article

4191
02:29:28,479 --> 02:29:31,200
i think 2011 showed that

4192
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:33,520
they have less moral behavior and it can

4193
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:35,359
you know cause depression they're

4194
02:29:35,359 --> 02:29:36,640
discussing whether they should tell

4195
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:38,399
their daughter about free will or not

4196
02:29:38,399 --> 02:29:40,560
that she doesn't have any free will the

4197
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:42,000
discussion is like should we tell our

4198
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,160
daughter that she doesn't have free will

4199
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:47,040
but the actual discussion

4200
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:48,560
implies that they believe that they have

4201
02:29:48,560 --> 02:29:50,399
some choice whether to tell her or not

4202
02:29:50,399 --> 02:29:51,600
they're having a discussion about

4203
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:53,520
whether they should do this or not so

4204
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:55,520
there's a contradiction in their

4205
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:57,040
conversation

4206
02:29:57,040 --> 02:29:58,399
that contradicts what they believe

4207
02:29:58,399 --> 02:30:00,479
what's interesting is that

4208
02:30:00,479 --> 02:30:02,399
if they do tell her that she has no free

4209
02:30:02,399 --> 02:30:04,720
will and she believes it she's actually

4210
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:05,680
gonna

4211
02:30:05,680 --> 02:30:07,439
have negative mental effects like it

4212
02:30:07,439 --> 02:30:08,960
will

4213
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:11,359
you know be harmful um assuming that she

4214
02:30:11,359 --> 02:30:13,200
really believes it i don't know if it

4215
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:15,359
has that in everyone but

4216
02:30:15,359 --> 02:30:19,600
you do see studies that show that um so

4217
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:22,399
if we do have free will it's a very

4218
02:30:22,399 --> 02:30:25,359
bad thing to be telling people

4219
02:30:25,359 --> 02:30:26,319
um

4220
02:30:26,319 --> 02:30:28,000
and the last thing i'll say about that

4221
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:29,040
is

4222
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:31,760
well it's it's interesting because

4223
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:34,240
if she's familiar with epistemology and

4224
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:35,520
they tell her that she doesn't have free

4225
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:38,640
will but she goes okay that's based on a

4226
02:30:38,640 --> 02:30:40,479
model that has uncertainty and that

4227
02:30:40,479 --> 02:30:42,560
model may be disproved

4228
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:44,080
then she

4229
02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:45,760
might not have the negative effects of

4230
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:47,840
free will so i think everyone should

4231
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:49,840
practice being a good bayesian and

4232
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:51,920
understand that our models our theories

4233
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:54,479
even the one that i just talked about um

4234
02:30:54,479 --> 02:30:56,560
will have errors and will be shown to be

4235
02:30:56,560 --> 02:30:57,920
wrong and

4236
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:00,240
if reductionists do that they won't call

4237
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:02,960
free will belief and free will like

4238
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:05,040
comparing them to horoscopes which is

4239
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:08,160
just i think a horrible statement and

4240
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:09,920
kind of funny that physicists don't like

4241
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:12,160
it when like neuroscientists start and

4242
02:31:12,160 --> 02:31:13,760
biologists start like talking about

4243
02:31:13,760 --> 02:31:14,880
physics

4244
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:16,960
it's kind of strange that physicists are

4245
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:19,040
are so sure that we don't have free will

4246
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:21,040
when they're not familiar at all with

4247
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:22,399
the neuroscience

4248
02:31:22,399 --> 02:31:25,520
behind agency and free will

4249
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:27,040
so

4250
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:28,560
would you like me to

4251
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:30,399
just read a comment in the chat

4252
02:31:30,399 --> 02:31:32,160
otherwise i think we can kind of come to

4253
02:31:32,160 --> 02:31:34,160
a close

4254
02:31:34,160 --> 02:31:36,240
um if there's anything yeah i can do one

4255
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:40,000
more question yeah well uh marco and

4256
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:41,760
dave and others thanks a lot for the

4257
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:42,640
great

4258
02:31:42,640 --> 02:31:44,560
comments and commentary in the chat i

4259
02:31:44,560 --> 02:31:47,120
hope that bobby i have you check the um

4260
02:31:47,120 --> 02:31:48,960
live chat replay

4261
02:31:48,960 --> 02:31:52,880
um and uh sean o'connor wrote thanks for

4262
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:55,040
the good and informative talk

4263
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:57,200
dr azarian mentioned the idea of

4264
02:31:57,200 --> 02:31:59,280
evolutionary arms race i was hoping to

4265
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:02,319
recommend that he consider if he hasn't

4266
02:32:02,319 --> 02:32:05,200
how an intra-specific evolutionary arms

4267
02:32:05,200 --> 02:32:07,600
race may relate

4268
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:11,439
i'm not familiar with the specific so uh

4269
02:32:11,439 --> 02:32:13,920
perhaps like a game theory

4270
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:17,840
red queen not between uh two species but

4271
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:18,880
within one

4272
02:32:18,880 --> 02:32:20,319
[Music]

4273
02:32:20,319 --> 02:32:22,560
species

4274
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:23,600
yes

4275
02:32:23,600 --> 02:32:24,800
so

4276
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:26,319
you would have an evolutionary arms race

4277
02:32:26,319 --> 02:32:27,920
there too yeah certainly because you're

4278
02:32:27,920 --> 02:32:30,880
competing with other organisms um

4279
02:32:30,880 --> 02:32:33,439
and uh

4280
02:32:33,439 --> 02:32:35,200
uh john maynard smith who i mentioned

4281
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:37,920
earlier uh talking about like this

4282
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:40,720
causal power of information and biology

4283
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:42,000
he uh

4284
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,399
was the person to bring von neumann's

4285
02:32:44,399 --> 02:32:47,120
game theory to biological evolution

4286
02:32:47,120 --> 02:32:50,160
so he did uh he basically

4287
02:32:50,160 --> 02:32:52,880
showed that there is this you know game

4288
02:32:52,880 --> 02:32:55,439
theory sort of process being played out

4289
02:32:55,439 --> 02:32:56,640
i think he

4290
02:32:56,640 --> 02:32:59,120
his examples use different species

4291
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:02,399
but i think within species um

4292
02:33:02,399 --> 02:33:04,319
you would see the sorts same sort of

4293
02:33:04,319 --> 02:33:07,120
thing of course if it's not humans you

4294
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:08,640
know if you have other

4295
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:11,120
species people are competing

4296
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:13,200
organisms are competing you will get

4297
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:14,560
increased complexity but there are

4298
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:16,880
limits so just because there's these

4299
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:18,720
evolutionary arm races

4300
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:21,280
uh within and between species

4301
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:23,600
there will still be a limit because

4302
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:24,399
uh

4303
02:33:24,399 --> 02:33:26,240
they have to model the environment and

4304
02:33:26,240 --> 02:33:28,080
just modeling all these unnecessary

4305
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:29,280
variables

4306
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:32,399
uh is is wasteful so

4307
02:33:32,399 --> 02:33:33,280
um

4308
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:35,520
it will ratchet up complexity

4309
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:37,120
in species but

4310
02:33:37,120 --> 02:33:38,319
um

4311
02:33:38,319 --> 02:33:40,640
i think at least with the planet earth

4312
02:33:40,640 --> 02:33:42,160
and our biosphere

4313
02:33:42,160 --> 02:33:44,560
that uh

4314
02:33:44,560 --> 02:33:47,359
that humans are this sort of leading

4315
02:33:47,359 --> 02:33:48,399
envelope

4316
02:33:48,399 --> 02:33:52,399
uh of complexity and um so it really

4317
02:33:52,399 --> 02:33:55,200
just is open-ended with the most complex

4318
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:57,760
species so the most complex species is

4319
02:33:57,760 --> 02:33:59,920
the one that will evolve toward higher

4320
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:01,359
complexity

4321
02:34:01,359 --> 02:34:03,120
and uh

4322
02:34:03,120 --> 02:34:04,960
really there might be a limit there

4323
02:34:04,960 --> 02:34:06,160
there are reasons to think there are

4324
02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:08,640
limits to how far human biological

4325
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:10,720
intelligence can emerge there's i mean

4326
02:34:10,720 --> 02:34:12,640
can evolve towards there's something

4327
02:34:12,640 --> 02:34:14,560
called a cephalization limit which is

4328
02:34:14,560 --> 02:34:16,960
like how big our brain can get because

4329
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:18,479
of reasons like having to do with like

4330
02:34:18,479 --> 02:34:19,680
the skull

4331
02:34:19,680 --> 02:34:20,720
and

4332
02:34:20,720 --> 02:34:21,600
um

4333
02:34:21,600 --> 02:34:22,399
so

4334
02:34:22,399 --> 02:34:24,319
but what's interesting is

4335
02:34:24,319 --> 02:34:26,399
part of this process

4336
02:34:26,399 --> 02:34:29,840
this evolutionary process is popper and

4337
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:31,840
newer people like dennett have mentioned

4338
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:33,920
continues with science and culture and

4339
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:35,200
technology

4340
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:37,600
so humans really have open-ended

4341
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:40,479
complexity because we're uh we're

4342
02:34:40,479 --> 02:34:44,000
augmenting ourselves with technology so

4343
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,560
while biology biological complexity may

4344
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:49,520
have limits there's no limits

4345
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:51,200
once we start merging with our

4346
02:34:51,200 --> 02:34:52,560
technology

4347
02:34:52,560 --> 02:34:55,040
and we shouldn't see technology

4348
02:34:55,040 --> 02:34:56,720
as separate from

4349
02:34:56,720 --> 02:34:57,760
life

4350
02:34:57,760 --> 02:34:59,680
it's an extension of biology so the

4351
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:01,760
extended phenotype richard falcons

4352
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:04,399
explains like beaver dams considers like

4353
02:35:04,399 --> 02:35:06,160
the dam that the beaver instinctually

4354
02:35:06,160 --> 02:35:08,640
builds as part of the whole phenotype so

4355
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:10,720
the ecosystem the organism there's

4356
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:12,080
really no clear division between the

4357
02:35:12,080 --> 02:35:14,479
organism and the ecosystem and david

4358
02:35:14,479 --> 02:35:15,920
chalmers has the extended mind

4359
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:18,399
hypothesis which says that our phones

4360
02:35:18,399 --> 02:35:20,399
are extensions of our minds

4361
02:35:20,399 --> 02:35:21,840
and um

4362
02:35:21,840 --> 02:35:24,800
all of our devices are and

4363
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:26,160
for that reason we need to be worried

4364
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:28,960
about privacy but we also need to not be

4365
02:35:28,960 --> 02:35:31,760
scared of technology we just need to use

4366
02:35:31,760 --> 02:35:34,800
technology to become more human so we're

4367
02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:37,040
not transcending

4368
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:39,520
like humanity and biology

4369
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:41,920
technology will allow us to become hyper

4370
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:44,640
biological

4371
02:35:45,840 --> 02:35:46,800
very

4372
02:35:46,800 --> 02:35:50,880
interesting note perhaps to close it on

4373
02:35:50,880 --> 02:35:53,359
anytime you want the dot too

4374
02:35:53,359 --> 02:35:55,280
we can make it happen it can be any

4375
02:35:55,280 --> 02:35:58,399
format we can invite anyone else on

4376
02:35:58,399 --> 02:35:59,760
