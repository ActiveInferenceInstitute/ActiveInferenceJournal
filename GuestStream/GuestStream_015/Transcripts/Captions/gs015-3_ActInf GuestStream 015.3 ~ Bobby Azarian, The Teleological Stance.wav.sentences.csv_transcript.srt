1
00:00:07,463 --> 00:00:09,021
Daniel: Hello and welcome everyone.

2
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:14,585
This is ActInf GuestStream 15.3, lucky

3
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:14,585
number three with Bobby!

4
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:18,950
We're here with Bobby Azarian as well as

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,950
some guests.

6
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:23,450
We're going to have a discussion, talk

7
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:23,450
about a range of different topics.

8
00:00:23,492 --> 00:00:30,145
It's June 1 2023 1st, Adam and Michael

9
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:30,145
can intro introduce themselves.

10
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:36,781
Then Bobby will pass it off to you for

11
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:36,781
sharing your screen and facilitating this

12
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:36,781
however you see fit.

13
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:38,962
So Adam, go for it.

14
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:51,210
Adam: Hello I'm Adam, I am a research

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:51,210
fellow at the Johns Hopkins Center for

16
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:51,210
Psychedelic and Consciousness Research.

17
00:00:52,343 --> 00:01:12,765
Long standing interest in the free energy

18
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:12,765
principle, consciousness, free will,

19
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:12,765
psychedelics, artificial intelligence and

20
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:12,765
along the way I met and befriended Bobby

21
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:12,765
and I guess proud to be part of the

22
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:12,765
movement.

23
00:01:14,919 --> 00:01:15,021
Bobby: Thanks for coming Adam.

24
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:27,246
Yeah, Adam I wish we would have time to

25
00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:27,246
get into this today but Adam has

26
00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:27,246
presented a pretty clear mechanistic

27
00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:27,246
model of free will, cybernetic free

28
00:01:27,246 --> 00:01:27,246
will.

29
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:49,048
And there's just this huge problem where

30
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:49,048
and I'll keep this short, we got to

31
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:49,048
introduce Michael, but basically the main

32
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:49,048
kind of straw man against free will is

33
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:49,048
that there's this argument that you have

34
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:49,048
this nonphysical mind doing stuff outside

35
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:49,048
of causality and that's why everyone's

36
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:49,048
rejecting it as not a scientific idea.

37
00:01:50,052 --> 00:01:55,107
But of course something can't work if it

38
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:55,107
doesn't have mechanism.

39
00:01:55,108 --> 00:01:57,125
If it's not real, it's not real.

40
00:01:57,126 --> 00:02:05,147
So it's kind of a ridiculous debate to

41
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:05,147
have if you want to talk about what

42
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:05,147
people are talking about when they

43
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:05,147
discuss free will.

44
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:22,313
In the past we didn't have mechanisms to

45
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:22,313
understand what that was, but now we

46
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:22,313
understand things like top down

47
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:22,313
causation, we understand control and when

48
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:22,313
you have that language you can actually

49
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:22,313
talk about what free will is in a

50
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:22,313
mechanistic way and that just changes the

51
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:22,313
debate completely.

52
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:29,384
That's not enough to convince people that

53
00:02:29,384 --> 00:02:29,384
there's something called free will

54
00:02:29,384 --> 00:02:29,384
because there's a lot of issues that we

55
00:02:29,384 --> 00:02:29,384
get into.

56
00:02:29,384 --> 00:02:45,548
But Adam's one of the people that have

57
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:45,548
been taking this nebulous concept and

58
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:45,548
have been trying to show that there's

59
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:45,548
actually a very specific set of

60
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:45,548
mechanisms and it's nothing outside of

61
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:45,548
science but it is science that is outside

62
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:45,548
of our current paradigm.

63
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:55,639
It's just dynamics that we don't normally

64
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:55,639
that weren't included in the previous

65
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:55,639
model so it looked like magic but there's

66
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:55,639
stuff going on there.

67
00:02:55,643 --> 00:03:04,670
So yeah, we're going to have a longer

68
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:04,670
discussion with Adam in the future either

69
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:04,670
on my channel or maybe we'll come back

70
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:04,670
and make it all about free will because

71
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:04,670
it's such a big topic.

72
00:03:04,672 --> 00:03:11,747
But yeah, thanks for coming and invite

73
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:11,747
Michael as well.

74
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:13,759
Yes.

75
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:15,786
Michael: Am I supposed to take the wheel

76
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:15,786
now?

77
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:16,792
Yeah.

78
00:03:17,802 --> 00:03:19,829
Obviously, I'm a fan of Bobby's.

79
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:28,917
I very much like well, I think it's

80
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:28,917
important, I think, the work that Bobby

81
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:28,917
is trying to articulate.

82
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:34,970
And Adam, I'm a fan, so this is the first

83
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:34,970
time we've met, but I've watched some of

84
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:34,970
your stuff as well.

85
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,024
And Daniel, obviously, we've talked, and

86
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:39,024
yeah, let's just yield to Bobby.

87
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:41,043
And let's see where we go here.

88
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:41,048
Bobby: Yeah.

89
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:45,089
Michael has a background in kind of

90
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:45,089
system science and those kind of things.

91
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:57,204
That's how we kind of resonate is kind of

92
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:57,204
like the system science approach, but

93
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:57,204
thinking about how system science can be

94
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:57,204
applied to psychology and organizational

95
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:57,204
issues.

96
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:01,181
So how to make this stuff that's very

97
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:01,181
theoretical practical.

98
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:04,211
And so we're kind of working on that on

99
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:04,211
the side.

100
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:07,248
And then Brennan Grand MC will be coming

101
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:07,248
and joining the conversation.

102
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:10,277
Since he's not here right now, I'll just

103
00:04:10,277 --> 00:04:10,277
give a little introduction for him.

104
00:04:10,278 --> 00:04:17,340
He's the author of a book called

105
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:17,340
emergentism, and he has a Facebook group

106
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:17,340
called Metamodern Spirituality.

107
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:30,478
And basically in that book, he's turned

108
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:30,478
this emergence paradigm, which is

109
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:30,478
basically kind of the opposite of the

110
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:30,478
reductionist paradigm, into something

111
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:30,478
like a sort of secular religion.

112
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,534
So he's talking about a lot of these same

113
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:36,534
things.

114
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:39,563
So he'll join us shortly, probably.

115
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:43,604
I think he's watching the stream and is

116
00:04:43,604 --> 00:04:43,604
trying to get into the zoom link.

117
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:46,635
So yeah, we can start.

118
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:51,684
It'd be great for this to be sort of a

119
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:51,684
discussion.

120
00:04:51,684 --> 00:05:06,774
So if anything I say triggers any sort of

121
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:06,774
thoughts or criticisms, please speak up,

122
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:06,774
because I don't have an organized set of

123
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:06,774
slides and there's a lot to talk about.

124
00:05:06,775 --> 00:05:13,841
And the problem really, when I was trying

125
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:13,841
to make these slides was like, everything

126
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:13,841
I say kind of gets into something else.

127
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:18,893
And so I had, like 100 slides, and I was

128
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:18,893
just trying to organize them in the last

129
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:18,893
minute.

130
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:29,000
So I think I have some slides that were

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
made in the past for other presentations

132
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
that are just going to be kind of like a

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
roadmap, but we can veer off of that.

134
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:32,030
And I'm going to be saying a lot of stuff

135
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:32,030
that's not in the slides.

136
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:36,074
Yeah, so I guess we can start.

137
00:05:36,078 --> 00:05:41,126
So I'll share my screen because I just

138
00:05:41,126 --> 00:05:41,126
shared my screen from my computer and I

139
00:05:41,126 --> 00:05:41,126
couldn't see you.

140
00:05:41,126 --> 00:05:53,241
But I think the trick to that is to share

141
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:53,241
my screen through zoom and then share do,

142
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:53,241
like, slideshow, and then I should be

143
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:53,241
able to see your faces on the side.

144
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:53,248
Yes.

145
00:05:53,249 --> 00:06:01,269
Okay, so you can see my screen now, then

146
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:01,269
if I do slideshow, it doesn't perfect.

147
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:04,294
Okay.

148
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:12,377
Michael: Bobby, just before you get

149
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:12,377
started, I believe Brendan joined us as

150
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:12,377
well.

151
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:13,389
Bobby: Hey, Brendan!

152
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,431
Daniel: We warmed up the crowd.

153
00:06:18,432 --> 00:06:25,502
Bobby: His audio yeah, his audio is

154
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:25,502
probably not connected yet, so we can

155
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:25,502
just begin.

156
00:06:25,508 --> 00:06:29,545
Hey, Brendan, I introduced you, and I.

157
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:32,579
Brendan: Was just set on the YouTube

158
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:32,579
version, and then I got the link, so

159
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:32,579
great.

160
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:34,592
It's a pleasure to be here.

161
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:36,612
Thanks for thanks for the introduction.

162
00:06:36,612 --> 00:06:37,623
I appreciate it.

163
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,634
Bobby: Yeah, no problem.

164
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:42,677
Please feel free to chime in at any time

165
00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:42,677
because I really need help here.

166
00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:45,700
I'm not prepared to do this by myself.

167
00:06:47,724 --> 00:07:04,836
And maybe you can play the role of the

168
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:04,836
critic, too, because I should have

169
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:04,836
invited some anti free will people or

170
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:04,836
just some skeptics of these ideas,

171
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:04,836
because what I realized is, like, I'm

172
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:04,836
saying these things, a lot of them were

173
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:04,836
the things in my book The Romance of

174
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:04,836
Reality.

175
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:08,875
And I make that argument as clear as I

176
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:08,875
can.

177
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:16,952
But then people have criticisms that, for

178
00:07:16,952 --> 00:07:16,952
whatever reason, how I worded it, don't

179
00:07:16,952 --> 00:07:16,952
address those, and then they're not

180
00:07:16,952 --> 00:07:16,952
convinced.

181
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:21,002
And then I do nothing to convince anyone

182
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:21,002
who doesn't already believe this.

183
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:44,236
So it's actually a lot more fruitful if

184
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:44,236
there's sort of this dialectical debate

185
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:44,236
like this dynamic, because then you hear

186
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:44,236
both sides and then I can actually

187
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:44,236
address the things that people think are

188
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:44,236
the issues that might cast out on some of

189
00:07:44,236 --> 00:07:44,236
the things that I'm arguing.

190
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:48,270
The teleological stance.

191
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:54,335
So this is the name of the self help

192
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:54,335
system, for lack of a better term.

193
00:07:54,336 --> 00:08:01,349
I know people hear self help and they

194
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:01,349
think that's something like Cheesy and

195
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:01,349
New Age or BS.

196
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:06,390
And there are a lot of snake oil salesmen

197
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,390
in this place.

198
00:08:06,391 --> 00:08:29,628
And I think that's why it's so important

199
00:08:29,628 --> 00:08:29,628
that we try, if possible, to create

200
00:08:29,628 --> 00:08:29,628
something like a self help system and

201
00:08:29,628 --> 00:08:29,628
something almost like a religion, like

202
00:08:29,628 --> 00:08:29,628
something that has practices and a sort

203
00:08:29,628 --> 00:08:29,628
of instruction manual for a living based

204
00:08:29,628 --> 00:08:29,628
on scientific principles.

205
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:36,691
Now, it doesn't have to be based on

206
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:36,691
science, won't explain everything or

207
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:36,691
address everything.

208
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:46,793
But this provides a foundation where we

209
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:46,793
can actually start to build logic, where

210
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:46,793
we can go, some of these things are right

211
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:46,793
and some of these things aren't.

212
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:59,921
And we can start to see things that have

213
00:08:59,921 --> 00:08:59,921
been said in folk psychology or New Age

214
00:08:59,921 --> 00:08:59,921
practices that people just considered to

215
00:08:59,921 --> 00:08:59,921
be non scientific or pseudoscience.

216
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:13,003
We can see how that maps on to some of

217
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:13,003
these newer mechanisms that we're

218
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:13,003
understanding, because now we're starting

219
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:13,003
to look at biology and neuroscience and

220
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:13,003
psychology from the perspective of

221
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:13,003
information theory and thermodynamics.

222
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:26,134
And these are revealing new mechanisms

223
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:26,134
that I believe can create a bridge

224
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:26,134
between reductionist science and the

225
00:09:26,134 --> 00:09:26,134
higher sciences.

226
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:38,257
But also a lot of these statements you'll

227
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:38,257
hear things that you hear in, like,

228
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:38,257
spiritual circles or people are doing

229
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:38,257
practices, just different little things

230
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:38,257
that they find to be very effective.

231
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:43,309
In most cases, there's a scientific

232
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:43,309
explanation for why those things are

233
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:43,309
effective.

234
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,352
And most science minded people are

235
00:09:48,352 --> 00:09:48,352
ignoring all that stuff.

236
00:09:48,353 --> 00:10:01,423
So they're like throwing out all of these

237
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:01,423
things that emerged because they were

238
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:01,423
adaptations, like practices, community

239
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:01,423
building, things like that are just

240
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:01,423
completely being ignored.

241
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:03,448
And that's really bad.

242
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:06,471
It's just throwing the baby out with the

243
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:06,471
bathwater.

244
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:22,630
And as long as we have that mentality

245
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,630
scientists, they may say, I don't want to

246
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,630
promote religion, organized religion,

247
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,630
let's say, or like kind of New Age

248
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,630
spirituality, I don't want to promote

249
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,630
that.

250
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:40,811
But they're actually helping keep those

251
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:40,811
things in existence because a lot of

252
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:40,811
regular people are hearing this

253
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:40,811
scientific worldview that's the

254
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:40,811
mainstream worldview, and it's very

255
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:40,811
nihilistic in some of its beliefs, and

256
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:40,811
that'd be okay if that's how reality

257
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:40,811
was.

258
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:53,942
But we're going to see that a lot of

259
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:53,942
these are based on mistaken assumptions

260
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:53,942
and people are rejecting that worldview

261
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:53,942
because it doesn't offer anything of

262
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:53,942
value to them as a normal person.

263
00:10:53,944 --> 00:11:02,972
And they will opt for other less evidence

264
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:02,972
based worldviews or philosophies because

265
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:02,972
they're not getting that from that.

266
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:19,140
So science is actually helping, like

267
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,140
pseudoscience and things like that, if

268
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,140
they want to keep science isolated from

269
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,140
all these practical things and sort of

270
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,140
addressing bigger existential and even

271
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,140
spiritual questions.

272
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:24,197
And so if we can do that, if we can build

273
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:24,197
that bridge, it would be good for

274
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:24,197
unifying everyone.

275
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:35,308
But it would also cut down on a lot of

276
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:35,308
the pseudoscience and stuff that people

277
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:35,308
are trying to kind of prevent from not

278
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:35,308
going there.

279
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:39,342
But actually, I think that's part of the

280
00:11:39,342 --> 00:11:39,342
problem, if that makes any sense.

281
00:11:42,373 --> 00:11:46,412
So this is stuff from my substac Road to

282
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:46,412
Omega.

283
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:47,423
Go there and check it out.

284
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:55,506
There's posts on the teleological stance

285
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:55,506
that break this down in more detail than

286
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:55,506
I'll be able to give here today.

287
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:59,544
I have this word in this slide poetic

288
00:11:59,544 --> 00:11:59,544
meta Naturalism.

289
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:12,615
If you're familiar with my book, you

290
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:12,615
might have seen that it's not really

291
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:12,615
important to really talk about why I call

292
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:12,615
it that, but let's just say there are

293
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:12,615
these two distinctive worldviews.

294
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:21,700
So there's the old mainstream scientific

295
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:21,700
worldview, which is the reductionist

296
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:21,700
worldview, which I think is basically a

297
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:21,700
nihilistic worldview.

298
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:34,829
And there are a lot of assumptions built

299
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:34,829
into this worldview based on just we had

300
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:34,829
limited knowledge at the time of how the

301
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:34,829
world works.

302
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:44,933
So there were things like, for example,

303
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:44,933
when we thought the world was Newtonian,

304
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:44,933
you just couldn't get away from

305
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:44,933
determinism this kind of strict Laplacian

306
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:44,933
determinism.

307
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:50,992
Laplace basically took Newton's kind of

308
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:50,992
framework and tried to apply it to

309
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:50,992
everything.

310
00:12:50,993 --> 00:12:52,016
It's really interesting that Newton

311
00:12:52,016 --> 00:12:52,016
himself didn't do that.

312
00:12:52,016 --> 00:12:54,036
He didn't think that his laws applied to

313
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:54,036
life.

314
00:12:54,037 --> 00:13:07,100
And Newton was actually very religious

315
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,100
and thought there were all these crazy

316
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,100
hidden messages in the Bible, which is

317
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,100
neat and kind of like covered up because

318
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,100
people don't want people to know that

319
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,100
Newton was so religious.

320
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:14,173
So Laplace kind of created this

321
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:14,173
deterministic philosophy.

322
00:13:14,174 --> 00:13:19,224
And when we thought that was the truth,

323
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:19,224
then there was no room for human agency.

324
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:25,285
There was just one future trajectory and

325
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:25,285
we couldn't do anything to change that.

326
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:29,328
And we weren't really doing anything to

327
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:29,328
begin with.

328
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:42,452
Everything we do is sort of illusory and

329
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:42,452
we can talk about determinism in greater

330
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:42,452
detail, but that's one nihilistic aspect

331
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:42,452
is that we don't have any agency and we

332
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:42,452
don't have free will.

333
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:42,456
Brendan: Free will?

334
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:44,475
Bobby: It's a bit more of a loaded term.

335
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:51,547
There's just assumptions with that word,

336
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:51,547
like with the word free that make it a

337
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:51,547
little bit more of a contentious

338
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:51,547
subject.

339
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:59,623
But yeah, with determinism in the strict

340
00:13:59,623 --> 00:13:59,623
sense, no one could have any agency.

341
00:13:59,624 --> 00:14:12,690
So if you accept that scientific

342
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:12,690
proposition, then you're like basically

343
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:12,690
accepting that you have no control over

344
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:12,690
the future or your life.

345
00:14:12,691 --> 00:14:15,729
And that can be very depressing and

346
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:15,729
demotivating.

347
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:28,856
And there are studies that we can talk

348
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:28,856
about that have shown that that belief

349
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:28,856
actually causes people to, for example,

350
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:28,856
behave less morally.

351
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:35,921
They will be more likely to cheat because

352
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:35,921
they don't have culpability because no

353
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:35,921
one's responsible for anything.

354
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:47,042
That's them basically choosing to not

355
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:47,042
have this agency that I'll explain

356
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:47,042
exactly what I mean by that.

357
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:52,095
But basically, I mean the fact that you

358
00:14:52,095 --> 00:14:52,095
can tell them that and then they lose it

359
00:14:52,095 --> 00:14:52,095
and then they start behaving more

360
00:14:52,095 --> 00:14:52,095
immorally.

361
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:56,138
It's obvious that there's something

362
00:14:56,138 --> 00:14:56,138
causal there that's changing their

363
00:14:56,138 --> 00:14:56,138
behavior.

364
00:14:57,141 --> 00:15:01,123
So that's kind of a clue that that

365
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:01,123
picture something doesn't make sense

366
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:01,123
there.

367
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:09,207
And it also causes people to be really

368
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:09,207
depressed and have kind of existential

369
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:09,207
meltdowns.

370
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:15,265
I personally had when I thought

371
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:15,265
determinism was the only explanation that

372
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:15,265
made sense.

373
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:31,423
I sort of had times where I would have

374
00:15:31,423 --> 00:15:31,423
these experiences where I was very

375
00:15:31,423 --> 00:15:31,423
disturbed by the fact that I had no

376
00:15:31,423 --> 00:15:31,423
control over anything and that this was

377
00:15:31,423 --> 00:15:31,423
sort of a tape that was determined from

378
00:15:31,423 --> 00:15:31,423
the initial event and that I was just

379
00:15:31,423 --> 00:15:31,423
playing that out.

380
00:15:31,424 --> 00:15:37,484
It can be very disturbing if you take

381
00:15:37,484 --> 00:15:37,484
this stuff seriously.

382
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:44,550
And what I'm arguing is that a lot of the

383
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,550
scientists preaching this stuff, they're

384
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,550
not taking it seriously because they

385
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,550
can't.

386
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:49,609
Your life would just be over if you

387
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:49,609
really believe that you had no agency

388
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:49,609
because you would stop doing stuff.

389
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:55,664
Adam: I tried to take it seriously and it

390
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:55,664
took me out for a good two years.

391
00:15:56,673 --> 00:15:57,688
Bobby: How do you even take it

392
00:15:57,688 --> 00:15:57,688
seriously?

393
00:15:57,688 --> 00:15:58,697
What does that do?

394
00:15:58,698 --> 00:15:59,704
What do you do

395
00:15:59,704 --> 00:16:00,651
then?

396
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:03,684
Adam: It happened.

397
00:16:03,685 --> 00:16:10,756
It was a combination of reading this

398
00:16:10,756 --> 00:16:10,756
book, “The Meme Machine” by Susan

399
00:16:10,756 --> 00:16:10,756
Blackmore and “Darwin's.

400
00:16:10,757 --> 00:16:11,762
Dangerous Idea.”

401
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,786
There was this one sentence that just

402
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:13,786
took me out.

403
00:16:13,787 --> 00:16:27,922
It was like everything up to this moment,

404
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:27,922
including your genes, environment, and

405
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:27,922
all your experiences, including the first

406
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:27,922
half of this sentence, will determine how

407
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:27,922
you interpret the second half.

408
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:32,977
It was sort of like just this web of

409
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:32,977
causation being described on a different

410
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:32,977
level of analysis.

411
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:39,041
Sort of like bringing that to the

412
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:39,041
foreground and not seeing me in that

413
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:39,041
foreground.

414
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:45,102
And then I was like, oh, there isn't like

415
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:45,102
a neuron in my brain that knows or cares

416
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:45,102
that I exist as whole.

417
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:50,157
And that was, wait, not even sodium ions

418
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:50,157
are going to sodium ion.

419
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:52,177
They're just going to follow those

420
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:52,177
gradients.

421
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,192
Oh, God.

422
00:16:56,215 --> 00:17:03,221
It just sort of had me for a while.

423
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:17,361
Bobby: Does it kind of paralyze you or

424
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:17,361
did you just go, I'm going to do what I

425
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:17,361
was going to do anyway, but I'm going to

426
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:17,361
do it, I'm going to have this weird sort

427
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:17,361
of experience at the same time because

428
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:17,361
it's all meaningless.

429
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:18,371
I'm just going to go through life.

430
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:23,427
I'm probably going to look really sad,

431
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:23,427
but I'm going to do everything that I

432
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:23,427
plan to do otherwise?

433
00:17:23,428 --> 00:17:27,459
Or does it just shut you down where

434
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:27,459
you're like, I'm not going to get out of

435
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:27,459
bed?

436
00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:42,610
Adam: There was kind of like a double

437
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:42,610
consciousness about it too, because it

438
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:42,610
was like, I'd be moving between having

439
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:42,610
that as a frame, but then to take action,

440
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:42,610
you can't you can't you just.

441
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:43,623
Bobby: Got to throw it out the window.

442
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:53,725
Adam: On occasion, there would be kind of

443
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:53,725
like a maybe this I don't think it took

444
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:53,725
me in an unethical direction, but kind of

445
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:53,725
like a fracket mindset.

446
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:58,774
Like, well, nothing matters anyway, so

447
00:17:58,774 --> 00:17:58,774
woo.

448
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:01,745
Bobby: Yeah, really stick for me.

449
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:04,772
Brendan: Can I offer a devil's advocate

450
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:04,772
take here?

451
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:07,800
And I don't know if we're derailing.

452
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,830
Bobby: Or no, this is perfect, this is

453
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:10,830
great.

454
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:23,960
Brendan: And it is very much a devil's

455
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:23,960
advocate position because I think, Bobby,

456
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:23,960
you and I are very much aligned on trying

457
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:23,960
to emphasize the importance of free will,

458
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:23,960
the causal power of information,

459
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:23,960
potentially, et cetera.

460
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:30,003
I'm sure you might get into some of that,

461
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:30,003
but I will say this in its favor or in

462
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:30,003
addition to what's being said.

463
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:39,012
So I also had an experience like that of

464
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:39,012
suffering from the seeming implications

465
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:39,012
of the deterministic universe.

466
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:46,019
But I do think that there's a way of also

467
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:46,019
allowing all of that to be the case and

468
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:46,019
responding differently.

469
00:18:46,019 --> 00:19:05,032
And there are a number of different ways

470
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:05,032
that that can look, I mean, there's the

471
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:05,032
Nietzsche approach to this which is

472
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:05,032
actually kind of taking this

473
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:05,032
deterministic cycle and kind of the

474
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:05,032
eternal recurrence of the same as sort of

475
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:05,032
a wild yes saying to existence, and I'll

476
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:05,032
just throw that out there and bracket

477
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:05,032
it.

478
00:19:05,032 --> 00:19:06,033
We could come back to that one.

479
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:08,035
Bobby: What do you mean by that?

480
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:09,035
Sorry.

481
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:17,044
Brendan: Nietzsche was he would

482
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:17,044
philosophize while walking or he would

483
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:17,044
think his philosophy while going on these

484
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:17,044
long walks and everything, right?

485
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:29,056
And one day he was walking in the Swiss

486
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
Alps and he sees this gigantic rock and

487
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
he comes to this sudden realization and I

488
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
guess I won't get into the whole story

489
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
because it would probably be a little bit

490
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
too much.

491
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:56,083
But basically the realization that

492
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
springs there, which he has at this sort

493
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
of monolithic scene, is somehow he sort

494
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
of transported and appreciates that what

495
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
he would need to do was affirm his

496
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
existence under the assumption that

497
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
everything that has happened and will

498
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
happen, will happen over and over and

499
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
over again for eternity.

500
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:59,086
All the mistakes, all the ecstasies, et

501
00:19:59,086 --> 00:19:59,086
cetera.

502
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:01,082
It was all there almost.

503
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:06,087
You could kind of think of it kind of in

504
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:06,087
the there's the Big Bang, big crunch

505
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:06,087
model and then it repeats.

506
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:08,089
And so let's say something like that.

507
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:11,092
Bobby: Is happening, where yeah, he

508
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:11,092
called it eternal recurrence.

509
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:14,095
Brendan: Right, yeah, eternal

510
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:14,095
recurrence.

511
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:22,103
And he basically said that we need to be

512
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,103
able to positively affirm that in an

513
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,103
exuberant sense.

514
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:25,106
Bobby: What does that mean?

515
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:36,117
Brendan: Well, what it means is that if

516
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:36,117
you take the idea seriously that this is

517
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:36,117
your life and you are therefore radically

518
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:36,117
responsible in some ways for what you

519
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:36,117
experience.

520
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:50,131
And I'll come back to this in the sense

521
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
of what responsibility could mean in this

522
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
context as well, then it actually imbues

523
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
everything with an incredible

524
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
significance because this is what you'll

525
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:50,131
be experiencing over and over again.

526
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:55,136
The second thing I wanted to say, which I

527
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:55,136
think might kind of preempt some of your

528
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:55,136
kind of like, well, how does that work?

529
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:55,136
Right?

530
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:57,137
How can you be responsible?

531
00:20:57,138 --> 00:21:16,150
Is I do think that there's a

532
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,150
phenomenological way that you can come to

533
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,150
terms with determinism that basically

534
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,150
concludes something like, okay, even if

535
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,150
mechanistically this can be describable

536
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,150
in terms of deterministic, cause and

537
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,150
effect all the way back.

538
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:20,155
My experience of it is rather different.

539
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,157
I have the experience of free will.

540
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:27,162
I feel as though as if I can choose as I

541
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:27,162
want to.

542
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:39,174
And so there is no necessary reason why

543
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:39,174
some descriptive framework needs to

544
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:39,174
impinge upon my own phenomenological

545
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:39,174
sense of reality.

546
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:47,182
So for a long time I made peace with this

547
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:47,182
question that way by basically saying,

548
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:47,182
yeah, it's all determined, but I feel as

549
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:47,182
though I have free will.

550
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:52,187
And that's really, I think, the core

551
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:52,187
there because let me say something

552
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:52,187
about.

553
00:21:52,187 --> 00:22:00,189
Bobby: That and I don't want it to seem

554
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:00,189
dismissive, but I mean, this is not your

555
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:00,189
idea anyway, so I don't really have to

556
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:00,189
apologize to you.

557
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:05,194
It's Nietzsche, and it's one of the

558
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:05,194
possible things that I think you're

559
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:05,194
considering.

560
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:07,196
But we've talked about this.

561
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:10,199
I think we have similar ideas about

562
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:10,199
agency.

563
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:16,205
What I want to say about that is

564
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:16,205
basically that is similar to

565
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:16,205
compatibilism.

566
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:22,211
And what's going on is that these people

567
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:22,211
are there's language games.

568
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:36,225
First of all, if you believe that causal

569
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:36,225
story in the strict sense and it's more

570
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:36,225
complicated that because I'm saying that

571
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:36,225
there is causality.

572
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:40,229
There's always cause and effect to

573
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:40,229
everything and that doesn't not permit

574
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:40,229
agency.

575
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:56,245
But what I'm going to say is the kind of

576
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:56,245
magic ingredient to understanding how

577
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:56,245
this can be mechanistic idea or

578
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:56,245
mechanistic process, how free will can be

579
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:56,245
explained as part of the causal chain.

580
00:22:56,245 --> 00:23:00,243
We need to talk about top down causation

581
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:00,243
and that's really the game changer.

582
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:05,248
But without top down causation, I don't

583
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:05,248
think there is any responsibility.

584
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:12,255
And what I think that Nietzsche and

585
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:12,255
others are doing is, first of all,

586
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:12,255
they're compartmentalizing.

587
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:19,262
They're not fully taking the determinism

588
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:19,262
they're talking about seriously.

589
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:29,272
And if you do that, you have to

590
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:29,272
compartmentalize if you believe that

591
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:29,272
because like Adam said, you have to throw

592
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:29,272
that out when you actually want to take

593
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:29,272
action.

594
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:38,280
So first of all, everybody who believes

595
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,280
in determinism is kind of living a split

596
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,280
personality life and that leads to all

597
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,280
kinds of cognitive dissonance.

598
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:39,282
But it's worse than that.

599
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:43,286
You still are in a way.

600
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:44,287
Adam: It depends.

601
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:59,302
I'm agnostic about determinism in terms

602
00:23:59,302 --> 00:23:59,302
of like that was part of, but it wasn't

603
00:23:59,302 --> 00:23:59,302
agnosticism about determinism, but going

604
00:23:59,302 --> 00:23:59,302
more deflationary on causation or more

605
00:23:59,302 --> 00:23:59,302
instrumentalist on causation.

606
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:01,298
Bobby: And I do think that I'm open.

607
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:14,311
Adam: To there being a best causal

608
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:14,311
handling, or there could be like a new

609
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:14,311
Gestalt for me where causation kind of

610
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:14,311
enters into physics and full majesty

611
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:14,311
and.

612
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:16,313
Bobby: That'S what this is.

613
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:17,314
That's what I want to describe.

614
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:23,320
Adam: But the move for me was

615
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:23,320
compatibilism via instrumental

616
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:23,320
causation.

617
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,324
That kind of stays within Carol's, like

618
00:24:27,324 --> 00:24:27,324
it stays in its lane.

619
00:24:28,324 --> 00:24:35,332
Bobby: Yes, I will put out a thing out

620
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:35,332
there where you could have determinism

621
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:35,332
and have true agency too.

622
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:53,350
At these higher levels, you would still

623
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,350
need top down causation, but you might

624
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,350
not need any indeterminism at the most

625
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,350
fundamental level, like quantum

626
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,350
indeterminism, and you could still have

627
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,350
potentially agency and that's sort of

628
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,350
Adam's perspective or like he says, he's

629
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:53,350
agnostic on it.

630
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:57,354
But in the future, I hope to convince

631
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:57,354
Adam that there's a better solution.

632
00:24:58,355 --> 00:25:11,362
What I was saying to Brendan is that

633
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:11,362
these are language games when he's like,

634
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:11,362
it's truly this way, it's this way, but

635
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:11,362
that should make you feel like you're

636
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:11,362
responsible because this is the life you

637
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:11,362
have and the one you're going to repair

638
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:11,362
or whatever.

639
00:25:11,362 --> 00:25:12,363
It's good reasoning.

640
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:14,365
Brian Green says similar stuff and that's

641
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:14,365
why I say this.

642
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:27,378
Brian Green is like, the decision is

643
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:27,378
real, but it's not really you making it,

644
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:27,378
but it's a real, like a lot of strange,

645
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:27,378
weird language games that if you actually

646
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:27,378
make language the focus, which I wanted

647
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:27,378
to do, but it's way too abstract.

648
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:32,383
Like, I didn't have time to nail that

649
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:32,383
down for today, but that's what I want to

650
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:32,383
do in the future.

651
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:45,396
And you can show that people who are

652
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:45,396
talking about this stuff, especially

653
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:45,396
people who are trying to find some sort

654
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:45,396
of silver lining to determinism, they're

655
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:45,396
using words inconsistently.

656
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:48,399
They will use a word one way and then

657
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:48,399
contradict it.

658
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:52,403
They might even use the same word in two

659
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:52,403
different ways in the same sentence.

660
00:25:52,403 --> 00:26:09,414
But basically you can't have well, I'm

661
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:09,414
going to let you respond, Brendan, but I

662
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:09,414
don't think there can be in that model

663
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:09,414
any true responsibility and then this

664
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:09,414
solution of like, but I feel like I have

665
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:09,414
it, to me, it doesn't give you anything

666
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:09,414
additional.

667
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:11,416
Like, you're just an epic phenomenon.

668
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:13,418
And to me that can be almost worse.

669
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:21,426
He's given a nice spin on the positive

670
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:21,426
way you can see it, but there's other

671
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:21,426
people, like illusionists, that say,

672
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:21,426
yeah, we have this phenomenal

673
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:21,426
experience.

674
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:25,430
It feels like I have free will, but

675
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,430
there's absolutely no responsibility.

676
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,433
Like, Sam Harris was like, I don't have

677
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:28,433
pride.

678
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:34,439
A friend was just talking to me about

679
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
this because he's a Sam Harris fan, but

680
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
he is turned off by this whole no free

681
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
will thing.

682
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:38,443
And then he hears Sam Harris contradict

683
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:38,443
himself all the time because Sam Harris

684
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:38,443
will say, you don't have free will.

685
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:40,445
And the whole thing is on free will.

686
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:45,450
And then there's a little commercial for

687
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:45,450
his podcast where he goes, you have the

688
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:45,450
freedom to choose to listen to this

689
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:45,450
podcast.

690
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:50,455
It's like you're using double talk, like,

691
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:50,455
constantly.

692
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:51,456
Adam: I think it's very notable.

693
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:52,457
Sam Harris does not tell that to.

694
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:57,462
Bobby: His daughter, and he says that

695
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:57,462
they.

696
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:58,463
Adam: Say it to each other.

697
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:05,464
Bobby: He says, I'm not going to tell my

698
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:05,464
kids because it's going to make them

699
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:05,464
behave differently and like all these bad

700
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:05,464
things that I said.

701
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:09,468
But when they grow up, I'll tell them

702
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:09,468
that they don't have any agency when

703
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:09,468
they're ready for it.

704
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:14,473
But what I'm saying is all of that is

705
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:14,473
absolutely ridiculous talk.

706
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:21,480
It's absolutely nonsense to be like, she

707
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,480
doesn't have age, I'm not going to tell

708
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,480
everything he's doing.

709
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:32,491
The whole argument is completely self

710
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
defeating in every way, and there's a lot

711
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
of people that have tried to make nice

712
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
stories out of it, but ultimately they're

713
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
contradicting themselves.

714
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:36,495
And compatibilism in its current form is

715
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:36,495
a contradiction.

716
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:43,502
And people call it out for that all the

717
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:43,502
time, but that doesn't stop the

718
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:43,502
compatibleists because it seems like the

719
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:43,502
best answer.

720
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:47,506
It goes, yeah, but I experience this

721
00:27:47,506 --> 00:27:47,506
agency, so it has to be real on some

722
00:27:47,506 --> 00:27:47,506
level.

723
00:27:47,506 --> 00:27:50,509
But then how can we go against this

724
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:50,509
determinism?

725
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:52,511
It seems to go against causality in

726
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:52,511
general.

727
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:55,514
So it's like a lot of people like Dan

728
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:55,514
didn't.

729
00:27:56,514 --> 00:28:13,526
Their solution was like, I'm not going to

730
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:13,526
go against these sorts of like, I'm not

731
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:13,526
going to go against determinism or

732
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:13,526
causality, which I'm saying it doesn't go

733
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:13,526
against causality, but they think the

734
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:13,526
best solution is to try to do some magic

735
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:13,526
and make both these things work

736
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:13,526
together.

737
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:13,526
Yeah.

738
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,528
So we can talk more about that, but

739
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:15,528
yeah.

740
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:18,531
Brandy, may I maybe you have a response

741
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:18,531
to that, please?

742
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:30,543
Michael: Yeah, I was just going to throw

743
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:30,543
in something that we had grounded this in

744
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:30,543
before was the idea that we choose not to

745
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:30,543
act on the back of that.

746
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:30,543
Right.

747
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:33,546
So there's that balance of you know what

748
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:33,546
I'm talking about, right?

749
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:34,547
Bobby: Yeah.

750
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:38,551
If you believe that it's going to affect

751
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:38,551
your behavior, too.

752
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:46,559
And what I'm going to argue is that you

753
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:46,559
won't exercise your agency as much as you

754
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:46,559
would if you don't believe it.

755
00:28:47,560 --> 00:29:07,574
Adam: Along those lines, part of what

756
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:07,574
really concerns me about the anti free

757
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:07,574
will rhetoric is because an agency active

758
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:07,574
inference that Carl sometimes say there's

759
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:07,574
certain optimism that's required, that's

760
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:07,574
just built into it for the way you pursue

761
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:07,574
goals by predicting them into being.

762
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:17,584
And so if you stop believing in yourself

763
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:17,584
as a cause, being able to predict certain

764
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:17,584
goals, that actually could be a real

765
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:17,584
problem.

766
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:29,596
Bobby: I believe it is a real problem and

767
00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:29,596
that actually these people living this

768
00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:29,596
are already not behaving optimally, not

769
00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:29,596
making decisions optimally.

770
00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:30,597
Here's the thing, though.

771
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:32,599
You may say Sam Harris is a really

772
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:32,599
successful guy.

773
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:33,600
How do you explain that?

774
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,602
It's because he's living, too.

775
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:38,605
He has a split personality.

776
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:49,616
The part of him that pumped about doing

777
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:49,616
all this stuff, it's disconnected from

778
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:49,616
the part of him that really believes that

779
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:49,616
he has no agency.

780
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:58,625
And you've seen that in those studies

781
00:29:58,625 --> 00:29:58,625
where you see people lose that belief and

782
00:29:58,625 --> 00:29:58,625
it changes their behavior.

783
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:03,624
So my point is, if that's the way reality

784
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:03,624
is, then we have to tell the truth.

785
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:04,625
And that's what Sam Harris says.

786
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:20,641
I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you,

787
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:20,641
but what I'm saying is that idea is built

788
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:20,641
on a mountain of language ambiguities

789
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:20,641
that are creating this problem and just a

790
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:20,641
misunderstanding of causation.

791
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:27,648
Because if you think all causation is

792
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
bottom up, which means that the system is

793
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:27,648
not, there's no higher level control.

794
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:37,658
And this is kind of getting into details

795
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:37,658
that I need to give some more background

796
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:37,658
for, but if it's all bottom up causation,

797
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:37,658
then there is no room for agency.

798
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:59,680
But if you have top down causation and

799
00:30:59,680 --> 00:30:59,680
the whole system is this control center,

800
00:30:59,680 --> 00:30:59,680
it's a cybernetic control system that's

801
00:30:59,680 --> 00:30:59,680
basically we can explain this later, but

802
00:30:59,680 --> 00:30:59,680
what I will argue is that the

803
00:30:59,680 --> 00:30:59,680
evolutionary process accumulates

804
00:30:59,680 --> 00:30:59,680
knowledge.

805
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:25,700
So adaptive information in biological

806
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:25,700
systems, so predictive information about

807
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:25,700
the environment, the knowledge, the

808
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:25,700
adaptations that are being acquired

809
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:25,700
through evolution correspond to genes and

810
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:25,700
neural connections that basically encode

811
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:25,700
information about the external world.

812
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,704
And that's what starts to give a system

813
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:29,704
agency.

814
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:34,709
And that's why living systems behave

815
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:34,709
differently than inanimate systems.

816
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:41,716
And that is because the system has gained

817
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:41,716
causal power.

818
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:52,727
So the system as a coherent unit is

819
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:52,727
starting to control the components that

820
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:52,727
it's made of and the trajectory that the

821
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:52,727
system follows.

822
00:31:53,728 --> 00:32:00,729
And so for example, Philip Ball is a

823
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:00,729
journalist who's been writing about this

824
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:00,729
a lot like one of the most respected

825
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:00,729
science journalists.

826
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:13,742
But if you drop a pigeon and a rock off a

827
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:13,742
tower, the rock you can predict with

828
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:13,742
Newtonian mechanics, with classical

829
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:13,742
physics equations, you can predict the

830
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:13,742
trajectory of the rock, you can't predict

831
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:13,742
the trajectory of the bird.

832
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:17,746
So there's something fundamentally

833
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:17,746
different about those two things.

834
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:21,750
And I'm saying that behavioral

835
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:21,750
distinction is what we have to call

836
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:21,750
agency.

837
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:30,759
Now, that doesn't get us to free will,

838
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:30,759
but it shows us that there's some sort of

839
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:30,759
causal difference between biological

840
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:30,759
systems and inanimate systems.

841
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,762
And this used to be attributed to

842
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:33,762
vitalism.

843
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:39,768
What I'm saying is that vitalism wasn't

844
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:39,768
necessarily wrong, we just didn't know

845
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:39,768
what that vital force was.

846
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:42,771
And now we have a name for it and we call

847
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:42,771
it information.

848
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:54,782
So I kind of veered from the point maybe,

849
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:54,782
but yeah, I can't remember what I was

850
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:54,782
answering with that.

851
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:56,785
Brendan, do you have anything else to

852
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
say?

853
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:57,786
Michael: Sorry, go ahead.

854
00:32:57,786 --> 00:33:03,786
Bobby: Yeah, so maybe we should finish up

855
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:03,786
the Nietzsche thing and then I should get

856
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:03,786
into some slides and then we should come

857
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:03,786
back to this.

858
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:08,791
Brendan: Yeah, I was just going to say

859
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:08,791
real quick again, I think bobby, I think

860
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:08,791
what you're articulating, I.

861
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:14,797
Mean, having read your book and talked

862
00:33:14,797 --> 00:33:14,797
with you a lot about your work, I think

863
00:33:14,797 --> 00:33:14,797
we're very much on the same page.

864
00:33:14,797 --> 00:33:28,811
I was very much also at the same time

865
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:28,811
doing a devil's advocate thing, though,

866
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:28,811
for a couple of reasons, and it would

867
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:28,811
derail us too much from the present

868
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:28,811
topic, which is more important than

869
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:28,811
trying to make a devil's advocate case

870
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:28,811
for living with determinism.

871
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:33,816
Bobby: Yeah, well, I told Daniel that I'm

872
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:33,816
a recovering determinist.

873
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:41,824
That's kind of what I want to do here,

874
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:41,824
because I said if we don't hear the

875
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:41,824
criticism, then the people who don't

876
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:41,824
agree with this, I'm not going to

877
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:41,824
answer.

878
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:46,829
So I'm glad you said that, but I would

879
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:46,829
just like to push you a little bit more

880
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:46,829
to explain.

881
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:53,836
If it's purely deterministic, where's the

882
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:53,836
responsibility that Nietzsche is talking

883
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:53,836
about?

884
00:33:53,836 --> 00:34:00,837
Brendan: Yeah, well, let me say maybe a

885
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:00,837
couple of things too that adds further

886
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:00,837
context here.

887
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:34,871
There's sort of a tradition of, let's say

888
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
using historical, philosophical or even

889
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
theological categories and the kind of

890
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
frameworks that those used to provide for

891
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
making sense of really important concepts

892
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
and ways of being in the world and then

893
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
presuming that if someone deviated from

894
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
those that there would be these natural,

895
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
necessary sort of implications that would

896
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
flow from thinking differently about

897
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
something.

898
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:41,878
The classic case in my experience has

899
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:41,878
been, oh, we need morality and moral

900
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:41,878
facts to make us good people.

901
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:46,883
As soon as you don't believe in moral

902
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:46,883
facts, you'll become a terrible human

903
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:46,883
being.

904
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:48,884
And that's not true.

905
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:55,892
People who don't believe in moral facts

906
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:55,892
in the kind of traditional way can find

907
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:55,892
all sorts of groundings for their.

908
00:34:56,892 --> 00:35:03,894
Bobby: Moral yeah, sorry to interrupt,

909
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:03,894
but I can see these language things going

910
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:03,894
on everywhere in these discussions.

911
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:16,907
So, for example yeah, so you're saying

912
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:16,907
that people don't need morality and that

913
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:16,907
these people but then you said

914
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:16,907
traditional morality.

915
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:27,918
So that was the point I was going to

916
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:27,918
make, is that the people who let's say

917
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:27,918
you don't believe that there's any

918
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:27,918
purposefulness in nature, there's no

919
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:27,918
teleology, everything's random and

920
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:27,918
accidental.

921
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:29,920
Then they go, well, you know what?

922
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,922
That doesn't make me depressed.

923
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:37,928
This is the only time, this is all we've

924
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:37,928
got, so I better make it count.

925
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:38,929
There's no afterlife.

926
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:51,942
So what I'm saying is they're still

927
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:51,942
deriving morals from this paradigm and

928
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:51,942
they're actually deriving meaning and

929
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:51,942
purposeful principles out of this.

930
00:35:51,942 --> 00:36:06,951
So they're really, in a way, they're

931
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:06,951
still finding what they need to find to

932
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:06,951
behave in an optimal way.

933
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:15,960
But what I'm saying is that that's kind

934
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:15,960
of a teleological view and they're not

935
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:15,960
fully sticking to their paradigm with no

936
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:15,960
assumptions.

937
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,962
They're building on lots of assumptions.

938
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:26,971
And you get this morality that ends up

939
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:26,971
looking exactly like religion once you

940
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:26,971
map it out and you go, oh yeah, like the

941
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:26,971
Golden Rule, for example.

942
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:27,972
The golden rule.

943
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:29,974
You don't need a religion or the Golden

944
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:29,974
Rule.

945
00:36:30,974 --> 00:36:37,981
You just need to know that you're an

946
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:37,981
agent there are other agents like you,

947
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:37,981
they're like you, they also experience

948
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:37,981
happiness and suffering.

949
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:40,985
Therefore I'm going to treat them like I

950
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:40,985
would want to be treated.

951
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:47,992
And also there's an incentive to do that

952
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:47,992
because then they can treat me that way,

953
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:47,992
then they'll treat me as I've treated

954
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:47,992
them.

955
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:55,000
But the golden rule could be a basis for

956
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,000
a religion and a moral postulate.

957
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:10,009
So are they really morally free of moral

958
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:10,009
facts or are they creating a set of

959
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:10,009
morals from a paradigm that's supposed to

960
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:10,009
be completely moral free?

961
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:19,018
Maybe it's not because what I'm saying

962
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:19,018
basically is they're kind of converging

963
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:19,018
on this kind of purposeful narrative

964
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:19,018
without even realizing it.

965
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:21,020
Brendan: Well yeah, there's a lot there.

966
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:31,030
I mean I would say what you're getting

967
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,030
at, which is important, which is there is

968
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,030
often a performative contradiction that

969
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,030
we're engaged in, we're asserting

970
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,030
something logically and then our actions

971
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,030
are sort of suggesting otherwise.

972
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:39,038
I mean if I'm a solipsist and I say I

973
00:37:39,038 --> 00:37:39,038
believe in solipsism and I think this is

974
00:37:39,038 --> 00:37:39,038
sort of like well wait, why are you

975
00:37:39,038 --> 00:37:39,038
telling me that?

976
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:42,041
So there's that element to it.

977
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:58,057
There are actually though some rather

978
00:37:58,057 --> 00:37:58,057
detailed arguments you could make that

979
00:37:58,057 --> 00:37:58,057
get into things like well yes, I'm a

980
00:37:58,057 --> 00:37:58,057
solipsist but I'm talking to you about it

981
00:37:58,057 --> 00:37:58,057
because you're a projection of me and

982
00:37:58,057 --> 00:37:58,057
it's still worthwhile for me to have

983
00:37:58,057 --> 00:37:58,057
projections with conversational,

984
00:37:58,057 --> 00:37:58,057
projections with myself, et cetera.

985
00:37:58,057 --> 00:38:01,054
And there are versions of that for the

986
00:38:01,054 --> 00:38:01,054
free will sort of a thing.

987
00:38:03,056 --> 00:38:05,058
Bobby: But I think there's fallacies with

988
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:05,058
all of that.

989
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:27,080
So for example, let's say there's old

990
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,080
joke about the teacher gives a lecture on

991
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,080
solipsism and why solipsism can't be

992
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,080
refuted and the student comes up to him

993
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,080
after the lecture and says oh you're a

994
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,080
solipsist too, like he's happy to meet

995
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,080
another solipsist but the whole point is

996
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,080
that the other person doesn't exist.

997
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,081
So you're happy to meet yourself.

998
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:32,085
What I would say is let's follow that

999
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:32,085
anytime.

1000
00:38:33,085 --> 00:38:36,089
Okay, so then we would do a little game

1001
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:36,089
where we break that down.

1002
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:40,093
And what I'm saying when you start to

1003
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:40,093
break all those things down they lead you

1004
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:40,093
back to the same road.

1005
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:44,097
So let's say you're not real Brendan,

1006
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:44,097
you're a projection of my mind.

1007
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:46,099
But what does that mean?

1008
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:55,107
Brendan is a projection of my mind but

1009
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:55,107
you're an agent and you have different

1010
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:55,107
beliefs than me as I know myself here.

1011
00:38:55,108 --> 00:39:08,115
And you're going to do things, you're

1012
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:08,115
going to behave in ways that are

1013
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:08,115
different than I would behave because you

1014
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:08,115
have a different set of beliefs

1015
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:08,115
ultimately compared to actually the me I

1016
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:08,115
know, even if you're really me.

1017
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:12,119
What I'm saying is that really me doesn't

1018
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:12,119
really have any meaning.

1019
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:28,135
Because when you start to define you as

1020
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:28,135
this agent, even if you make this

1021
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:28,135
metaphysical claim that you're a

1022
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:28,135
projection of me, for all practical

1023
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:28,135
purposes, you are an agent within this

1024
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:28,135
system that has a different set of

1025
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:28,135
beliefs than what I know that behaves

1026
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:28,135
differently.

1027
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:38,144
So what I'm saying is even the thought

1028
00:39:38,144 --> 00:39:38,144
experiment has this language fall because

1029
00:39:38,144 --> 00:39:38,144
you come back to the equivalence of it's

1030
00:39:38,144 --> 00:39:38,144
not really a meaningful statement to say

1031
00:39:38,144 --> 00:39:38,144
whether it's me or not.

1032
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:49,156
If it has all these properties, that

1033
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:49,156
counts as an individual agent in the

1034
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:49,156
reality that we can be aware of, if that

1035
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:49,156
makes sense.

1036
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:51,158
Brendan: Yeah, and I agree.

1037
00:39:51,158 --> 00:40:05,166
If we really followed this through, I

1038
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:05,166
think we would converge to the same

1039
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:05,166
point, which for me tends to be well,

1040
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:05,166
I'll frame this a little bit by saying

1041
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:05,166
something like, hume, you're just

1042
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:05,166
mentioning earlier about how Sam Harris

1043
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:05,166
said, I wouldn't tell it to my daughter.

1044
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:08,169
Hume skeptic would question will the sun

1045
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:08,169
actually rise?

1046
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:09,170
Et cetera.

1047
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:17,178
But he made the point that basically once

1048
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:17,178
he puts his philosopher pen down and he

1049
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:17,178
goes and leaves his study, he's now

1050
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:17,178
living like a regular person now, you

1051
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:17,178
could say.

1052
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:26,187
So there's a potentially meaningful

1053
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:26,187
distinction between the pragmatism and

1054
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:26,187
the sort of intellectual logical

1055
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:26,187
coherence, let's say.

1056
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:44,205
But I do think that there's a meaningful

1057
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:44,205
way that we can actually collapse those

1058
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:44,205
in a way that should be collapsed because

1059
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:44,205
it would lead to something like what

1060
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:44,205
information about reality has causal

1061
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:44,205
power for sustaining my viability and

1062
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:44,205
flourishing in the face of entropy.

1063
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:44,205
Right.

1064
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:50,211
Kind of tie back in some of this free

1065
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:50,211
energy principle Bayesian updating sort

1066
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:50,211
of thing here.

1067
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:50,211
Right.

1068
00:40:52,213 --> 00:41:09,224
And this is the point that you introduced

1069
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:09,224
me about the work of, like, Kolchinsky

1070
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:09,224
and Walpert, which I've made great use

1071
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:09,224
of, of thinking about meaningful

1072
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:09,224
information as being that meaning that a

1073
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:09,224
system produces by processing information

1074
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:09,224
about its environment that ultimately

1075
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:09,224
AIDS its viability.

1076
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:10,225
Right.

1077
00:41:10,225 --> 00:41:21,236
Now, if what we're talking about in a

1078
00:41:21,236 --> 00:41:21,236
pragmatic sense has a deleterious effect

1079
00:41:21,236 --> 00:41:21,236
on our viability because of our concepts,

1080
00:41:21,236 --> 00:41:21,236
then we might say that that actually is

1081
00:41:21,236 --> 00:41:21,236
decreasing our viability.

1082
00:41:21,236 --> 00:41:38,253
And therefore, we might be inclined to

1083
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:38,253
say if that's our sort of criterion for

1084
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:38,253
asserting information as being an

1085
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:38,253
accurate model of reality, which I'm not

1086
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:38,253
sure of a better one, then we could say

1087
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:38,253
that things like skepticism and solipsism

1088
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:38,253
are untrue on that ground.

1089
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:41,256
If that line makes any sense, you could

1090
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:41,256
really start to unpack that.

1091
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:44,259
But I think that that might be where we'd

1092
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:44,259
ultimately converge.

1093
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:45,260
In agreement on some of these points?

1094
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,262
On some of these points.

1095
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:48,263
Bobby: Yeah.

1096
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:53,268
Adam: I'm going to have to run in 5

1097
00:41:53,268 --> 00:41:53,268
minutes, unfortunately.

1098
00:41:53,268 --> 00:41:56,271
So I'll just throw in a couple of quick

1099
00:41:56,271 --> 00:41:56,271
thoughts.

1100
00:41:56,271 --> 00:42:00,269
Bobby: Oh, let me just say one sentence

1101
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
before I forget.

1102
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,271
Maybe I already forgot.

1103
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:04,273
Let's see.

1104
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:05,274
Okay.

1105
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:05,274
Go ahead, Adam.

1106
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:06,275
I'll try to remember it.

1107
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:07,276
Adam: Sorry.

1108
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:08,277
Bobby: That's okay.

1109
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:11,280
Sorry.

1110
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,280
Yeah.

1111
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:19,288
When you were talking about viability,

1112
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:19,288
like all these explanations, like, oh,

1113
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:19,288
well, maybe I don't have free will, but

1114
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:19,288
being optimistic has some positive

1115
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:19,288
effect.

1116
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:27,296
What I'm trying to say is if the micro

1117
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:27,296
scale determinism is true and we're going

1118
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:27,296
to break that's one point I want to make

1119
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:27,296
determinism.

1120
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:31,299
When people are saying that word, it's

1121
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:31,299
conflating two different things.

1122
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:41,310
There's physical determinism that I'm

1123
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:41,310
talking about, like micro determinism,

1124
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:41,310
where everything is just this model, like

1125
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:41,310
where you have these atoms are basically

1126
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:41,310
pool balls and they're following these

1127
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:41,310
trajectories.

1128
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,312
I'll get to that in a slide.

1129
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:52,321
But that's a different kind of

1130
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:52,321
determinism than saying that your genes

1131
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:52,321
and experiences give rise to what you

1132
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:52,321
do.

1133
00:42:54,323 --> 00:43:03,326
My point is, if you're saying all these

1134
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:03,326
if the microscale determinism is true,

1135
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:03,326
there's no need to even talk about, oh,

1136
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:03,326
optimism helps me.

1137
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:05,328
There's no like, oh, even being

1138
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:05,328
optimistic.

1139
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:10,333
All of that biological level talk is

1140
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:10,333
causally redundant.

1141
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:17,340
So basically, if there's microscale

1142
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,340
determinism, genes even aren't

1143
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,340
determining anything that's causal over

1144
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:17,340
determinism.

1145
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,344
You're saying, okay, the genes cause my

1146
00:43:21,344 --> 00:43:21,344
behavior, but then you said the atoms

1147
00:43:21,344 --> 00:43:21,344
cause my behavior.

1148
00:43:21,344 --> 00:43:27,350
So my point is, if microscale determinism

1149
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:27,350
is true, you don't even have genes

1150
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:27,350
determining your behavior.

1151
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:28,351
It's an incoherent argument.

1152
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:33,356
And Sam Harris is conflating these two

1153
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:33,356
types of determinism and flipping back

1154
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:33,356
and forth.

1155
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:35,358
So what I'm saying is we got to break

1156
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:35,358
this down.

1157
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:45,368
And what agency, what top down causation

1158
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:45,368
does is it overcomes this physical

1159
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:45,368
determinism and then there's biological

1160
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:45,368
determinism that determines what agents

1161
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:45,368
will do.

1162
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:52,375
And I'm saying that consciousness and

1163
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:52,375
self awareness, reflective thought is

1164
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:52,375
what overrides biological determinism.

1165
00:43:52,375 --> 00:44:07,384
And that's when basically your higher

1166
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:07,384
mind, like this monitoring kind of

1167
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:07,384
prefrontal cortex executive control, like

1168
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:07,384
the mind that's responsible for that,

1169
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:07,384
there's access consciousness versus

1170
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:07,384
phenomenal consciousness distinction.

1171
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:11,388
So that mind can override your biological

1172
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:11,388
programming, your impulsive actions.

1173
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:23,400
So when we have this hierarchical model,

1174
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,400
we see that there's two types of

1175
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,400
determinism at least, and then there's

1176
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,400
multiple types of top down causation

1177
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,400
which overcome those things.

1178
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,405
So not to say that that argument doesn't

1179
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:28,405
hold up.

1180
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:33,410
Like we have to talk about determinism as

1181
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:33,410
far as genes determining your behavior.

1182
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:45,422
But my point is, if someone believes in

1183
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:45,422
microscale determinism, then these higher

1184
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:45,422
level things, when people say, oh, your

1185
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:45,422
genes are deciding what you're doing,

1186
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:45,422
those things would also be

1187
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:45,422
epiphenomenal.

1188
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:53,430
Those would be shorthands because you

1189
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:53,430
could actually look at the genes and you

1190
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:53,430
could see a bunch of particles and then

1191
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:53,430
you could use Newtonian trajectories just

1192
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:53,430
applied to the particles.

1193
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:54,431
The genes are epiphenomenal.

1194
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:57,434
Now the neurons are epiphenomenal.

1195
00:44:57,434 --> 00:45:01,432
So it's a level of new I don't know,

1196
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:01,432
adam, have you thought about that at

1197
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:01,432
all?

1198
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:02,433
Adam: Yeah.

1199
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:08,439
And that's kind of part of my agnosticism

1200
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:08,439
is like, is there such a thing as a true

1201
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:08,439
atomism?

1202
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:14,445
Does causation even make sense if it's

1203
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:14,445
just like an undifferentiated quantum

1204
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:14,445
field?

1205
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:24,455
For instance, as soon as we're talking

1206
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:24,455
about particles or kinds of anything we

1207
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:24,455
can even name or pick out, are we

1208
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:24,455
basically core screening?

1209
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:33,464
And are we in kind of like when we say

1210
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:33,464
micro, why don't we just keep going?

1211
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:36,467
Isn't it already somewhat like an

1212
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:36,467
instrumental for a given purpose?

1213
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:45,476
But in terms of and I've kind of kept

1214
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:45,476
these separate, like these issues of the

1215
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:45,476
philosophy of causation, like the

1216
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:45,476
handlings of free will.

1217
00:45:45,476 --> 00:46:02,487
So I've tended to focus on functional

1218
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
cybernetic free will, basically the

1219
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
planning and the architecture of choice

1220
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
and being able to suss out different

1221
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
options and evaluate counterfactuals that

1222
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
you then have different control energy

1223
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:02,487
for the system.

1224
00:46:02,487 --> 00:46:13,498
But I think there could be really

1225
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:13,498
interesting connections between how we

1226
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:13,498
handle causation, though, and where

1227
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:13,498
within the control hierarchy and the way

1228
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:13,498
you're describing of what's responsible

1229
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:13,498
for what.

1230
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:17,502
So, like ways in which system two can

1231
00:46:17,502 --> 00:46:17,502
override system one or like that's.

1232
00:46:17,502 --> 00:46:34,519
Bobby: Absolutely what I want to develop

1233
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:34,519
here because I think you can bridge this

1234
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:34,519
low level Causation discussion that I'm

1235
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:34,519
talking about, which, for example, Paul

1236
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:34,519
davies and sarah walker have written

1237
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:34,519
about informational control and that's

1238
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:34,519
with the origin of life, there's this

1239
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:34,519
change in the causal structure of the

1240
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:34,519
system, and then it gains this agency.

1241
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,523
And that's what I focused on a lot in

1242
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:38,523
part one of the book.

1243
00:46:39,524 --> 00:46:57,541
And so what I'm saying is Adam's work

1244
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:57,541
focuses on basically this free will

1245
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:57,541
topic, where I'm saying that there's this

1246
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:57,541
even higher level system beyond just

1247
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:57,541
normal biological agents that comes with

1248
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:57,541
not just consciousness, but an ability to

1249
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:57,541
create counterfactuals and imagination.

1250
00:46:57,542 --> 00:47:00,539
So it's like prefrontal cortex sort of

1251
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:00,539
higher self.

1252
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,542
And a lot of people say the self

1253
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:03,542
solutionary.

1254
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:09,548
That's why I love to fall back on Adam's

1255
00:47:09,548 --> 00:47:09,548
work, because it really breaks down the

1256
00:47:09,548 --> 00:47:09,548
self from a mechanistic perspective.

1257
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:12,551
But that's exactly what we can do.

1258
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:14,553
We can look at the space of

1259
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:14,553
counterfactuals.

1260
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:21,560
And as we will see that, I think there is

1261
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:21,560
some indeterminism at the fundamental

1262
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:21,560
level of reality that propagates up.

1263
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:26,565
And that's what you see with chaos, even

1264
00:47:26,565 --> 00:47:26,565
though it's called deterministic chaos.

1265
00:47:26,565 --> 00:47:28,567
And that's a whole nother issue to get

1266
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:28,567
into.

1267
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:38,577
But basically I'm saying that there are

1268
00:47:38,577 --> 00:47:38,577
choices and that the world's trajectory

1269
00:47:38,577 --> 00:47:38,577
is not set in stone and there's some

1270
00:47:38,577 --> 00:47:38,577
variation.

1271
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:50,589
And when we as agents consider the space

1272
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:50,589
of counterfactuals and then choose

1273
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:50,589
something specifically, it may be

1274
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:50,589
something like we're going to make a

1275
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:50,589
choice.

1276
00:47:50,589 --> 00:48:01,594
And then our biases, like our impulsive

1277
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:01,594
decision, is to make a certain choice

1278
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:01,594
reflexively based on how we feel and our

1279
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:01,594
genetic programming and our experiences.

1280
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:06,599
But then we can have another process

1281
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:06,599
where we go, okay, is this decision

1282
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:06,599
optimal?

1283
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:09,602
Given my principles, I have this higher

1284
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:09,602
self now.

1285
00:48:09,602 --> 00:48:19,612
I think about what's good, what I want to

1286
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:19,612
do, what are my long term goals, and that

1287
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:19,612
is the mechanism that corresponds to what

1288
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:19,612
people mean when they talk about free

1289
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:19,612
will.

1290
00:48:20,613 --> 00:48:37,630
And so I'm excited about that in working

1291
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:37,630
with Adam to explain that to people who

1292
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:37,630
just think that there's no way free will

1293
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:37,630
can work, because he's talked about these

1294
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:37,630
mechanisms from this cybernetic and

1295
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:37,630
computational neuroscience perspective

1296
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:37,630
and formalized them.

1297
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:44,637
People like Sabina Hawsenfelder, like

1298
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:44,637
physicists, are like saying there's no

1299
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:44,637
way free will can be compatible with a

1300
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:44,637
causal picture of the world.

1301
00:48:44,637 --> 00:48:50,643
I don't think that's true, but what I

1302
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:50,643
wanted and Adam's going to leave, so he's

1303
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:50,643
unfortunately not going to be part of

1304
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:50,643
this, but he'll see it later.

1305
00:48:50,643 --> 00:49:09,656
I think we can bridge Adam's work at this

1306
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:09,656
higher level to this low level causation

1307
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:09,656
stuff to actually have a causal story

1308
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:09,656
where there's actually still cause and

1309
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:09,656
effect, but there's higher level

1310
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:09,656
causation that can basically override the

1311
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:09,656
sort of the lower level bottom up

1312
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:09,656
causation.

1313
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:19,666
And then you even get these higher levels

1314
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:19,666
where you can have that sort of causation

1315
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:19,666
being overridden by conscious, like

1316
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:19,666
mental causation.

1317
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:25,672
So you would have bottom up causation and

1318
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
then top down causation and then mental

1319
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
causation and top down and mental

1320
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:25,672
causation.

1321
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:29,676
They would all be looped under,

1322
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:29,676
categorized under downward causation.

1323
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:31,678
Or you could call them all top down

1324
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:31,678
causation.

1325
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:38,685
But there are differences when

1326
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:38,685
consciousness emerges that allows for

1327
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:38,685
what could be called new causal power.

1328
00:49:38,685 --> 00:50:01,702
Things are working in a similar way, but

1329
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:01,702
you will see a behavioral change when you

1330
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:01,702
get consciousness that will allow for

1331
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:01,702
things like technology, things that

1332
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:01,702
require imagination, counterfactual

1333
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:01,702
generation, that can't be achieved with

1334
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:01,702
lower level intelligence, and that we can

1335
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:01,702
actually construct a causal picture that

1336
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:01,702
is perfectly in line with everything we

1337
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:01,702
know about causality.

1338
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:07,708
But when you do this, you realize that

1339
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:07,708
the bottom up story and I haven't really

1340
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:07,708
defined that.

1341
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:10,711
You guys know what I'm talking about, but

1342
00:50:10,711 --> 00:50:10,711
I haven't defined it for the listeners.

1343
00:50:10,711 --> 00:50:19,720
But that when you have this story of

1344
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:19,720
causation, you have agents emerge and

1345
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:19,720
they're actually control centers that can

1346
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:19,720
initiate causal chains.

1347
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,721
And they do it for reasons.

1348
00:50:20,721 --> 00:50:24,725
There's always reasons that you want to

1349
00:50:24,725 --> 00:50:24,725
make a certain decision over another.

1350
00:50:25,726 --> 00:50:29,730
So some people think because you have a

1351
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:29,730
reason, that's a cause, that somehow

1352
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:29,730
that's not free will.

1353
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:33,734
But if you didn't have a reason for it,

1354
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:33,734
you would be doing it randomly and that

1355
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:33,734
wouldn't be free will either.

1356
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:39,740
So free will just has to be

1357
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:39,740
reconceptualized within this framework.

1358
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:49,750
And it's not full free will, but full

1359
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:49,750
free will wouldn't be free will in the

1360
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:49,750
first place because again, it would be

1361
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:49,750
random if it was not based on a reason.

1362
00:50:49,750 --> 00:51:06,761
But what I'm saying is that your reason,

1363
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:06,761
even though it's a cause, the reasons,

1364
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:06,761
it's not determined, because basically

1365
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:06,761
it's not determined in the same sense

1366
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:06,761
that people are talking about with

1367
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:06,761
physical determinism.

1368
00:51:07,762 --> 00:51:07,762
We'll get to this.

1369
00:51:07,762 --> 00:51:10,765
There's no way I can do it without

1370
00:51:10,765 --> 00:51:10,765
looking at the slides.

1371
00:51:10,765 --> 00:51:16,771
But if anyone has any comments about what

1372
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:16,771
I just said and Adam, I know you got to

1373
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:16,771
go.

1374
00:51:16,771 --> 00:51:19,774
So any final concluding thoughts?

1375
00:51:20,775 --> 00:51:26,781
Adam: I am furious that I have to go, but

1376
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:26,781
I'm looking forward to tuning in in a

1377
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:26,781
bit.

1378
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:28,783
So talk to you soon.

1379
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:29,784
Bobby: See adam, thanks for coming.

1380
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:34,789
Michael: May I interject for a second?

1381
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:34,789
Bobby: Yeah.

1382
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:51,806
If anybody wants to read Adam's papers on

1383
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:51,806
integrated world modeling theory and

1384
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:51,806
cybernetic free will, you can just Google

1385
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:51,806
his name in those terms, and you'll see

1386
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:51,806
some great papers and some really

1387
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:51,806
respected journals like Entropy, I think,

1388
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:51,806
is the integrated world modeling three

1389
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:51,806
one.

1390
00:51:51,806 --> 00:51:53,807
Yeah, Michael.

1391
00:51:53,808 --> 00:51:59,814
Michael: No, I'm just trying to, again,

1392
00:51:59,814 --> 00:51:59,814
do my job here or whatever.

1393
00:51:59,814 --> 00:52:08,817
But Daniel, I did want to ask your

1394
00:52:08,817 --> 00:52:08,817
thoughts about active inference at this

1395
00:52:08,817 --> 00:52:08,817
juncture.

1396
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:15,824
Bobby: Yeah, any thoughts about active

1397
00:52:15,824 --> 00:52:15,824
inference, how that applies to anything

1398
00:52:15,824 --> 00:52:15,824
we've said already.

1399
00:52:15,824 --> 00:52:21,830
And I will link it to that soon because I

1400
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:21,830
know a lot of listeners that's what

1401
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:21,830
they're interested in.

1402
00:52:22,831 --> 00:52:24,833
Daniel: I'll definitely look forward to

1403
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
how you link it.

1404
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:49,858
But although active inference is this

1405
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:49,858
incredible modern, composable framework

1406
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:49,858
for, on one hand, cognitive modeling and

1407
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:49,858
on the other hand, the actual embodied

1408
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:49,858
situational modeling, a lot of the reason

1409
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:49,858
why people get into it, get curious,

1410
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:49,858
start participating in the institute, is

1411
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:49,858
exactly the topic of self help and self

1412
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:49,858
improvement and personal decision making

1413
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:49,858
amidst multiscale uncertainty.

1414
00:52:50,859 --> 00:53:08,871
And so there's among the many gaps

1415
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:08,871
between theory and application or

1416
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:08,871
practice, one of them is utilizing these

1417
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:08,871
kinds of multiscale information geometry,

1418
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:08,871
decision making, moment of choice type

1419
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:08,871
frameworks for what for what we actually

1420
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:08,871
do.

1421
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:13,876
So this is something that really strikes

1422
00:53:13,876 --> 00:53:13,876
at the heart of what we do, as infra

1423
00:53:13,876 --> 00:53:13,876
ants.

1424
00:53:13,876 --> 00:53:19,882
And I'm just looking forward to how you

1425
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:19,882
frame it in this narrative and then we

1426
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:19,882
can come back to some more technical

1427
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:19,882
details, too.

1428
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:24,887
Bobby: Yeah, so we're going to cap it at

1429
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:24,887
eight, I guess, at 750.

1430
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:31,894
I don't know if you'll have many

1431
00:53:31,894 --> 00:53:31,894
questions in the chat, but I'm going to

1432
00:53:31,894 --> 00:53:31,894
try to give the presentation in the next

1433
00:53:31,894 --> 00:53:31,894
45 minutes.

1434
00:53:32,895 --> 00:53:36,899
But feel free to comment on stuff that

1435
00:53:36,899 --> 00:53:36,899
will still be helpful.

1436
00:53:36,899 --> 00:53:42,905
But I guess we shouldn't get too far

1437
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:42,905
into, like, make a comment so we can mark

1438
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:42,905
it.

1439
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:44,907
I might give a little answer and then

1440
00:53:44,907 --> 00:53:44,907
we'll come back to it.

1441
00:53:44,907 --> 00:53:48,911
But I prefer that you speak up because

1442
00:53:48,911 --> 00:53:48,911
then we'll know what to come back to.

1443
00:53:50,913 --> 00:54:05,922
So I'll say a few more things about

1444
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
causality because they're important, and

1445
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
then I'll get into kind of the bigger

1446
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
picture of the theory and then

1447
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
specifically the self help teleological

1448
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
stance, which is the free energy

1449
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:05,922
principle comes into play there.

1450
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:12,929
And yeah, then we can talk about

1451
00:54:12,929 --> 00:54:12,929
practical applications for the individual

1452
00:54:12,929 --> 00:54:12,929
and first society.

1453
00:54:12,929 --> 00:54:17,934
Because the goal is that this system can

1454
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:17,934
be used it's kind of like a theory of

1455
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:17,934
everything.

1456
00:54:17,934 --> 00:54:29,946
So it explains reality, but that it can

1457
00:54:29,946 --> 00:54:29,946
be used to improve your life as an

1458
00:54:29,946 --> 00:54:29,946
individual, but also be used to figure

1459
00:54:29,946 --> 00:54:29,946
out how to sort of optimize our social

1460
00:54:29,946 --> 00:54:29,946
systems, political systems.

1461
00:54:29,946 --> 00:54:40,957
So it kind of creates a logic that could

1462
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:40,957
be used to base a new political party on,

1463
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:40,957
like, a third party or something, which

1464
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:40,957
would be great if we had a party kind of

1465
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:40,957
based on systems thinking.

1466
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:56,973
We kind of need a bipartisan ideology

1467
00:54:56,973 --> 00:54:56,973
right now that's not based on anything

1468
00:54:56,973 --> 00:54:56,973
other than evidence based things that we

1469
00:54:56,973 --> 00:54:56,973
know can be used to optimize systems, not

1470
00:54:56,973 --> 00:54:56,973
that that's everything.

1471
00:54:56,973 --> 00:55:06,977
But what I'm saying is it provides a

1472
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:06,977
foundation that then the ethical and kind

1473
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:06,977
of moral stances emerge from.

1474
00:55:06,977 --> 00:55:13,984
And if you don't see this basic cosmic

1475
00:55:13,984 --> 00:55:13,984
story, then you will be confused about

1476
00:55:13,984 --> 00:55:13,984
ethical issues.

1477
00:55:14,985 --> 00:55:35,006
And what I will argue is that folk

1478
00:55:35,006 --> 00:55:35,006
psychology, ethics, all of that stuff I

1479
00:55:35,006 --> 00:55:35,006
believe is consistent with this view

1480
00:55:35,006 --> 00:55:35,006
because it was kind of intuitive that

1481
00:55:35,006 --> 00:55:35,006
this is the story of nature and that it

1482
00:55:35,006 --> 00:55:35,006
will kind of ease that cognitive

1483
00:55:35,006 --> 00:55:35,006
dissonance for people who have accepted

1484
00:55:35,006 --> 00:55:35,006
the reductionist view.

1485
00:55:36,007 --> 00:55:46,017
I know a lot of people have accepted this

1486
00:55:46,017 --> 00:55:46,017
view that there's no agency, that there's

1487
00:55:46,017 --> 00:55:46,017
just the strict determinism, but then

1488
00:55:46,017 --> 00:55:46,017
they want to use this free energy

1489
00:55:46,017 --> 00:55:46,017
principle type things to improve their

1490
00:55:46,017 --> 00:55:46,017
life.

1491
00:55:46,017 --> 00:55:53,024
But that's kind of a contradiction

1492
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:53,024
because are they choosing to improve it

1493
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:53,024
or is there just one trajectory that's

1494
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:53,024
set in stone?

1495
00:55:55,025 --> 00:56:12,037
I think that getting this stuff straight

1496
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:12,037
will allow people to embrace stuff like

1497
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:12,037
the free energy principle and apply it to

1498
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:12,037
their lives because they go, okay, I can

1499
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:12,037
actually use this and I can do that, and

1500
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:12,037
I can create change in myself and in the

1501
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:12,037
society I'm a part of.

1502
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:17,042
But with this old model, there's no hope

1503
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:17,042
for change because there's only one

1504
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:17,042
trajectory.

1505
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:32,057
And so if Nietzsche really took that

1506
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:32,057
seriously, it would be no reason to

1507
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:32,057
really talk about responsibility because

1508
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:32,057
it's just purely a block time frozen

1509
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:32,057
thing where the future is already

1510
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:32,057
determined from the initial state.

1511
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:37,062
And the fact that it would repeat over

1512
00:56:37,062 --> 00:56:37,062
and over is just even more hell.

1513
00:56:37,062 --> 00:56:39,064
Determinism was bad enough.

1514
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:44,069
Now you have to experience not having an

1515
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,069
illusion forever.

1516
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:55,079
So what I want to offer is a different

1517
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:55,079
model that we can't fully get into but

1518
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:55,079
what I have called eternal recursive

1519
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:55,079
emergence.

1520
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,082
And so that it's not a cyclical process.

1521
00:56:57,082 --> 00:57:05,084
It's actually a process of the universe

1522
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:05,084
evolving and maybe giving rise to

1523
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:05,084
something new, potentially like a new

1524
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:05,084
universe.

1525
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:07,086
There's cosmological natural selection.

1526
00:57:07,086 --> 00:57:08,087
We don't have to go there.

1527
00:57:08,087 --> 00:57:13,092
We don't have to talk about anything

1528
00:57:13,092 --> 00:57:13,092
outside of this universe.

1529
00:57:13,092 --> 00:57:26,104
But my point is that yeah, so what I want

1530
00:57:26,104 --> 00:57:26,104
to show is that the universe is not an

1531
00:57:26,104 --> 00:57:26,104
arbitrary system.

1532
00:57:26,105 --> 00:57:26,105
It's not random.

1533
00:57:27,106 --> 00:57:28,107
It is a system that exhibits a design.

1534
00:57:28,107 --> 00:57:31,110
You can say it's the appearance of a

1535
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:31,110
design.

1536
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:35,114
Maybe it's not really design, but there's

1537
00:57:35,114 --> 00:57:35,114
qualities that can't be explained.

1538
00:57:36,115 --> 00:57:43,122
If the universe was the only universe in

1539
00:57:43,122 --> 00:57:43,122
all of reality, you couldn't have that

1540
00:57:43,122 --> 00:57:43,122
theory.

1541
00:57:43,122 --> 00:57:53,132
Either there's a designer that designed

1542
00:57:53,132 --> 00:57:53,132
it that way, or there's a larger reality

1543
00:57:53,132 --> 00:57:53,132
with a multiverse that would explain this

1544
00:57:53,132 --> 00:57:53,132
fine tuning.

1545
00:57:53,132 --> 00:57:55,134
And that's where basically science went.

1546
00:57:55,134 --> 00:58:00,133
They said, okay, it looks like there's a

1547
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:00,133
creator because of the fine tuning

1548
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:00,133
problem, but we can't accept that.

1549
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:03,136
So we have to consider this multiverse

1550
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:03,136
option.

1551
00:58:03,136 --> 00:58:06,139
But the multiverse option is just as

1552
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:06,139
weird as a creator.

1553
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:12,145
It leads to all kinds of crazy things

1554
00:58:12,145 --> 00:58:12,145
like other universes, where there's every

1555
00:58:12,145 --> 00:58:12,145
possible version of you.

1556
00:58:12,145 --> 00:58:16,149
So it probably has just as much baggage

1557
00:58:16,149 --> 00:58:16,149
as the creator thing.

1558
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:26,159
But then there's cosmological natural

1559
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:26,159
selection, which basically is an

1560
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:26,159
evolutionary explanation where basically

1561
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:26,159
universes give rise to other universes.

1562
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:37,170
And there's this Darwinian selection

1563
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:37,170
principle that would lead to a universe

1564
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:37,170
optimized for complexity, growth, and

1565
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:37,170
life essentially spreading continuously.

1566
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:40,173
So we don't really need to get in those

1567
00:58:40,173 --> 00:58:40,173
metaphysical topics.

1568
00:58:40,173 --> 00:58:49,182
But I just wanted to state up front that

1569
00:58:49,182 --> 00:58:49,182
the universe does have something that we

1570
00:58:49,182 --> 00:58:49,182
could call a design.

1571
00:58:49,182 --> 00:58:57,190
But when I say that, don't assume that I

1572
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:57,190
am talking about it being created by some

1573
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:57,190
sort of conscious intelligent agent.

1574
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:03,190
It could be this evolutionary process,

1575
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:03,190
but it's not random, it's not arbitrary.

1576
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:08,195
And that's the big mistake, is that we

1577
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:08,195
have models of a random system, like a

1578
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:08,195
gas.

1579
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:15,202
That's what Boltzman used to kind of try

1580
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:15,202
to have a statistical foundation of the

1581
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:15,202
second law of thermodynamics.

1582
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:18,205
And the problem is, we based the dynamics

1583
00:59:18,205 --> 00:59:18,205
of that inanimate system.

1584
00:59:19,206 --> 00:59:31,218
I mean, we understood the dynamics of

1585
00:59:31,218 --> 00:59:31,218
that inanimate system, and then we

1586
00:59:31,218 --> 00:59:31,218
assumed that the universe behaved the

1587
00:59:31,218 --> 00:59:31,218
same way, and that led to all of these

1588
00:59:31,218 --> 00:59:31,218
bad assumptions that created this

1589
00:59:31,218 --> 00:59:31,218
nihilistic worldview.

1590
00:59:31,218 --> 00:59:33,220
So let me talk about that first.

1591
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:43,230
If determinism is true, like if there

1592
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:43,230
were no indeterminism at the lowest

1593
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:43,230
level, for example, everything was just

1594
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:43,230
made of these atoms.

1595
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:49,236
And these atoms were like classical scale

1596
00:59:49,236 --> 00:59:49,236
objects, like pool balls on a pool

1597
00:59:49,236 --> 00:59:49,236
table.

1598
00:59:49,236 --> 00:59:51,238
And you have all these atoms.

1599
00:59:51,238 --> 01:00:03,475
And if those atoms follow classical

1600
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:03,475
trajectories and they're just like

1601
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:03,475
basically you can imagine the universe as

1602
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:03,475
a table of pool balls, then there's no

1603
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:03,475
room for anything.

1604
01:00:03,561 --> 01:00:07,759
There's one future trajectory, and it's

1605
01:00:07,759 --> 01:00:07,759
set in stone.

1606
01:00:07,951 --> 01:00:15,641
So if you believe that, if you accept

1607
01:00:15,641 --> 01:00:15,641
that worldview, there is no other future,

1608
01:00:15,641 --> 01:00:15,641
there's no changing it.

1609
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:26,762
And if you believe that and you want to

1610
01:00:26,762 --> 01:00:26,762
change your life and you're really taking

1611
01:00:26,762 --> 01:00:26,762
this seriously, you would have to ask

1612
01:00:26,762 --> 01:00:26,762
yourself, well, if I change my life, am I

1613
01:00:26,762 --> 01:00:26,762
really changing it?

1614
01:00:26,766 --> 01:00:28,962
Or was this the way it was always

1615
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:28,962
supposed to happen?

1616
01:00:28,966 --> 01:00:30,168
It was determined that I was going to

1617
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:30,168
change my life?

1618
01:00:30,177 --> 01:00:36,762
Or are you saying, like, it's determined

1619
01:00:36,762 --> 01:00:36,762
in a way where you can't change your

1620
01:00:36,762 --> 01:00:36,762
life, so you shouldn't even try?

1621
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:38,985
It leads to all these weird conclusions.

1622
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:41,276
But what I'm saying is that's not the way

1623
01:00:41,276 --> 01:00:41,276
reality is.

1624
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:45,674
And that leads to this worldview where

1625
01:00:45,674 --> 01:00:45,674
you have no agency.

1626
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:51,229
You can't get around it because if it's a

1627
01:00:51,229 --> 01:00:51,229
purely pool ball universe, then there's

1628
01:00:51,229 --> 01:00:51,229
no agency.

1629
01:00:52,383 --> 01:00:55,675
Not only that, so that's the first

1630
01:00:55,675 --> 01:00:55,675
thing.

1631
01:00:56,695 --> 01:01:00,537
If the world was Newtonian at the micro

1632
01:01:00,537 --> 01:01:00,537
level, there would be no agency.

1633
01:01:00,542 --> 01:01:04,929
There would be one trajectory, and there

1634
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:04,929
would be this block time thing.

1635
01:01:04,946 --> 01:01:14,941
Everything would follow from the initial

1636
01:01:14,941 --> 01:01:14,941
state in a way that was calculable from

1637
01:01:14,941 --> 01:01:14,941
just specifying the positions of every

1638
01:01:14,941 --> 01:01:14,941
particle and applying Newton's laws to

1639
01:01:14,941 --> 01:01:14,941
those.

1640
01:01:14,956 --> 01:01:19,429
And then we have some forces that

1641
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:19,429
interact, but it doesn't really change

1642
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:19,429
the picture.

1643
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:23,854
So there's just one continual

1644
01:01:23,854 --> 01:01:23,854
trajectory.

1645
01:01:23,865 --> 01:01:28,374
Then Boltzman found that an inanimate

1646
01:01:28,374 --> 01:01:28,374
system because all of in a gas, for

1647
01:01:28,374 --> 01:01:28,374
example.

1648
01:01:28,381 --> 01:01:36,175
So it's a specific type of system that

1649
01:01:36,175 --> 01:01:36,175
Boltzman was using to derive the second

1650
01:01:36,175 --> 01:01:36,175
law of thermodynamics on a statistical

1651
01:01:36,175 --> 01:01:36,175
foundation.

1652
01:01:37,241 --> 01:01:39,482
And it's not the way open systems work.

1653
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:50,059
So first of all, we should know that he

1654
01:01:50,059 --> 01:01:50,059
showed with statistical mechanics that if

1655
01:01:50,059 --> 01:01:50,059
you have a gas so in a gas, every

1656
01:01:50,059 --> 01:01:50,059
particle is uncorrelated, it's just

1657
01:01:50,059 --> 01:01:50,059
moving around freely.

1658
01:01:50,059 --> 01:01:55,105
And in his model also, people should know

1659
01:01:55,105 --> 01:01:55,105
that this is before we understood the

1660
01:01:55,105 --> 01:01:55,105
periodic table.

1661
01:01:55,106 --> 01:02:00,090
Periodic table didn't come till like

1662
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:00,090
decades after Boltzman did this work.

1663
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:02,118
So we didn't understand like chemical

1664
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:02,118
bonding, for example.

1665
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:04,134
We didn't understand a lot of things.

1666
01:02:04,134 --> 01:02:15,242
So in his model, as an idealization, used

1667
01:02:15,242 --> 01:02:15,242
spherical, like what would be marbles,

1668
01:02:15,242 --> 01:02:15,242
like spherical round things that bump off

1669
01:02:15,242 --> 01:02:15,242
each other elastically.

1670
01:02:15,242 --> 01:02:17,261
So they just bounce off each other.

1671
01:02:17,261 --> 01:02:19,285
They don't combine and interact with

1672
01:02:19,285 --> 01:02:19,285
forces.

1673
01:02:19,286 --> 01:02:45,542
And if you have this picture, if you have

1674
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:45,542
these things just bumping off of each

1675
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:45,542
other, interacting this way, moving

1676
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:45,542
around, following these classical

1677
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:45,542
trajectories, not bound in any way, you

1678
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:45,542
will get a transition from order to

1679
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:45,542
disorder if the system starts out in an

1680
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:45,542
ordered state, of course, because the

1681
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:45,542
disordered state, there's more possible

1682
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:45,542
ways to do that.

1683
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:59,680
So if everything's moving around

1684
01:02:59,680 --> 01:02:59,680
randomly, you see this trajectory here

1685
01:02:59,680 --> 01:02:59,680
that we see and then so the idea but

1686
01:02:59,680 --> 01:02:59,680
there were so many weird assumptions in

1687
01:02:59,680 --> 01:02:59,680
trying to apply this to our universe.

1688
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,648
Like when you start to break them down,

1689
01:03:01,648 --> 01:03:01,648
none of them really made sense.

1690
01:03:01,649 --> 01:03:04,672
So he was saying, okay, this is what has

1691
01:03:04,672 --> 01:03:04,672
to happen.

1692
01:03:04,672 --> 01:03:13,763
You go from order to disorder and this

1693
01:03:13,763 --> 01:03:13,763
must be the way the universe is, because

1694
01:03:13,763 --> 01:03:13,763
this is what has to happen by statistical

1695
01:03:13,763 --> 01:03:13,763
laws.

1696
01:03:13,763 --> 01:03:17,800
If everything's moving randomly, if

1697
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:17,800
there's no magical forces doing thing,

1698
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:17,800
this is what happens.

1699
01:03:18,814 --> 01:03:34,970
So the problem with that basically well,

1700
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:34,970
so one thing I should say is that's not

1701
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:34,970
even true.

1702
01:03:34,971 --> 01:03:51,141
If this was the way the world is, and

1703
01:03:51,141 --> 01:03:51,141
people pointed this out to Boltzman,

1704
01:03:51,141 --> 01:03:51,141
given enough time, if these are following

1705
01:03:51,141 --> 01:03:51,141
these mechanical trajectories, even the

1706
01:03:51,141 --> 01:03:51,141
disordered state will go back to the

1707
01:03:51,141 --> 01:03:51,141
ordered state given enough time.

1708
01:03:51,142 --> 01:04:00,170
This is Coincare's recurrence theorem,

1709
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:00,170
kind of similar to Nietzsche's eternal

1710
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:00,170
recurrence.

1711
01:04:00,172 --> 01:04:10,272
But so the idea is that if you have the

1712
01:04:10,272 --> 01:04:10,272
system behaving this way, basically all

1713
01:04:10,272 --> 01:04:10,272
trajectories are possible and given

1714
01:04:10,272 --> 01:04:10,272
enough time, it will go from disorder.

1715
01:04:10,272 --> 01:04:11,280
And then we'll revert.

1716
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,329
And people challenged Boltsman with this

1717
01:04:15,329 --> 01:04:15,329
and he couldn't get away from that

1718
01:04:15,329 --> 01:04:15,329
possibility.

1719
01:04:17,341 --> 01:04:19,362
I lost my train of thought earlier.

1720
01:04:19,367 --> 01:04:22,390
I didn't let you know, I just went on to

1721
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:22,390
the next thing.

1722
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:32,491
But what I forgot to say was that

1723
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:32,491
Boltzman was like faced with the problem

1724
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:32,491
of why is our universe look so complex if

1725
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:32,491
it goes from order to disorder?

1726
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:35,524
And then that's where so he had to say,

1727
01:04:35,524 --> 01:04:35,524
oh, well, it must have.

1728
01:04:35,524 --> 01:04:38,552
Started out really ordered because it

1729
01:04:38,552 --> 01:04:38,552
can't go from disorder to order.

1730
01:04:38,552 --> 01:04:41,588
So it must have been this highly ordered

1731
01:04:41,588 --> 01:04:41,588
state, which was the beginning of time.

1732
01:04:41,588 --> 01:04:44,612
It was this low, low entropy state.

1733
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:51,684
But now we know that after the Big Bang,

1734
01:04:51,684 --> 01:04:51,684
everything was homogeneous, and then

1735
01:04:51,684 --> 01:04:51,684
things started aggregating.

1736
01:04:51,684 --> 01:05:00,714
So it was literally an equilibrium state,

1737
01:05:00,714 --> 01:05:00,714
this fully mixed up high disorder state,

1738
01:05:00,714 --> 01:05:00,714
something closer to that before that.

1739
01:05:00,714 --> 01:05:03,743
And then things started plumping and you

1740
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:03,743
get more organization.

1741
01:05:03,747 --> 01:05:07,783
So the story is completely the opposite

1742
01:05:07,783 --> 01:05:07,783
of what we've been taught.

1743
01:05:07,784 --> 01:05:20,917
Julian Barber, in his new book, explains

1744
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:20,917
this, that the trajectory of the universe

1745
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:20,917
is towards higher complexity and order,

1746
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:20,917
and that we made a mistake by applying

1747
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:20,917
this model of an inanimate system to the

1748
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:20,917
universe in its entirety.

1749
01:05:20,919 --> 01:05:28,995
When the universe has all of these

1750
01:05:28,995 --> 01:05:28,995
batteries in the sky, we call stars, and

1751
01:05:28,995 --> 01:05:28,995
they're driving systems away from

1752
01:05:28,995 --> 01:05:28,995
equilibrium.

1753
01:05:28,996 --> 01:05:37,084
So then we had Elia Prigogene in 19 40,

1754
01:05:37,084 --> 01:05:37,084
19 50, 19 60, 19 70.

1755
01:05:37,085 --> 01:05:43,147
I would say fifty S and sixty S were

1756
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:43,147
probably when he was starting this work,

1757
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:43,147
and it was really gaining influence.

1758
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:58,296
But he basically showed that there's

1759
01:05:58,296 --> 01:05:58,296
another dynamic where if you have a

1760
01:05:58,296 --> 01:05:58,296
system of particles driven by a flow of

1761
01:05:58,296 --> 01:05:58,296
energy, it will start to naturally

1762
01:05:58,296 --> 01:05:58,296
organize that system, assuming that the

1763
01:05:58,296 --> 01:05:58,296
molecules combine to each other.

1764
01:05:58,296 --> 01:06:03,287
So you need to have the right sort of

1765
01:06:03,287 --> 01:06:03,287
molecular variety for this to happen.

1766
01:06:03,288 --> 01:06:08,333
But this model of boltzman's didn't take

1767
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:08,333
into account bonding.

1768
01:06:08,334 --> 01:06:13,384
It didn't take into account the force of

1769
01:06:13,384 --> 01:06:13,384
gravity, it didn't take account into

1770
01:06:13,384 --> 01:06:13,384
account open systems.

1771
01:06:13,385 --> 01:06:21,465
And what I'm arguing is ultimately that

1772
01:06:21,465 --> 01:06:21,465
the universe's dynamics are more like an

1773
01:06:21,465 --> 01:06:21,465
open system being pushed far from

1774
01:06:21,465 --> 01:06:21,465
equilibrium, where it's self organizing.

1775
01:06:21,465 --> 01:06:29,549
So in this model, the universe isn't

1776
01:06:29,549 --> 01:06:29,549
going towards disorder because it's not a

1777
01:06:29,549 --> 01:06:29,549
universe made of particles that stay

1778
01:06:29,549 --> 01:06:29,549
uncorrelated.

1779
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:37,626
So this Bolton's model was based on this

1780
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:37,626
H theorem, where everything stays

1781
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:37,626
uncorrelated, but when things interact,

1782
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:37,626
they become correlated.

1783
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:41,664
So this model works for gases and it

1784
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:41,664
doesn't work for open systems.

1785
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,686
And what I'm saying is, it doesn't work

1786
01:06:43,686 --> 01:06:43,686
for the universe.

1787
01:06:43,687 --> 01:06:45,702
We applied it to the universe.

1788
01:06:45,703 --> 01:06:49,746
And if this was true, there's only one

1789
01:06:49,746 --> 01:06:49,746
trajectory, which means there's no

1790
01:06:49,746 --> 01:06:49,746
changing the future.

1791
01:06:49,747 --> 01:06:51,762
What's going to happen is going to

1792
01:06:51,762 --> 01:06:51,762
happen.

1793
01:06:51,763 --> 01:06:57,827
And if that's the case, that's pretty

1794
01:06:57,827 --> 01:06:57,827
depressing because it kind of demotivates

1795
01:06:57,827 --> 01:06:57,827
us to go, oh, you know what?

1796
01:06:57,827 --> 01:06:58,837
I can change the world.

1797
01:06:58,837 --> 01:07:03,821
I can have this idea, and it can blow up

1798
01:07:03,821 --> 01:07:03,821
like Mark Zuckerberg, like creating

1799
01:07:03,821 --> 01:07:03,821
Facebook.

1800
01:07:03,822 --> 01:07:07,866
Like, you could create something like

1801
01:07:07,866 --> 01:07:07,866
Facebook, and you would have that and you

1802
01:07:07,866 --> 01:07:07,866
would change the world.

1803
01:07:07,867 --> 01:07:10,890
But if you believed in determinism, it

1804
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:10,890
would be kind of strange.

1805
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:12,918
You would be like, wait, but this is

1806
01:07:12,918 --> 01:07:12,918
already determined.

1807
01:07:12,919 --> 01:07:13,927
So I already did it.

1808
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:20,989
In a way, I'm already going to do it, and

1809
01:07:20,989 --> 01:07:20,989
there's only one trajectory, and then I

1810
01:07:20,989 --> 01:07:20,989
play that important role in history.

1811
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:21,003
No, that can't be true.

1812
01:07:21,004 --> 01:07:22,015
This is impossible.

1813
01:07:22,016 --> 01:07:24,036
I'm going to change the world and it was

1814
01:07:24,036 --> 01:07:24,036
determined.

1815
01:07:24,036 --> 01:07:43,219
So that philosophy leads to a lot of

1816
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:43,219
weirdness that I'm saying completely

1817
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:43,219
dissipates when we get the causal picture

1818
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:43,219
straight and we see that there's not this

1819
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:43,219
nihilistic one trajectory because of

1820
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:43,219
quantum indeterminism and that's not

1821
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:43,219
everything.

1822
01:07:43,220 --> 01:08:03,367
But what quantum indeterminism does is it

1823
01:08:03,367 --> 01:08:03,367
shows that when you shrink when you zoom

1824
01:08:03,367 --> 01:08:03,367
in and you get to a certain level that

1825
01:08:03,367 --> 01:08:03,367
Newton's laws of motion do not hold you

1826
01:08:03,367 --> 01:08:03,367
will see there will be no definite state

1827
01:08:03,367 --> 01:08:03,367
of an electron that you can predict given

1828
01:08:03,367 --> 01:08:03,367
its prior state.

1829
01:08:03,367 --> 01:08:11,444
There's only going to be a wave function

1830
01:08:11,444 --> 01:08:11,444
that gives a distribution of

1831
01:08:11,444 --> 01:08:11,444
probabilities where that can go and then

1832
01:08:11,444 --> 01:08:11,444
use the Born rule to find out where it's

1833
01:08:11,444 --> 01:08:11,444
likely to go.

1834
01:08:11,444 --> 01:08:16,495
And then if you repeat that study a bunch

1835
01:08:16,495 --> 01:08:16,495
of times you'll see these statistical

1836
01:08:16,495 --> 01:08:16,495
patterns.

1837
01:08:16,497 --> 01:08:27,609
So what I'm saying is quantum and

1838
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:27,609
determinism got rid of this picture of

1839
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:27,609
strict determinism at the micro level.

1840
01:08:28,611 --> 01:08:36,695
And if you did have that strict

1841
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:36,695
determinism at the micro level you would

1842
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:36,695
not have any agency or any there would be

1843
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:36,695
no real counterfactuals.

1844
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:42,758
They would be sort of due to our

1845
01:08:42,758 --> 01:08:42,758
epistemic limitations what we can know

1846
01:08:42,758 --> 01:08:42,758
about the world.

1847
01:08:42,758 --> 01:08:45,785
We think there are different

1848
01:08:45,785 --> 01:08:45,785
possibilities but there actually are

1849
01:08:45,785 --> 01:08:45,785
none.

1850
01:08:45,785 --> 01:08:46,797
The world can only go one way.

1851
01:08:46,797 --> 01:08:53,867
And what I'm saying is that there are

1852
01:08:53,867 --> 01:08:53,867
some different there's a possibility

1853
01:08:53,867 --> 01:08:53,867
space of things that can happen and that

1854
01:08:53,867 --> 01:08:53,867
when agents make decisions.

1855
01:08:53,868 --> 01:09:02,898
You're carving out a path that in some

1856
01:09:02,898 --> 01:09:02,898
ways it's not determined by the

1857
01:09:02,898 --> 01:09:02,898
microscale physics because of quantum

1858
01:09:02,898 --> 01:09:02,898
indeterminism.

1859
01:09:02,899 --> 01:09:08,952
And then we have chaos, too at the

1860
01:09:08,952 --> 01:09:08,952
classical scale where you can't predict

1861
01:09:08,952 --> 01:09:08,952
what a chaotic system is going to do.

1862
01:09:08,953 --> 01:09:09,967
People call it deterministic chaos.

1863
01:09:09,968 --> 01:09:16,034
I have issues with calling that

1864
01:09:16,034 --> 01:09:16,034
determinism because it's completely not

1865
01:09:16,034 --> 01:09:16,034
predictable and I don't even think

1866
01:09:16,034 --> 01:09:16,034
determinism is the right word.

1867
01:09:16,035 --> 01:09:18,059
People want to look up norton's dome.

1868
01:09:19,061 --> 01:09:24,118
If you have a ball posed at the top of

1869
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:24,118
the dome there's multiple Newton's

1870
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:24,118
equations that can satisfy where it's

1871
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:24,118
going to go next.

1872
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:28,150
There's actually even determinism is not

1873
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:28,150
fully deterministic.

1874
01:09:28,151 --> 01:09:30,176
But that's kind of beyond what we'll get

1875
01:09:30,176 --> 01:09:30,176
into.

1876
01:09:32,194 --> 01:09:35,227
Let me just try to go faster through the

1877
01:09:35,227 --> 01:09:35,227
slide since it's 720.

1878
01:09:35,228 --> 01:09:47,342
So I'm not going to talk about a lot of

1879
01:09:47,342 --> 01:09:47,342
the details that I planned but maybe our

1880
01:09:47,342 --> 01:09:47,342
earlier conversation provides context

1881
01:09:47,342 --> 01:09:47,342
that can clear all this stuff up.

1882
01:09:47,343 --> 01:09:50,371
So what I'm arguing is that the universe

1883
01:09:50,371 --> 01:09:50,371
is self organizing.

1884
01:09:50,372 --> 01:10:04,458
And so Lee Smollen, popular physicist

1885
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:04,458
says the possibility of conceiving the

1886
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:04,458
universe as a whole as a self organized

1887
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:04,458
system in which a variety of improbable

1888
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:04,458
structures exist permanently without the

1889
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:04,458
need of a pilot or other external agent I

1890
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:04,458
can't see that word.

1891
01:10:05,464 --> 01:10:09,501
So we have the possibility of

1892
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:09,501
constructing a new scientific cosmology.

1893
01:10:09,503 --> 01:10:22,639
It's clear that if the natural state of

1894
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:22,639
matter is chaos and external intelligence

1895
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:22,639
isn't needed to explain the order and

1896
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:22,639
beauty of the world so he's basically

1897
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:22,639
saying if we had this model of

1898
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:22,639
randomness, then it wouldn't make sense

1899
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:22,639
for us to see what we see.

1900
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:26,671
And we would need a creator would be a

1901
01:10:26,671 --> 01:10:26,671
better explanation.

1902
01:10:26,673 --> 01:10:36,776
But if life order and structure are the

1903
01:10:36,776 --> 01:10:36,776
natural state of the cosmos itself, then

1904
01:10:36,776 --> 01:10:36,776
our existence, indeed our spirit, might

1905
01:10:36,776 --> 01:10:36,776
finally be comprehended and as created

1906
01:10:36,776 --> 01:10:36,776
naturally by the world rather than

1907
01:10:36,776 --> 01:10:36,776
unnaturally and in opposition to it.

1908
01:10:36,777 --> 01:10:43,846
And you'll see up here that he says, a

1909
01:10:43,846 --> 01:10:43,846
variety of improbable structures that

1910
01:10:43,846 --> 01:10:43,846
exist permanently.

1911
01:10:43,847 --> 01:10:52,932
So what I'm saying is there's some

1912
01:10:52,932 --> 01:10:52,932
language issues here that we're seeing,

1913
01:10:52,932 --> 01:10:52,932
where we're saying, why do we see all

1914
01:10:52,932 --> 01:10:52,932
this improbable stuff if it's there?

1915
01:10:52,932 --> 01:10:53,941
It's not improbable.

1916
01:10:53,942 --> 01:11:05,005
So it's only improbable if we accept the

1917
01:11:05,005 --> 01:11:05,005
old model based on this simplified model

1918
01:11:05,005 --> 01:11:05,005
of causation that doesn't include top

1919
01:11:05,005 --> 01:11:05,005
down causation, which we'll explain.

1920
01:11:05,007 --> 01:11:23,186
And that actually complexity that you

1921
01:11:23,186 --> 01:11:23,186
would say that this is highly improbable,

1922
01:11:23,186 --> 01:11:23,186
that complexity just keeps growing and

1923
01:11:23,186 --> 01:11:23,186
growing and growing, because

1924
01:11:23,186 --> 01:11:23,186
statistically you would think that there

1925
01:11:23,186 --> 01:11:23,186
would be some transient complexity, and

1926
01:11:23,186 --> 01:11:23,186
then basically you would have this trend

1927
01:11:23,186 --> 01:11:23,186
towards entropy, that this complexity

1928
01:11:23,186 --> 01:11:23,186
would dissolve.

1929
01:11:23,187 --> 01:11:31,261
What I'm saying is when I'm saying that

1930
01:11:31,261 --> 01:11:31,261
the universe is becoming more and more

1931
01:11:31,261 --> 01:11:31,261
complex, it's not opposed to naturalism.

1932
01:11:31,263 --> 01:11:45,408
It's that our conception of naturalism is

1933
01:11:45,408 --> 01:11:45,408
based on an outdated paradigm that did

1934
01:11:45,408 --> 01:11:45,408
not include dynamics that really exist,

1935
01:11:45,408 --> 01:11:45,408
that we're now just finding so that these

1936
01:11:45,408 --> 01:11:45,408
structures that are highly complex were

1937
01:11:45,408 --> 01:11:45,408
never improbable.

1938
01:11:45,409 --> 01:11:57,520
And I'm actually going to argue that

1939
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:57,520
they're statistically inevitable, that

1940
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:57,520
they arise in a way deterministically.

1941
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,491
And it might be kind of confusing that I

1942
01:12:00,491 --> 01:12:00,491
use that word.

1943
01:12:00,493 --> 01:12:08,573
But what I'm going to try to argue is

1944
01:12:08,573 --> 01:12:08,573
that when we talk about determinism, we

1945
01:12:08,573 --> 01:12:08,573
need to make distinctions between that as

1946
01:12:08,573 --> 01:12:08,573
well.

1947
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:11,608
So what I'm saying is that there's strict

1948
01:12:11,608 --> 01:12:11,608
determinism is not true.

1949
01:12:11,609 --> 01:12:32,810
But I'm now going to argue that something

1950
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:32,810
like global determinism is true, which is

1951
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:32,810
a name that's been used by philosophers,

1952
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:32,810
that there are attractors that create

1953
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:32,810
these dynamics such that it is natural

1954
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:32,810
that the world goes towards increasing

1955
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:32,810
complexity and that if we see this

1956
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:32,810
trajectory that we're a part of, life is

1957
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:32,810
spreading.

1958
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:33,821
We're building technology.

1959
01:12:33,822 --> 01:12:36,853
The biosphere has created all this

1960
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:36,853
complexity on Earth.

1961
01:12:36,854 --> 01:12:42,913
If we spread we're spreading complexity

1962
01:12:42,913 --> 01:12:42,913
throughout the universe in the form of

1963
01:12:42,913 --> 01:12:42,913
computational structures.

1964
01:12:42,914 --> 01:12:43,929
Life is a computational structure.

1965
01:12:44,929 --> 01:12:47,967
This information processing network that

1966
01:12:47,967 --> 01:12:47,967
we call the biosphere is spreading.

1967
01:12:47,968 --> 01:12:51,000
If life spreads that that was never

1968
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,000
improbable.

1969
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,045
It was just improbable because it seemed

1970
01:12:55,045 --> 01:12:55,045
improbable, because we didn't have all of

1971
01:12:55,045 --> 01:12:55,045
the laws.

1972
01:12:55,046 --> 01:13:09,126
And that actually it's inevitable, but

1973
01:13:09,126 --> 01:13:09,126
that there is some freedom within that,

1974
01:13:09,126 --> 01:13:09,126
but there is an outline that's basically

1975
01:13:09,126 --> 01:13:09,126
deterministic at this larger scale.

1976
01:13:10,133 --> 01:13:13,163
And by that I mean things can go a

1977
01:13:13,163 --> 01:13:13,163
different way.

1978
01:13:13,164 --> 01:13:21,245
Like if you rewound the tape of time and

1979
01:13:21,245 --> 01:13:21,245
you played it again, that different

1980
01:13:21,245 --> 01:13:21,245
events, there would be a slightly

1981
01:13:21,245 --> 01:13:21,245
different chain of events that would

1982
01:13:21,245 --> 01:13:21,245
happen.

1983
01:13:21,246 --> 01:13:32,359
You would get different, for example,

1984
01:13:32,359 --> 01:13:32,359
genetic mutations, because genetic

1985
01:13:32,359 --> 01:13:32,359
mutation and Schrodinger was the first

1986
01:13:32,359 --> 01:13:32,359
person to speculate about this, but that

1987
01:13:32,359 --> 01:13:32,359
there's a quantum component.

1988
01:13:32,359 --> 01:13:36,397
So if you rewound the tape of time and

1989
01:13:36,397 --> 01:13:36,397
you played it again, you would get some

1990
01:13:36,397 --> 01:13:36,397
different genes.

1991
01:13:36,397 --> 01:13:54,576
But what I'm arguing is, because of these

1992
01:13:54,576 --> 01:13:54,576
emergent attractor dynamics that were

1993
01:13:54,576 --> 01:13:54,576
really explained by non equilibrium

1994
01:13:54,576 --> 01:13:54,576
physics and the work of Ilioprikajin,

1995
01:13:54,576 --> 01:13:54,576
then what you see is that you would get

1996
01:13:54,576 --> 01:13:54,576
the same trajectory towards higher and

1997
01:13:54,576 --> 01:13:54,576
higher complexity because there were

1998
01:13:54,576 --> 01:13:54,576
other laws that we weren't aware of.

1999
01:13:54,577 --> 01:14:03,604
And so in this model, there's going to be

2000
01:14:03,604 --> 01:14:03,604
a sort of cosmic destiny that is this

2001
01:14:03,604 --> 01:14:03,604
sort of form of global determinism.

2002
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:13,705
And then there's going to be free agency

2003
01:14:13,705 --> 01:14:13,705
that the agents can do things that's not

2004
01:14:13,705 --> 01:14:13,705
set in stone within that kind of global

2005
01:14:13,705 --> 01:14:13,705
deterministic picture.

2006
01:14:13,705 --> 01:14:15,722
So it's kind of new.

2007
01:14:15,723 --> 01:14:20,775
I'm saying that it's not binaries the

2008
01:14:20,775 --> 01:14:20,775
world deterministic or indeterministic.

2009
01:14:20,776 --> 01:14:26,838
There's indeterminism at the lowest

2010
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:26,838
level, which basically introduces slack

2011
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:26,838
into the causal chain.

2012
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:30,871
So not everything is fully determined in

2013
01:14:30,871 --> 01:14:30,871
the strict sense.

2014
01:14:30,873 --> 01:14:37,943
But because of these attractors, you get

2015
01:14:37,943 --> 01:14:37,943
these emergent dynamics where you're

2016
01:14:37,943 --> 01:14:37,943
going to see similar patterns, similar

2017
01:14:37,943 --> 01:14:37,943
regularities.

2018
01:14:40,974 --> 01:15:00,117
So Christoph Coke just a couple

2019
01:15:00,117 --> 01:15:00,117
scientists who well, yeah, I'll skip this

2020
01:15:00,117 --> 01:15:00,117
stuff, but so there are a lot of

2021
01:15:00,117 --> 01:15:00,117
scientists who a lot of philosophers who

2022
01:15:00,117 --> 01:15:00,117
have had this kind of teleological

2023
01:15:00,117 --> 01:15:00,117
narrative that the universe was moving

2024
01:15:00,117 --> 01:15:00,117
towards some sort of goal, that it seemed

2025
01:15:00,117 --> 01:15:00,117
to be like an organism that's developing

2026
01:15:00,117 --> 01:15:00,117
and that seemed like an idea opposed to

2027
01:15:00,117 --> 01:15:00,117
naturalism.

2028
01:15:00,117 --> 01:15:11,222
People like Tilharde, Chardin and Bergson

2029
01:15:11,222 --> 01:15:11,222
were Chardin was religious, but Bergson

2030
01:15:11,222 --> 01:15:11,222
was a philosopher.

2031
01:15:11,223 --> 01:15:12,231
That wasn't really.

2032
01:15:12,232 --> 01:15:14,257
So I think a lot of these people got

2033
01:15:14,257 --> 01:15:14,257
criticized wrongly.

2034
01:15:14,258 --> 01:15:16,276
They were actually seeing what was right

2035
01:15:16,276 --> 01:15:16,276
about nature.

2036
01:15:16,277 --> 01:15:21,321
But this view was thought to be opposed

2037
01:15:21,321 --> 01:15:21,321
to naturalism.

2038
01:15:21,322 --> 01:15:24,353
That was teleological and that had to be

2039
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:24,353
some sort of mystical force.

2040
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:27,381
And what I'm saying is we just didn't

2041
01:15:27,381 --> 01:15:27,381
know about certain things.

2042
01:15:27,382 --> 01:15:35,461
We didn't understand information and that

2043
01:15:35,461 --> 01:15:35,461
these people were right and that a lot of

2044
01:15:35,461 --> 01:15:35,461
people will hear this and say, oh, well,

2045
01:15:35,461 --> 01:15:35,461
that's against science.

2046
01:15:35,466 --> 01:15:38,493
They might think it's against the second

2047
01:15:38,493 --> 01:15:38,493
law of thermodynamics or something.

2048
01:15:38,494 --> 01:15:41,523
But no, there's a big misunderstanding

2049
01:15:41,523 --> 01:15:41,523
about that.

2050
01:15:41,523 --> 01:15:45,568
And all of these people are all the

2051
01:15:45,568 --> 01:15:45,568
scientists on this page.

2052
01:15:46,569 --> 01:15:54,659
Really, everyone with the exception of a

2053
01:15:54,659 --> 01:15:54,659
couple of the phosphorus, are extremely

2054
01:15:54,659 --> 01:15:54,659
respected and very accomplished people

2055
01:15:54,659 --> 01:15:54,659
who support this view.

2056
01:15:55,659 --> 01:16:00,658
I mean, Ray Kurzwald, his technology guy,

2057
01:16:00,658 --> 01:16:00,658
is a little bit more out there, but he

2058
01:16:00,658 --> 01:16:00,658
even uses the word destiny.

2059
01:16:00,658 --> 01:16:01,667
Destiny.

2060
01:16:01,669 --> 01:16:07,728
It is clear that the physical laws of our

2061
01:16:07,728 --> 01:16:07,728
universe are precisely what they need to

2062
01:16:07,728 --> 01:16:07,728
be to allow for the evolution of

2063
01:16:07,728 --> 01:16:07,728
increasing levels of order and

2064
01:16:07,728 --> 01:16:07,728
complexity.

2065
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:11,768
Ultimately, the entire universe will

2066
01:16:11,768 --> 01:16:11,768
become saturated with intelligence.

2067
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:13,786
This is the destiny of the universe.

2068
01:16:13,787 --> 01:16:17,826
So what I'm saying is that this is the

2069
01:16:17,826 --> 01:16:17,826
trajectory of cosmic evolution.

2070
01:16:17,827 --> 01:16:20,855
This is the roadmap of the future.

2071
01:16:20,857 --> 01:16:27,929
And this provides something like an

2072
01:16:27,929 --> 01:16:27,929
outline for non reductionist theory of

2073
01:16:27,929 --> 01:16:27,929
everything based on emergence.

2074
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:35,007
So you have, first physics and chemistry

2075
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:35,007
emerge, then biology, then brains, then

2076
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:35,007
technology, and then the merger of

2077
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:35,007
biology with technology.

2078
01:16:35,009 --> 01:16:41,061
And then you get patterns of matter and

2079
01:16:41,061 --> 01:16:41,061
energy, and the Universe becomes

2080
01:16:41,061 --> 01:16:41,061
saturated with intelligent processes and

2081
01:16:41,061 --> 01:16:41,061
knowledge.

2082
01:16:41,061 --> 01:16:42,077
So life expands.

2083
01:16:42,078 --> 01:16:45,100
And we do that because we have to.

2084
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,118
We're going to run out of energy on this

2085
01:16:46,118 --> 01:16:46,118
planet.

2086
01:16:46,118 --> 01:16:54,194
Our star is going to die, which

2087
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:54,194
necessitates that we move outward, and

2088
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:54,194
then we extract the energy from that, and

2089
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:54,194
we keep moving outward.

2090
01:16:54,195 --> 01:17:05,245
And as we do, the informational network

2091
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:05,245
that is life keeps expanding, and it

2092
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:05,245
keeps taking inanimate matter in the

2093
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:05,245
world and incorporating that into its

2094
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:05,245
computational substrate.

2095
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:12,311
So the island of agency, the island of

2096
01:17:12,311 --> 01:17:12,311
information keeps spreading and subsuming

2097
01:17:12,311 --> 01:17:12,311
the inanimate world.

2098
01:17:12,313 --> 01:17:15,348
And I'm saying that that is an inevitable

2099
01:17:15,348 --> 01:17:15,348
process.

2100
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:18,371
And people say, well, that seems very

2101
01:17:18,371 --> 01:17:18,371
unlikely.

2102
01:17:18,372 --> 01:17:27,460
And if that's happening, then it's not

2103
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:27,460
part of the design or it's not part of

2104
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:27,460
the code of the universe.

2105
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:31,504
Like, it's not necessitated by the

2106
01:17:31,504 --> 01:17:31,504
parameters, the laws and the constants.

2107
01:17:31,505 --> 01:17:37,565
They'll say it's just something that

2108
01:17:37,565 --> 01:17:37,565
could have happened, and it's unlikely,

2109
01:17:37,565 --> 01:17:37,565
but we're defying the odds.

2110
01:17:37,566 --> 01:17:45,642
Now, when those people say that they

2111
01:17:45,642 --> 01:17:45,642
don't even realize their own ontology,

2112
01:17:45,642 --> 01:17:45,642
like, if they believe in determinism,

2113
01:17:45,642 --> 01:17:45,642
then there's only one trajectory, there's

2114
01:17:45,642 --> 01:17:45,642
only one thing that could happen.

2115
01:17:45,642 --> 01:17:47,659
So there's no likely or not likely.

2116
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:51,702
If you really believe in determinism,

2117
01:17:51,702 --> 01:17:51,702
there's no statistics, and there's really

2118
01:17:51,702 --> 01:17:51,702
no causation.

2119
01:17:51,703 --> 01:17:53,720
It's just one thing follows another.

2120
01:17:53,721 --> 01:17:54,733
And people have talked about that.

2121
01:17:54,734 --> 01:17:57,767
If determinism is true, then even

2122
01:17:57,767 --> 01:17:57,767
causality is an illusion.

2123
01:17:57,768 --> 01:18:03,767
It's just one sort of fabric of events

2124
01:18:03,767 --> 01:18:03,767
that all follow from the initial event.

2125
01:18:03,769 --> 01:18:19,920
So what I'm arguing is that the universe

2126
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:19,920
shows the dynamics of a far from

2127
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:19,920
equilibrium system, a driven system, and

2128
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:19,920
that it moving towards complexity isn't

2129
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:19,920
violating any laws, and it's not

2130
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:19,920
improbable.

2131
01:18:19,921 --> 01:18:26,995
We just didn't understand far from

2132
01:18:26,995 --> 01:18:26,995
equilibrium dynamics and that the

2133
01:18:26,995 --> 01:18:26,995
universe's complexity doesn't have to be

2134
01:18:26,995 --> 01:18:26,995
transient.

2135
01:18:26,996 --> 01:18:33,006
So Sean Carroll has this thing where he's

2136
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:33,006
showing, like, the increase in complexity

2137
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:33,006
and the increase in entropy, and people

2138
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:33,006
go, okay, this is making sense.

2139
01:18:33,006 --> 01:18:35,008
Complexity is not opposed to entropy.

2140
01:18:35,008 --> 01:18:35,008
It's part of that.

2141
01:18:35,008 --> 01:18:37,010
But it goes up and then it goes down.

2142
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:44,017
You have the coffee, and you have the

2143
01:18:44,017 --> 01:18:44,017
cream and the coffee mixing, and you get

2144
01:18:44,017 --> 01:18:44,017
this complexity, and then it all becomes

2145
01:18:44,017 --> 01:18:44,017
homogeneous.

2146
01:18:44,017 --> 01:18:47,020
What I'm saying is, no, that's not true

2147
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:47,020
for the universe at all.

2148
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:52,025
Complexity keeps going because when life

2149
01:18:52,025 --> 01:18:52,025
emerges, it's not like some complexity.

2150
01:18:52,025 --> 01:18:58,031
Like, you get some random pebbles

2151
01:18:58,031 --> 01:18:58,031
arranged as a crystal, and then the wind

2152
01:18:58,031 --> 01:18:58,031
blows and then they disperse.

2153
01:18:58,031 --> 01:19:00,027
Life is robust.

2154
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:01,028
It's modeled the world.

2155
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:08,035
And because it's modeled the world, it

2156
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:08,035
can maintain its own existence.

2157
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:17,044
So, for example, if an asteroid is coming

2158
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:17,044
at the Earth in 100 years, assuming that

2159
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:17,044
we advance technologically at the rate

2160
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:17,044
we've been, we're going to destroy that

2161
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:17,044
asteroid.

2162
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:19,046
We're going to do what we need to do to

2163
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:19,046
preserve life.

2164
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:24,051
And that's going to change the

2165
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:24,051
deterministic trajectory of the inanimate

2166
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:24,051
world.

2167
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:28,055
So life changes the trajectory of the

2168
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:28,055
inanimate world.

2169
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:32,059
But what I'm saying, it was inevitable

2170
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:32,059
that life emerges and does this.

2171
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:46,073
So there is a sort of trajectory that's

2172
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:46,073
sort of set in stone from the initial

2173
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:46,073
parameters, but that this trajectory is

2174
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:46,073
the opposite trajectory of what Boltzman

2175
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:46,073
thought.

2176
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:52,079
It's actually towards greater and greater

2177
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:52,079
organization and the discussion of

2178
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:52,079
where's the limit?

2179
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:58,085
If this universe wakes up and the whole

2180
01:19:58,085 --> 01:19:58,085
thing becomes this integrated

2181
01:19:58,085 --> 01:19:58,085
computational system, when does it have

2182
01:19:58,085 --> 01:19:58,085
to stop?

2183
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:00,081
What about the second law of

2184
01:20:00,081 --> 01:20:00,081
thermodynamics?

2185
01:20:00,081 --> 01:20:03,084
What about the energy needs?

2186
01:20:03,084 --> 01:20:07,088
And I wrote an article for NOAMA called

2187
01:20:07,088 --> 01:20:07,088
Life Need Not Ever End.

2188
01:20:07,088 --> 01:20:17,098
And it was shared by David Deutsch and

2189
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:17,098
Sabine Hawson felder and Robin Hansen

2190
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:17,098
also were commenting on it and saying,

2191
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:17,098
yes, it's possible that life could

2192
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:17,098
potentially not have a limit.

2193
01:20:17,098 --> 01:20:19,100
It depends on if there's an upper bound

2194
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:19,100
to entropy.

2195
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:22,103
Robin Hansen said Sabine was like, I have

2196
01:20:22,103 --> 01:20:22,103
a chapter on this in my book.

2197
01:20:22,103 --> 01:20:33,114
So a lot of the things that we took as

2198
01:20:33,114 --> 01:20:33,114
gospel, like the First Law and Second Law

2199
01:20:33,114 --> 01:20:33,114
of thermodynamics, those apply very well

2200
01:20:33,114 --> 01:20:33,114
to certain systems, but we shouldn't have

2201
01:20:33,114 --> 01:20:33,114
applied them to the Universe as a whole.

2202
01:20:33,114 --> 01:20:47,128
The first law of thermodynamics is just

2203
01:20:47,128 --> 01:20:47,128
like there's conservation of energy which

2204
01:20:47,128 --> 01:20:47,128
holds, and we use that to calculate

2205
01:20:47,128 --> 01:20:47,128
things, but the statement matter can't be

2206
01:20:47,128 --> 01:20:47,128
created or destroyed.

2207
01:20:47,128 --> 01:20:48,129
Absolutely not true.

2208
01:20:48,129 --> 01:20:55,136
Cosmic inflation theory has new matter

2209
01:20:55,136 --> 01:20:55,136
and energy created during the cosmic

2210
01:20:55,136 --> 01:20:55,136
inflation period continuously.

2211
01:20:55,136 --> 01:21:01,136
And then now with the expansion of the

2212
01:21:01,136 --> 01:21:01,136
Universe, there's dark energy constantly

2213
01:21:01,136 --> 01:21:01,136
being created as well.

2214
01:21:03,138 --> 01:21:15,150
There's this astronomy conference paper

2215
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:15,150
where people have speculated, have argued

2216
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:15,150
that we can use dark energy, and that's

2217
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:15,150
getting more speculative to continue to

2218
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:15,150
power life.

2219
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:16,151
We might not even need that.

2220
01:21:16,151 --> 01:21:19,154
If you read my article, you'll see this,

2221
01:21:19,154 --> 01:21:19,154
but you can look up on Sean Carroll's

2222
01:21:19,154 --> 01:21:19,154
blog.

2223
01:21:19,154 --> 01:21:22,157
He has an article called Energy is not

2224
01:21:22,157 --> 01:21:22,157
conserved.

2225
01:21:22,157 --> 01:21:28,163
And it talks about basically the First

2226
01:21:28,163 --> 01:21:28,163
Law is not true in the way some people

2227
01:21:28,163 --> 01:21:28,163
thought it was.

2228
01:21:29,164 --> 01:21:31,166
I didn't mean to do that.

2229
01:21:31,166 --> 01:21:33,168
Let me go back to this slide.

2230
01:21:34,169 --> 01:21:37,172
So let's speed it up.

2231
01:21:37,172 --> 01:21:39,174
So maybe this is where we're at now.

2232
01:21:39,174 --> 01:21:42,177
So it's a series of these stages.

2233
01:21:43,178 --> 01:21:49,184
And what I'm saying is we're at this

2234
01:21:49,184 --> 01:21:49,184
stage, and that the biosphere mirrors a

2235
01:21:49,184 --> 01:21:49,184
brain.

2236
01:21:49,184 --> 01:21:57,192
It's an information network of agents

2237
01:21:57,192 --> 01:21:57,192
exchanging information through the

2238
01:21:57,192 --> 01:21:57,192
Internet and that there's actually

2239
01:21:57,192 --> 01:21:57,192
people.

2240
01:21:57,192 --> 01:21:59,194
I say that's cosmic mysticism.

2241
01:21:59,194 --> 01:22:08,197
Well, there's some interesting new

2242
01:22:08,197 --> 01:22:08,197
theories by people like Lee Smallen and

2243
01:22:08,197 --> 01:22:08,197
John Lanier arguing that the Universe is

2244
01:22:08,197 --> 01:22:08,197
a learning machine and everything in that

2245
01:22:08,197 --> 01:22:08,197
paper is consistent with this view.

2246
01:22:08,197 --> 01:22:10,199
So go read that paper.

2247
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:12,201
Read the universe's neural network by

2248
01:22:12,201 --> 01:22:12,201
vitali.

2249
01:22:12,201 --> 01:22:14,203
He has a group on Facebook, and we've

2250
01:22:14,203 --> 01:22:14,203
been meeting.

2251
01:22:14,203 --> 01:22:17,206
We're taking a break for the summer and

2252
01:22:17,206 --> 01:22:17,206
making some videos.

2253
01:22:17,206 --> 01:22:23,212
But basically there's a mathematical

2254
01:22:23,212 --> 01:22:23,212
foundation for this picture.

2255
01:22:23,212 --> 01:22:28,217
And so calling it cosmic mysticism is

2256
01:22:28,217 --> 01:22:28,217
just not true anymore.

2257
01:22:28,217 --> 01:22:37,226
And you can have a fundamentally

2258
01:22:37,226 --> 01:22:37,226
purposeful universe headed towards this,

2259
01:22:37,226 --> 01:22:37,226
what TLR de Chardin would describe as

2260
01:22:37,226 --> 01:22:37,226
like an omega point.

2261
01:22:38,227 --> 01:22:44,233
And it's completely consistent with

2262
01:22:44,233 --> 01:22:44,233
naturalism, as long as you update

2263
01:22:44,233 --> 01:22:44,233
naturalism to include these new

2264
01:22:44,233 --> 01:22:44,233
dynamics.

2265
01:22:45,234 --> 01:22:49,238
So I was going to talk about phase

2266
01:22:49,238 --> 01:22:49,238
transitions.

2267
01:22:49,238 --> 01:23:00,243
So basically, these stages in cosmic

2268
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:00,243
evolution occur from components like

2269
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:00,243
nature's fundamental particles combining

2270
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:00,243
to make higher level systems.

2271
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:09,252
So we have atoms come together to form

2272
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:09,252
molecules, which come together to form

2273
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:09,252
cells, which come together to form

2274
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:09,252
organisms and ecosystems.

2275
01:23:10,253 --> 01:23:12,255
And then the biosphere is this fully

2276
01:23:12,255 --> 01:23:12,255
integrated network.

2277
01:23:12,255 --> 01:23:14,257
So those are phase transitions.

2278
01:23:14,257 --> 01:23:16,259
It occurs in stages.

2279
01:23:16,259 --> 01:23:17,260
We have a depiction here.

2280
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:19,262
We see a single celled organism.

2281
01:23:20,263 --> 01:23:23,266
And then those organisms, you can think

2282
01:23:23,266 --> 01:23:23,266
of a slime mold.

2283
01:23:23,266 --> 01:23:27,270
So you have a bunch of, like, paramesium

2284
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:27,270
or something, and then they need to solve

2285
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:27,270
a problem.

2286
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:29,272
And so they come together and they solve

2287
01:23:29,272 --> 01:23:29,272
a problem.

2288
01:23:29,272 --> 01:23:32,275
They form multicellular organism.

2289
01:23:32,275 --> 01:23:34,277
So here's a slime molding, here's a

2290
01:23:34,277 --> 01:23:34,277
human.

2291
01:23:34,277 --> 01:23:38,281
And these agents also come together to

2292
01:23:38,281 --> 01:23:38,281
form larger collectives.

2293
01:23:38,281 --> 01:23:41,284
And every time you have one of these,

2294
01:23:41,284 --> 01:23:41,284
it's called a phase transition.

2295
01:23:41,284 --> 01:23:45,288
And it's exactly the same as the phase

2296
01:23:45,288 --> 01:23:45,288
transitions.

2297
01:23:45,288 --> 01:23:50,293
Not exactly the same, but the same

2298
01:23:50,293 --> 01:23:50,293
category of phenomena.

2299
01:23:50,293 --> 01:23:55,298
Like when you have water freeze into

2300
01:23:55,298 --> 01:23:55,298
ice.

2301
01:23:55,298 --> 01:24:11,308
But we have these non equilibrium phase

2302
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:11,308
transitions where you'll have, like, the

2303
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:11,308
emergence of a tornado or a whirlpool in

2304
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:11,308
your bathtub and basically these little

2305
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:11,308
units, like in the formation of a

2306
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:11,308
Whirlpool, you have all these atoms that

2307
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:11,308
are bouncing around chaotically.

2308
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:23,320
And due to some thermodynamic constraints

2309
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:23,320
that we won't get into here, they start

2310
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:23,320
to organize themselves into these

2311
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:23,320
collective formations that create these

2312
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:23,320
flow patterns.

2313
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,322
And you can see these organized

2314
01:24:25,322 --> 01:24:25,322
structures.

2315
01:24:25,322 --> 01:24:30,327
And that life is basically another

2316
01:24:30,327 --> 01:24:30,327
version of this.

2317
01:24:30,327 --> 01:24:39,336
And that when atoms come together to make

2318
01:24:39,336 --> 01:24:39,336
our subatomic particles come together to

2319
01:24:39,336 --> 01:24:39,336
make an atom.

2320
01:24:39,336 --> 01:24:42,339
Like these phase transitions, they

2321
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:42,339
continue in the hierarchy of life.

2322
01:24:42,339 --> 01:24:46,343
So you have agents coming together,

2323
01:24:46,343 --> 01:24:46,343
single cellulants to make multicellular,

2324
01:24:46,343 --> 01:24:46,343
then to make societies.

2325
01:24:46,343 --> 01:24:52,349
And these phase transitions happen at

2326
01:24:52,349 --> 01:24:52,349
this edge of chaos.

2327
01:24:52,349 --> 01:24:59,356
So there's this sort of dialectical

2328
01:24:59,356 --> 01:24:59,356
dynamic between order and chaos that

2329
01:24:59,356 --> 01:24:59,356
creates complexity.

2330
01:24:59,356 --> 01:25:02,353
And really, everything is going through

2331
01:25:02,353 --> 01:25:02,353
these cycles.

2332
01:25:02,353 --> 01:25:11,362
So when there's a phase transition, you

2333
01:25:11,362 --> 01:25:11,362
don't want a system to be too stable

2334
01:25:11,362 --> 01:25:11,362
because it's too rigid to transition to

2335
01:25:11,362 --> 01:25:11,362
the next stage.

2336
01:25:11,362 --> 01:25:15,366
So there will be periods of chaos like

2337
01:25:15,366 --> 01:25:15,366
we're experiencing right now in society.

2338
01:25:15,366 --> 01:25:21,372
And you might think that the world's

2339
01:25:21,372 --> 01:25:21,372
ending, but it's actually an indication

2340
01:25:21,372 --> 01:25:21,372
that a phase transition is about to

2341
01:25:21,372 --> 01:25:21,372
happen.

2342
01:25:21,372 --> 01:25:28,379
And so the system has the potential to

2343
01:25:28,379 --> 01:25:28,379
either collapse or to transition into a

2344
01:25:28,379 --> 01:25:28,379
higher state of organization.

2345
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:34,385
And so this shows these different

2346
01:25:34,385 --> 01:25:34,385
stages.

2347
01:25:34,385 --> 01:25:36,387
You have nonliving, then you have it with

2348
01:25:36,387 --> 01:25:36,387
living.

2349
01:25:36,387 --> 01:25:41,392
You go from cells to military organisms

2350
01:25:41,392 --> 01:25:41,392
to tribes and cities, nations and into

2351
01:25:41,392 --> 01:25:41,392
gaia.

2352
01:25:42,392 --> 01:25:47,398
And then it can even extend from like

2353
01:25:47,398 --> 01:25:47,398
when we TerraForm Mars, that's the

2354
01:25:47,398 --> 01:25:47,398
biosphere self replicating.

2355
01:25:47,398 --> 01:25:56,407
And so life will basically the spread of

2356
01:25:56,407 --> 01:25:56,407
life is like this higher level unit

2357
01:25:56,407 --> 01:25:56,407
that's the biosphere making copies of

2358
01:25:56,407 --> 01:25:56,407
itself with variation and selection.

2359
01:25:57,407 --> 01:26:10,415
And then life would potentially, I'm

2360
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:10,415
arguing, inevitably subsume solar systems

2361
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:10,415
and galaxies and so on.

2362
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:17,422
So let's skip some stuff and get into the

2363
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:17,422
self help stuff, since we don't have much

2364
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:17,422
time.

2365
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:21,426
Daniel, do we have to cut it eight or can

2366
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:21,426
we go 10 minutes longer?

2367
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:25,430
Daniel: We can go 10 minutes over.

2368
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:26,431
Bobby: We'll only go ten.

2369
01:26:27,431 --> 01:26:29,434
I don't want to keep you too long, but

2370
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:29,434
that will help with the questions.

2371
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:31,436
If I can end at eight, then we can do 10

2372
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:31,436
minutes.

2373
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:34,439
If questions are maybe I'll try to end

2374
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:34,439
before.

2375
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:42,447
So these phase transitions create these

2376
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:42,447
memory systems, so these higher organized

2377
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:42,447
systems like life.

2378
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:55,460
So when we get the first cell, we have

2379
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:55,460
genetic memory, and that's encoding

2380
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:55,460
information that the organism basically

2381
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:55,460
that living things have discovered

2382
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:55,460
through evolution.

2383
01:26:55,460 --> 01:27:00,459
So evolution is this process where it's

2384
01:27:00,459 --> 01:27:00,459
making these different copies of these

2385
01:27:00,459 --> 01:27:00,459
organisms.

2386
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:06,465
So there's a genome with some

2387
01:27:06,465 --> 01:27:06,465
information, but it makes a copy, and

2388
01:27:06,465 --> 01:27:06,465
that copy has some variation.

2389
01:27:06,465 --> 01:27:14,473
So you get something different, and that

2390
01:27:14,473 --> 01:27:14,473
organism might be better fit to the

2391
01:27:14,473 --> 01:27:14,473
environment, or worse fit.

2392
01:27:14,473 --> 01:27:17,476
If it's a worse fit, it's going to die

2393
01:27:17,476 --> 01:27:17,476
out.

2394
01:27:17,476 --> 01:27:19,478
So it's going to be weeded out.

2395
01:27:19,478 --> 01:27:24,483
That template of information is going to

2396
01:27:24,483 --> 01:27:24,483
be weeded out of the population.

2397
01:27:24,483 --> 01:27:30,489
And the organisms that are well adapted

2398
01:27:30,489 --> 01:27:30,489
get to make more copies of themselves.

2399
01:27:30,489 --> 01:27:38,497
So what's going on in this process is

2400
01:27:38,497 --> 01:27:38,497
that you're building up information in an

2401
01:27:38,497 --> 01:27:38,497
organism and that information corresponds

2402
01:27:38,497 --> 01:27:38,497
to adaptations.

2403
01:27:38,497 --> 01:27:42,501
And so that information is information

2404
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:42,501
that is predictive about the

2405
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:42,501
environment.

2406
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:48,507
So organisms are performing inference

2407
01:27:48,507 --> 01:27:48,507
from the very beginning of life's

2408
01:27:48,507 --> 01:27:48,507
emergence.

2409
01:27:48,507 --> 01:27:50,509
They're trying to solve a problem.

2410
01:27:50,509 --> 01:27:54,513
It's how to stop this order to disorder

2411
01:27:54,513 --> 01:27:54,513
transition.

2412
01:27:54,513 --> 01:27:58,517
Basically, for an organism to stay

2413
01:27:58,517 --> 01:27:58,517
organized, it has to find energy.

2414
01:27:59,518 --> 01:28:09,522
And if it has to find and that's what

2415
01:28:09,522 --> 01:28:09,522
Schrodinger's book, what his Life was

2416
01:28:09,522 --> 01:28:09,522
showing, is that life resists this

2417
01:28:09,522 --> 01:28:09,522
tendency to fall apart that Boltman

2418
01:28:09,522 --> 01:28:09,522
described, because it captures energy.

2419
01:28:09,522 --> 01:28:13,526
And that energy allows the system to do

2420
01:28:13,526 --> 01:28:13,526
work that's keeping the organization.

2421
01:28:13,526 --> 01:28:19,532
So with these phase transitions, you get

2422
01:28:19,532 --> 01:28:19,532
different memory systems building on each

2423
01:28:19,532 --> 01:28:19,532
other.

2424
01:28:19,532 --> 01:28:21,534
So you have genetic memory with the

2425
01:28:21,534 --> 01:28:21,534
origin of life.

2426
01:28:21,534 --> 01:28:28,541
Then you have neural memory with the

2427
01:28:28,541 --> 01:28:28,541
emergence of brains, and then you have

2428
01:28:28,541 --> 01:28:28,541
the emergence of civilization, and you

2429
01:28:28,541 --> 01:28:28,541
get cultural memory, and then you get

2430
01:28:28,541 --> 01:28:28,541
meme propagation.

2431
01:28:28,541 --> 01:28:31,544
So you get a different mode of

2432
01:28:31,544 --> 01:28:31,544
transferring information.

2433
01:28:31,544 --> 01:28:48,561
And all of these memory systems build on

2434
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:48,561
each other and they all encode predictive

2435
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:48,561
information about the environment that

2436
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:48,561
allows the living system to stay out of

2437
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:48,561
thermodynamic equilibrium, to stay out,

2438
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:48,561
to prevent falling apart.

2439
01:28:50,563 --> 01:29:03,570
So one thing that is worth mentioning is

2440
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:03,570
this new picture of hierarchical

2441
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:03,570
emergence, this new paradigm where you

2442
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:03,570
have this multilevel level nature of

2443
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:03,570
reality, where reality is organizing

2444
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:03,570
itself into these hierarchical levels.

2445
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:04,571
It has predictive power.

2446
01:29:04,571 --> 01:29:06,572
That the reductionist theory.

2447
01:29:06,573 --> 01:29:12,579
Any reductionist theories of everything

2448
01:29:12,579 --> 01:29:12,579
don't have those are microphysics

2449
01:29:12,579 --> 01:29:12,579
theories and they don't apply to life.

2450
01:29:12,579 --> 01:29:19,586
So those theories of everything, I would

2451
01:29:19,586 --> 01:29:19,586
argue, aren't theories of everything

2452
01:29:19,586 --> 01:29:19,586
because they don't include life and

2453
01:29:19,586 --> 01:29:19,586
civilization and consciousness.

2454
01:29:19,586 --> 01:29:21,588
And what I'm saying is that that stuff

2455
01:29:21,588 --> 01:29:21,588
has causal power.

2456
01:29:21,588 --> 01:29:23,590
It's not epithet phenomena.

2457
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:29,596
So any theory of everything needs to

2458
01:29:29,596 --> 01:29:29,596
include those things because they

2459
01:29:29,596 --> 01:29:29,596
consider them epid phenomena.

2460
01:29:29,596 --> 01:29:30,597
They go, we don't have to worry about

2461
01:29:30,597 --> 01:29:30,597
it.

2462
01:29:30,597 --> 01:29:33,600
But what I'm saying is those things

2463
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:33,600
actually have causal power and they need

2464
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:33,600
to be explained.

2465
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:47,614
So some predictive power that this theory

2466
01:29:47,614 --> 01:29:47,614
has that the old model doesn't, this

2467
01:29:47,614 --> 01:29:47,614
microscale model is that we can actually

2468
01:29:47,614 --> 01:29:47,614
use the dynamics of a system at one level

2469
01:29:47,614 --> 01:29:47,614
to understand the dynamics of a system at

2470
01:29:47,614 --> 01:29:47,614
another level because they're

2471
01:29:47,614 --> 01:29:47,614
isomorphic.

2472
01:29:48,615 --> 01:29:52,619
They have similar patterns because

2473
01:29:52,619 --> 01:29:52,619
they're all complex adaptive systems.

2474
01:29:52,619 --> 01:30:05,626
So what I'm saying is that you can make

2475
01:30:05,626 --> 01:30:05,626
predictions and you can use principles to

2476
01:30:05,626 --> 01:30:05,626
optimize society that are the same

2477
01:30:05,626 --> 01:30:05,626
principles at work in evolution that

2478
01:30:05,626 --> 01:30:05,626
optimize organisms.

2479
01:30:05,626 --> 01:30:10,631
And so we can think about someone's

2480
01:30:10,631 --> 01:30:10,631
asking, okay, maybe you accept that

2481
01:30:10,631 --> 01:30:10,631
there's a global brain.

2482
01:30:10,631 --> 01:30:11,632
You go, okay, we are agents.

2483
01:30:11,632 --> 01:30:13,634
We're informationally connected.

2484
01:30:13,634 --> 01:30:19,640
We're exchanging information the way

2485
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:19,640
neurons exchange signal each other

2486
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:19,640
through action potentials.

2487
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:23,644
We must be forming this collective

2488
01:30:23,644 --> 01:30:23,644
intelligence the way that there's an

2489
01:30:23,644 --> 01:30:23,644
intelligence in the brain.

2490
01:30:23,644 --> 01:30:25,646
And we know we are because that's how we

2491
01:30:25,646 --> 01:30:25,646
build rockets and stuff.

2492
01:30:26,647 --> 01:30:27,648
A single person doesn't do it.

2493
01:30:27,648 --> 01:30:28,649
We build on accumulated knowledge.

2494
01:30:28,649 --> 01:30:31,652
We stand on the shoulder of giants and we

2495
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:31,652
share information.

2496
01:30:32,653 --> 01:30:33,654
That's what science is all about.

2497
01:30:33,654 --> 01:30:34,655
It depends on that.

2498
01:30:34,655 --> 01:30:51,672
So if you want to ask how intelligent is

2499
01:30:51,672 --> 01:30:51,672
the global brain, is the network of

2500
01:30:51,672 --> 01:30:51,672
humans, then you can fall back on

2501
01:30:51,672 --> 01:30:51,672
understanding the way that

2502
01:30:51,672 --> 01:30:51,672
neuroscientists have understand brains

2503
01:30:51,672 --> 01:30:51,672
and what leads to greater computational

2504
01:30:51,672 --> 01:30:51,672
power in brains?

2505
01:30:51,672 --> 01:30:56,677
Or what's the most robust design for a

2506
01:30:56,677 --> 01:30:56,677
civilization?

2507
01:30:56,677 --> 01:30:58,679
Well, what's the most robust design for

2508
01:30:58,679 --> 01:30:58,679
an organism?

2509
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:06,681
Well, we want it to be hierarchical

2510
01:31:06,681 --> 01:31:06,681
because you have this division of labor

2511
01:31:06,681 --> 01:31:06,681
and all these other advantages that we'll

2512
01:31:06,681 --> 01:31:06,681
talk about in a minute.

2513
01:31:06,681 --> 01:31:20,695
So my point is this theory allows us to

2514
01:31:20,695 --> 01:31:20,695
predict things that we couldn't predict

2515
01:31:20,695 --> 01:31:20,695
before, because we are using a model of a

2516
01:31:20,695 --> 01:31:20,695
similar system, of a complex system at

2517
01:31:20,695 --> 01:31:20,695
one level to tell us things about what

2518
01:31:20,695 --> 01:31:20,695
hasn't happened in the future and what

2519
01:31:20,695 --> 01:31:20,695
will emerge.

2520
01:31:20,695 --> 01:31:24,699
And so there is an aspect of determinism

2521
01:31:24,699 --> 01:31:24,699
here.

2522
01:31:25,699 --> 01:31:31,706
It's not the same kind of determinism,

2523
01:31:31,706 --> 01:31:31,706
but there's a global determinism where

2524
01:31:31,706 --> 01:31:31,706
you get expected patterns at these

2525
01:31:31,706 --> 01:31:31,706
levels.

2526
01:31:31,706 --> 01:31:37,712
So we can get a glimpse into where the

2527
01:31:37,712 --> 01:31:37,712
future is headed, but we can never know

2528
01:31:37,712 --> 01:31:37,712
the details and we can never know what

2529
01:31:37,712 --> 01:31:37,712
will emerge.

2530
01:31:37,712 --> 01:31:38,713
Exactly.

2531
01:31:38,713 --> 01:31:42,717
But we can see that these phase

2532
01:31:42,717 --> 01:31:42,717
transitions happen and we will get new

2533
01:31:42,717 --> 01:31:42,717
emergences.

2534
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:46,721
Talking about predictive power.

2535
01:31:46,721 --> 01:31:54,729
So Paul Krugman Nobel prize winning

2536
01:31:54,729 --> 01:31:54,729
economist said, by 2005, it will become

2537
01:31:54,729 --> 01:31:54,729
clear that the Internet's impact on the

2538
01:31:54,729 --> 01:31:54,729
economy has been no greater than the fax

2539
01:31:54,729 --> 01:31:54,729
machines.

2540
01:31:54,729 --> 01:31:58,733
Probably the most wrong statement that

2541
01:31:58,733 --> 01:31:58,733
you could ever make.

2542
01:31:59,734 --> 01:32:03,732
And so why did he make this mistake?

2543
01:32:03,732 --> 01:32:04,733
Here we see it again.

2544
01:32:04,733 --> 01:32:07,736
Internet may be just a passing fad as

2545
01:32:07,736 --> 01:32:07,736
millions give up on it.

2546
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:09,738
Why did they make this mistake?

2547
01:32:09,738 --> 01:32:16,745
What I'm saying is, if they had this

2548
01:32:16,745 --> 01:32:16,745
framework that I've just outlined, we

2549
01:32:16,745 --> 01:32:16,745
would have known when we saw the

2550
01:32:16,745 --> 01:32:16,745
Internet.

2551
01:32:16,745 --> 01:32:19,748
This is a tool for interconnection.

2552
01:32:19,748 --> 01:32:20,749
This is a tool for complexification.

2553
01:32:20,749 --> 01:32:22,751
It's not going away.

2554
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:31,760
Maybe the Internet would go away, but

2555
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:31,760
something else with a different name

2556
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:31,760
would replace it because this is part of

2557
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:31,760
this trajectory that Ray Kurzwell called,

2558
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:31,760
like, the destiny for life.

2559
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:36,765
So without this theory, we will not see

2560
01:32:36,765 --> 01:32:36,765
obvious things that would be obvious to

2561
01:32:36,765 --> 01:32:36,765
us otherwise.

2562
01:32:37,766 --> 01:32:42,771
And we'll make terrible predictions like

2563
01:32:42,771 --> 01:32:42,771
Paul Krugman, and hopefully everybody

2564
01:32:42,771 --> 01:32:42,771
reminds him every day of his life that he

2565
01:32:42,771 --> 01:32:42,771
made that prediction.

2566
01:32:43,772 --> 01:32:45,774
He's really into systems thinking.

2567
01:32:45,774 --> 01:32:47,776
And so I think he would understand this.

2568
01:32:47,776 --> 01:32:52,781
And I'm interested to know whether he got

2569
01:32:52,781 --> 01:32:52,781
into systems thinking after he made that

2570
01:32:52,781 --> 01:32:52,781
prediction or before.

2571
01:32:52,781 --> 01:33:06,789
Because if you see this picture, like

2572
01:33:06,789 --> 01:33:06,789
Kilhardeshardin's newest fear, he

2573
01:33:06,789 --> 01:33:06,789
predicted this, the Internet, like 100

2574
01:33:06,789 --> 01:33:06,789
years ago based on his theory becoming

2575
01:33:06,789 --> 01:33:06,789
more integrated.

2576
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:11,794
So what does this mean for society?

2577
01:33:11,794 --> 01:33:15,798
We'll mention some of that stuff before

2578
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:15,798
getting into the Bayesian stuff just

2579
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:15,798
because it's here.

2580
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:16,799
Isolationism is bad.

2581
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:17,800
We want to be connected.

2582
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,802
If you cut people off, it's not good.

2583
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:21,804
There's no information exchange.

2584
01:33:21,804 --> 01:33:31,814
And it could be good for your nation in

2585
01:33:31,814 --> 01:33:31,814
the short term, but eventually what's

2586
01:33:31,814 --> 01:33:31,814
happening elsewhere in the world is going

2587
01:33:31,814 --> 01:33:31,814
to affect you because it's one integrated

2588
01:33:31,814 --> 01:33:31,814
system.

2589
01:33:31,814 --> 01:33:39,822
So we want to connect to people because

2590
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:39,822
we want to open up channels of

2591
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:39,822
information exchange, but we also want to

2592
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:39,822
preserve nations.

2593
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:49,832
We want to have this hierarchical thing

2594
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:49,832
where there's control centers at all of

2595
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:49,832
these levels towns, cities, nations, et

2596
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:49,832
cetera.

2597
01:33:49,832 --> 01:33:51,834
So we don't want it to become a

2598
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:51,834
homogenized hive mind.

2599
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:52,835
Why?

2600
01:33:52,835 --> 01:33:56,839
Because complexity is in computational

2601
01:33:56,839 --> 01:33:56,839
power.

2602
01:33:56,839 --> 01:33:58,841
It's a function of variety and

2603
01:33:58,841 --> 01:33:58,841
integration.

2604
01:33:58,841 --> 01:34:08,845
So something is more complex, has more

2605
01:34:08,845 --> 01:34:08,845
computational power if there's more

2606
01:34:08,845 --> 01:34:08,845
diversity among the parts and if there's

2607
01:34:08,845 --> 01:34:08,845
more connections between those parts.

2608
01:34:08,845 --> 01:34:24,861
So that definition of complexity that

2609
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:24,861
lets us know if an organism is more

2610
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:24,861
complex, like a human brain is more

2611
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:24,861
complex than an ant brain because it has

2612
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:24,861
more neurons and more connections and

2613
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:24,861
more hierarchical levels, we can use that

2614
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:24,861
to create a more robust society.

2615
01:34:25,862 --> 01:34:26,863
Now, what does this mean for you?

2616
01:34:26,863 --> 01:34:29,866
It means life is part of a cosmic process

2617
01:34:29,866 --> 01:34:29,866
with a goal.

2618
01:34:29,866 --> 01:34:38,875
There's this cosmic attractor, and we're

2619
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:38,875
agents that are part of that bringing

2620
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:38,875
that attractor about this process allows

2621
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:38,875
the universe to wake up.

2622
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:47,884
So life spreading is the inanimate world

2623
01:34:47,884 --> 01:34:47,884
finding a form that models itself, and

2624
01:34:47,884 --> 01:34:47,884
slowly the universe starts.

2625
01:34:47,884 --> 01:34:51,888
To become this integrated network that's

2626
01:34:51,888 --> 01:34:51,888
this coherent intelligence.

2627
01:34:51,888 --> 01:34:56,893
So that's pretty interesting spiritual

2628
01:34:56,893 --> 01:34:56,893
implications to that, however you want to

2629
01:34:56,893 --> 01:34:56,893
interpret that.

2630
01:34:56,893 --> 01:34:59,896
But when we're part of this, what does it

2631
01:34:59,896 --> 01:34:59,896
mean for us?

2632
01:34:59,896 --> 01:35:02,893
Okay, so this is the framing of the free

2633
01:35:02,893 --> 01:35:02,893
energy principle.

2634
01:35:02,893 --> 01:35:07,898
It says organisms are so saving it for

2635
01:35:07,898 --> 01:35:07,898
last, so it'd be climactic.

2636
01:35:07,898 --> 01:35:11,902
So the free energy principle, it frames

2637
01:35:11,902 --> 01:35:11,902
it with this schrodinger framing.

2638
01:35:11,902 --> 01:35:13,904
And Carl Friston, that's where he got it

2639
01:35:13,904 --> 01:35:13,904
from.

2640
01:35:13,904 --> 01:35:15,906
And it's also influenced by cybernetics.

2641
01:35:15,906 --> 01:35:21,912
But if you look at that stuff, you have

2642
01:35:21,912 --> 01:35:21,912
the free energy principle because it

2643
01:35:21,912 --> 01:35:21,912
basically says all organisms will fall

2644
01:35:21,912 --> 01:35:21,912
apart, all ordered systems.

2645
01:35:21,912 --> 01:35:24,915
So free energy principle applies to

2646
01:35:24,915 --> 01:35:24,915
aliens.

2647
01:35:25,916 --> 01:35:33,924
Any organized system anywhere in this

2648
01:35:33,924 --> 01:35:33,924
universe will have to, first of all,

2649
01:35:33,924 --> 01:35:33,924
extract energy if they want to stay

2650
01:35:33,924 --> 01:35:33,924
organized.

2651
01:35:34,925 --> 01:35:36,927
Free energy principle doesn't focus on

2652
01:35:36,927 --> 01:35:36,927
that.

2653
01:35:36,927 --> 01:35:41,932
But even though it has free energy in the

2654
01:35:41,932 --> 01:35:41,932
name but I will focus on that because I

2655
01:35:41,932 --> 01:35:41,932
think it should be a part of it.

2656
01:35:41,932 --> 01:35:54,945
Organisms have to capture real

2657
01:35:54,945 --> 01:35:54,945
thermodynamic free energy to stay in the

2658
01:35:54,945 --> 01:35:54,945
game of existence, to capture energy from

2659
01:35:54,945 --> 01:35:54,945
a chaotic external world, you have to

2660
01:35:54,945 --> 01:35:54,945
start modeling the world.

2661
01:35:54,945 --> 01:36:01,946
And that evolution is building a model of

2662
01:36:01,946 --> 01:36:01,946
the world through variation and

2663
01:36:01,946 --> 01:36:01,946
selection, through these accumulation of

2664
01:36:01,946 --> 01:36:01,946
adaptations.

2665
01:36:01,946 --> 01:36:03,948
And then brains do it even better.

2666
01:36:03,948 --> 01:36:07,952
And then you can update the model in real

2667
01:36:07,952 --> 01:36:07,952
time with brains because you have

2668
01:36:07,952 --> 01:36:07,952
synaptic plasticity.

2669
01:36:07,952 --> 01:36:09,954
It's not slow, where things have to die.

2670
01:36:09,954 --> 01:36:16,961
And you have this phylogenetic learning,

2671
01:36:16,961 --> 01:36:16,961
which is like the population is learning

2672
01:36:16,961 --> 01:36:16,961
this individuals can learn in real time.

2673
01:36:17,961 --> 01:36:19,964
And so you have to model the world.

2674
01:36:19,964 --> 01:36:21,966
And the free energy principle, that's

2675
01:36:21,966 --> 01:36:21,966
what it says.

2676
01:36:21,966 --> 01:36:31,976
It says there's reality and it has all

2677
01:36:31,976 --> 01:36:31,976
these details that we don't know, and we

2678
01:36:31,976 --> 01:36:31,976
have to create a model or a map of that

2679
01:36:31,976 --> 01:36:31,976
world that's a coarse grain, simplified

2680
01:36:31,976 --> 01:36:31,976
version of that.

2681
01:36:31,976 --> 01:36:38,983
And then that model is going to have

2682
01:36:38,983 --> 01:36:38,983
errors.

2683
01:36:38,983 --> 01:36:47,992
And so what the free energy principle and

2684
01:36:47,992 --> 01:36:47,992
active inference framework says is that

2685
01:36:47,992 --> 01:36:47,992
when we're doing actions in the world,

2686
01:36:47,992 --> 01:36:47,992
those are like miniature experiments.

2687
01:36:47,992 --> 01:36:55,000
And what we should do if we want to live

2688
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:55,000
optimally and stay out of thermodynamic

2689
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:55,000
equilibrium.

2690
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:11,010
If we want to survive and be robust, we

2691
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:11,010
want to decrease the difference between

2692
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:11,010
our model of the world, we want to

2693
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:11,010
decrease the error of our model and we

2694
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:11,010
want to make it more of an accurate

2695
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:11,010
representation of the world.

2696
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:13,012
So you have reality and then you have a

2697
01:37:13,012 --> 01:37:13,012
model of reality.

2698
01:37:13,012 --> 01:37:24,023
And when you want your model to match

2699
01:37:24,023 --> 01:37:24,023
reality as close as you can, to be able

2700
01:37:24,023 --> 01:37:24,023
to extract energy and avoid threats and

2701
01:37:24,023 --> 01:37:24,023
to stay in existence so we can be part of

2702
01:37:24,023 --> 01:37:24,023
this continual process of

2703
01:37:24,023 --> 01:37:24,023
complexification.

2704
01:37:25,024 --> 01:37:30,029
So we only got ten more minutes, but I

2705
01:37:30,029 --> 01:37:30,029
think we can actually cover all this.

2706
01:37:30,029 --> 01:37:42,041
So this looks really complex, but this is

2707
01:37:42,041 --> 01:37:42,041
going to allow me to explain the free

2708
01:37:42,041 --> 01:37:42,041
energy principle and merge it with

2709
01:37:42,041 --> 01:37:42,041
evolutionary theory and even the process

2710
01:37:42,041 --> 01:37:42,041
of science.

2711
01:37:42,041 --> 01:37:51,050
So this is an organism imagine this is

2712
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:51,050
the first organism that emerged with the

2713
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:51,050
origin of life.

2714
01:37:52,051 --> 01:38:00,053
And so this organism makes copies of

2715
01:38:00,053 --> 01:38:00,053
itself, and you get all of these

2716
01:38:00,053 --> 01:38:00,053
different designs, right?

2717
01:38:01,054 --> 01:38:05,058
So these different designs are variations

2718
01:38:05,058 --> 01:38:05,058
on this model.

2719
01:38:05,058 --> 01:38:10,063
This organism is an embodied theory about

2720
01:38:10,063 --> 01:38:10,063
how to survive, about how to stay far

2721
01:38:10,063 --> 01:38:10,063
from equilibrium.

2722
01:38:10,063 --> 01:38:20,073
So it has a predictive model of the world

2723
01:38:20,073 --> 01:38:20,073
that makes copies of itself, and you get

2724
01:38:20,073 --> 01:38:20,073
all of these competing predictive models,

2725
01:38:20,073 --> 01:38:20,073
and then these models compete for

2726
01:38:20,073 --> 01:38:20,073
survival, and some die out.

2727
01:38:20,073 --> 01:38:22,075
And the winning design is the best

2728
01:38:22,075 --> 01:38:22,075
predictor.

2729
01:38:22,075 --> 01:38:25,078
It gets to make copies of itself, and you

2730
01:38:25,078 --> 01:38:25,078
get a similar design.

2731
01:38:26,079 --> 01:38:32,085
So what's going on here is you have

2732
01:38:32,085 --> 01:38:32,085
models that are competing models, the way

2733
01:38:32,085 --> 01:38:32,085
scientific models compete.

2734
01:38:32,085 --> 01:38:47,100
And Bayes theorem is basically you have a

2735
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:47,100
theory, and you have competing models,

2736
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:47,100
and then you make predictions with those

2737
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:47,100
models, and then you test those

2738
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:47,100
predictions, and you update the

2739
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:47,100
probability that each model is true based

2740
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:47,100
on the results of those experiments.

2741
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:50,103
And so you want to update your model

2742
01:38:50,103 --> 01:38:50,103
based on new evidence.

2743
01:38:50,103 --> 01:38:59,112
And so what I'm saying is, evolution,

2744
01:38:59,112 --> 01:38:59,112
when you create all these organisms,

2745
01:38:59,112 --> 01:38:59,112
these copies, and they compete, it's

2746
01:38:59,112 --> 01:38:59,112
competing models, the way that scientific

2747
01:38:59,112 --> 01:38:59,112
theories compete.

2748
01:38:59,112 --> 01:39:09,116
And the winning model is a product of

2749
01:39:09,116 --> 01:39:09,116
natural selection, the same way that the

2750
01:39:09,116 --> 01:39:09,116
winning scientific theory is a product of

2751
01:39:09,116 --> 01:39:09,116
surviving criticism and testing.

2752
01:39:09,116 --> 01:39:11,118
So that's a natural selection pressure.

2753
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:21,128
So as these generations go on, with each

2754
01:39:21,128 --> 01:39:21,128
generation, you get an update to the

2755
01:39:21,128 --> 01:39:21,128
model.

2756
01:39:21,128 --> 01:39:23,130
It's a Bayesian update.

2757
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:31,138
And so the model starts to match reality

2758
01:39:31,138 --> 01:39:31,138
better, such that after a bunch of

2759
01:39:31,138 --> 01:39:31,138
generations, you get an optimized

2760
01:39:31,138 --> 01:39:31,138
organism that's optimized for that

2761
01:39:31,138 --> 01:39:31,138
niche.

2762
01:39:32,139 --> 01:39:36,143
And so this is how evolution itself is a

2763
01:39:36,143 --> 01:39:36,143
process of Bayesian inference.

2764
01:39:36,143 --> 01:39:41,148
As organisms adapt, they're updating

2765
01:39:41,148 --> 01:39:41,148
their model.

2766
01:39:42,149 --> 01:39:47,154
Karl Friston has understood this

2767
01:39:47,154 --> 01:39:47,154
equivalence and says that all of

2768
01:39:47,154 --> 01:39:47,154
evolution is inference.

2769
01:39:47,154 --> 01:39:51,158
Of course, someone might say all

2770
01:39:51,158 --> 01:39:51,158
inference is evolution, and it would all

2771
01:39:51,158 --> 01:39:51,158
be equally true.

2772
01:39:51,158 --> 01:39:53,160
But so this model applies to science.

2773
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:56,163
It applies to learning.

2774
01:39:56,163 --> 01:40:17,178
So instead of all these different

2775
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:17,178
organisms, which we said could be

2776
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:17,178
theories, different competing models, you

2777
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:17,178
could have this as different models of

2778
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:17,178
maybe you're trying to figure out how to

2779
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:17,178
play your sport to the best of your

2780
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:17,178
ability, and you want to test out these

2781
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:17,178
different things, and then you test them,

2782
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:17,178
and one performs better.

2783
01:40:17,178 --> 01:40:25,186
And so that's the free energy principle,

2784
01:40:25,186 --> 01:40:25,186
is that you're decreasing the difference

2785
01:40:25,186 --> 01:40:25,186
between your model and actual reality.

2786
01:40:25,186 --> 01:40:39,200
So you're doing these little experiments

2787
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:39,200
all the time, and based on what works,

2788
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:39,200
you're updating your model, or you should

2789
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:39,200
be if you want to optimize your system

2790
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:39,200
for survival and growth.

2791
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:53,214
And so it's the same when we're trying to

2792
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:53,214
find a political philosophy capitalism,

2793
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:53,214
socialism.

2794
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:55,216
These are competing models.

2795
01:40:55,216 --> 01:40:57,217
We test those models out.

2796
01:40:57,218 --> 01:40:58,219
This is variation in selection.

2797
01:40:58,219 --> 01:41:01,216
And the ones that work, they get retained

2798
01:41:01,216 --> 01:41:01,216
by society, and we keep those.

2799
01:41:01,216 --> 01:41:09,224
So capitalism, I would argue it's

2800
01:41:09,224 --> 01:41:09,224
terrible right now, but it was the best

2801
01:41:09,224 --> 01:41:09,224
model for the time.

2802
01:41:09,224 --> 01:41:14,229
And the superior model is always going to

2803
01:41:14,229 --> 01:41:14,229
be it's never going to be one thing.

2804
01:41:14,229 --> 01:41:15,230
It's always going to change.

2805
01:41:15,230 --> 01:41:20,235
So we would want to test hybrids between

2806
01:41:20,235 --> 01:41:20,235
socialism and capitalism and crypto

2807
01:41:20,235 --> 01:41:20,235
economics.

2808
01:41:20,235 --> 01:41:35,250
If you want to determine a political

2809
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:35,250
party based on this, what you would say

2810
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:35,250
was that the best solution for a

2811
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:35,250
political party is to try out different

2812
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:35,250
models in small areas and based on what

2813
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:35,250
works, then you can see where to apply

2814
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:35,250
those models.

2815
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:38,253
But I would argue that it's not going to

2816
01:41:38,253 --> 01:41:38,253
be socialism for every place.

2817
01:41:38,253 --> 01:41:40,255
It's not going to be capitalism.

2818
01:41:40,255 --> 01:41:41,256
It might not even be a hybrid.

2819
01:41:41,256 --> 01:41:45,260
It might even be something in addition to

2820
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:45,260
that, like crypto economics.

2821
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:47,262
And that we have to test these things.

2822
01:41:47,262 --> 01:41:52,267
And if we're not testing them and we're

2823
01:41:52,267 --> 01:41:52,267
not trying these different models, we're

2824
01:41:52,267 --> 01:41:52,267
not living optimal.

2825
01:41:52,267 --> 01:41:58,273
We have no way to get to the optimal

2826
01:41:58,273 --> 01:41:58,273
worldview political philosophy if we're

2827
01:41:58,273 --> 01:41:58,273
not doing.
