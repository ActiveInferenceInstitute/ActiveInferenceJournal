1
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,840
hello everyone welcome

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,440
it is september 13 2022.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,800
we're here at the active inference

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,439
institute with john vervicky so john

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,920
welcome thank you for joining

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,920
i'm very much looking forward to this

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,600
conversation

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,080
hello and to you

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,679
thank you daniel it's great pleasure

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,960
being here i'm looking forward to this

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,520
is there any introduction or hello that

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,320
you'd like to provide as we

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,800
head into this journey together

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,239
i guess i can give just a little bit of

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,079
background so people know where i'm

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,000
coming from i'm an associate professor

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
at the university of toronto

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,879
i'm i'm appointed both in cognitive

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,160
psychology

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,600
and in cognitive science i teach in both

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
and i am the director of the cognitive

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,879
science program

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,600
uh so i do a lot of work integrating

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,920
especially psychology and

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,320
um ideas from artificial intelligence

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,080
large framework models philosophical

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,520
framework models for the nature of the

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,320
mind

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,439
i especially do work on intelligence

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,600
consciousness insight

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,680
flow mindfulness and wisdom

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,520
all centered upon a notion uh uh uh well

33
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,520
not a notion a proposal a theoretical

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,200
proposal that i call relevance

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,640
realization and perhaps we'll get into

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,360
that at some point

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,479
into it we go

38
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,840
so to provide some context

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,200
these live streams are

40
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,400
multi-directional roads

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,759
we're going to be talking about

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,240
different ideas for some people it'll be

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,399
their day-to-day life and the water they

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,960
swim in for other people it might be

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,280
their first time hearing about relevance

46
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,000
realization or predictive processing or

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,360
active inference

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,439
and so we always want to make it

49
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,479
accessible and also provide depth

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,360
so

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,079
yesterday in speaking with some

52
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,240
other participants at the institute

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,280
about how to frame this discussion

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,360
i was bringing a notion of a

55
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,040
three-legged stool

56
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,440
and the three legs of this stool

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,560
that provided stability are again those

58
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,319
relevance realization predictive

59
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,440
processing and active inference

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,480
and then a participant dean said flip

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,040
the stool it's still stable

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,360
and so that led to some discussions of

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,480
what was

64
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,480
the betweenness of these ideas and what

65
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,720
were they really doing alone and what do

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,480
they do together

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,319
and we're going to approach that

68
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,360
so

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,080
first we'll be exploring relevance

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,319
realization and predictive processing

71
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,959
in terms of what they are and how you

72
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,200
recently connected them in a recent

73
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,120
paper and then we'll bring in active

74
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,720
inference as a third guest to the party

75
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,000
but first

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,480
what is relevance realization and what

77
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,400
is predictive processing

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,159
how did you bring those two together in

79
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,080
the recent work with brett anderson and

80
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,000
mark miller

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
so the two lines were

82
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,120
working independently

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,159
um

84
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,319
i first got my first paper officially

85
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,200
accepted in 2009 didn't get published

86
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,920
until 2012 because they were holding it

87
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,080
back for a special issue that took

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,920
forever to come out uh the reason i

89
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,840
mentioned the earlier date is that's

90
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,640
before i think most of kristen's major

91
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,599
publications um and that's just and i'm

92
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,200
not claiming precedent or anything i'm

93
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,040
just claiming independence i didn't know

94
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,360
about his work until after the theory uh

95
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,000
was well developed and i assume he might

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,159
even not know of mine even now and

97
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,400
that's fine um

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,560
uh so the idea behind relevance

99
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,200
realization is that if you take a look

100
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,360
at many different problems

101
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,599
uh within attempts to explain the mind

102
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,519
in a non-homuncular

103
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,159
non-question begging manner you hit this

104
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,040
problem of relevance realization

105
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,760
so for example

106
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,680
how does categorization work well we

107
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,120
notice the two things are similar what

108
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,040
does it mean to say they're similar

109
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,399
well logically it means they share uh

110
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,639
many properties and then goodman

111
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,160
famously pointed out that any two

112
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,520
objects share an indefinite number of

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,479
true properties uh you know

114
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,120
a plum and a lawnmower both have rounds

115
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,720
shiny surfaces they're both found in

116
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,120
north america neither one existed 300

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,600
million years ago both have an odor

118
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,960
neither one is a particularly good

119
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,840
weapon etc etc etc and what people will

120
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,759
say to me is they can't say those are

121
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,880
false because they're all true they'll

122
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,199
say but that doesn't matter and that's

123
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,720
the move

124
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,560
right when you go from logical

125
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,880
similarity to psychological similarity

126
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,600
you say well i zero in on

127
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,360
the relevant

128
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,800
comparisons

129
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,040
ah and how do you do that and that of

130
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,440
course is still the crux

131
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,080
of the categorization problem let's take

132
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,479
a look at inference well

133
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,240
well inference is just to follow all the

134
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,600
implications of a proposition in

135
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,520
relation to other propositions

136
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,600
well how many are those

137
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,000
well let's take a proposition it's it's

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,639
going to be windy tomorrow that has you

139
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,720
know that would have implications for me

140
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,800
if i'm sailing uh that are different for

141
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,720
the implications for me if i'm flying a

142
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
kite or if i'm planning to have a picnic

143
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,479
or i'm planning to stay inside or if i'm

144
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,039
planning to take an airplane and do i

145
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,880
check out all the possible connections

146
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,560
between that proposition

147
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,919
um no i only select those that are

148
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,680
relevant and this was a point made very

149
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,280
very well quite a while ago by

150
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,039
christopher christopher cherniak in his

151
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,759
book

152
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,720
uh minimal rationality

153
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,199
problem solving i i many of you are

154
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,639
already familiar with this so i'll just

155
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,479
state it we know that the search space

156
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,320
for most problems is combinatorially

157
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,479
explosive you can't search the whole

158
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,880
space so you have to somehow ignore most

159
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,440
of the space well nevertheless reliably

160
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,039
being able to solve a wide variety of

161
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,680
problems in a wide variety of domains

162
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,960
i can make similar arguments for

163
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,560
communication i can make similar

164
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,639
arguments for learning etc i won't go

165
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,199
into them i'm just giving enough to

166
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,280
exemplify that

167
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,360
independently all of these things keep

168
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,280
crashing into this issue

169
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,759
of zeroing in on the relevant

170
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,440
information

171
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,400
and you can even note it uh at it you

172
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,000
know in your everyday experience what

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400
should you pay attention to right now

174
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,720
what should you draw from working memory

175
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,160
what should you draw from long-term

176
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,039
memory um especially with the fact that

177
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,400
you can combine different things from

178
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,160
long-term memory what sequence of

179
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,000
actions should you perform what

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,960
possibilities you could consider etc um

181
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,280
i take it that this

182
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,880
is at least plausible enough for me to

183
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,960
go on people can take a look at

184
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
all the publications to see the

185
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,720
arguments more in depth so this crucial

186
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,759
ability for relevance realization uh

187
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,520
needs to be addressed if we're ever

188
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,919
going to provide i i've argued i've

189
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,919
argued since my thesis that if we're

190
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,199
going to provide a naturalistic

191
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,720
explanation of the mind and the degree

192
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,440
to which we avoid it try to just pretend

193
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,639
it's not there et cetera

194
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,759
i think it undermines our efforts to

195
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,840
give a naturalistic explanation now this

196
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,479
is sometimes called the frame problem

197
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,319
i don't call it that anymore because

198
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,440
shanahan

199
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,360
has rightly argued that the frame

200
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,840
problem was two separate problems uh one

201
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,199
was to create a viable logic for change

202
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,120
uh that didn't get you sort of enmeshed

203
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,000
in

204
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,880
a bleed out of all kind of identities

205
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,039
and he argues that that

206
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,440
challenging problem has largely

207
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
been solved he claims to be one of the

208
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,960
people that solved it nobody seems to be

209
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,440
challenging him on that i i i don't

210
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,720
either

211
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,880
what he says remains and those are his

212
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,960
words not mine is the deeper problem of

213
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,639
relevance that's exactly what he calls

214
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,479
it the relevance problem um so

215
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,639
this problem is a key problem and

216
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,479
i have a proposal that i've worked on

217
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,000
with other people

218
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,400
tim littlecraft blake richards leo

219
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,840
ferraro

220
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
brett anderson and mark miller in the

221
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,919
recent paper uh gary hovinesian in a

222
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,879
paper we recently published um also

223
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,039
integrating relevance realization theory

224
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,800
and an active big five personality

225
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,759
theory

226
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,520
uh and the proposal

227
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,039
i mean the

228
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,400
proposal has more sort of technical

229
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,599
details but just to give the idea um

230
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,840
and we're not claiming that this i'm not

231
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,440
claiming none of us claim that this

232
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,839
proposal is completely

233
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,919
novel what we're claiming is you see it

234
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,919
implicit in many different areas where

235
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,159
progress is being made and you can draw

236
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,519
it out and explicate it and therefore

237
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,440
make more specific proposals of how to

238
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,839
look for it or how to engineer it

239
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,320
and this is the proposal that

240
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,080
the brain basically uses at many

241
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,279
different levels opponent processing um

242
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,800
and what it's doing is it's doing

243
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,279
something very analogous to evolution

244
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,680
it's opening up uh variations and then

245
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,600
putting selective pressure on them and

246
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,200
then from that opening up variations

247
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,959
putting selective pressure

248
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,000
uh on them and you you can see this at

249
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,839
many different levels your attention is

250
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,600
doing it right now

251
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,200
your default mode network is trying to

252
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,880
make your attention wander off and

253
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,000
introduce

254
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,839
new

255
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,760
ideas your task focused network is

256
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,920
drawing it back in killing off most of

257
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,200
those options but one of two of them

258
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,519
might be actually relevant to what's

259
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,080
going on you keep them

260
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,480
and the idea is that you do this and

261
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,519
there's many of these trade-off

262
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,959
relationships i'm just giving one

263
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,279
example there's many of these trade-off

264
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,920
relationships they're operating

265
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,200
in a massively recursive

266
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,920
multi-dimensional uh self-organizing

267
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,040
process to help you repeatedly zero in

268
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,880
on the relevant information like i say

269
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
there's more detail

270
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,480
obviously

271
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,600
but that's as as fast as i could make it

272
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,120
a gist of what uh the theory

273
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,000
is

274
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,480
is proposing

275
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,040
thank you for the summary definitely a

276
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,800
lot there

277
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,920
in

278
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,200
one way it's like moving from the sketch

279
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,959
of the continents and the lay of the

280
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,120
land the space of the possible for

281
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
cognitive science across these different

282
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,240
domains

283
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,760
and then asking how the relevant

284
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,839
view combinations are selected and then

285
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,200
one can point to a broad range of

286
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,440
so-called cognitive phenomena

287
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,480
in human as well as in other cognitive

288
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,600
systems

289
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,320
learning memory planning attention

290
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,880
compositionality action selection and

291
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,399
policy inference all of these areas

292
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,120
which one might imagine could have

293
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,519
bespoke custom theory

294
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,399
or there might be a way to look at some

295
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,920
similarities

296
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,640
ironically or not finding the relevant

297
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,320
similarities in these different

298
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,040
cognitive domains and asking whether we

299
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,600
could improve our inference and our

300
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,920
action regarding those domains through

301
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,160
the usage of an integrative framework

302
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,240
like relevance realization

303
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,720
that's excellent daniel and so just to

304
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,519
add to why i think it's uh reasonable

305
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,480
and perhaps even plausible that there is

306
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,240
such a domain general central capacity

307
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,320
is we have uh robustly replicated

308
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,279
evidence uh for uh the existence of

309
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,360
general intelligence by the way general

310
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,120
intelligence doesn't mean it can't be

311
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
analyzed in components it means

312
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,760
at its functional level it forms a

313
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,600
causal whole

314
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,839
that has you know reliable predictive

315
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,760
relations and we have it's you know it's

316
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,200
the most powerful psychometric in

317
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,040
psychology people don't like to hear

318
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,680
that uh but it is nevertheless the case

319
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,959
um we and so we have evidence that there

320
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,880
is above all and not in not in place of

321
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,040
but above all the specific learning you

322
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,079
have for specific domains there is

323
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,639
powerful evidence for general

324
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,120
intelligence a domain general ability

325
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,360
the way we test for it leo and i made

326
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,120
this argument in another paper is

327
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,279
basically we test for people's capacity

328
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,600
at relevance realization again and again

329
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,480
and again um and so

330
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,240
um that's why i think it's plausible

331
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,560
that there is this underlying

332
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,040
uh uh capacity

333
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,079
and

334
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,800
what what that helps do is it helps it

335
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,240
it allows you

336
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,839
it allows us to bridge into more

337
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,839
comprehensive patterns of explanation we

338
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,800
have

339
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,600
so for example uh the model i just

340
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,760
proposed to you um is explicitly

341
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,480
an analogy but a strong analogy you know

342
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,560
to the way evolutionary processes

343
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,040
produce adaptive morphology for market

344
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,279
organisms um

345
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,680
evolution variation selection and the

346
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,200
pro and it doesn't require an

347
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,920
intelligent designer right so evolution

348
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,079
is clearly a process that is itself not

349
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,160
intelligent and can produce intelligence

350
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,560
and so that gives us uh the potential

351
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,279
way out of any homuncular explanations

352
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,200
of intelligence uh like you know the

353
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,279
central executive selects this or that

354
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,519
and those kinds of explanations that

355
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,360
just presuppose an answer to this

356
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,399
question and so instead the idea is no

357
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,720
no um

358
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,760
the brain

359
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,519
at this general level again i'm not

360
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,760
denying specific heuristics although i'm

361
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,959
proposing that perhaps relevance

362
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,800
realization is how those specific

363
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,120
heuristics might be generated i'm not

364
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,959
i'm not denying specific heuristics i'm

365
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,040
not denying domain specific knowledge

366
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,399
i'm not denying any of that but i'm

367
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,560
saying there is a general ability

368
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,120
just like there is right this general

369
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,519
process of evolution for biological

370
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,680
adaptivity there is this general if

371
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,639
you'll allow me cognitive evolution of

372
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,560
your fittedness your cognitive

373
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,279
fittedness as a problem solver

374
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,480
to your environment

375
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,600
yes in in those ways it's very resonant

376
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,560
with

377
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,399
generalized uh darwinian models or like

378
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,839
neural darwinism as well as the

379
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,199
trend in

380
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,839
eco evo devo ecology evolution and

381
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,040
development

382
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,760
by way of looking at proliferation and

383
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,079
that pruning back process

384
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,399
in different spatial and temporal scales

385
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,000
different systems like the way that it

386
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,160
might happen with synapses forming and

387
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,399
then being pruned during development the

388
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,120
way that ecosystem assembly might occur

389
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,639
with initial

390
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,880
plants forming some sort of substrate

391
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,880
that later forms a ground for

392
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,360
development and then even at slower and

393
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,160
longer time scales with evolution and

394
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,600
especially when we think about the

395
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,800
neural aspects learning and behavior are

396
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,720
part of development they're processes

397
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,120
that happen within a lifetime

398
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,160
and

399
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,600
that is a great

400
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,920
angle to consider so

401
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
relevance realization

402
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,560
in our first pocket let's move to the

403
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,720
second leg

404
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,519
predictive processing what is predictive

405
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,160
processing and how did it come into play

406
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,800
and why did it come into play for this

407
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,560
recent work

408
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,000
so i've been familiar with predictive

409
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,800
processing um and i would often be an

410
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,320
annoyance at the conferences where

411
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,959
predictive processing uh was being

412
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,399
presented because i would ask where does

413
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,040
the model come from and uh where's the

414
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
innovations for the model come from and

415
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,120
uh things like that um

416
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,240
because uh i was i and and the questions

417
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,760
were genuine i wasn't you know i wasn't

418
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,959
trying to sabotage i wanted to

419
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,240
understand

420
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,920
how this was

421
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,279
um

422
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,360
integrating and i wasn't getting to be

423
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,199
fair and you know and the fault is

424
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,199
probably also mine you know i mean i i

425
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,000
was

426
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,199
i was learning all about this i've

427
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,560
learned about it quite a bit and you

428
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,320
know and i have my bias

429
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,800
but brett brett anderson approached me

430
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,199
and he said look

431
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,040
um

432
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,240
i think that what you're doing in

433
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,399
relevance realization is really needed

434
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,720
for predictive processing

435
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
and then at the very same time almost

436
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,839
and this is one of those uh happy

437
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,279
coincidences that are the shadows of god

438
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,120
or something like that uh a former

439
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,240
student of mine who went through the

440
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,680
cognitive science program with me mark

441
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,920
miller who has worked with andy clark

442
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,600
and a bunch of the other uh predictive

443
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,279
processing people

444
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,240
came and he said john i i want to start

445
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,079
working with you again and i want to

446
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,000
integrate what you've been doing and

447
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
i've been doing and so

448
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,240
the three of us started talking

449
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,720
and and um

450
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,000
and

451
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,680
you know when we went back and forth a

452
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,160
lot and we came up with

453
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,000
um a way in which we saw these two

454
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,360
theories converging so predictive

455
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,720
processing i mean there's a lot of

456
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
technicalities and people vary to the

457
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,920
degree to which uh they're committed to

458
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
you know a strong bayesian or a weaker

459
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,440
bayesium everybody agrees that you can't

460
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,720
be pure based because it would be

461
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,639
computationally intractable you have to

462
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,120
do some approximation and then the idea

463
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,600
is you have a massively recursive

464
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,720
um

465
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,759
network

466
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,440
that is basically

467
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
um doing something really in in

468
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,439
interesting

469
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,959
now again not to claim priority or pres

470
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,760
precedence but independently

471
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,280
in the 2012 paper uh we predicted that

472
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,119
the brain basically

473
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,439
uh tries to model itself in order to

474
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,839
model the environment uh because this

475
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,919
actually gets you uh

476
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,720
through a lot uh past a lot of difficult

477
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,120
problems um and that was

478
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,760
and independently and again like

479
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,320
i want to give due credit uh the idea

480
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,720
was no no the brain shouldn't predict

481
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,280
the world uh the brain should predict

482
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,520
itself in a multiply recursive

483
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,280
self-correcting fashion

484
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,360
in order to predict the world and for

485
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,440
reasons that i won't go into right now

486
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,280
that just that that just

487
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,039
gets you past so many of these

488
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,280
roadblocks right and then the idea is

489
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,039
well what should the brain what is the

490
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,720
brain doing when it's predicting itself

491
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,919
you know

492
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,400
there's all kinds of math but you know a

493
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,080
good interpretation is the brain is

494
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,559
trying to reduce the degree to which it

495
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,440
surprises itself the brain is higher

496
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,559
levels well all right you've got a level

497
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,080
of the brain the level is meant to be

498
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,440
taken as an abstraction not an

499
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
anatomical region there's a level of the

500
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,480
brain that is you know doing the

501
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,160
sensory motor interaction with the world

502
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,080
and the idea is this is a loop it's not

503
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,400
input output it's a continuous loop

504
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,960
where sensation perception is modifying

505
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,039
action and action is modifying uh

506
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,880
perception

507
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,640
and so there's a there's a level of the

508
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
brain that is just registering that as

509
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,559
patterns of activity in that causal

510
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,520
interaction and then layers above it try

511
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,360
to predict

512
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,039
how that pattern is going to unfold and

513
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,600
when there's error the error is fed back

514
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,919
into that layer and it is corrected to

515
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,200
try and make a better prediction and

516
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,559
then what you do is you do this

517
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,799
massively recursively you have layers

518
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,720
predicting the layers below them so on

519
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,440
and you propagate error up and you

520
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,080
propagate prediction down and what that

521
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,960
does is it um

522
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,799
it allows you to slowly slowly hone in

523
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,880
on the causal structure of the world and

524
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,640
it doesn't promise to get you the

525
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,480
perfect causal structure of the world or

526
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,120
any cartesian thing like that

527
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,840
but

528
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,679
what's really interesting and one of the

529
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,600
things we talked about is you know you

530
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,360
also have that recursive sort of

531
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,160
stacking of layers of prediction in

532
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,559
various models of deep learning and deep

533
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,640
learning also does right it was one of

534
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,840
the inspirations for relevance

535
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,679
realization theory it does the variation

536
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,919
and selection you know in the in things

537
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,000
like the wake sleep algorithm right and

538
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,360
we thought hey there's a lot of things

539
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,799
converging here

540
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,320
and then you know

541
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,200
we

542
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,880
started examining this and with other

543
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
people like clark you know and we were

544
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,799
going through it he says well you know

545
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,679
what

546
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,400
uh

547
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,240
what do you predict you can't there's

548
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,919
there's a combinatorial explosive number

549
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,280
of patterns you could predict in the

550
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,320
environment

551
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,480
well then you you know you you predict

552
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,000
the important ones or the relevant ones

553
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,080
or oops that's going to be problematic

554
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,360
and then they try to you predict the

555
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,240
reliable ones now that's not good yet

556
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,120
enough

557
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,559
and then you had the idea of precision

558
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,480
weighting in which you're you're trying

559
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,280
to prioritize uh

560
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,400
which patterns are given processing

561
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,679
which is

562
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,679
basically a model and many people

563
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,280
explicitly claim this in the predictive

564
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,000
processing uh framework of attention

565
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,480
that's what attention is attention is

566
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,360
psychologically a prioritization process

567
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,520
that's doing the precision waiting that

568
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,840
make that helps the

569
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,640
um

570
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,360
the predictive processing avoid

571
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,919
uh a combinatorial explosion

572
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,520
you can see the convergence coming in

573
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,039
here uh but then you know and

574
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,240
fairly recently i think it was 2017 2018

575
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,080
clark was talking about this and he said

576
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,159
well precision waving als ultimately

577
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,960
comes down to task relevance and we and

578
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,600
you know and it was like oh no right

579
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,559
that's just homuncular uh we we need a

580
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,400
little man in there just that's relevant

581
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,880
that's not relevant um and that can't be

582
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,280
it and then what you see is

583
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,960
uh predict the predictive processing

584
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,720
framework is moving to trying to come up

585
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,640
with sort of uh dynamical

586
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,039
self-correcting

587
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,840
way in which the trade-off relationships

588
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,280
in the environment

589
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,240
are being used in order to help

590
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,799
trade-off relationships sorry in the way

591
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,200
the organism is trying to

592
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,360
survive in its environment that's more

593
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,640
accurate

594
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,039
um can be made use of in an opponent

595
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,000
processing fashion to help right get a

596
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,679
non-homuncular account of the precision

597
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,000
weighting and we saw the two theories as

598
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
ja oh wow they're converging they're

599
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,480
coming right together and then it looks

600
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,400
like they could actually help each other

601
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,799
the relevance realization can help you

602
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,880
know explicate what these trade-offs are

603
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,880
like and the kind of opponent processing

604
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,720
make and i do mean explicate i think

605
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,640
this is already implicit in the most

606
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,200
cutting edge work within precision

607
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,760
weighting and predictive processing uh

608
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,679
and and the predictive processing i

609
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,919
sometimes like to use this analogy and

610
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,000
don't push it too far but i think the

611
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,520
predictive processing is basically

612
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,360
giving us the mendelian genetics of

613
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,280
intelligence

614
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,200
and relevance realization is giving us

615
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,600
the darwinian evolutionary theory and

616
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,000
they need each other very deeply and

617
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,440
there's a lot of things that the

618
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,080
relevance realization theory can give to

619
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,440
the predictive processing that it

620
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,600
doesn't do

621
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,400
as directly on its own

622
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,000
these are things like

623
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,720
helping to explain connections to

624
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,640
a lot of phenomenological features

625
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,120
salience

626
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,720
increase the uh

627
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,840
um

628
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,679
the linkage to theories of consciousness

629
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,919
i can go into all of this in detail and

630
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:48,640
so

631
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,440
um the two theories just came together

632
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,039
and they really strongly support each

633
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,159
other i think a very strong advantage

634
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,760
which is coming out now

635
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,280
and this is something

636
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
we're just starting to work on so i

637
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,039
don't have too much to say that i'm very

638
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,360
confident about but i i'm confident in

639
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,880
the intuition that i will have something

640
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,880
to say which is

641
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,679
that

642
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,799
you know there's been a very strong

643
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,559
critique of the predictive processing

644
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,200
framework coming out of somebody who i

645
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,600
hold in very high regard evan thompson

646
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,799
um and

647
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,400
and it's complex

648
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,960
and there's an ongoing debate i do think

649
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,559
that um

650
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,600
evan's

651
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,080
main point if i can boil down a very

652
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,159
complex argument i hope evan will

653
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,480
forgive me because i'm just trying to

654
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
make sort of a promise here but make it

655
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,640
a plausible promise

656
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,559
um is that um the predictive processing

657
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,559
can be sort of refuted with you know

658
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,559
easy counter examples of you know

659
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,120
pendulum clocks in training on a mantle

660
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,799
piece and all kinds of so you get you

661
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,720
get panned psychists from all over the

662
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,799
place uh if predictive pro of these

663
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,720
predictive processes are supposed to be

664
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,480
the model of the cognitive i've heard

665
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,320
some predictive processing people just

666
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,919
bite that bullet uh but for me uh

667
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,039
that seems implausible i think the

668
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,880
answer

669
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,720
which is

670
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,799
almost

671
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,279
forefronted in some ways in evan's point

672
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,080
is that predictive processing is not

673
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,720
really as 4e as it claims to be it's not

674
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,960
properly embodied embedded and active

675
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,679
and extended

676
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,520
now i think

677
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,799
the way

678
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,360
out of that is by

679
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,080
the connection the integration with

680
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,360
relevance realization theory because

681
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,159
relevance realization theory

682
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,600
rounds out in the bioeconomy of an

683
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,880
organism

684
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,159
and it grounds out in

685
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,360
the fact

686
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,880
that relevance is always relevant to

687
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,520
a system that is auto-poetic

688
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,039
montague put it very well we're

689
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,480
different from computers in that they

690
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,159
don't care about the information they

691
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,120
process

692
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,600
we care about the information we process

693
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,120
and i propose to you we care about the

694
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,559
information we process because we are

695
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,799
fundamentally taking care of ourselves

696
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,440
we are autopoetic beings and

697
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,360
the theory of relevance realization

698
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,880
ultimately grounds out it says that

699
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,120
relevance is deeper than representation

700
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
it's deeper than inference it's deeper

701
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,559
than logic it's actually running off the

702
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,559
bioeconomics of the organism and it is

703
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,880
working in terms of the autopoiesis and

704
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,080
so i think if predictive processing is

705
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,000
integrated with relevance realization it

706
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,400
gets very clearly and explicitly and

707
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,000
deeply integrated with involved

708
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,679
continue

709
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,799
with embodiment and embeddedness

710
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,279
and that would address i think many of

711
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,360
the criticisms that are

712
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,240
emerging from from evan thompson's uh

713
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,279
critique uh so that's that's a a

714
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,360
so not only is there increased

715
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,600
explanatory power outward in terms of

716
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,120
explaining fundamental phenomena there's

717
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,080
ex

718
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,919
there's increased explanatory power in

719
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,480
responding to deep criticism so that's

720
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,440
sort of

721
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,320
where we're at right now

722
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,159
amazing many ways to go here and many

723
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,080
great questions in live chat that i know

724
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,640
we'll be able to get to

725
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,840
one

726
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,120
footnote that we'll come to as well is

727
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,080
connecting so many of the terms that

728
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,159
we're using here

729
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,480
which are being used in a technical

730
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,159
sense

731
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,159
scientific or even formal and

732
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,960
mathematical to their everyday uses

733
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,480
ranging from

734
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,960
attention and relevance to all these

735
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,279
different notions of prediction

736
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,720
explanation

737
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,400
design control

738
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,120
and so forth so connecting these natural

739
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,200
language terms to the way that they're

740
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,440
used in cognitive sciences is a very

741
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,360
rich area

742
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,799
for the predictive processing

743
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,640
architecture itself

744
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,360
you absolutely conveyed it which is it

745
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,880
is building from bayesian formalisms

746
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,640
around inference

747
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,799
and uses a

748
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,240
vertical nested model

749
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,799
spatial metaphor it's not actually like

750
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,279
a skyscraper or anything like that where

751
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,679
higher levels are making ongoing

752
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,159
predictions and lower levels are said to

753
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,559
be feeding upwards

754
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,039
observations and initially or at the

755
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,760
most peripheral aspects of the agents we

756
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,480
have what are most sensory-like

757
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,120
observations but those can become

758
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,080
processed in a predictive framework

759
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,880
step-by-step for example edge detection

760
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,559
and vision object recognition and so on

761
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,679
um

762
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,200
and then

763
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,600
very interesting how um

764
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,080
even at the very beginning

765
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,799
asking how this came about

766
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,240
you spoke to the way that brett and mark

767
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,120
became involved in this ongoing line of

768
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,640
research which i think speaks to the

769
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,520
social inaction of research and the

770
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,919
distributed cognitive elements

771
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,880
of development of theory and practice

772
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,760
and then to bring to the very end

773
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,559
that the relevance is agentic and

774
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,000
situational

775
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,799
and that's kind of like the strange loop

776
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,720
or like the quasi-tautology like fitness

777
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,039
in an evolutionary setting is

778
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,480
situational

779
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,600
and it is both the most mysterious

780
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,320
and explanatory phenomena and it's the

781
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,159
most circular

782
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,840
phenomena and so relevance as well is so

783
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,080
hyper situational

784
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,880
that

785
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,520
it can seem like it's going to evade

786
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,360
generalization

787
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,760
yet by combining computational

788
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,039
architectures which are inspired by both

789
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,600
advances in modern machine learning and

790
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,360
artificial intelligence

791
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,000
and deeper investigations of natural

792
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,120
intelligences of diverse kinds ranging

793
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,000
from ecological psychology and all these

794
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,600
other fields

795
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,159
that is what you pointed to in the title

796
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,919
conversion solutions

797
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,600
to the frame problem

798
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,360
and um

799
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,440
so anything else to add on predictive

800
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,840
processing relevance realization or

801
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,520
their edge before we add more in

802
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,240
yeah i mean there's an important point

803
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,360
um

804
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,159
which is important to both brett and

805
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,080
mark as well as myself

806
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,640
um i i i wanted to first of all try to

807
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,799
lay out what you might call the the

808
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,720
scientific provenance of what we're

809
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,640
talking about here but now i want to

810
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,679
also talk about a a domain in which it

811
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,799
offers

812
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,799
um

813
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,000
a significant promise

814
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,440
i won't go over the argument here i've

815
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,679
done it in all multiple places both uh

816
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,360
many different video series i won't even

817
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,679
name them that the point is

818
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,000
in talks i've given at conferences the

819
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,159
relevance realization machinery

820
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,159
i think you can make a very plausibly

821
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,000
strong case because

822
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,600
relevance realization is not cold

823
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,760
calculation it's about caring it's about

824
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,200
what grabs your attention it's about

825
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,360
what calibrates your arousal it's about

826
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,039
what binds you adaptively to the

827
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,480
environment this is about the

828
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,679
fundamental agent arena fittedness that

829
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,640
makes you a cognitive agent it generates

830
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,360
the primary affordances that are brought

831
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,200
into your cognition through salience etc

832
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,720
what i'm trying to get at is this is

833
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,360
like a a primordial connectedness that

834
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,840
is constitutive of your agency and i

835
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,640
think

836
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
relevance realization and that kind of

837
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,720
connectedness and constitution of your

838
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,679
agency is very much

839
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,159
what people are seeking

840
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,159
when they're seeking this domain general

841
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,039
feature of meaning in life

842
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,039
it's a kind of connectedness the

843
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,360
language that is used is mattering being

844
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,640
connected

845
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,240
um

846
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,159
they're having a fit between you and the

847
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,960
world that you make a difference right

848
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,200
all of this language which is almost

849
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,880
always metaphorical that in fact using

850
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,880
the word meaning is a metaphor we're

851
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,640
taking something from propositions we're

852
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,039
trying to talk about our relatedness uh

853
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,640
to the environment

854
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,000
and i think

855
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,279
um

856
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,120
the relevance realization

857
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,240
stop

858
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,159
relevance realization

859
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,240
when it is giving you what marlo ponti

860
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,960
would call an optimal grip and a met or

861
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,880
in fact a meta optimal grip on the

862
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,159
environment is actually affording that

863
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,559
uh meaning in life

864
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,000
that's one point i want to make another

865
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,960
point that i'm going to bring the two

866
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,039
points together so a bit of patience

867
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,960
if you take a look at how relevance

868
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,880
realization works and this is one of the

869
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,960
advantages so i've done a lot of work in

870
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,720
sort of insight and self-deception that

871
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,120
have not been gone into as much in

872
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,360
predictive processing

873
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
you know because everybody's doing what

874
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,480
has

875
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,399
attracted their interest and what they

876
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,159
find relevant to point of phrase um

877
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,159
but what what i would say to you is the

878
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,559
very processes that make us adaptively

879
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,960
intelligent make us perennially

880
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,039
prone to self-deceptive self-destructive

881
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,480
behavior

882
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,080
because

883
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,919
we are intelligent

884
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:22,960
by

885
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,159
by

886
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,519
ignoring so much information we always

887
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,120
run the risk that we are actually

888
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,039
ignoring the information needed to solve

889
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,159
the problem

890
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,039
and

891
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,679
you can catch this in the evolutionary

892
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,519
dynamics of relevance realization when

893
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,080
you have an aha moment

894
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,600
when you go you have an insight and you

895
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,159
realize oh i've been i've been framing

896
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,159
this we'll even sometimes use that word

897
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,840
i've been looking at this the wrong

898
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,200
wrong way and we don't mean visual

899
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,679
perception we mean right i thought she

900
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,279
was angry but it turns out she's

901
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,200
actually afraid i've completely

902
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,640
misinterpreted

903
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,919
and you know what i'm talking about

904
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,000
those insight moments and that's when

905
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,799
the system right is is actually doing

906
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,799
something like punctuated equilibrium

907
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,039
like in evolution but the point is we

908
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,200
don't always have insights

909
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,880
we have the opposite of insight which is

910
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,919
we get locked into blocked into

911
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,080
misframing situations and

912
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,840
in a self-deceptive self-destructive

913
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,360
manner we can do this individually and

914
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,320
collectively echo chambering etc and

915
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,360
therefore

916
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,480
we need

917
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,320
processes that ameliorate the

918
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,240
self-deception

919
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,320
without hamstringing

920
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,039
the adaptive relevance realization that

921
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,640
enhance insight

922
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,559
enhance that connectedness that's

923
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,360
meaning in life uh while reducing the

924
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,880
foolishness the self-deceptive

925
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,799
self-destructive behavior and i put it

926
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,880
to you that across time and across

927
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,159
cultures people have come up with

928
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,240
ecologies and practices for doing that

929
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,480
and that's what i would call wisdom it's

930
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,240
a kind of rationally self-transcending

931
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,600
rationality

932
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,559
and

933
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,200
therefore there are deep connections

934
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,440
that can be made scientifically

935
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,000
plausible and empirically testable and

936
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,440
where some of the testing is already

937
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,640
occurring

938
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,760
uh about central aspects

939
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,719
of

940
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,599
what goes into a lot of falls under the

941
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,520
name i don't like this term but we don't

942
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,879
seem to have a better term for it

943
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,679
spirituality where people are primarily

944
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,159
sort of in an often nebulous fashion

945
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,599
talking about

946
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,280
wisdom

947
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,040
insight

948
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,719
the alteration of consciousness and and

949
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,918
and somehow

950
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,918
but if you think about it

951
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,679
a wise person is a person that can go

952
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,359
into a very messy complex situation

953
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,320
and somehow zero in on the relevant

954
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,480
information what really matters and

955
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
appropriately fit themselves to that

956
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,440
situation to make a difference to it in

957
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,399
a way

958
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,320
that

959
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,719
brings about a movement towards

960
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,520
flourishing for all parties involved

961
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,320
and so an additional thing that the

962
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,079
connection to relevance realization

963
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,839
provides that predictive processing

964
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,599
doesn't have i'm not saying it couldn't

965
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,280
have but i'm saying this just speeds it

966
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,000
up and makes it is

967
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,760
a connection to a lot of the work that

968
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,280
has been done

969
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,520
by me and others collecting relevance

970
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
realization to meaning in life altered

971
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,920
states of consciousness insight

972
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,200
flow

973
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,720
wisdom and that is a powerful way

974
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,280
to extend the explanatory

975
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,839
scope of the theory while also

976
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,720
increasing its existential and cultural

977
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,200
relevance

978
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,119
thank you very interesting there

979
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,960
i want to pick up

980
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,839
where you mentioned this may be

981
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,560
towards what people can be seeking with

982
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,079
questions around

983
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,040
life's meaning people search for meaning

984
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,760
and you use some terms there like

985
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,920
things that matter and you've brought up

986
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,839
in writing and in

987
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,839
conversation about asking people

988
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,839
questions around what matters and seeing

989
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,760
that as an entry point into further

990
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,119
investigation

991
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,839
as well as like connection and fit

992
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,560
and you also brought up from ecological

993
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,760
psychology

994
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,079
the notion of affordances capacities for

995
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,520
action and optimal grip where we need to

996
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,920
hold the sports implement

997
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,079
enough to use it but it has to be

998
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,400
flexible and adaptive and situational as

999
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,280
well

1000
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,480
and this points in our language and

1001
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,520
thought

1002
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,200
to extensive spatial and visual visual

1003
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,640
and physical

1004
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
metaphors and figures of speech we talk

1005
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,000
about sketching ideas and even tangible

1006
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,480
aspects like comprehension

1007
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,359
and um grasping ideas so we even use

1008
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,079
this kind of optimal grip language

1009
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,160
around cognitive ideas

1010
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,119
and

1011
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,960
this is being

1012
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,000
dovetailed in a new way with cognitive

1013
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,640
physics and the bayesian mechanics that

1014
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,800
will be exploring more inactive

1015
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,640
inference so i think that's extremely

1016
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,240
interesting that even the formalisms

1017
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,760
are seeing

1018
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,520
convergence

1019
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,359
and similarity

1020
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,359
in terms of the

1021
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,160
physicality of things that might seem

1022
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,280
cognitive mental abstract even spiritual

1023
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,200
and vice versa

1024
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,160
and

1025
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,640
i wanted to know where is action in this

1026
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,040
picture

1027
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,760
so

1028
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,359
i mean action for me is

1029
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,640
the

1030
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,960
um

1031
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,680
uh how do i say this without i'm trying

1032
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,598
to not say too many things all at once

1033
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,640
there's

1034
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,119
agent arena relationships set up

1035
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,640
affordances

1036
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,480
um and that's a basic level of

1037
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,079
relevance realization a level i call

1038
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,320
participatory knowing uh where the

1039
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,720
environment the the arena and the agent

1040
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,240
are co-shaping each other so that

1041
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,800
affordances open up and you don't make

1042
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,720
affordances they're not subjective

1043
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,400
they're not in you they're not

1044
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,240
features of the environment they're real

1045
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,119
relations i i say they're transactive

1046
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,720
relations that's what affordance is and

1047
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,800
we need to open up our ontology and this

1048
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,079
has been a this has been sort of a

1049
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,800
philosophical uh dimension of a lot of

1050
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,520
this like we need to we need to bring

1051
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,880
back the idea of real relations we've

1052
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,640
already been implicitly assuming them

1053
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,560
adaptivity is a

1054
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,320
is the ad is the adductivity of the

1055
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,400
great white shark in the shark no put it

1056
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
in the sahara desert it dies is it in

1057
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,560
the ocean no if i put an elephant in the

1058
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,880
ocean it drowns right so no no it's a

1059
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,960
real relationship a real relation of

1060
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,839
fittedness so we need a we need to have

1061
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,960
an ontology of real relations and so the

1062
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,320
participatory knowing um is and you

1063
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,480
remember this is something come out of

1064
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,920
philosophy because i'm not i'm trying

1065
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,599
not to do too many arguments at once you

1066
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,040
don't have to know you know in order to

1067
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,280
know because if you do that you get into

1068
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,440
infinite regress and skepticism so these

1069
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,960
are this is a kind of knowing that you

1070
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,160
don't know that you know because it

1071
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,680
makes all other kinds of knowing

1072
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,640
possible for you it's a co-shaping by

1073
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,079
the physics by the biology right even by

1074
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,280
the culture between you and the

1075
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,839
environment so that affordances open up

1076
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,240
right so agent arena affordances are

1077
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,680
there perspectival knowing is uh

1078
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,359
layers up of recursive relevance

1079
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,280
realization in which

1080
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,440
the relevance is being translated

1081
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,640
as relevance to something like working

1082
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,800
memory and that's what salience is i put

1083
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,560
it to you that salience is relevant to

1084
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,359
working memory um i do not think we

1085
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,880
should be saying that salience is a

1086
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,640
property of objects or a subjective

1087
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,520
phenomenon um

1088
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,680
that again doesn't ultimately make

1089
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,280
ontological sense

1090
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,400
um

1091
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,359
but i i'll just keep going

1092
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,599
perspectival knowing is knowing what

1093
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,560
it's like to be you here now in this

1094
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,680
state of mind in this situation and the

1095
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,119
situation is how the arena is made

1096
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,880
affordable to you

1097
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,960
and your state of mind is how you are

1098
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,680
fitted to the arena but now you are

1099
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,760
salience landscaping it you're

1100
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,560
foregrounding and backgrounding you're

1101
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,880
sizing up some things you're leaving

1102
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,680
other things not as gestalted together

1103
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,839
more penumbra right

1104
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,680
and it's dynamic and it's flowing you're

1105
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,079
always salience landscaping and the

1106
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,960
function of that salience landscaping is

1107
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,320
to select

1108
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,079
and i mean this like in an evolutionary

1109
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,280
sense to select which affordances are

1110
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,040
going to be enacted

1111
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,880
that's your perspectival knowing and

1112
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,320
what it does when it makes that

1113
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,119
selection is it also taps into your

1114
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,839
procedural knowing your sets of skills

1115
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,400
your sensory motor routines for

1116
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,079
interacting with the viru

1117
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,160
environment your procedural knowledge

1118
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,599
this is your know-how this is your

1119
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,960
knowing how

1120
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,920
to do

1121
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,960
and then

1122
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,839
only

1123
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,079
within a subset of your knowing how you

1124
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,560
know how to make certain inferences you

1125
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,000
know how to

1126
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,599
uh make certain proposals and

1127
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,520
propositions etc and that's your

1128
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,800
propositional knowing so action is going

1129
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,280
up that stack

1130
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,960
that's my proposal it's the

1131
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960
participatory knowing that it's taking

1132
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,280
up by perspectival knowing that is taken

1133
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,520
up by procedural knowing that can be

1134
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,079
reflected and extended by propositional

1135
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,400
knowing

1136
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,359
one other aspect of action which i saw

1137
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:30,960
in the

1138
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,680
tension or compromise between thinking

1139
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,200
different threads

1140
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,680
and only having one mouth

1141
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,560
is action is like the eye of the needle

1142
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,520
because the embodied entity is able to

1143
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,240
only engage in one action selection at a

1144
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,359
time with potentially serious

1145
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,400
and even fatal consequence exactly

1146
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,520
exactly

1147
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,040
that yeah

1148
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,280
that's that's important thank you

1149
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,359
and cognitive systems

1150
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,560
either as if as we model them or in

1151
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,400
their actuality can engage in

1152
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,560
all of these interesting phenomena that

1153
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,560
we've been exploring

1154
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,960
like counter factuals planning

1155
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,520
um all these different aspects that help

1156
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,400
one

1157
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,480
emulate simulate however we want to

1158
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,040
think about that but consider

1159
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,319
alternate pasts and presence which is

1160
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,470
like the

1161
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,720
[Music]

1162
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,560
perspective

1163
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,359
counterfactual and alternate futures

1164
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,720
which we must engage with to understand

1165
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,680
which sequences of actions we prefer to

1166
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,960
select

1167
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,160
and then

1168
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,920
in predictive processing the imperative

1169
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,839
becomes to

1170
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,680
among other things reduce our surprise

1171
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,440
about the world which can be an

1172
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,599
optimistic model we're reducing surprise

1173
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,079
about so it's not that we've expunged

1174
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,960
pragmatic value in fact we've balanced

1175
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,280
and as we'll explore formally soon

1176
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,160
balanced epistemic and pragmatic value

1177
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,319
through action selection

1178
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,520
by way of replacing this like monolithic

1179
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,359
reward pursuit

1180
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,319
and seeing curiosity and epistem as

1181
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,839
merely like a tributary to reward

1182
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,599
exactly and so

1183
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,280
that that's another that's that's part

1184
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,040
of what i meant with the the analogy i

1185
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,560
gave earlier about uh genetics and and

1186
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,640
and uh evolutionary theory uh because

1187
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,400
you know

1188
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,079
and we're all familiar people

1189
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,160
who initially encounter this say but i

1190
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,000
don't want to reduce all surprises i

1191
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,200
want and then

1192
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,800
what the typical

1193
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,880
predictive processing is oh but you'll

1194
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,079
you'll sometimes go for uh a short-term

1195
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,760
increase in surprise for long-term

1196
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,960
reduction and then what we're talking

1197
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,839
about is overall rate but the problem is

1198
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,359
you then need

1199
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,599
something that is selecting between

1200
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:52,480
different

1201
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,000
longitudinal domains are processing um

1202
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,520
because of course it's not always the

1203
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,200
case that you should prefer

1204
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,240
long term over short term right and

1205
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,240
there's right there isn't there aren't

1206
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,440
simple

1207
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
comparative algorithms for this you need

1208
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,760
dynamic trade-off relationships between

1209
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,400
short term long term between

1210
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,800
you know well i i like some short terms

1211
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,880
i don't want all my short term surprises

1212
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,520
to go away because if if that was to go

1213
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,480
away then i you know that would impact

1214
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,960
greatly on my long-term learning because

1215
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,440
i get locked in local minima and and

1216
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,800
that's not the only explanation for

1217
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,480
curiosity but that's that's one kind of

1218
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,800
explanation you give and you go yeah

1219
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,040
right but you know that means you can't

1220
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,800
use a simple hill climbing you got to do

1221
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,720
other things what are you doing and you

1222
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,920
know there's you know there's people

1223
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,000
there's people like brett and i who

1224
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,680
think that you know there's there's

1225
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,880
things happening in the brain like

1226
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,119
self-organizing criticality at multiple

1227
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,800
levels of firing

1228
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,560
small world network organization of

1229
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,640
multiple worlds multiple levels of

1230
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,359
wiring that are trying to

1231
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,760
constantly dynamically optimize these

1232
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,480
trade-off relationships and chris honey

1233
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,760
has talked about the fact that you can

1234
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,480
see the brain processing at multiple

1235
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,560
levels he actually argues and i don't

1236
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,240
know i don't know if i completely agree

1237
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,319
with this but you know he argues and i

1238
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,640
knew chris was at ufc for a while

1239
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,000
he argues that there actually isn't

1240
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,319
memory there's just different speeds

1241
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,160
longitudinal rates at which information

1242
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,119
is being processed uh which is a really

1243
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,160
cool idea um and

1244
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,839
so again what this does is soon as you

1245
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:30,839
start

1246
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,880
to make

1247
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,599
those completely legitimate moves on

1248
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,359
behalf of predictive processing

1249
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,880
explaining things

1250
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,960
like curiosity

1251
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,920
like

1252
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,079
insight like wonder because wonder and

1253
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,319
curiosity aren't the same curiosity is

1254
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,160
there's something missing

1255
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,119
and you

1256
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,800
a piece of information and you go

1257
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,319
looking to fill it in and get rid of

1258
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,800
your ignorance wondering as it was

1259
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,680
when you call yourself and your world

1260
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,000
into question in order to set yourself

1261
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,480
onto a developmental pathway

1262
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,880
it's an aspirational uh project and so

1263
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,599
predictive processing when it opens up

1264
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,800
its theoretical language in order to

1265
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,680
address these you can see how it starts

1266
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,480
to lean more and more into the kind of

1267
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,520
language that is afforded by recursive

1268
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,880
relevance realization theory

1269
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,480
great one

1270
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,000
closing note um before we move to active

1271
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,040
inference

1272
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,599
is this question of

1273
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,240
does the fact that these models are

1274
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,240
reducing or bounding surprise mean i

1275
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,000
can't have any surprise

1276
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,079
and the nest there's as you pointed out

1277
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,079
there's various ways to approach or

1278
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,520
balance that

1279
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,040
um critique

1280
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,880
for example considering the long term or

1281
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,800
the rate of surprise

1282
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,040
and one of the most powerful responses

1283
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,680
is nested modeling which could be like

1284
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,560
the self-belief i expect and prefer to

1285
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,160
hear from diverse and novel perspectives

1286
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,200
then yes one will be surprised in a

1287
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,760
little sense you know lowercase surprise

1288
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,520
by every phoneme

1289
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,560
but then in a deeper sense who we are

1290
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,960
we can be connected with by hearing new

1291
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,280
information so it's um

1292
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,680
absolutely a valid critique of the

1293
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,880
kernel of a single layer surprise

1294
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,800
minimizer just like you would have

1295
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,040
various trivial critiques of single

1296
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,839
layer reward maximizers however

1297
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,240
especially with nested architectures and

1298
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,000
considering embodiness we can see how um

1299
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,560
higher level beliefs about the self

1300
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,480
which can include like the rhetorical

1301
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,800
and the narrative absolutely provide a

1302
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,000
context by which lower level surprises

1303
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,119
are

1304
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,880
accommodated if not surfed on top of

1305
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,520
just one thing i i think we can make we

1306
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,000
can even make some significant progress

1307
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,520
and i did this in a series with greg

1308
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,280
enriquez and christopher master pietro

1309
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,040
the elusive eye sort of integrating

1310
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,560
predictive processing and relevance

1311
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,520
realization models uh to give an account

1312
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,760
of the self you take you know the all

1313
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,839
the accumulating evidence that self

1314
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,359
reference which is really just self

1315
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,520
relevance is the glue of cognition and

1316
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,680
perception relevance realization and

1317
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,839
then you you can basically integrate

1318
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,560
that with uh howie and other peoples i

1319
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,319
think it's howie and michael their uh

1320
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,520
idea of a predictive processing model uh

1321
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,480
of the self um and and then they just

1322
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,079
go together very nicely and then you can

1323
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,400
talk about well there's relevance

1324
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,760
realization to the self and this is not

1325
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,400
just a homuncular thing and you can also

1326
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,720
point out the fact that cells are

1327
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,240
because we're mammalian primates and

1328
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,319
this is greg's point is we learn to turn

1329
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,960
the arrow relevance the other way we we

1330
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,280
are not just for our whole development

1331
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,440
how are things relevant for me

1332
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,160
we also develop how am i relevant to

1333
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,960
others and to the world and even to my

1334
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,160
culture

1335
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,400
and that again starts to connect up with

1336
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,040
meaning in life how am i connected to

1337
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,520
something bigger than myself this is the

1338
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,520
metaphor that people use see what i mean

1339
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,079
there's just so many things that can be

1340
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,720
brought into a convergent and powerful

1341
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,359
conversation once we get this

1342
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,880
integration going i'm not saying it's

1343
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,440
complete but i'm i i'm trying to at

1344
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,400
least make it plausible that it is it

1345
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,440
has

1346
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,200
plausible promise to extend the scope

1347
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,599
and power of our scientific explanation

1348
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,240
into domains that it has hitherto been

1349
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,599
blocked from getting at

1350
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:36,800
that's heavy

1351
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,920
that's

1352
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,160
a massive cognitive

1353
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,480
entity that's groovy we're in the path

1354
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,040
of least action together let us move to

1355
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,319
active inference

1356
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,599
so right

1357
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:48,960
in the paper

1358
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,520
you mentioned active inference one time

1359
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,440
though i think we can see it uh

1360
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,520
interwoven densely

1361
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,920
and the quotation in the paper was

1362
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,040
pointing to sajid at all 2020s paper it

1363
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,040
has recently been argued that active

1364
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,599
inference and free energy minimization

1365
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,079
necessarily entail the minimization of

1366
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,800
redundancy and the maximization of

1367
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,800
degeneracy

1368
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,160
redundancy and maximization just to give

1369
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,079
another example are drawn directly from

1370
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,400
cutting-edge biology i keep wanting to

1371
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,800
show again and again that this is not a

1372
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,359
trivial claim of autopoiesis and

1373
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,839
embodiment we are making use of

1374
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,720
fundamental biological principles

1375
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,440
uh this is again to give a basis for a

1376
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,480
reply to evan's i think

1377
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,160
everything that evan does is brilliant

1378
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,319
right and so this is but this is a again

1379
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,119
i just i just i i'm sorry i take i have

1380
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,880
a deep respect for his critique and i

1381
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,119
just want to keep pointing out here's a

1382
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,839
possible response

1383
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:52,800
great

1384
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,640
so we have a few um

1385
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,599
images and pieces of information about

1386
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,599
active inference which we will uncover

1387
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,119
through action we will reduce our

1388
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,960
surprise about what is under the gray

1389
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,680
box through action but first just wanted

1390
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,400
to hear your perspective what is active

1391
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,359
inference

1392
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,680
how did it come into play and when and

1393
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,839
what was it doing in your recent paper

1394
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,559
so um

1395
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,119
for me and i know there's variation on

1396
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,040
this between people i see active

1397
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,160
inference within the predictive

1398
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,480
processing framework because i see

1399
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,119
the idea of the interplay between active

1400
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,000
inference and perception and and that

1401
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,040
uh first of all um

1402
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,040
mark and brett and many of the people

1403
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,319
that we cite

1404
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,920
are not

1405
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,880
bound to a strict

1406
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,280
propositional logical or sorry the

1407
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,200
logical manipulation of propositions

1408
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,680
when they use the word inference

1409
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,200
if they would do that

1410
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,440
then evan really does have a purchase

1411
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,119
point because then they are being

1412
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,160
they're being locked at the

1413
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,240
propositional level of processing

1414
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,839
they're they're not tapping into all the

1415
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:05,280
non-propositional um you know in in a

1416
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,160
deep way uh but mark for example very

1417
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,880
much inactive in body he says we just

1418
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,800
use imprints because that's was the

1419
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,359
original term and it's just stayed as a

1420
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:18,880
as a way of talking

1421
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,800
so the way i think about it is like this

1422
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,400
you have two ways of dealing with the

1423
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,640
error you can change your model or you

1424
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,920
can change the world

1425
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,359
um and changing your model is broadly

1426
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,839
perception i just want to stop here and

1427
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,119
open that up

1428
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,119
when we say perception we don't mean

1429
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,960
what the empiricist gave us with the

1430
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,760
sense of perception we don't mean just a

1431
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,800
purely receptive bottom up taking in of

1432
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,160
information

1433
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,280
because we also mean prediction

1434
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,720
right and so in a very real sense when

1435
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,960
i'm looking around this room

1436
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,920
i'm not detecting most of what i'm

1437
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,839
seeing i'm predicting it now that

1438
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,480
doesn't mean it's an illusion

1439
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,960
true predictions are true if you don't

1440
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,240
believe that you know you don't believe

1441
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,680
in science

1442
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,880
like you have to give up this sort of

1443
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,119
empiricist thing that unless i touched

1444
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,480
it somehow in detection it's not true

1445
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,040
no true predictions are true they are

1446
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,839
real relations they are true to the

1447
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,640
world right in an important way

1448
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,680
so

1449
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,960
i would put it to you that to get closer

1450
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,200
to what is meant by perception we have

1451
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,280
to take two terms that were separated in

1452
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,839
empiricism and then put a weird

1453
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,280
relationship through the enlightenment

1454
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,319
we have to actually integrate

1455
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,400
imagination and perception together you

1456
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,800
are constantly imagine perceiving and

1457
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,599
percepto imagining your environment but

1458
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,599
that doesn't mean it's an illusion so

1459
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,480
first of all that uh point

1460
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,000
right

1461
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,800
and that opens so much up for explaining

1462
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,720
the the the imagination and

1463
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,440
distinguishing imaginary from imaginal

1464
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,440
and all kinds of important and powerful

1465
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,400
things

1466
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,520
the other thing you can do is you can

1467
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,880
change the world

1468
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,720
right and what and i take it that

1469
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,800
active inference is a generic term for

1470
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,520
many different species of how

1471
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,720
we can

1472
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,520
change the world uh we can change the

1473
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,359
world by

1474
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,200
simply and we're constantly doing this

1475
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,960
by the way um

1476
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,599
we can just slightly alter our

1477
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,599
perspective again the perspectival

1478
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,359
knowing and you're you know you're

1479
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:30,559
constantly doing this you're constantly

1480
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,800
just shifting your attention around so

1481
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,200
the world is disclosing itself to you in

1482
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,280
new ways and you right and you say well

1483
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,559
that's just a new way of seeing it's not

1484
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,160
just a new way of seeing

1485
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,440
you are disclo you are look

1486
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,880
you can't

1487
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,480
ever see

1488
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,240
all of one object you only see

1489
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,160
an aspect of it no matter what you're

1490
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,480
doing yet you think you're seeing the

1491
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,680
whole thing

1492
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,160
because what you're doing with this

1493
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,960
active inference is you are tracking and

1494
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,440
i really want to play on that sensory

1495
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,440
motor metaphor you are tracking the

1496
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,119
through line between all of these

1497
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,520
aspects for me that's one of the

1498
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,240
fundamental things that active inference

1499
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,040
means it means that i am

1500
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,040
look look at how i'm doing and but

1501
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,079
notice how actually you unsuper how

1502
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,559
unsurprised you are as i do this

1503
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,760
that

1504
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,880
is so

1505
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,960
right active entrance is not just i make

1506
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,520
stuff in the world it is that too you

1507
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,599
know i get the water and i drink it and

1508
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,480
so now i'm no longer thirsty but

1509
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,680
it's even in the it's even in how you

1510
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,720
are tracking which is an action a

1511
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,200
sensory motor action how you are

1512
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,599
tracking the through line in the multi

1513
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,160
aspectuality of anything in the world

1514
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,000
because the amount of information that

1515
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,839
any object can present to you is

1516
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,119
actually combinatorially explosive

1517
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,240
for me

1518
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,240
right and again i'm not denying the

1519
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,200
gross motor changes in the world of

1520
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,079
active inference but i'm most interested

1521
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,480
in this cognitive navigation of the

1522
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,520
multi-aspectuality and multiple

1523
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,960
perspectives

1524
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,520
of the world such that we find the

1525
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,040
through line and here's the thing that's

1526
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,799
really intriguing daniel the through

1527
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,599
line is not itself an aspect it's not

1528
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,240
itself a perspective it is something

1529
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,000
that runs through them and ties them

1530
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,559
together and that is the track i propose

1531
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,720
to you of active inference at its most

1532
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,680
primordial level

1533
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:37,520
excellent i think that golden thread

1534
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,880
is how

1535
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,599
the broader system changes through time

1536
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:42,640
which

1537
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,880
we model action as influencing how

1538
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,240
things change through time and the

1539
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,280
causal structure of the world um but to

1540
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,880
pull a step back

1541
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,240
you pointed towards the two ways that a

1542
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,359
given agent can reduce the free energy

1543
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,200
of their generative model

1544
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,000
so this is not gibbs free energy this

1545
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,160
isn't the thermochemical free energy

1546
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,960
that causes combustion this isn't tesla

1547
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,200
tech free energy though i eagerly await

1548
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,599
the day when that synthesis is made this

1549
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,319
is an information theoretic quantity

1550
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:16,880
that bears resemblance to the free

1551
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,160
energy

1552
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,319
calculations used in chemistry and

1553
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,559
physics and other areas and we call that

1554
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,720
bayesian mechanics and the process

1555
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,960
theory by which it occurs being active

1556
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,839
inference and so you point into two ways

1557
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:32,240
in which a given agent can

1558
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,319
reduce the free energy which bounds the

1559
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,200
surprisal with a tractable heuristic of

1560
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,720
their generative model

1561
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,680
and those are to change the model so

1562
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,040
change one's self and that can subsume

1563
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,640
an entire taxonomy of cognitive types

1564
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,240
and parameters

1565
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,079
as modeled they don't have to be

1566
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,960
specific neural anatomical region

1567
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,000
and those

1568
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,680
parameters that can be changing to

1569
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,000
reduce free energy of a generative model

1570
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,200
can include the continuum of perception

1571
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,680
learning as well as expectation

1572
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,799
preferences and also models of action

1573
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,200
and the other way in which a given

1574
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,400
entity can bound their free energy

1575
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,480
and seek to reduce it is through taking

1576
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,480
action in the world and so active

1577
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,559
inference is built around the action

1578
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:24,400
perception loop and it gives two meta

1579
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,760
affordances

1580
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,559
for

1581
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,799
reducing the free energy

1582
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,280
by way of minimizing surprise so i'm

1583
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,680
going to go one more level into detail

1584
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,640
with the active inference by revealing

1585
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,960
the first gray box

1586
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,359
so this is an image from

1587
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:43,280
a recent paper this year by chris

1588
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,119
thornton called an informal

1589
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,880
reconstruction of the free energy

1590
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,799
framework examining the conceptual

1591
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,880
problems that arise

1592
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,599
and the red text is a additional

1593
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,000
annotation that we've added into this

1594
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,920
excellent summary figure

1595
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,520
and we can

1596
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,040
read this figure

1597
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,359
as being a uh perhaps a kairos based

1598
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:07,119
historiography it's not a literal

1599
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:09,760
chronology of history but we can see it

1600
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,680
as part of the dialectic of research

1601
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,760
progression and it begins with the

1602
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,480
necessity of learning and developing

1603
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,640
which leads one to adopt a bayesian

1604
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,720
inferential scheme my personal

1605
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,960
preference is that last names don't stay

1606
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,119
attached to terms but bayesian inference

1607
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,599
broadly just means models that update as

1608
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,920
opposed to for example descriptive

1609
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,640
frequentist statistics right the

1610
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,799
necessity of heuristics for bayesian

1611
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,839
inference comes very early because exact

1612
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:41,280
base is very hard to compute especially

1613
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,799
on large or unknown state spaces

1614
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:46,880
the necessity of heuristics takes a

1615
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,440
further developmental stage

1616
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,839
by the necessity of proxies that bound

1617
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:56,079
the exact bayesian or even a heuristic

1618
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,559
or approximate bayesian solution and so

1619
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,400
we can consider that like uncertainty

1620
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,760
reduction

1621
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,720
and then

1622
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,000
this is all pre-fristen at all

1623
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,920
um here dion

1624
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,079
with the bayesian brain work and also

1625
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,000
the work of hinton and others

1626
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
in level four where we see the free

1627
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,599
energy minimization

1628
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,680
free energy minimization

1629
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,119
is a computational heuristic

1630
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,319
that is already widely in use going back

1631
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,559
to feynman and before

1632
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,400
to uh

1633
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,559
bound uncertainty

1634
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,319
with a attractable

1635
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,160
computational approach

1636
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,880
that includes reducing uncertainty and

1637
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,720
kind of being on this pareto optimal

1638
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,359
frontier of uh

1639
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,680
not collapsing uncertainty too much or

1640
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,799
too little

1641
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,400
and in a way that's kind of like the

1642
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,640
energy and the enthalpy term in the

1643
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,400
gibbs free energy world

1644
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,480
except we're in an informational world

1645
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,520
now so that's where we were at before

1646
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,480
the

1647
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,359
recent work um in the last say 10 to 20

1648
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:00,240
years

1649
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,839
of especially carl fristen and

1650
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:03,280
collaborators

1651
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,000
and what thornton points to as some of

1652
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,400
the key contributions that were made

1653
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,880
was this particularly

1654
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,040
agentic interpretation

1655
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,000
of the lower four levels

1656
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,160
by suggesting that the figure could be

1657
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,079
separated from the grounds that the

1658
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:22,400
generative model could be separated or

1659
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,200
partitioned from the generative process

1660
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,799
which is the niche

1661
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:28,079
and that

1662
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,880
entails a process theory which we call

1663
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,319
active inference

1664
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:35,280
which is suggesting a synthesis of

1665
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,119
inference broadly considered as you

1666
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,760
pointed to and action

1667
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,720
and

1668
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,880
finding all the contact points and the

1669
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,720
ways that inference and action come

1670
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,799
together just as the term active

1671
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:49,280
inference would suggest which means like

1672
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,760
action is used to improve inference you

1673
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,040
turn over the object inference is about

1674
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,920
action it's about selecting action it's

1675
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,000
about learning the consequences of

1676
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,079
action and how conditional they are on

1677
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:03,760
world states and other hidden state

1678
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,359
inferences and so the one level seven

1679
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,440
that we can bring in which in the active

1680
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,520
inference textbook is called the high

1681
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,520
road to active inference is the

1682
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,680
necessity of persistence and quite

1683
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,160
simply objects that aren't acting at

1684
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,359
least as if they're surviving will not

1685
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:24,559
be around to be observed later so

1686
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,720
whether it's a rock or whether it's a

1687
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,799
computer or whether it's a biological

1688
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:29,760
system

1689
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,920
it must at least be acting for the time

1690
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,240
that you're observing it or modeling it

1691
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,920
as if it is surviving in a potentially

1692
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,319
very complex statistical

1693
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:41,359
niche

1694
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:43,839
and so these six levels um do an

1695
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:47,359
excellent job of describing how general

1696
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:49,440
statistical and learning frameworks like

1697
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,359
bayesian statistics

1698
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,280
can become

1699
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,280
improved and elaborated upon through

1700
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,880
computational

1701
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,559
approaches which have only been

1702
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,319
developed for example the bayesian graph

1703
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,319
approach and so on in the previous

1704
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:04,240
several decades

1705
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,880
in the agentic frame

1706
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,680
directly leads us to considerations of

1707
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,760
active inference and understanding how

1708
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,599
inference and self-modeling including

1709
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:16,079
self-modeling about action of the agents

1710
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,240
are a way that either we can either

1711
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,520
think of what

1712
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,160
agents are actually doing or at the very

1713
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,960
least we can model what agents are doing

1714
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,440
through active inference

1715
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,480
excellent

1716
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,480
i'd like to i don't know this paper uh

1717
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,240
it looks like a paper i would like to

1718
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,920
have uh so

1719
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,760
i'll i'll ask you to send me a link

1720
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,520
later

1721
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,200
awesome so then

1722
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,520
do you wanna add any more or we can go

1723
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,280
one more level

1724
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,160
i mean i i i think uh uh i don't know if

1725
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,160
what i'm proposing isn't a a is an

1726
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,319
additional level maybe it is or maybe

1727
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:53,280
it's a way of adding a dimension to the

1728
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,240
highest level uh or dimensions to all of

1729
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,359
the at least maybe level seven six and

1730
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:02,640
five uh relevance realization um and

1731
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,160
then again we we

1732
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,839
uh relevance realization predictive

1733
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,559
processing have common ancestors uh jeff

1734
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:11,039
hinton who of course was at u of t uh

1735
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:12,319
and deep learning was one of the

1736
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,480
explicit things we drew upon when we

1737
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,160
were trying to talk about relevance

1738
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,720
realization and remember the title of

1739
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,799
the paper relevance realization and the

1740
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:23,039
emerging framework in cognitive science

1741
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,559
we were trying to say look there are

1742
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,799
general strategies in different areas

1743
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,960
that look remarkably similar and they

1744
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,799
seem to be strategies for dealing with

1745
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:32,559
this central problem of relevance

1746
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:34,079
realization

1747
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,960
we could see the organism's persistence

1748
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:37,880
or

1749
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,720
eco-evolutionary fitness as being like

1750
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,799
the environment as the selector of

1751
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:44,319
relevance

1752
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:46,319
and then we can think the view from the

1753
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:49,039
inside the psychological or even

1754
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:51,680
experiential aspects of relevance

1755
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,640
to be um a part of that broader system

1756
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,920
and we can imagine kind of two cases one

1757
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,359
is where the the organism's experience

1758
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,599
and cognition around relevance is

1759
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,440
aligned with ecologically selective

1760
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,559
fitness

1761
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,640
yes at which case you're going to find

1762
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,000
that entity

1763
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,240
surviving and thriving you can also

1764
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,599
imagine where relevance leads us askew

1765
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,920
and things become relevant whether it's

1766
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,839
repetitive behavior self-destructive

1767
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:22,000
behavior through information filtering

1768
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,240
all these cases in which our relevance

1769
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,760
realization

1770
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,559
is

1771
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,520
missing the mark it sins with respect to

1772
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,520
the ecological selection

1773
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,480
exactly and that's my point how

1774
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,960
the very process that makes you adaptive

1775
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,880
also makes you perennially susceptible

1776
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,039
to self-destructive self-destructive

1777
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:44,000
behavior you sin you miss the mark in a

1778
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,160
way that you can't realize you're doing

1779
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,000
and we calibrate and we learn as long as

1780
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:52,799
we

1781
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,160
are around

1782
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:54,960
right

1783
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,400
well what i meant is as long as you're

1784
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,440
remaining in your sin that it it itself

1785
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,640
encloses and the adaptivity the the

1786
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,200
ability of an adaptive system to reduce

1787
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,520
reduce perturbation means when you have

1788
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,359
these kinds of parasitic processing

1789
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:12,799
going on it hijacks that activity and

1790
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:15,440
prevents your attempts to perturb it and

1791
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,200
break and help you break out of the

1792
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,119
inappropriate framing that's why you

1793
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:21,119
need very comprehensive ecologies of

1794
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,599
practices in order to cultivate wisdom

1795
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,520
it's why simply knowing that you

1796
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,359
shouldn't do that same stupid thing you

1797
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:29,440
do in your romantic relationships is

1798
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,599
massively insufficient for not doing

1799
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,280
that same stupid thing you keep doing in

1800
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,319
your romantic relationships

1801
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,799
yes in the agentic framework

1802
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:41,440
with the ecological richness that is

1803
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,160
being brought in helps us contextualize

1804
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,400
and take a pluralistic approach towards

1805
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,400
the various kinds of interventions which

1806
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,960
might be suggested because interventions

1807
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,400
for different kinds of relevance um

1808
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,799
you know mal alignments self-perceived

1809
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:58,799
other perceived and cases where there's

1810
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,039
conflict there they could include like

1811
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,000
neurochemical it could include an action

1812
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,319
oriented there's so many different ways

1813
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:09,039
in which this nexus of the entity

1814
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:11,680
engaging in inference and action can be

1815
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,359
modified and shaped

1816
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:16,720
that um without integrative models

1817
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,520
to help us understand it can descend

1818
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,520
into kind of a disciplinary

1819
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,839
preference show-off

1820
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,839
yeah yeah with the church of the level i

1821
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:27,520
call it the church of the level of

1822
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,760
analysis you believe everybody should be

1823
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,680
working at yes

1824
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,000
great so let's look

1825
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,680
at a second

1826
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,720
aspect of active inference which is its

1827
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,160
uh formal

1828
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,359
basis

1829
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:43,839
now there are many ongoing developments

1830
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,240
in the formalisms around active

1831
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,480
inference and the free energy principle

1832
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,880
and so this is barely even the tip of

1833
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,520
the iceberg but hopefully showing these

1834
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,000
formalisms which we explore in much

1835
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,720
greater detail in many of the other uh

1836
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,640
several hundred live streams that you'll

1837
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,200
find at the active inference institute

1838
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,039
um just to show

1839
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,359
a few of the aspects of the formalism so

1840
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:09,599
people can triangulate

1841
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,240
and have a little bit of a sense for

1842
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,720
where is active inference between

1843
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,040
so this is from a paper of decosta at

1844
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,359
all from 2020 active inference on

1845
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:22,319
discrete state spaces a synthesis

1846
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:24,640
so i'll make this image as large as i

1847
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,479
can

1848
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:29,600
there's two key aspects

1849
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,600
in this figure

1850
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,120
the top

1851
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,520
which we won't go into detail in

1852
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,238
is describing two types of inference

1853
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:40,158
which are on the bottom perceptual

1854
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,719
inference which is like a best fitting

1855
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,719
estimate for perception

1856
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:46,238
given the sensory data which are

1857
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:48,640
incoming which includes the blind spot

1858
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,319
and the low resolution outside of the

1859
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:52,000
fovea and the lack of color vision

1860
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,439
outside the fovea and all these other

1861
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:56,479
attributes of our generative model

1862
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:57,839
such that we even know that we're in a

1863
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:00,000
generative model and not for example

1864
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,920
within some sort of naive signal

1865
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,040
processing uh inward only view so i see

1866
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,279
this as just absolute slam dunk for

1867
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:08,960
predictive processing architectures

1868
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,279
broadly that we don't experience the

1869
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,279
blind spot we don't see it and that's

1870
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:15,759
normal because our salience has been

1871
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,120
tuned down

1872
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,520
to blurriness in that area and so on and

1873
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,238
in the top we have expected free energy

1874
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,080
minimization which in contrast with the

1875
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,319
variational free energy minimization

1876
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,960
expected free energy is prospective it's

1877
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,920
about selecting expect amongst

1878
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,080
policies sequences of actions sequences

1879
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,719
of affordances that can be expected to

1880
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,960
result in different outcomes now the

1881
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,880
entity could be wrong and that could

1882
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,198
lead to the entity not existing but

1883
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,839
within the scope of the generative model

1884
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:47,359
expected free energy is how different

1885
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:48,640
policies

1886
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,520
about one's own world states about the

1887
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,320
markov blanket here which are the set of

1888
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:57,280
perceptual and active nodes that mediate

1889
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,840
the interface between the entity and the

1890
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,120
niche

1891
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,600
the way that those are balanced in

1892
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,679
prospective inference is summarized on

1893
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:06,800
the top

1894
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,239
and then it's quite interesting to look

1895
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:10,159
at some of these special cases on the

1896
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:12,159
bottom and so we can think about these

1897
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:14,400
as like the poles

1898
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,480
in which the big tent of active

1899
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,960
inference is propped up on

1900
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,600
these are cases where when one parameter

1901
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,400
is minimized or maximized or doesn't

1902
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,960
exist there are various special cases

1903
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,760
that arise so just to give a few

1904
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,960
examples

1905
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,000
where there is no preference

1906
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,120
we see

1907
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,840
information gain maximization

1908
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,480
that's like a pure novelty search

1909
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,840
in contrast

1910
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,360
where we have no ambiguity or risk

1911
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,840
so we have complete information

1912
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,360
then we can engage in classical utility

1913
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,159
like calculations so that's kind of like

1914
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:56,000
when we don't have to learn anything or

1915
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,679
reduce our uncertainty

1916
01:10:57,679 --> 01:10:58,640
then

1917
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,360
that's a special case in which pragmatic

1918
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,360
value alone can be pursued

1919
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,679
where pragmatic value has been taken off

1920
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,400
the table because all outcomes are equal

1921
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,920
because our preferences across them are

1922
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:10,880
flat

1923
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:11,679
then

1924
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:13,679
the inference can move into a more

1925
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,320
exploratory mode represented by like

1926
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,000
optimal surprise or information

1927
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,440
maximization

1928
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,280
and there are some deeper and more

1929
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,679
subtle links with maximum entropy

1930
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,320
principles but this is just to show a

1931
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,320
few of the kinds of formalisms that we

1932
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,640
explore in active inference which bring

1933
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,760
together many previous threads in

1934
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,080
perceptional perceptual inference as

1935
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,080
well as inference about action for

1936
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,320
example from cybernetics control theory

1937
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,880
and so on

1938
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,600
just a few notes

1939
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,480
um and then one last piece that i think

1940
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,760
will

1941
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,320
hopefully connect us to thinking about

1942
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,679
communication

1943
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:56,239
culture and then also bridge to the

1944
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:58,880
questions that i've seen stack up in the

1945
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,320
live chat

1946
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,120
so these are um from the

1947
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,760
active inference ontology which is a

1948
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,760
project at the active inference

1949
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,320
institute that we've been developing for

1950
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,120
uh well over a year now

1951
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,880
and what we have

1952
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,640
is a

1953
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,719
what started as a terms list but

1954
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:20,840
continues to develop to be much much

1955
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,320
more and we think of active inference in

1956
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:27,199
building competency and familiarity with

1957
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:29,440
learning and applying active inference

1958
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,440
in terms of quite literally skilled

1959
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,640
performance of a language the terms and

1960
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,800
how they're related constitute the

1961
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,719
active inference ontology

1962
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:40,640
and so two views

1963
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,040
that speak hopefully to the directions

1964
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,280
that this can help us pursue rigor as

1965
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,760
well as accessibility

1966
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,880
simple

1967
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,120
english definitions

1968
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,159
that link to other terms just like you'd

1969
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:56,080
see in a dictionary a dictionary doesn't

1970
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,239
really tell you what the word means it

1971
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,080
just has more words

1972
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,239
yet it still is considered a useful

1973
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,159
artifact by those who are learning and

1974
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:06,000
applying a language and so that's

1975
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,159
exactly what our

1976
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:10,960
terms and definitions provide which are

1977
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,520
natural language definitions for some of

1978
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,920
these terms which often straddle the

1979
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,120
line or confuse optimally between

1980
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,159
everyday usages and technical usages

1981
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:24,480
again surprise attention all these

1982
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,480
different terms which you might hear

1983
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,360
day to day being used informally

1984
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,199
they sometimes are used both in an

1985
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,600
informal and quite technical sense in

1986
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,239
active inference and a second aspect

1987
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:38,159
that's been a great

1988
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:41,040
direction and and really inclusive area

1989
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,480
of participation

1990
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,120
is with translating all of those terms

1991
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,520
into different natural languages

1992
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,800
so here we see english as well as um

1993
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,120
equal partners with spanish portuguese

1994
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,560
french italian

1995
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,280
russian hebrew persian and hopefully

1996
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,280
many more to come

1997
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,320
and so by treating this linguistic

1998
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,640
artifact as a collaborative and

1999
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,800
participatory project

2000
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,880
and being able to bring in

2001
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,440
natural languages that people have as

2002
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,760
well as bring in computer languages like

2003
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,000
our nomenclature and how we name

2004
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
computer variables

2005
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,600
we aim for something like a triple play

2006
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,920
where we can connect natural language

2007
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,440
descriptions

2008
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,480
of

2009
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,400
everyday settings or of contrived

2010
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,520
settings

2011
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,199
those everyday natural language

2012
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:34,159
descriptions can be visualized and they

2013
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:36,640
can also be rendered as executable

2014
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,679
models

2015
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:40,640
because we see that as where the promise

2016
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,480
of applying active inference can be most

2017
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,600
powerful

2018
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,080
when people are engaging

2019
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:49,280
in the skills and in the ways that feel

2020
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,320
natural

2021
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,640
and meaningful to them such as in

2022
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,360
community engaging in practices

2023
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,400
and that is supported and scaffolded in

2024
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,600
feedback

2025
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,000
with computational systems that

2026
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,320
facilitate the communication

2027
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,280
and

2028
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,600
imagination around the discussion for

2029
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,520
example visualization

2030
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:14,080
and also provide in the same flow

2031
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,880
executable simulations so it's not just

2032
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,320
like there's people who are having a

2033
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,800
conversation at the chalkboard and then

2034
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,480
the modelers go take it into a different

2035
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,400
room and that's where like the alchemy

2036
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,840
happens

2037
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,360
we think that by connecting the ontology

2038
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,560
with

2039
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,080
natural terms

2040
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,400
and computational representations that

2041
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,320
there will be new ways

2042
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,560
to be developing certain kinds of

2043
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,760
cognitive

2044
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,440
models and infrastructure together

2045
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,320
so you're actually trying to afford

2046
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,719
wisdom

2047
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,080
what does that mean or what does it look

2048
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,520
like

2049
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,080
well i mean insofar as you're helping

2050
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,679
people to applaud sophia into pronesis

2051
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,040
these are the two words for wisdom and

2052
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,120
ancient greek sophia is your knowledge

2053
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,040
of first principles and phromesis is how

2054
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,080
you apply it within a particular context

2055
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,320
so that it is effective both giving you

2056
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,880
virtuosity and virtue you're trying to

2057
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,719
help people translate sophia into

2058
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:17,199
phronesis uh which is the sort of meta

2059
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:19,199
ability that is required for people to

2060
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:22,400
be genuinely wise

2061
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,520
with virtuosity and virtue

2062
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,159
i see a lot of

2063
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:31,360
what

2064
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:32,880
could be

2065
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,800
positive for

2066
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,840
research and technical areas which is

2067
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,360
it's not enough to have virtuosity alone

2068
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,600
someone could be very skilled at taking

2069
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,560
aim

2070
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,640
in a variety of different domains maybe

2071
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,800
one domain maybe across domains

2072
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,520
but without virtue

2073
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,840
then

2074
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,040
what

2075
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,480
you have skill and capacity without

2076
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,679
alignment

2077
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,760
maybe even the propositional belief that

2078
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,120
alignment doesn't exist or it's

2079
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,360
impossible it's useless or worthless or

2080
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,880
meaningless

2081
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,679
and then all that virtuosity

2082
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:10,960
to say it's for naught would be an

2083
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,159
understatement because that person

2084
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:13,760
already made that claim but it could be

2085
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,440
worse than for not

2086
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,480
and so

2087
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:17,679
yeah and i

2088
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,280
want to say the opposite is also the

2089
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,679
case virtue without virtuosity

2090
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,560
is something that undermines

2091
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,120
uh the respect that virtue is due

2092
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,880
because you have people

2093
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:32,719
sort of attempting virtue without having

2094
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:35,679
the capacity the virtuosity needed to

2095
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:39,520
genuinely empower it in the world

2096
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,840
and so that's also problematic

2097
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,600
and so you can get you can get the

2098
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,679
reduction of virtue to

2099
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:48,000
following simplistic rules

2100
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,640
or merely signaling the presence of

2101
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,480
something without having the requisite

2102
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,360
virtuosity to bring it reliably into

2103
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,360
being

2104
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:03,920
how does what you've been working on

2105
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:07,280
point towards or help us come to terms

2106
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:11,559
with wise technologies

2107
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,000
so that's

2108
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,440
i mean

2109
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,719
for me

2110
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:19,120
i try to take

2111
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,920
i mean a big part of my pr i wear three

2112
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,040
hats

2113
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,040
one is the the scientist hat which i've

2114
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,800
been mostly wearing today

2115
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,480
in our conversation

2116
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:32,239
but i also uh i also wear a hat where i

2117
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:33,760
help to

2118
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,719
develop teach curate create cultivate

2119
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:38,880
ecologies and practices

2120
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,400
as you said pluralism i wanted to

2121
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,920
strengthen the pluralism point you made

2122
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,679
but i it wasn't right for me to

2123
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:46,480
intervene at the time pluralism i mean

2124
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,800
one of the things that the framework i'm

2125
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,760
i'm proposing with brat and mark

2126
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,360
is to

2127
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,920
note that a lot of relevance realization

2128
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,600
and hence predictive processing is

2129
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,040
taking place

2130
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,560
by

2131
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,840
making use of trade-off relationships

2132
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:04,800
between

2133
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,840
different values different properties of

2134
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,679
the environment i gave you the opponent

2135
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:11,520
processing with the detention you can

2136
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,120
think of the opponent processing within

2137
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,360
the autonomic nervous system for

2138
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,280
constantly calibrating so what you do is

2139
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,199
you get a system that is two systems

2140
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:21,280
that are biased in opposite directions

2141
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,719
one is trying to interpret everything as

2142
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:24,400
threatened opportunity

2143
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,840
another one is trying to interpret

2144
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,719
everything as uh safety and uh

2145
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:31,600
recuperation and they're pulling in on

2146
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,280
each other like this constantly and

2147
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,120
that's how your level of arousal in a

2148
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,199
non-homuncular fashion is constantly

2149
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:40,400
evolving its calibration to the world so

2150
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,199
many examples of this uh right often in

2151
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,440
multiple

2152
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,800
multiple dimensions where i mean

2153
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,960
trade-off relationships that are also in

2154
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,560
trade-off relationships with each other

2155
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,400
that's why i use the metaphor of an

2156
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,719
ecology if you think of ecology as all

2157
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:57,040
these checks and balances both you know

2158
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,120
at the same level and between levels of

2159
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,480
organization

2160
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,679
ecology there is no panacea practice no

2161
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:05,360
free lunch theorem et cetera et cetera

2162
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,080
there is no panacea practice they right

2163
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,800
you need you need to get a dynamic

2164
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,880
ecology of practices

2165
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,480
that

2166
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,480
well optimizes

2167
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:17,600
for

2168
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,719
that

2169
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:21,760
multi-layered opponent processing

2170
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,960
and

2171
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:26,239
so i try to use

2172
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:28,640
my knowledge as a scientist

2173
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,320
to look for

2174
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,360
places within traditional and emerging

2175
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,840
ecologies of practices where i can see

2176
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,480
those design principles being applied

2177
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:41,679
very well or being developed very well

2178
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:45,120
and then i help to develop those

2179
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,280
cultivate them uh help build those

2180
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,560
communities

2181
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:49,920
and

2182
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,679
then

2183
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:53,760
that takes me into my third hat which i

2184
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,159
didn't ever think i'd be wearing and i'm

2185
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:58,800
wearing which is what is it to build

2186
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,960
these communities so that

2187
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:01,760
the

2188
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:04,400
wisdom of individual cognition

2189
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,560
and the wisdom of distributed cognition

2190
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,280
are

2191
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,199
optimally aligned

2192
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:12,080
so that we have the best access within a

2193
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,679
community and then build those

2194
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:15,120
communities into communities of

2195
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,640
communities

2196
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,080
that's

2197
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,760
this project that i now find i'm

2198
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,159
actually engaged in a lot

2199
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:24,239
i do not claim to have any particular

2200
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:26,080
expertise for this it's just that i have

2201
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,560
fallen into it and i seem to be the

2202
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,360
person that is undertaking it so that's

2203
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,520
why i'm sort of hesitant but i'm doing

2204
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,679
it with other people um

2205
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:37,360
and so

2206
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,280
the answer to your question is i wear

2207
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,600
these three hats and i try to integrate

2208
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,600
them so that they mutually afford and

2209
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,199
constrain each other as much as i

2210
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:48,000
possibly can

2211
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:53,280
very interesting a lot to

2212
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,440
say there

2213
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,639
uh

2214
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:59,199
there's a few ways we can go i think

2215
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:00,560
let's

2216
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,280
bring up one topic and then we'll go in

2217
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,840
the end to the uh questions so if people

2218
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,600
have any questions please feel free to

2219
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,199
add them now

2220
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:11,280
and it's a term that's one of

2221
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,360
my personal favorites which is oh i like

2222
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,000
it i like this term you introduced the i

2223
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,360
did not know this term until our

2224
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,280
previous conversation off camera where

2225
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,719
you introduced this term to me which i

2226
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:22,560
really liked

2227
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,840
it's a great term arising from work on

2228
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:30,080
insects and the uh work of haligan

2229
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,480
defines stigma g as a mechanism of

2230
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,280
indirect coordination in which the trace

2231
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:38,159
left by an action in a medium stimulates

2232
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,560
subsequent actions stigma g enables

2233
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,440
complex coordinated activity without any

2234
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,840
need for planning control communication

2235
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,800
simultaneous presence or even mutual

2236
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,480
awareness

2237
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,320
i think it's a really fascinating and

2238
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,400
provocative idea because a lot of times

2239
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,480
when we hear about

2240
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,400
collective intelligence or just

2241
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,880
collective algorithms more broadly

2242
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,760
there are examples like flocks of birds

2243
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,639
which

2244
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:07,280
absolutely swarm and flock and they use

2245
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,880
visual coordination but they don't leave

2246
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:12,400
a trace on their aerial environment or

2247
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,639
you have the examples of traffic jams or

2248
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:17,199
of swarms or mobs of people in which

2249
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:18,719
case again there's jostling there's

2250
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:20,400
contact amongst entities

2251
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,840
but a trace is not left and so those

2252
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,600
one might think of as like a live

2253
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,120
conversation

2254
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,760
where no trace is recorded and that kind

2255
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,600
of synchronous coordination is

2256
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,679
absolutely an important component to

2257
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:34,800
consider

2258
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,120
but especially when we think about at

2259
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,679
least two incredibly important cases

2260
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:42,400
which are our digital environments and

2261
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,159
the various modifications that we make

2262
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:47,520
to them and our physical ecosystems and

2263
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,199
the kinds of modifications that are made

2264
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:50,880
to these niches

2265
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,880
neither of those cases

2266
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,360
are going to even be hinted at if we

2267
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:58,080
only consider non-stigmatic collective

2268
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,159
behavior and collective wisdom

2269
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:03,280
and so um in some recent work with

2270
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,320
colleagues

2271
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,719
we've continued exploration that has

2272
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:08,719
been existing since the earliest days of

2273
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:10,719
wikipedia and before

2274
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:13,760
around digital coordination as digital

2275
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:16,000
stigmergy because although there are

2276
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,480
times for synchronous coordination

2277
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,960
for example in this conversation

2278
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,320
broadly

2279
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,960
through all kinds of modifications

2280
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,600
including this video as an artifact that

2281
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,760
could be re-watched or transcribed or

2282
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,440
analyzed in the future

2283
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:34,000
broadly communication

2284
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,960
in the online setting can be said to

2285
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,280
result in complex coordinated activity

2286
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,600
without the need for planning control

2287
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,719
etc etc so just wanted to hear your

2288
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,719
thoughts on stigma g yeah i've got three

2289
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:48,080
things i want to say about that because

2290
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:51,360
it's super cool first of all uh i i for

2291
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,239
me where stigma jury uh really called

2292
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:56,239
out for me is is

2293
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:59,280
how it affords cultural ratcheting uh a

2294
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,800
proposal that one of our primary

2295
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,639
capacities for adaptivity is cultural

2296
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,719
ratcheting which means we don't we learn

2297
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:07,600
from scratch we can't we we come in and

2298
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,760
culture has preserved previous learning

2299
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,360
and then we ratchet it up so we

2300
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,040
culturally ratchet

2301
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,360
in a very powerful way and so that gives

2302
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,840
us a kind of adaptivity that is closed

2303
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:18,800
off to

2304
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,280
most organisms there are a few species

2305
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,800
that you could plausibly say chimps

2306
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,639
bonobos

2307
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:26,080
maybe some evidence from dolphins and

2308
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,080
elephants uh where there's something

2309
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:32,320
like a culture um um but this now this

2310
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,400
is where human beings excel and stigma

2311
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,080
just seems to fit right in there

2312
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,440
powerfully

2313
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,360
and you wanna you wanna note

2314
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,400
that um what we're doing right now

2315
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,960
is so and so important because we're

2316
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,840
actually we're we're we're we are

2317
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,600
collapsing the boundary that used to be

2318
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,400
the

2319
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,840
exists between live speech and

2320
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:54,800
writing because we have all the

2321
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,239
spontaneity

2322
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:59,120
of this but then we it's preserved and

2323
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,880
it can enter into this meta dialogue

2324
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,480
with other videos where people are

2325
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:05,280
moving between the videos in dialogical

2326
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,840
fashion um until you get this layering

2327
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:08,960
effect

2328
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,560
which is also working within the

2329
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:13,120
cultural ratcheting and that is very

2330
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,560
very interesting and needs to be

2331
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,159
explored

2332
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:17,199
so

2333
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:19,520
that's cool and then uh

2334
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,800
i wanted to connect what you just said

2335
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,880
with the issue that

2336
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,800
the neuroscientists read montague talks

2337
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,760
about of mutual modeling

2338
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,280
and this is something that i think needs

2339
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,199
to be properly integrated

2340
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:35,760
into this overarching framework

2341
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,320
that's being built um i've done some

2342
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,800
work especially with respect to aspects

2343
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,880
of consciousness mutual modeling so

2344
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,480
um

2345
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,719
he talks about that you you faced a

2346
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:48,320
certain kind of problem

2347
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,360
um in communication um

2348
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,280
um and it's he calls it the it's an

2349
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,040
efficiency paradox so

2350
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,480
the idea is

2351
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,000
well one of the things i need to do to

2352
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,320
increase efficiency is to reduce acting

2353
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,880
at cross purposes so i reduce acting at

2354
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,560
cross purposes by having two or more

2355
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,239
systems talk

2356
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,880
more to each other they communicate more

2357
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,880
but another way classically of course by

2358
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,199
which i improve efficiency

2359
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:16,159
is i reduce the metabolic costs or

2360
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:19,199
whatever the cost of uh my problem

2361
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:20,239
solving

2362
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:23,120
and of course communication is very time

2363
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,960
and energy expensive

2364
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:25,920
uh

2365
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:26,960
and so

2366
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,600
he says notice how these and i'm doing

2367
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,880
this on purpose are in a trade-off

2368
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,120
relationship right the more we

2369
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,960
communicate the more we increase our

2370
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,280
costs and we lose efficiency

2371
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,360
the more we reduce communication we

2372
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,600
reduce our metabolic costs but we

2373
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,840
increase acting at cross purposes and

2374
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,679
our efficiency also goes down how do we

2375
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:47,600
solve this and then he gives the he

2376
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,280
gives a wonderful analogy before he

2377
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,040
moves to the brain and he says well

2378
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,000
consider an old married couple happily

2379
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,600
married some people stay married because

2380
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,639
they hate each other and that's the best

2381
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,159
way they can torture each other but i'm

2382
01:27:58,159 --> 01:27:59,440
talking about people who stay married

2383
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,080
because they they they are are loved

2384
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,159
they have almost like this telepathy

2385
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:05,920
with each other

2386
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,520
and he didn't quite use this language

2387
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,520
but he uses the language of modeling but

2388
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,440
i think calling it generative modeling

2389
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,080
is no imposition on him and he says his

2390
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,320
his example is straight that's too like

2391
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,000
a straight relationship i'm just going

2392
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,440
to use that for ease of reference i'm

2393
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,080
not prioritizing that or making any uh

2394
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,520
cultural claim i'm just saying it's

2395
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,960
easier to talk because i can just

2396
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,360
quickly use common language right so the

2397
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:28,480
husband

2398
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:31,360
right has a generative model of his wife

2399
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,960
and the wife has a generative model of

2400
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,120
the husband so that they can actually

2401
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:37,040
coordinate their behavior without having

2402
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,920
to talk to each other very much so

2403
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,360
that's where he leaves it now what i

2404
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:44,080
argued is kinda that's right but you

2405
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:45,760
have to cycle because periodically they

2406
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,000
have to come back together and talk to

2407
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,040
each other

2408
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,320
right to make sure their model the

2409
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,920
general models aren't getting out of

2410
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,560
whack and then they can go off and do

2411
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,560
their coordinated uncommunicating

2412
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,199
behavior and they cycle and then i said

2413
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:00,880
you can you can actually see the brain

2414
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,120
doing this it has it you do the task

2415
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,120
focused where you're processing all the

2416
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,639
world and your coordinate all these

2417
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:08,159
different areas of the brain are

2418
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:09,360
coordinated without having to

2419
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,440
communicate much on the task and then

2420
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,360
you go to default mode where what are

2421
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,639
they doing well they're all centrally

2422
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:16,000
hubbed and they're all checking in with

2423
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
each other because you just do all this

2424
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,120
sort of you know uh you know

2425
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,960
self-referential imagination making sure

2426
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,960
all the models are in sync and then you

2427
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,600
go back on the world

2428
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,360
you know sync up again go back on the

2429
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,440
world sync up again all these trade-off

2430
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,000
relationships and how you resolve

2431
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:34,800
the

2432
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,800
the paradox and then i thought you know

2433
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:39,120
mutual modeling and stigma g right like

2434
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,840
they really belong together as

2435
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,239
underlying concepts now montague's

2436
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:45,679
argument is

2437
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:47,679
you see the brain adopting this strategy

2438
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:50,080
you see the brain doing this

2439
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,960
all right where you've got areas are are

2440
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,639
engaged in generative modeling of each

2441
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,480
other and think how easily this could

2442
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,400
fit into predictive processing framework

2443
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,480
because you're more there's areas of the

2444
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,239
brain are predicting other errors but

2445
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:04,080
the idea and then you know you can point

2446
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,639
to evidence of synesthesia uh

2447
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:09,360
cross-modal enhancement of perception uh

2448
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,400
the fact that one uh supposedly

2449
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,639
specialized area like acoustics can

2450
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:16,560
actually take over sight in people that

2451
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,159
teach blind people who teach themselves

2452
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:20,400
echolocation synesthesia and a whole

2453
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,960
bunch of other things just pile up as

2454
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,639
evidence that the brain is adopting this

2455
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:26,960
strategy and so i thought

2456
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,440
this was an interesting thing because

2457
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,840
this notion in one sense points to

2458
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,560
cultural ratcheting and stigmargy and

2459
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,719
mutual modeling between people but it

2460
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:40,239
also points inward um to mutual modeling

2461
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:42,080
within the brain and i like i said i

2462
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:45,120
think this is so close already to

2463
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,120
a lot of what's going on in the

2464
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,320
framework we're talking about they're

2465
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,639
bringing this in and then again then we

2466
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:52,639
could extend the explanation to things

2467
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:55,120
like synesthesia

2468
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,440
that you can get cross-modal enhancement

2469
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,239
that you can have one area of the brain

2470
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:01,920
supposedly dedicated to one sense

2471
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:05,040
modality picking up the ability for uh

2472
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:09,280
right in rehabilitation etc etc etc

2473
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:12,320
well two two layers of marital stigma g

2474
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,719
the first would be the neuroanatomical

2475
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:18,320
stigma g by which local synaptic changes

2476
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,320
and other sort of neural architectural

2477
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:21,520
changes

2478
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,760
enable complex coordinated activity

2479
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,679
without the need for a central neuron so

2480
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:27,600
at the micro scale we have the

2481
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,960
physicality of learning

2482
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,880
there's the post-it note

2483
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,800
and there's the note on the door there's

2484
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,280
the modification of the environment

2485
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,239
which is stimulating subsequent activity

2486
01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:42,960
and it doesn't need to be the recipe for

2487
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,840
dinner it can just be a note or an

2488
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:48,560
inside joke and so when we have a model

2489
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,239
that's integrative and allows us to

2490
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:53,360
situate advanced cognitive agents

2491
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,440
in their niche

2492
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,000
then we can actually bring in those

2493
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
kinds of modifications which is the root

2494
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,400
of stigma g to mark stigma

2495
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:05,280
not in a taboo way but to mark the

2496
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:06,400
environment

2497
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,800
and the ways that that can elicit action

2498
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,400
whether it's again a post-it note on the

2499
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,360
door in the relationship or a comment on

2500
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:15,360
a video these are all ways that we can

2501
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,040
spur others to action

2502
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,840
or and so you can just when you can take

2503
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,320
the mutual modeling idea and then do

2504
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,000
george herbert mead

2505
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,159
you're right you're in a baseball you're

2506
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:27,840
on a baseball team and you don't

2507
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,840
necessarily need to form a specific

2508
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,080
model of all the other players you might

2509
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,920
want to have that a bit but you can he

2510
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,040
he said what you do is you create the

2511
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:38,400
generalized other you create a model uh

2512
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,159
right will allow you to interact with

2513
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:42,560
all of them very effectively and so

2514
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,440
right we can carry around we can like

2515
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,000
we we can have stackings we can have

2516
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,800
more specific mutual models for how i

2517
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:53,840
relate to my partner but then they are

2518
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,000
in a right dynamic recursive

2519
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,159
relationship with a generalized

2520
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:02,000
other model uh and that also is a trace

2521
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,719
of others like in the guts of our

2522
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:06,560
cognitive modeling in a very very

2523
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:08,400
powerful way

2524
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:12,000
yes multi-player rituals

2525
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,560
as cultural ratcheting

2526
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,199
enable people to be involved in

2527
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:19,600
cumulative as well as re-experienced and

2528
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:23,600
reimagined cultural praxis and

2529
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,480
if there's a level to generalize out to

2530
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,560
perhaps it is one of them that is

2531
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,400
relevant such that we can have

2532
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,719
participatory ritual

2533
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:33,760
as

2534
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,040
one can say every single culture has

2535
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,800
but taking

2536
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,320
awareness

2537
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:43,120
and wisdom into the process

2538
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:44,719
of shaping

2539
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:46,480
our rituals so maybe they can be aligned

2540
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,400
with our preferences

2541
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:49,920
that's exactly right and there's a whole

2542
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,400
movement and i'm i'm involved in it uh

2543
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,960
and i i spoke to this one at the a

2544
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,480
recent invited lecture i gave at

2545
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,360
cambridge about uh ritual knowing and

2546
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,960
the connections between ritual the

2547
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,960
imaginal and being rational

2548
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,679
um and so

2549
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:08,639
very much very much uh i i i if you

2550
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:10,159
allow me i'll give you one instance of

2551
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:12,239
this

2552
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:13,440
and think about how this goes to

2553
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,880
updating and all the stuff we're talking

2554
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,239
about in predictive processing and

2555
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:18,639
reducing surprise okay so

2556
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:19,760
um

2557
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,120
you go into academics who are supposed

2558
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,639
to be the cream of the crop

2559
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:24,000
so a little bit of self-deprecation

2560
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,520
there

2561
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:27,280
and

2562
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:28,800
you give them

2563
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,040
convincing evidence

2564
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,440
locked salt you know rigorously tight

2565
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:34,960
arguments that they should start saving

2566
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,800
for their retirement now you allow them

2567
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,719
to raise whatever objections they have

2568
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:41,040
you meet them you get them to all agree

2569
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,639
that you've convinced them that they

2570
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:44,800
should save for their retirement

2571
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,400
you go away

2572
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,920
you come back in six months none of them

2573
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,840
are saving for the retirement

2574
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,520
hyperbolic discounting et cetera et

2575
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,600
cetera hyperbolic discounting is an

2576
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,440
adaptive thing et cetera i won't go into

2577
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,199
all of that right

2578
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:58,800
but then what you do and there's

2579
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,239
like you know hirschfield and other

2580
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:02,080
people all this what you do is you now

2581
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:03,679
do something else

2582
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:05,199
you get them

2583
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:07,120
and this is the imaginal not imaginary

2584
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:09,040
you get them to imagine their future

2585
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:11,920
self as a family member that they have a

2586
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,719
responsibility for and that they love

2587
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:16,639
and they want to give the best possible

2588
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:18,080
life to

2589
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,760
two things you find when you come back

2590
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,120
six months later

2591
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:23,199
the people that did the do the imagining

2592
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:25,840
start to save and the more vividly they

2593
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,520
can imagine

2594
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,440
the more they save

2595
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:33,520
so you overcome a kind of egocentric

2596
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,320
hyperbolic discounting through an in an

2597
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:39,040
imaginal it's basically a ritual this

2598
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,520
imaginal binding of yourself to your

2599
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:44,480
future self so that you get a more

2600
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:48,080
adaptive relationship

2601
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,600
it makes me think about

2602
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:52,159
variational free energy which is about

2603
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:54,239
the present and the past

2604
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:56,639
as religion really

2605
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,880
and then expected free energy as pre

2606
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:01,280
legare because we need to bind ourselves

2607
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,280
to futures that haven't happened

2608
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,199
yeah there's an asper there's there

2609
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:07,920
there's other there's there's a

2610
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,560
you know there's a current agentic

2611
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,880
right way in which religio that's my

2612
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,880
preferred etymological origin for

2613
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,280
religion binding connectedness and

2614
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:19,520
there's also aspirational religio and

2615
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,400
what religion often does is try to trade

2616
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,400
and try to find a sweet spot an optimal

2617
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,639
relationship between current and

2618
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:30,000
aspirational religio

2619
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,480
amazing let us look at some of these

2620
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:35,280
comments so any of them

2621
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,280
feel free to add comments or give a

2622
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,120
response so

2623
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,760
first ali has written

2624
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,800
in deluse's words relevance questions

2625
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,400
are how much

2626
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:47,600
and how

2627
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,119
in what cases

2628
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:51,920
and who questions as opposed to what is

2629
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:52,880
x

2630
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,040
questions from difference in repetition

2631
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,280
so what are the questions that bring us

2632
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,760
towards relevance as opposed to

2633
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,040
questions that

2634
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:04,320
make relevance obscured

2635
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,600
um

2636
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,119
that's a really interesting question i'm

2637
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:10,239
not

2638
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:12,000
i don't know much to lose i've read a

2639
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,639
little bit about the lose and and that's

2640
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:16,639
i should read more to lose because i'm a

2641
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:19,040
deep fan of spinoza and he has a very

2642
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,280
interesting reading i have the book by

2643
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:24,400
the lewis on spinoza but um i i'm i'm

2644
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:25,679
really hesitant to give much of an

2645
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:27,679
answer here because i don't know de luz

2646
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:29,520
very well um it doesn't have to be a

2647
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:31,360
delusion answer just what kinds of

2648
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,360
questions and and um integra

2649
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,600
interrogative practices

2650
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,199
help us find relevance

2651
01:37:39,199 --> 01:37:41,199
so um i think

2652
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:44,400
that uh i

2653
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:47,040
to collapse a large argument built from

2654
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:50,239
sperber and wilson and their work on a

2655
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:53,840
book entitled relevance by the way um

2656
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:56,239
at least within communication i think

2657
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:57,760
actually this is where i disagree with

2658
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,679
the lose but this is why i hesitant

2659
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:01,520
because i don't know to lose well so

2660
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,360
that's my hesitancy i think all of the

2661
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:07,199
questions are ways of trying to get a

2662
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:09,440
reformulation of what we find relevant

2663
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,360
they bring out there

2664
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:13,119
they bring out different aspects bring

2665
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:15,199
in different perspectives and point the

2666
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:16,560
arrow of relevance in different

2667
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,199
direction and what sperber and wilson

2668
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:21,040
they took for they said okay

2669
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,280
you have the pragmatic aspect of all

2670
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,360
communication what's pragmatics

2671
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,280
pragmatics is what you convey beyond

2672
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,639
what you can say

2673
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:30,960
because i can't actually put into my

2674
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,800
words every all of the information i'm

2675
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,760
trying to convey to you because if i if

2676
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:39,199
i did that well if if and by the use of

2677
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:42,239
if i'm making use of not the logical if

2678
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:45,520
but the temporal and conditional if i in

2679
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:47,360
this case i'm referring to me and i'm

2680
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:49,119
referring to me insofar as i'm in this

2681
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:52,880
current situation um did that and that

2682
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,800
was referring to what of all the things

2683
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:57,440
i've spoken of i'm speaking of uh you

2684
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:00,800
know trying to uh give give the specific

2685
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,880
uh verbal form of everything i'm trying

2686
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,119
to convey and then for each one of those

2687
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:06,719
current what do i mean by the currency

2688
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:08,480
you see what happens you get a penumbra

2689
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:11,440
of ever-expanding attempts to to to

2690
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:13,199
translate the conveyance

2691
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:16,159
and you get a combinatorially explosive

2692
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:17,520
list of

2693
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:18,719
sentences

2694
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:21,040
that i can't say and you do you do this

2695
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:23,920
all the time you know when you drive up

2696
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:25,440
and you open your window and you say

2697
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,520
excuse me i'm out of gas you mean your

2698
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,119
car is out of gas you're not trying to

2699
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:30,800
be more flatulent you mean gas is

2700
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:32,560
actually standing for gasoline you mean

2701
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,000
you're not completely out of gas you

2702
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,440
have some for you can drive at least a

2703
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,840
few more minutes

2704
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,360
right and you know all of these things

2705
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,199
are at work because if you violate any

2706
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:43,679
one of those expectations you get pissed

2707
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:45,840
off if if they say to you there's a gas

2708
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,080
station at the corner and you drive to

2709
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,600
the corner and the gas station has been

2710
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,600
closed for 10 years you don't go whoa

2711
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:55,119
well he told me the truth because you

2712
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:57,280
right it was conveyed to you that you

2713
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:58,719
could make use

2714
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:00,719
of the gas station because you're out of

2715
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:02,480
gas i won't go on that i'm just trying

2716
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,560
to give an intuitive example and so

2717
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:08,080
grice gives these four maxims that we

2718
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:10,560
are trying to always follow

2719
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:13,360
when in order to manage the conveyance

2720
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:15,199
so it doesn't become combinatorially

2721
01:40:15,199 --> 01:40:17,920
explosive and it's the

2722
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,960
in its manner and

2723
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:24,480
formats and what is quality

2724
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:27,360
so he gives three that are not relevance

2725
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,040
and the fourth one is relevance

2726
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,960
explicitly so and then sperber and

2727
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,960
wilson just basically argue all the

2728
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:36,159
other ones collapse into relevance like

2729
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:38,159
uh quality is tell the truth well not

2730
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:39,040
know

2731
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,320
don't tell the truth you don't tell

2732
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,840
everything that's in your mind when

2733
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:44,639
you're speaking to somebody you select

2734
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:47,119
out of all of this in there a subset

2735
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:49,199
that's relevant so give the relevant

2736
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:52,800
truth the relevant manner etc etc

2737
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:53,840
so

2738
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,320
we always are doing this and i think

2739
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,639
questions actually operate

2740
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:01,440
right primarily at the pragmatic level

2741
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,840
of course they have semantic consequence

2742
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,840
but what we're constantly doing is

2743
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:06,880
asking

2744
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:09,119
which what are you conveying and what

2745
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:11,199
are the implicatures

2746
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:12,320
which are not the same thing as

2747
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,080
implications what are the relevant

2748
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,800
implicatures before i try and derive the

2749
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,119
implications of what you're saying

2750
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:22,159
that's what questions i think do

2751
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:24,159
now

2752
01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:28,960
i want to also be clear about this that

2753
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:30,840
we we need to be

2754
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:34,320
directing the questions into

2755
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:37,040
directions

2756
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:39,760
sometimes we are probing

2757
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,360
are we aspectualizing framing the arena

2758
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,679
well

2759
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,159
in terms of is the world this so we

2760
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:49,920
check to see is the world disclosing

2761
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,199
itself to us

2762
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:54,639
such that we are solving our problems

2763
01:41:54,639 --> 01:41:56,960
and flourishing

2764
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,719
but sometimes we also need to step back

2765
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:00,880
and look at the framing itself

2766
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:03,760
and ask is the framing

2767
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,760
right actually misdirecting or

2768
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:08,239
misleading me so i think

2769
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:10,080
questions are always

2770
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:14,159
trying to reconfigure the fittedness and

2771
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:15,760
one of the things we and therefore

2772
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,199
they're trying to enhance relevance

2773
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:20,000
realization at the pragmatic level

2774
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,960
but we should always remember to

2775
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,880
direct the questions in at least these

2776
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:28,040
two directions

2777
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:29,760
thank you

2778
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,199
all right here's a question from brock

2779
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:35,360
can you give some examples of how

2780
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:38,320
depending on ignoring to realize

2781
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,520
relevance

2782
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,960
can prevent realization of meaning

2783
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:45,360
does this relate to reciprocal narrowing

2784
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:46,639
and opening

2785
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:49,119
yes yes totally and so brock is familiar

2786
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:51,520
with my work and i'll just

2787
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,440
um let me just quickly

2788
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:56,239
uh open those the the the those final

2789
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:57,920
things up so other people are aware of

2790
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,520
what he's alluding to thank you brock

2791
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:01,760
for doing that uh so the notion of

2792
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,760
reciprocal narrowing is drawn from my

2793
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,520
friend and colleague mark lewis who has

2794
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,639
proposed a learning model of addiction

2795
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:10,800
rather than a disease model of predict

2796
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,639
of addiction so our current model which

2797
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:14,320
governments and agencies like is the

2798
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:15,679
disease model you have this thing it's

2799
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:18,400
infected you and you're trying to like

2800
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,639
and and it's still it's debilitating you

2801
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:22,000
um now

2802
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,760
i want to make something very clear mark

2803
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,280
is not saying that there is not a

2804
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:26,719
neurochemical

2805
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:29,199
layer but he's trying to well he's

2806
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:30,480
trying to get an insight he's trying to

2807
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,400
get you to realize that the disease

2808
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,159
model makes all kinds of predictions

2809
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:36,320
that have been empirically disconfirmed

2810
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,480
uh i won't go through all of them but

2811
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,920
they they have to do with the effect

2812
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:43,119
that you know when we have that model

2813
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:45,760
we'll tend to think of the substance as

2814
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,920
in and of itself addictive

2815
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:49,840
um you know cocaine is so addictive

2816
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:53,040
heroin is so addictive well you know

2817
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,960
yeah there was lots of

2818
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:58,239
uh soldiers in vietnam using opioids

2819
01:43:58,239 --> 01:43:59,760
and when they came back the vast

2820
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,440
majority of them stopped without having

2821
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,440
to have any special treatment

2822
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,520
they stopped using opioids

2823
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:08,159
but opioids are so addictive well what's

2824
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:09,280
different

2825
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:11,199
because

2826
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:12,400
presumably

2827
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:14,080
this destruction the chemical structure

2828
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,440
of heroin in vietnam in the united

2829
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:17,440
states is the same what is different the

2830
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:20,400
asian arena relationship is different

2831
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,800
you're a soldier in a traumatic

2832
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:25,040
circumstance in vietnam the united

2833
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,600
states you're a citizen and you're not

2834
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:28,960
and of course that caused all kinds of

2835
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:31,280
other problems for these people because

2836
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,280
the agent or relationships are so

2837
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:36,080
different here's what mark proposes

2838
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:36,880
so

2839
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:38,800
let's i'll use alcohol because it's one

2840
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,960
people can easily relate to

2841
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,159
i have a very challenging arena and i'm

2842
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:46,880
stressed so i take some alcohol and it

2843
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,960
reduces the stress but it actually

2844
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,840
limits my cognitive flexibility so my

2845
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,080
problem-solving abilities go down so the

2846
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:55,760
options available to me in the world

2847
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:58,320
goes down so the world narrows as the

2848
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,159
world narrows it becomes more stressful

2849
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:02,480
to me so now i want to take more alcohol

2850
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,480
to keep the stress away but that's now

2851
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:05,679
impairing

2852
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:08,159
my cognitive flexibility you see what's

2853
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:10,639
happening the world as an arena is

2854
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:13,760
narrowing and my capacity as an agent is

2855
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:15,520
narrowing so you've got reciprocal

2856
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,400
narrowing until i can't be any other

2857
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:21,679
than i am and there is no future for me

2858
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:22,639
at all

2859
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:25,119
other than this moment of taking the

2860
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:26,320
drug and that's addiction it's

2861
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:29,040
reciprocal narrowing now i was literally

2862
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,800
daniel i was literally at lunch with

2863
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,119
mark lewis and i said but mark if

2864
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:35,360
there's reciprocal narrowing there has

2865
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:37,920
to be reciprocal opening and he went

2866
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:39,440
oh you're right

2867
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,679
and i talked about how plato talks about

2868
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:44,239
this and the model of uh what's called

2869
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:46,000
anagage uh

2870
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,320
this model in the republic of how you

2871
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:51,199
ascend out of the cave into

2872
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:54,239
seeing the real world reciprocal opening

2873
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:55,440
and so

2874
01:45:55,440 --> 01:46:01,599
um i think when we engage in

2875
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:06,799
ignoring relevant information

2876
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:10,719
we will often very readily fall prey to

2877
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:13,360
a very powerful kind

2878
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:14,159
of

2879
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:16,560
reciprocal narrowing

2880
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:18,400
so let's let's go back to the example i

2881
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,719
used

2882
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:23,040
you don't have the insight

2883
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,560
you think she's angry when she's

2884
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:26,159
actually afraid you don't have the

2885
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:28,719
insight and so you push on her and you

2886
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:31,199
only take evidence confirming

2887
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:34,400
confirmation bias that she's angry in to

2888
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,800
your model and then you only act towards

2889
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:39,360
her as if she's and she's gonna start

2890
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,119
probably

2891
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:43,199
almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy

2892
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:45,600
respond more and more because your anger

2893
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,760
right you start to act towards her in a

2894
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,520
way that gets increasingly aggressive

2895
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,760
and you reciprocally narrow and then it

2896
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,440
gets harder and harder for you to see

2897
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:55,440
that she's not angry and it gets harder

2898
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:58,080
for her not to communicate to you in a

2899
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:00,239
way that you have to interpret as anger

2900
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:01,840
because when she tries to give you

2901
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:04,159
something else you ignore it in zero and

2902
01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:06,639
you have been in arguments and fights

2903
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:09,119
like at some point in your life with

2904
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:11,440
somebody that you don't want to be

2905
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,199
severed from

2906
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:15,920
but that kind of thing can sever

2907
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:18,320
the connectedness and when you're at the

2908
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,800
end of your life you don't really care

2909
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:23,840
how many objects you've manipulated you

2910
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,400
don't care how many french fries you eat

2911
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,960
you care about the relationships you had

2912
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:31,600
and how deep they are and if you didn't

2913
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,480
pay attention at that time you lost a

2914
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:37,679
relationship and severed a connectedness

2915
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:40,960
that enhances your meaning in life

2916
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:43,280
you you fell into reciprocal narrowing

2917
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:45,040
it severed a relationship and your

2918
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,560
connectedness

2919
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,560
mattering to another human being has

2920
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:51,280
been lost

2921
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:52,560
there's no more

2922
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,719
interpersonal gravity and the

2923
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:56,800
relationship does not matter

2924
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,840
yes

2925
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,679
all right i'm going to read just a few

2926
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:00,480
uh

2927
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,719
non-question comments and then get to a

2928
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:04,800
question in these last minutes

2929
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:05,600
so

griswold wrote ants hold hands in the

together

2933
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:15,840
that's wonderful

ah

2940
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,679
wow nice very cool

2941
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:31,440
all right and here's one more uh

2942
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:34,239
question this is from dave

2943
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:34,960
so

2944
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:37,760
uh dave says have you found uh

2945
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,880
oh i don't know if this is the correct

2946
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,400
way to pronounce the name but guiles

2947
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,560
falcaoniers

2948
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:45,199
uh work on mental spaces and conceptual

2949
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:47,600
fusion useful in explaining and

2950
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,760
improving the evolution of concrete

2951
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:52,560
mental activities and we can also see

2952
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:55,600
this work on uh generalized space and

2953
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:58,320
navigation with chris fields and mike

2954
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,320
levin and many others so whether you're

2955
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,159
familiar with that researcher or not how

2956
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:04,960
does this idea of cognitive spaces

2957
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,600
help us work in physical and social

2958
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,119
spaces

2959
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:11,679
uh for me um

2960
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:13,840
again and this how you know the

2961
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,520
connection to relevance realization and

2962
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:17,040
its collection to buy connections to

2963
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:19,600
biology and evolutionary modeling is

2964
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:21,280
really helpful here

2965
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,840
uh so give me a moment and then i'll uh

2966
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,719
uh

2967
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:27,199
so one of the ways in which evolution

2968
01:49:27,199 --> 01:49:30,239
selects is it exacts acceptation means

2969
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:31,600
it doesn't have to

2970
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:33,760
generate an entirely new

2971
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:36,800
uh mechanism um and so let me give you a

2972
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,400
concrete example that's one of my

2973
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:39,840
favorite ones what i'm doing with my

2974
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,520
tongue right now is speaking

2975
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,199
of course tongues did not evolve for

2976
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:45,119
speech because we have so many organisms

2977
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:46,239
that have tongues and they aren't

2978
01:49:46,239 --> 01:49:48,320
capable of speech but what does the

2979
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,320
tongue do well it helps masticate so it

2980
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:53,040
has to be highly flexible um it has to

2981
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,600
be a poison and calorie detector so it

2982
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,199
has to have lots of nerve endings and it

2983
01:49:57,199 --> 01:49:58,880
has to be it's in the air passageway

2984
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,040
because that's how we evolved right and

2985
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,840
so it's it's almost pre-designed as some

2986
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:06,239
people say pre-adapted for speech and so

2987
01:50:06,239 --> 01:50:09,119
it gets exacted into speech

2988
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:11,440
i think there's growing evidence uh look

2989
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,199
at barbara taversky's book mind in

2990
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:14,239
motion

2991
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:16,239
that the brain

2992
01:50:16,239 --> 01:50:17,600
and this goes to the work of michael

2993
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,920
anderson and the hen and others

2994
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:23,119
the brain is uh an exactive

2995
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:24,480
process

2996
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:28,400
the brain is constantly exacting

2997
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:32,960
machinery that emerged for one

2998
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,239
arena set of actions for another

2999
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:39,119
specifically it looks like

3000
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:40,159
the

3001
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:42,080
set of abilities

3002
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:44,480
that we generate

3003
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:46,880
for navigating

3004
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:49,679
physical space is exacted into moving

3005
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:51,840
around in conceptual space the fact that

3006
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:54,159
we're even calling it conceptual space

3007
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:55,760
and we talk about things being higher

3008
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,560
and lower and we move between et cetera

3009
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,400
you can it's just it's just totally

3010
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,719
impregnated with navigational language

3011
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:04,400
and we talk about orientation and

3012
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,880
finding our way or losing our way can

3013
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:09,040
you follow this argument

3014
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:11,119
what that's tracking language can you

3015
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:13,360
follow this argument where is it going

3016
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:17,440
to right uh you know i lost the thread

3017
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:20,080
just like again and again and again and

3018
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:23,119
again and and and and so

3019
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:25,040
it really and it helps to explain really

3020
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:27,119
weird stuff that's otherwise not well

3021
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:28,159
explained

3022
01:51:28,159 --> 01:51:31,199
okay cerebellum more neurons than your

3023
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:32,719
neocortex

3024
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:35,040
often not included in fmris by the way

3025
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:38,159
which is a mistake you know many fmris i

3026
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:39,760
think should be removed from their

3027
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:41,599
findings because the cerebellum is not

3028
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:43,760
included and we we are now getting

3029
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:46,320
overwhelming evidence for the cerebellar

3030
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:50,000
uh cerebellum cortex loop and by

3031
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,880
excluding the cerebellum from our fmris

3032
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:55,840
we are conf we are we are smuggling in a

3033
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,760
confound that has not been properly

3034
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:00,239
controlled for so just a general point

3035
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:01,360
there

3036
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:03,599
when people are sitting in what's the

3037
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:05,360
cerebellum for you know sensory motor

3038
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:07,199
balance right or

3039
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:09,040
when people are sitting absolutely still

3040
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:11,199
eyes closed

3041
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:13,679
perfectly stable in meditation their

3042
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:18,239
cerebellum is firing like crazy why

3043
01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:19,840
they're not doing anything they're not

3044
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,280
moving they're in a position where they

3045
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:23,920
can be deeply comfortable because they

3046
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:26,320
are aligned with gravity and like

3047
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,880
they're stable stable stable their eyes

3048
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:31,760
are presumably because they are

3049
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:34,400
navigating and they're trying to balance

3050
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:37,119
complex contingencies of attention and

3051
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:38,719
move through

3052
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:41,440
the experiential space in a powerful way

3053
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:43,199
and the cerebellum

3054
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:44,800
this when i started talking about this

3055
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,639
it was controversial now it's

3056
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:48,560
approaching consensus position that this

3057
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:50,960
is the cerebellum has been exacted for

3058
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:53,679
these kinds of functions so i i think

3059
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:55,520
the idea

3060
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:56,480
that

3061
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:57,440
um

3062
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,520
we but that

3063
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:01,119
and i'm not i'm i i've only briefly

3064
01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:02,480
looked at for quinine's work when i was

3065
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:03,920
doing work on metaphor and i didn't find

3066
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:05,840
it particularly helpful for metaphor so

3067
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:08,560
i didn't go into it more deeply um

3068
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:09,760
but

3069
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:11,599
the uh the idea

3070
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:14,800
that we are doing something like mapping

3071
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:18,159
between spaces i i think this is

3072
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:19,760
i think yeah

3073
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:22,320
i think this just plugs into the

3074
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:24,719
exactive nature of our cognition that it

3075
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:29,760
is a form of rapid cognitive evolution

3076
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:32,000
awesome well

3077
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,320
in the final minutes

3078
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:36,880
do you have any words of wisdom any

3079
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,800
thoughts where do we go from here where

3080
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:41,760
do people go from here

3081
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,280
well it depends i mean you can go

3082
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:44,639
theoretically in which you can look at

3083
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:47,280
my publications and and mark uh is

3084
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:50,000
coming he got an amazing grant

3085
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,239
and other grants and uh

3086
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:54,639
um and so he's coming to u of t he and i

3087
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:56,880
are going to do work brett and i are are

3088
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:58,880
doing work uh the three of us are going

3089
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:01,199
to continue work so look for that uh

3090
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:02,639
gary and i who published the paper on

3091
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:04,880
relevance realization and personality

3092
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,000
have one

3093
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,599
pretty well written on integrating

3094
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:09,199
relevance realization

3095
01:54:09,199 --> 01:54:12,159
and attachment theory um in terms of uh

3096
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:14,880
attachment is actually um a

3097
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:17,040
uh optimal gripping practice between the

3098
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:19,920
child and the mother or

3099
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:21,760
frequently the mother the the primary

3100
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:24,400
caregiver i should say um

3101
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:25,360
and so

3102
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:28,320
uh you can look for all of that um for

3103
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,080
those of you who are interested more in

3104
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:31,679
the wisdom stuff you can look at the

3105
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:35,440
stuff i published on wisdom um

3106
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:36,880
uh oh i don't think i wrote any wisdom

3107
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:38,239
papers on my own they're all they're

3108
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:39,599
with other people

3109
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:41,599
uh you if you're interested in

3110
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:44,159
mindfulness i've got two publications

3111
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:46,960
one on a an oxford book

3112
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:50,000
uh an anthology edited by emir raz on

3113
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,560
hypnosis and meditation and more recent

3114
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,719
one which i recommend in the routledge

3115
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:56,960
handbook on the philosophy of meditation

3116
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:59,119
where i talk about all this having how

3117
01:54:59,119 --> 01:55:01,199
this all works out in terms of attention

3118
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:02,960
and meditation and contemplation why

3119
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:04,159
they're not the same thing why they're

3120
01:55:04,159 --> 01:55:06,159
an opponent processing relationship why

3121
01:55:06,159 --> 01:55:09,040
that's conducive to

3122
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,360
insight and and more systemic and

3123
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:13,920
systematic insight et cetera

3124
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:16,239
if you're interested in learning about

3125
01:55:16,239 --> 01:55:18,320
the meeting crisis you can go to my

3126
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:20,239
youtube series awakening from the

3127
01:55:20,239 --> 01:55:22,000
meeting crisis and follow that argument

3128
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,199
all the way through

3129
01:55:23,199 --> 01:55:25,599
i have a new series coming out which is

3130
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:27,760
about trying to

3131
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:31,599
tap into how we can afford these kinds

3132
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:34,719
of flowing emergent conversations that

3133
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:36,960
take us beyond where we can go in an

3134
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:40,080
individual cognition and empower us

3135
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:41,760
and it's called after socrates where i'm

3136
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:44,239
tracing out what's going on in dialectic

3137
01:55:44,239 --> 01:55:48,320
into the logos that's coming out uh this

3138
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:51,040
year probably october november uh rebel

3139
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:52,719
wisdom david fuller they're making a

3140
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:55,119
documentary film about my me and my work

3141
01:55:55,119 --> 01:55:57,440
that's coming out also october november

3142
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:59,440
of this year so that's a bunch of things

3143
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:01,760
you can look for and look at

3144
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:04,159
amazing well thank you very much for
