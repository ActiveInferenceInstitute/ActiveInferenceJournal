1
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,840
hello everyone welcome

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,519
it is september 13 2022.

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,800
we're here at the active inference

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,520
institute with john vervicky so john

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,920
welcome thank you for joining

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,000
i'm very much looking forward to this

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,600
conversation

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,160
hello and to you

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,679
thank you daniel it's a great pleasure

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,960
being here i'm looking forward to this

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,600
is there any introduction or hello that

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,399
you'd like to provide as we

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,800
head into this journey together

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,320
i guess i can give just a little bit of

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,079
background so people know where i'm

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,079
coming from i'm an associate professor

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,000
at the university of toronto

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,879
i'm i'm appointed both in cognitive

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,160
psychology

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,680
and in cognitive science i teach in both

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,680
and i am the director of the cognitive

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,039
science program uh so i do a lot of work

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,920
integrating especially psychology and

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,400
um ideas from artificial intelligence

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,159
large framework models philosophical

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,520
framework models for the nature of the

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,320
mind i especially do work on

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,680
intelligence consciousness insight

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,759
flow mindfulness and wisdom

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,280
all centered upon a notion uh uh

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,040
well not a notion a proposal a

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,799
theoretical proposal that i call

33
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,320
relevance realization and perhaps we'll

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,439
get into that at some point

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,560
into it we go

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,840
so to provide some context

37
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,360
these live streams are

38
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,400
multi-directional roads

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,840
we're going to be talking about

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,240
different ideas for some people it'll be

41
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,399
their day-to-day life and the water they

42
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,960
swim in for other people it might be

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,280
their first time hearing about relevance

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,079
realization or predictive processing or

45
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,439
active inference

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,520
and so we always want to make it

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,479
accessible and also provide depth

48
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,439
so

49
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,079
yesterday in speaking with some

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,240
other participants at the institute

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,360
about how to frame this discussion

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
i was bringing a notion of a

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,040
three-legged stool

54
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,440
and the three legs of this stool

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,560
that provided stability are again those

56
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,319
relevance realization predictive

57
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,520
processing and active inference

58
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,480
and then a participant dean said flip

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,040
the stool it's still stable

60
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,440
and so that led to some discussions of

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,560
what was

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,480
the betweenness of these ideas and what

63
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,800
were they really doing alone and what do

64
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,560
they do together

65
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,319
and we're going to approach that

66
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,440
so

67
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,160
first we'll be exploring relevance

68
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,400
realization and predictive processing

69
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,040
in terms of what they are and how you

70
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,200
recently connected them in a recent

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,120
paper and then we'll bring in active

72
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,800
inference as a third guest to the party

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,080
but first

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,480
what is relevance realization and what

75
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
is predictive processing

76
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,239
how did you bring those two together in

77
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,159
the recent work with brett anderson and

78
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,080
mark miller

79
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,800
so the two lines were

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,120
uh working independently

81
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,159
um

82
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,400
i first got my first paper officially

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,200
accepted in 2009 didn't get published

84
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,920
until 2012 because they were holding it

85
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,159
back for a special issue that took

86
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,000
forever to come out uh the reason i

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,840
mentioned the earlier date is that's

88
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,640
before i think most of fristen's major

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,680
publications um and that's just and i'm

90
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,280
not claiming precedent or anything i'm

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,120
just claiming independence i didn't know

92
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,440
about his work until after the theory uh

93
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
was well developed and i assume he might

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,239
even not know of mine even now and

95
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,400
that's fine um

96
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,640
uh so the idea behind relevance

97
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,200
realization is that if you take a look

98
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,440
at many different problems

99
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,599
uh within attempts to explain the mind

100
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,519
in a non-homuncular

101
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,159
non-question begging manner you hit this

102
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,040
problem of relevance realization

103
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,760
so for example

104
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,680
how does categorization work well we

105
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,200
notice the two things are similar what

106
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,040
does it mean to say they're similar

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,399
well logically it means they share

108
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,639
many properties and then goodman

109
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,238
famously pointed out that any two

110
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,720
objects share an indefinite number

111
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,120
of true properties

112
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,479
you know

113
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,199
a plum and a lawnmower both have rounds

114
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,800
shiny surfaces they're both found in

115
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,199
north america neither one existed 300

116
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,680
million years ago both have an odor

117
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,960
neither one is a particularly good

118
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,840
weapon etc etc etc and what people will

119
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,759
say to me is they can't say those are

120
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,880
false because they're all true they'll

121
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,280
say but that doesn't matter and that's

122
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,720
the move

123
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,560
right when you go from logical

124
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,880
similarity to psychological similarity

125
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,600
you say well i zero in on

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,360
the relevant

127
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,880
comparisons

128
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,120
ah and how do you do that and that of

129
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,520
course is still the crux

130
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,080
of the categorization problem let's take

131
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,479
a look at inference well

132
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,240
well inferences just to follow all the

133
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,680
implications of a proposition in

134
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,080
relation to other propositions well how

135
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,600
many are those

136
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,080
well let's take a proposition it's it's

137
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,720
going to be windy tomorrow that has you

138
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,800
know that would have implications for me

139
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,880
if i'm sailing uh that are different for

140
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,800
the implications for me if i'm flying a

141
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
kite or if i'm planning to have a picnic

142
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,479
or i'm planning to stay inside or if i'm

143
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,240
planning to take an airplane

144
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,479
and do i check out all the possible

145
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,560
connections between that proposition

146
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,919
um no i only select those that are

147
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,680
relevant and this was a point made very

148
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,360
very well quite a while ago by

149
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,039
christopher christopher cherniak in his

150
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,840
book

151
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,800
uh minimal rationality

152
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,199
problem solving i i many of you are

153
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,720
already familiar with this so i'll just

154
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,560
state it we know that the search space

155
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,400
for most problems is combinatorially

156
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,560
explosive you can't search the whole

157
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,960
space so you have to somehow ignore most

158
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,440
of the space while nevertheless reliably

159
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,120
being able to solve a wide variety of

160
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,680
problems in a wide variety of domains

161
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,039
i can make similar arguments for

162
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,560
communication i can make similar

163
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,639
arguments for learning etc i won't go

164
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,280
into them i'm just giving enough to

165
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,560
exemplify that yeah independently all of

166
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,479
these things keep crashing into this

167
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,759
issue of zeroing in on the relevant

168
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,440
information

169
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,479
and you can even note it uh at it you

170
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,000
know in your everyday experience what

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,479
should you pay attention to right now

172
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,720
what should you draw from working memory

173
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,240
what should you draw from long-term

174
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,039
memory um especially with the fact that

175
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,400
you can combine different things from

176
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,160
long-term memory what sequence of

177
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,000
actions should you perform what

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,960
possibilities you could consider etc

179
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,360
i take it that this

180
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,880
is at least plausible enough for me to

181
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,039
go on people can take a look at

182
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,479
all the publications to see the

183
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,720
arguments more in depth so this crucial

184
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,759
ability for relevance realization uh

185
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,599
needs to be addressed if we're ever

186
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,919
going to provide i i've argued i've

187
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,919
argued since my thesis that if we're

188
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,280
going to provide a naturalistic

189
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,720
explanation of the mind and does it read

190
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,440
to which we avoid it try to just pretend

191
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,719
it's not there etc

192
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,759
i think it undermines our efforts to

193
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,919
give a naturalistic explanation now this

194
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,560
is sometimes called the frame problem

195
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,319
i don't call it that anymore because

196
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,120
shanahan has rightly argued that the

197
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,360
frame problem was two separate problems

198
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,160
uh one was to create a viable logic for

199
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,199
change

200
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,599
uh that didn't get you sort of enmeshed

201
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,880
in a bleed out of all kind of identities

202
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,039
and he argues that that

203
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,520
challenging problem has largely

204
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,440
been solved he claims to be one of the

205
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,960
people that solved it nobody seems to be

206
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,440
challenging him on that i i i don't

207
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,800
either

208
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,960
what he says remains and those are his

209
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,039
words not mine is the deeper problem of

210
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,639
relevance that's exactly what he calls

211
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,479
it the relevance problem um so

212
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,720
this problem is a key problem and

213
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,479
i have a proposal that i've worked on

214
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,000
with other people

215
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,479
tim littlecraft blake richards leo

216
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,919
ferraro

217
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,360
brett anderson and mark miller in the

218
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,000
recent paper uh gary hovinesian in a

219
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,879
paper we recently published um also

220
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,039
integrating relevance realization theory

221
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,879
and an active big five personality

222
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,840
theory

223
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,520
uh and the proposal

224
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,039
i mean the

225
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,479
proposal has more sort of technical

226
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,599
details but just to give the idea um

227
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,840
and we're not claiming that this i'm not

228
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,519
claiming none of us claim that this

229
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,839
proposal is completely

230
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,919
novel what we're claiming is you see it

231
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,919
implicit in many different areas where

232
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,159
progress is being made and you can draw

233
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,600
it out and explicate it and therefore

234
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,519
make more specific proposals of how to

235
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,839
look for it or how to engineer it

236
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,320
and this is the proposal that

237
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,080
the brain basically uses at many

238
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,279
different levels opponent processing uh

239
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,880
and what it's doing is it's doing

240
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,279
something very analogous to evolution

241
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,760
it's opening up uh variations and then

242
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,600
putting selective pressure on them and

243
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,279
then from that opening up variations

244
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,040
putting selective pressure

245
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,000
uh on them and you you can see this at

246
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,920
many different levels your attention is

247
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,360
doing it right now

248
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,120
uh your default mode network is trying

249
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,959
to make your attention wander off and

250
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,000
introduce

251
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,320
new ideas

252
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,240
your task focuses network is drawing it

253
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,160
back in killing off most of those

254
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,519
options but one of two that might be

255
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,360
actually relevant to

256
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,080
what's going on you keep them

257
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,560
and the idea is that you do this and

258
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,519
there's many of these trade-off

259
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,040
relationships i'm just giving one

260
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,279
example there's many of these trade-off

261
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,920
relationships they're operating

262
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,279
in a massively recursive

263
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,920
multi-dimensional uh self-organizing

264
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,040
process to help you repeatedly zero in

265
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,880
on the relevant information like i say

266
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
there's more detail uh

267
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,240
obviously

268
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,200
uh but that's as as fast as i could make

269
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,120
it uh a gist of what uh the theory

270
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,839
is uh is

271
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,560
proposing

272
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,040
thank you for the summary definitely a

273
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,800
lot there

274
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,920
in

275
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,200
one way it's like moving from the sketch

276
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,959
of the continents and the lay of the

277
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,200
land the space of the possible for

278
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,120
cognitive science across these different

279
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,320
domains

280
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,760
and then asking how the relevant

281
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,920
view combinations are selected and then

282
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,279
one can point to a broad range of

283
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,440
so-called cognitive phenomena

284
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,560
in human as well as in other cognitive

285
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,600
systems

286
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,320
learning memory planning attention

287
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,880
compositionality action selection and

288
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,560
policy inference

289
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,399
all of these areas

290
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,120
which one might imagine could have

291
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,519
bespoke custom theory

292
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,480
or there might be a way to look at some

293
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,920
similarities

294
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,720
ironically or not finding the relevant

295
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,320
similarities in these different

296
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,040
cognitive domains and asking whether we

297
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,600
could improve our inference and our

298
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,000
action regarding those domains through

299
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,240
the usage of an integrative framework

300
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,320
like relevance realization

301
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,720
that's excellent daniel and so just to

302
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,600
add to why i think it's uh reasonable

303
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,560
and perhaps even plausible that there is

304
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,240
such a domain general central capacity

305
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,320
is we have uh robustly replicated

306
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,279
evidence uh for uh the existence of

307
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,440
general intelligence by the way general

308
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,120
intelligence doesn't mean it can't be

309
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,440
analyzed in components it means at its

310
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,680
functional level it forms a causal whole

311
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,920
that has you know reliable predictive

312
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,839
relations and we have it's you know it's

313
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,279
the most powerful psychometric in

314
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,040
psychology and people don't like to hear

315
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,160
that but it is nevertheless the case um

316
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,200
we and so we have evidence that there is

317
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,120
above all and not in not in place of but

318
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,279
above all the specific learning you have

319
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,160
for specific domains there is

320
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,720
powerful evidence for general

321
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,120
intelligence a domain general ability

322
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,440
the way we test for it leo and i made

323
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,200
this argument in another paper is

324
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,279
basically we test for people's capacity

325
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,680
at relevance realization again and again

326
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,560
and again um and so

327
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,320
um that's why i think it's plausible

328
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,560
that there is this underlying

329
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,680
uh

330
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,120
capacity

331
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,079
and

332
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,800
what what that helps do is it helps it

333
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,240
it allows you

334
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,839
it allows us to bridge into more

335
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,839
comprehensive patterns of explanation we

336
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,880
have

337
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,560
so for example

338
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,760
the model i just proposed to you um is

339
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
explicitly

340
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,480
an analogy but a strong analogy you know

341
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,560
to the way evolutionary processes

342
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,120
produce adaptive morphology for market

343
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,279
organisms um

344
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,680
evolution variation selection and the

345
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,279
pro and it doesn't require an

346
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,160
intelligent designer right evolution is

347
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,079
clearly a process that is itself not

348
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,160
intelligent and can produce intelligence

349
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,560
and so that gives us uh the potential

350
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,360
way out of any homuncular explanations

351
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
of intelligence uh like you know the

352
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,360
central executive selects this or that

353
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,600
and those kinds of explanations that

354
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,360
just presuppose an answer to this

355
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,399
question and so instead the idea is no

356
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,720
no um

357
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,760
the brain

358
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,519
at this general level again i'm not

359
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,760
denying specific heuristics although i'm

360
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,040
proposing that perhaps relevance

361
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
realization is how those specific

362
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,200
heuristics might be generated i'm not

363
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,959
i'm not denying specific heuristics i'm

364
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,040
not denying domain specific knowledge

365
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,399
i'm not denying any of that but i'm

366
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,639
saying there is a general ability

367
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,120
just like there is right this general

368
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,600
process of evolution for biological

369
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,680
adaptivity there is this general if

370
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,639
you'll allow me cognitive evolution of

371
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,560
your fittedness your cognitive

372
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,360
fittedness as a problem solver

373
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,480
to your environment

374
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,600
yes in in those ways it's very resonant

375
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,560
with

376
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,480
generalized uh darwinian models or like

377
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,839
neural darwinism as well as the

378
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,199
trend in

379
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,920
eco evo devo ecology evolution and

380
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,040
development

381
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,760
by way of looking at proliferation and

382
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,079
that pruning back process

383
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,480
in different spatial and temporal scales

384
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,000
different systems like the way that it

385
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,160
might happen with synapses forming and

386
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,399
then being pruned during development the

387
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,199
way that ecosystem assembly might occur

388
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,639
with initial

389
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,959
plants forming some sort of substrate

390
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,880
that later forms a ground for

391
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,360
development and then even at slower and

392
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,240
longer time scales with evolution and

393
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,600
especially when we think about the

394
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,880
neural aspects learning and behavior are

395
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,720
part of development they're processes

396
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,120
that happen within a lifetime

397
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,160
and

398
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,680
that is a great

399
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,000
angle to consider so

400
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,399
relevance realization in our

401
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,360
first pocket let's move to the second

402
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,800
leg

403
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,519
predictive processing what is predictive

404
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,160
processing and how did it come into play

405
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,880
and why did it come into play for this

406
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,639
recent work

407
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,000
so i've been familiar with predictive

408
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,800
processing um and i would often be an

409
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,320
annoyance at the conferences where

410
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,040
predictive processing uh was being

411
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,480
presented because i would ask where does

412
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,040
the model come from and uh where's the

413
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,120
innovations for the model come from and

414
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
uh things like that um

415
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,440
because uh i was i

416
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,040
and and the questions were genuine i

417
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,000
wasn't you know i wasn't trying to

418
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,560
sabotage i wanted to understand uh how

419
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,000
this was

420
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,360
um

421
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
integrating and i wasn't getting to be

422
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,199
fair and you know and the fault is

423
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,279
probably also mine you know i mean i i

424
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,000
was

425
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,199
i was learning all about this i've

426
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,639
learned about it quite a bit and you

427
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,440
know and i have my bias uh but brett

428
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,680
brett anderson approached me and he said

429
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,279
look

430
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,120
um

431
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,320
i think that what you're doing in

432
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,399
relevance realization is really needed

433
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,800
for predictive processing

434
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,880
and then at the very same time almo and

435
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,839
this is one of those uh happy

436
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,360
coincidences that are the shadows of god

437
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,120
or something like that uh a former

438
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,240
student of mine who went through the

439
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,759
cognitive science program with me mark

440
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,920
miller who has worked with andy clark

441
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,680
and a bunch of the other uh predictive

442
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,279
processing people

443
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,320
came and he said john i i want to start

444
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,079
working with you again and i want to

445
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,079
integrate what you've been doing and

446
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,079
i've been doing and so

447
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,240
the three of us started talking

448
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,800
and and um

449
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,000
and

450
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,759
you know when we went back and forth a

451
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,160
lot and we came up with

452
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,000
um a way in which we saw these two

453
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,360
theories converging so predictive

454
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,720
processing i mean there's a lot of

455
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
technicalities and people vary to the

456
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,079
degree to which

457
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,000
uh they're committed to

458
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,920
you know a strong bayesian or a weaker

459
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,440
bayesium everybody agrees that you can't

460
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,720
be pure based because it would be

461
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,639
computationally intractable you have to

462
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,120
do some approximation and then the idea

463
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,680
is you have a massively recursive

464
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,800
um

465
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,440
network that is basically

466
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
um doing something really in in

467
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,439
interesting

468
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,039
now again not to claim priority or pres

469
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,839
precedence but independently

470
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,359
in the 2012 paper uh we predicted that

471
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,119
the brain basically

472
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,520
uh tries to model itself in order to

473
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,919
model the environment uh because this

474
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,000
actually gets you uh

475
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,720
through a lot uh past a lot of difficult

476
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,760
problems

477
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,400
um and that was uh and independently and

478
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,440
again like uh i want to give dude credit

479
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,600
uh the idea was no no the brain

480
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,559
shouldn't predict the world uh the brain

481
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,960
should predict itself in a multiply

482
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,440
recursive self-correcting fashion in

483
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
order to predict the world and for

484
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
reasons that i won't go into right now

485
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,280
that just that that just

486
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,039
gets you past so many of these

487
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,280
roadblocks right and then the idea is

488
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,039
well what should the brain what is the

489
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,799
brain doing when it's predicting itself

490
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,000
you know

491
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,760
there's all kinds of math but up you

492
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,919
know a good interpretation is the brain

493
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,480
is trying to reduce the degree to which

494
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,440
it surprises itself the brain is higher

495
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,559
levels well all right you've got a level

496
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,160
of the brain the level is meant to be

497
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,440
taken as an abstraction not an

498
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,520
anatomical region there's a level of the

499
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,880
brain that is you know doing the sensory

500
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,400
motor interaction with the world and the

501
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,480
idea is this is a loop it's not input

502
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,720
output it's a continuous loop where

503
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,280
sensation perception is modifying action

504
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,880
and action is modifying uh perception

505
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,640
and so there's a there's a level of the

506
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,720
brain that is just registering that as

507
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,640
patterns of activity in that causal

508
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,600
interaction and then layers above it try

509
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,440
to predict

510
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,120
how that pattern's going to unfold and

511
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,600
when there's error the error is fed back

512
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,919
into that layer and it is corrected to

513
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,280
try and make a better prediction and

514
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,640
then what you do is you do this

515
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,880
massively recursively you have layers

516
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,799
predicting the layers below them so on

517
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,440
and you propagate error up and you

518
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,520
propagate prediction down

519
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,039
and what that does is it um

520
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,799
it allows you to slowly slowly hone in

521
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,960
on the causal structure of the world and

522
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,640
it doesn't promise to get you the

523
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,480
perfect causal structure of the world or

524
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,200
any cartesian thing like that

525
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:19,919
but

526
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,679
what's really interesting and one of the

527
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,679
things we talked about is you know you

528
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,360
also have that recursive sort of

529
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,160
stacking of layers of prediction in

530
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
various models of deep learning

531
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,480
and deep learning also does right it was

532
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,919
one of the inspirations for relevance

533
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,760
realization theory it does the variation

534
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,160
and selection you know in in things like

535
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
the wake sleep algorithm right and we

536
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,360
thought hey there's a lot of things

537
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,799
converging here

538
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,200
and then you know we

539
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,280
started examining this with other people

540
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,120
like clark you know and we're going

541
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,480
through it he says well you know what uh

542
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,240
what do you predict you can't there's

543
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,000
there's a combinatorial explosive number

544
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,360
of patterns you could predict in the

545
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,760
environment well then you you know you

546
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,440
you predict the important ones or the

547
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,120
relevant ones oops that's going to be

548
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,960
problematic and then they try to you

549
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,280
predict the reliable ones now that's not

550
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,760
good yet enough and then you had the

551
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,600
idea of precision weighting in which

552
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,280
you're you're trying to prioritize uh

553
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,400
which patterns are given processing

554
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,679
which is

555
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,679
basically a model and many people

556
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,360
explicitly claim this in the predictive

557
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,080
processing uh framework of attention

558
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,480
that's what attention is attention is

559
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,360
psychologically a prioritization process

560
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,280
that's doing the precision weighting

561
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,720
that make that helps the

562
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,360
the predictive processing avoid

563
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,320
uh a combinatorial explosion you can see

564
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
the convergence coming in here

565
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,120
uh but then you know and

566
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,320
fairly recently i think it was 2017 2018

567
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,080
clark was talking about this and he said

568
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,159
well precision waving als ultimately

569
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,960
comes down to task relevance and we and

570
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,000
you know and

571
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,559
it was like oh no right that's just

572
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,200
homuncular uh we we need a little man in

573
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,880
there just that's relevant that's not

574
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,520
relevant um and that can't be it and

575
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,280
then what you see is

576
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,039
uh predict the predictive processing

577
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,799
framework is moving to trying to come up

578
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,720
with sort of uh dynamical

579
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,039
self-correcting

580
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,840
way in which the trade-off relationships

581
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,880
in the environment are being used in

582
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,320
order to help

583
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,880
trade-off relationships sorry in the way

584
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,280
the organism is trying to

585
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,360
survive in its environment that's more

586
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,720
accurate

587
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,120
um can be made use of in an opponent

588
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,520
processing fashion to help

589
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,200
right get a non-homuncular account of

590
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,799
the precision weighting and we saw the

591
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,280
two theories as ja oh wow they're

592
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,520
converging they're coming right together

593
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,120
and then it looks like they could

594
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,960
actually help each other the relevance

595
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,840
realization can help you know explicate

596
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,760
what these trade-offs are like and the

597
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,600
kind of opponent processing make and i

598
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,960
do mean explicate i think this is

599
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,039
already implicit in the most cutting

600
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,760
edge work within precision weighting and

601
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,320
predictive processing uh and and the

602
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
predictive processing i sometimes like

603
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,480
to use this analogy and don't push it

604
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,559
too far but i think the predictive

605
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,159
processing is basically giving us the

606
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,360
mendelian genetics of intelligence

607
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,280
and relevance realization is giving us

608
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,600
the darwinian evolutionary theory and

609
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,000
they need each other very deeply and

610
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,440
there's a lot of things that the

611
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,080
relevance realization theory can give to

612
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,520
the predictive processing that it

613
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,600
doesn't do

614
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,480
as directly on its own

615
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,080
these are things like

616
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,799
helping to explain connections to

617
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,640
a lot of phenomenological features

618
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,200
salience

619
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,840
increase the uh

620
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,760
the linkage to theories of consciousness

621
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,000
i can go into all of this in detail and

622
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,400
so um the two theories just came

623
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,440
together

624
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,120
and they really strongly support each

625
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,159
other i think a very strong advantage

626
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,840
which is coming out now

627
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,280
and this is something

628
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
we're just starting to work on so i

629
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,039
don't have too much to say that i'm very

630
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,480
confident about but

631
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,159
i i'm confident in the intuition that i

632
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,760
will have something to say which is that

633
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,880
you know there's been a very strong

634
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,559
critique of the predictive processing

635
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,280
framework coming out of somebody who i

636
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,600
hold in very high regard evan thompson

637
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,880
um and

638
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,480
and it's complex

639
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,039
and there's an ongoing debate i do think

640
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,559
that um

641
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,600
evan's

642
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,159
main point if i can boil down a very

643
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,159
complex argument i hope evan will

644
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,480
forgive me because i'm just trying to

645
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
make sort of a promise here but make it

646
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,280
a plausible promise

647
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,640
is that um the predictive processing

648
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,559
can be sort of refuted with you know

649
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,640
easy counter examples of you know

650
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,120
pendulum clocks in training on a mantle

651
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,880
piece and all kinds of so you get you

652
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,799
get panned psychists from all over the

653
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,880
place uh if predicted pro of these

654
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,799
predictive processes are supposed to be

655
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,559
the model of the cognitive i've heard

656
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,400
some predictive processing people just

657
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,000
bite that bullet uh but for me uh

658
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,120
that seems implausible i think the

659
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,880
answer

660
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,799
which is

661
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,080
almost

662
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,880
uh

663
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,360
forefronted in some ways in evan's point

664
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,159
is that predictive processing is not

665
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,799
really as 4e as it claims to be it's not

666
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,960
properly embodied embedded and active

667
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,679
and extended

668
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,600
now i think

669
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
the way

670
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,360
out of that is by

671
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,080
the connection the integration uh with

672
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,360
relevance realization theory because

673
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,240
relevance realization theory um

674
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,600
rounds out in the bioeconomy of an

675
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,880
organism

676
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,240
and it grounds out in

677
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,360
the fact

678
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,960
that relevance is always relevant to

679
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,520
a system that is auto poetic

680
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,120
montague put it very well we're

681
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,559
different from computers in that they

682
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,159
don't care about the information they

683
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,720
process we care about the information we

684
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,880
process and i propose to you we care

685
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,320
about the information we process because

686
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,000
we are fundamentally taking care of

687
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,520
ourselves we are autopoetic beings and

688
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,360
the theory of relevance realization

689
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,880
ultimately grounds out it says that

690
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,120
relevance is deeper than representation

691
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
it's deeper than inference it's deeper

692
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,640
than logic it's actually running off the

693
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,559
bioeconomics of the organism and it is

694
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,960
working in terms of the autopoiesis and

695
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,080
so i think if predictive processing is

696
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,000
integrated with relevance realization it

697
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,400
gets very clearly and explicitly and

698
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,080
deeply integrated with involved

699
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,679
continue

700
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,279
with embodiment and embeddedness and

701
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,520
that would address i think many of the

702
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,360
criticisms that are

703
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,240
emerging from from evan thompson's uh

704
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,360
critique uh so that's that's a

705
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
so not only is there increased

706
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,600
explanatory power outward in terms of

707
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,120
explaining fundamental phenomena there's

708
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,159
ex

709
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,000
there's increased explanatory power in

710
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,480
responding to deep criticism so that's

711
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,520
sort of

712
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,400
where we're at right now

713
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,880
amazing many ways to

714
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,520
go here and many great questions in live

715
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,720
chat that i know we'll be able to get to

716
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,840
one

717
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,120
footnote that we'll come to as well is

718
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,159
connecting so many of the terms that

719
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,159
we're using here

720
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,840
which are being used in a technical

721
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,240
sense scientific or even formal and

722
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,039
mathematical to their everyday uses

723
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,480
ranging from

724
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,039
attention and relevance to all these

725
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,360
different notions of prediction

726
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,799
explanation

727
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,480
design control

728
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,120
and so forth so connecting these natural

729
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,200
language terms to the way that they're

730
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,440
used in cognitive sciences is a very

731
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
rich area

732
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,880
for the predictive processing

733
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,720
architecture itself

734
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,440
you absolutely conveyed it which is it

735
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,880
is building from bayesian formalisms

736
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,720
around inference

737
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,320
and uses a vertical nested model

738
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,799
spatial metaphor it's not actually like

739
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,279
a skyscraper or anything like that where

740
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,679
higher levels are making ongoing

741
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,240
predictions and lower levels are said to

742
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,640
be feeding upwards

743
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,120
observations and initially or at the

744
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,760
most peripheral aspects of the agents we

745
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,480
have what are most sensory-like

746
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,200
observations but those can become

747
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,080
processed in a predictive framework

748
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,960
step by step for example edge detection

749
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,559
and vision object recognition and so on

750
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,679
um

751
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,200
and then

752
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,679
very interesting how um

753
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,159
even at the very beginning

754
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,880
asking how this came about

755
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,240
you spoke to the way that brett and mark

756
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,120
became involved in this ongoing line of

757
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,640
research which i think speaks to the

758
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,520
social inaction of research and the

759
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,320
distributed cognitive elements of

760
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,880
development of theory and practice

761
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,760
and then to bring to the very end

762
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,559
that the relevance is agentic and

763
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,080
situational

764
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,880
and that's kind of like the strange loop

765
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,200
or like the

766
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,720
quasi-tautology like fitness

767
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,039
in an evolutionary setting is

768
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,559
situational

769
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,679
and it is both the most mysterious

770
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,320
and explanatory phenomena and it's the

771
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,159
most circular

772
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,919
phenomena and so relevance as well is so

773
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,080
hyper situational

774
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,880
that

775
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,600
it can seem like it's going to evade

776
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,360
generalization

777
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,840
yet by combining computational

778
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,120
architectures which are inspired by both

779
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,679
advances in modern machine learning and

780
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,440
artificial intelligence

781
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,080
and deeper investigations of natural

782
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,200
intelligences of diverse kinds ranging

783
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,000
from ecological psychology and all these

784
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,600
other fields

785
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,159
that is what you pointed to in the title

786
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,919
conversion solutions

787
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,600
to the frame problem

788
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,360
and um

789
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,440
so anything else to add on predictive

790
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,919
processing relevance realization or

791
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,520
their edge before we add more in

792
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,240
yeah i mean there's an important point

793
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,360
um

794
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,159
which is important to both brett and

795
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,080
mark as well as myself

796
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,720
um i i i wanted to first of all try to

797
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,799
lay out what you might call the the

798
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,799
scientific provenance of what we're

799
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,720
talking about here but now i want to

800
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,760
also talk about a a domain in which it

801
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,799
offers

802
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,880
um

803
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,000
a significant promise

804
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,440
i won't go over the argument here i've

805
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,760
done it at all multiple places both uh

806
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,360
many different video series i won't even

807
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,679
name them that the point is

808
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,000
in talks i've given at conferences the

809
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,159
relevance realization machinery

810
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,159
i think you can make a very plausibly

811
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,000
strong case because

812
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,679
relevance realization is not called

813
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,760
calculation it's about caring it's about

814
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,200
what grabs your attention it's about

815
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,440
what calibrates your arousal it's about

816
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,120
what binds you adaptively to the

817
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,559
environment this is about the

818
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,760
fundamental agent arena fittedness that

819
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,640
makes you a cognitive agent it generates

820
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,440
the primary affordances that are brought

821
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,200
into your cognition through salience etc

822
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,720
what i'm trying to get at is this is

823
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,200
like a pro a primordial connectedness

824
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,679
that is constitutive of your agency and

825
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,720
i think

826
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,640
relevance realization and that kind of

827
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,720
connectedness and constitution of your

828
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,679
agency is very much

829
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,159
what people are seeking

830
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,159
when they're seeking this domain general

831
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,039
feature of meaning in life

832
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,120
it's a kind of connectedness the

833
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,360
language that is used is mattering being

834
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,640
connected

835
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,320
um

836
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,159
they're having a fit between you and the

837
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,960
world that you make a difference right

838
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,279
all of this language which is almost

839
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,880
always metaphorical that in fact using

840
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,880
the word meaning is a metaphor we're

841
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,720
taking something from propositions we're

842
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,120
trying to talk about our relatedness uh

843
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,640
to the environment

844
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,279
and i think um

845
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,120
the relevance realization

846
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,240
stop

847
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,159
relevance realization

848
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,240
when it is giving you what marlo ponte

849
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,960
would call an optimal grip and a met or

850
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,880
in fact a meta optimal grip on the

851
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,159
environment is actually affording that

852
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,559
uh meaning in life

853
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,000
that's one point i want to make another

854
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,039
point then i'm going to bring the two

855
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,120
points together so a bit of patience

856
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,960
if you take a look at how relevance

857
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
realization works and this is one of the

858
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,039
advantages so i've done a lot of work in

859
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,799
sort of insight and self-deception that

860
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,120
have not been gone into as much in

861
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,360
predictive processing

862
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
you know because everybody's doing what

863
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,559
has

864
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,399
attracted their interest and what they

865
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,159
find relevant to kind of phrase um

866
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,240
but what what i would say to you is the

867
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,559
very processes that make us adaptively

868
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,960
intelligent make us perennially

869
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,039
prone to self-deceptive self-destructive

870
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,480
behavior

871
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,080
because

872
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,919
we are intelligent

873
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,039
by

874
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,159
by

875
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,519
ignoring so much information we always

876
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,200
run the risk that we are actually

877
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,039
ignoring the information needed to solve

878
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,159
the problem

879
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,120
and

880
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,679
you can catch this in the evolutionary

881
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,519
dynamics of relevance realization when

882
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,080
you have an aha moment

883
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,679
when you go you have an insight and you

884
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,159
realize oh i've been i've been framing

885
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,159
this we'll even sometimes use that word

886
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,919
i've been looking at this the wrong

887
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,200
wrong way and we don't mean visual

888
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,760
perception we mean right i thought she

889
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,360
was angry but it turns out she's

890
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,279
actually afraid i've completely

891
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,640
misinterpreted

892
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,919
and you know what i'm talking about

893
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,000
those insight moments and that's when

894
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,799
the system right is is actually doing

895
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,880
something like punctuated equilibrium

896
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,039
like in evolution but the point is we

897
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,200
don't always have insights

898
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,960
we have the opposite of insight which is

899
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,919
we get locked into blocked into

900
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,080
misframing situations and

901
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,919
in a self-deceptive self-destructive

902
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,440
manner we can do this individually and

903
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,399
collectively echo chambering etc and

904
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,480
therefore we need

905
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,320
processes that ameliorate the

906
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,240
self-deception

907
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,399
without hamstringing

908
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,120
the adaptive relevance realization that

909
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,519
enhance insight enhance that

910
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,559
connectedness that's meaning in life uh

911
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,159
while reducing the foolishness the

912
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,320
self-deceptive self-destructive behavior

913
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,159
and i put it to you that across

914
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,679
time and across cultures people have

915
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,519
come up with ecologies and practices for

916
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,519
doing that and that's what i would call

917
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,440
wisdom it's a kind of rationally

918
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,600
self-transcending rationality

919
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,640
and

920
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,200
therefore there are deep connections

921
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,440
that can be made scientifically

922
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,080
plausible and empirically testable and

923
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,440
where some of the testing is already

924
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,720
occurring

925
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,760
uh about central aspects

926
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,800
of

927
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,599
what goes into a lot of falls under the

928
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,520
name i don't like this term but we don't

929
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,879
seem to have a better term for it

930
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,679
spirituality where people are primarily

931
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,239
sort of in an often nebulous fashion

932
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,679
talking about

933
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,280
wisdom

934
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,040
insight

935
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,719
the alteration of consciousness and and

936
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,918
and somehow

937
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,918
but if you think about it

938
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,760
a wise person is a person that can go

939
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,440
into a very messy complex situation

940
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,320
and somehow zero in on the relevant

941
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,480
information what really matters and

942
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,560
appropriately fit themselves to that

943
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,520
situation to make a difference to it in

944
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,399
a way

945
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,320
that

946
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,719
brings about a movement towards

947
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,599
flourishing for all parties involved

948
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,400
and so an additional thing that the

949
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,079
connection to relevance realization

950
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,839
provides that predictive processing

951
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,680
doesn't have i'm not saying it couldn't

952
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,359
have but i'm saying this just speeds it

953
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,000
up and makes it is

954
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,839
a connection to a lot of the work that

955
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,280
has been done

956
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,599
by me and others collecting relevance

957
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,599
realization to meaning in life altered

958
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,920
states of consciousness insight

959
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,200
flow

960
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,800
wisdom and that is a powerful way

961
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,359
to extend the explanatory

962
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,839
scope of the theory while also

963
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,720
increasing its existential and cultural

964
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,279
relevance

965
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,119
thank you very interesting there

966
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,960
i want to pick up

967
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,920
where you mentioned this may be

968
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,640
towards what people can be seeking with

969
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,079
questions around

970
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,040
life's meaning people search for meaning

971
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,839
and you use some terms there like

972
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,000
things that matter and you've brought up

973
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,839
in writing and in

974
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,920
conversation about asking people

975
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,920
questions around what matters and seeing

976
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,839
that as an entry point into further

977
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,119
investigation

978
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,920
as well as like connection and fit

979
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,560
and you also brought up from ecological

980
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,839
psychology

981
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,160
the notion of affordances capacities for

982
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,520
action and optimal grip where we need to

983
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,920
hold the sports implement

984
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,079
enough to use it but it has to be

985
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,480
flexible and adaptive and situational as

986
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,359
well

987
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,560
and this points in our language and

988
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,599
thought

989
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,200
to extensive spatial and visual visual

990
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,640
and physical

991
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
metaphors and figures of speech we talk

992
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,000
about sketching ideas and even tangible

993
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,480
aspects like comprehension

994
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,280
and

995
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,839
grasping ideas so we even use this kind

996
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,480
of optimal grip language around

997
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,240
cognitive ideas

998
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,119
and

999
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,040
this is being

1000
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,000
dovetailed in a new way with cognitive

1001
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,640
physics and the bayesian mechanics that

1002
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,880
we'll be exploring more inactive

1003
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,720
inference so i think that's extremely

1004
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,240
interesting that even the formalisms

1005
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,760
are seeing

1006
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,599
convergence

1007
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,440
and similarity

1008
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,440
in terms of the

1009
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,160
physicality of things that might seem

1010
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,280
cognitive mental abstract even spiritual

1011
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,280
and vice versa

1012
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,160
and

1013
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,640
i wanted to know where is action in this

1014
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,040
picture

1015
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,760
so

1016
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,320
i mean action for me

1017
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,359
is

1018
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,720
the

1019
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,040
um

1020
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,760
uh how do i say this without i'm trying

1021
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,680
to not say too many things all at once

1022
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:42,720
there's

1023
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,119
agent arena relationships uh set up

1024
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,640
affordances

1025
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,480
um and that's a basic level of

1026
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,079
relevance realization a level i call

1027
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,760
participatory knowing

1028
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,160
uh where the environment the the arena

1029
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,920
and the agent are co-shaping each other

1030
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,320
so that affordances open up and you

1031
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,240
don't make affordances they're not

1032
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,760
subjective they're not in you they're

1033
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,480
not

1034
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,240
features of the environment they're real

1035
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,119
relations i i say they're transactive

1036
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,800
relations that's what affordance is and

1037
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
we need to open up our ontology and this

1038
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,160
has been a this has been sort of a

1039
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,880
philosophical uh dimension of a lot of

1040
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,599
this like we need to we need to bring

1041
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,880
back the idea of real relations we've

1042
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,640
already been implicitly assuming them

1043
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,560
adaptivity is a

1044
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
is the as the adaptivity of the great

1045
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
white shark in the shark no put it in

1046
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,560
the sahara desert it dies is it in the

1047
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,640
ocean no if i put an elephant in the

1048
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,880
ocean it drowns right so no no it's a

1049
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,040
real relationship a real relation of

1050
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,920
fittedness so we need a we need to have

1051
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,040
an ontology of real relations and so the

1052
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,960
participatory knowing

1053
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,079
um is and you remember this is something

1054
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,280
come out of philosophy that's what i'm

1055
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,640
not i'm trying not to do too many

1056
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,240
arguments at once you don't have to know

1057
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,320
you know in order to know because if you

1058
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,000
do that you get into infinite regress

1059
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,920
and skepticism so these are things this

1060
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,359
is a kind of knowing that you don't know

1061
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,960
that you know because it makes all other

1062
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,280
kinds of knowing possible for you it's a

1063
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,359
co-shaping by the physics by the biology

1064
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,119
right even by the culture between you

1065
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,960
and the environment so that affordances

1066
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,160
open up right so agent arena affordances

1067
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,760
are there perspectival knowing is uh

1068
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,359
layers up of recursive relevance

1069
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,359
realization in which

1070
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,079
the relevance is being translated as

1071
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,720
relevance to something like working

1072
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,800
memory and that's what salience is i put

1073
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,560
it to you that salience is relevance to

1074
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,359
working memory um i do not think we

1075
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,880
should be saying that salience is a

1076
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,720
property of objects or a subjective

1077
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,520
phenomena um

1078
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,680
that again doesn't ultimately make

1079
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,359
ontological sense

1080
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,400
um

1081
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,359
but i i'll just keep going

1082
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,680
perspectival knowing is knowing what

1083
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,560
it's like to be you here now in this

1084
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,680
state of mind in this situation and the

1085
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,200
situation is how the arena is made

1086
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,160
affordable to you and your state of mind

1087
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,880
is how you are fitted to the arena but

1088
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,440
now you are salience landscaping it

1089
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,240
you're foregrounding and backgrounding

1090
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,480
you're sizing up some things you're

1091
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,280
leaving other things not as gestalted

1092
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,839
together more penumbra right

1093
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,760
and it's dynamic and it's flowing you're

1094
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,160
always salience landscaping and the

1095
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,040
function of that salience landscaping is

1096
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,320
to select

1097
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,160
and i mean this like in an evolutionary

1098
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,359
sense to select which affordances are

1099
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,119
going to be enacted

1100
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,880
that's your perspectival knowing and

1101
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,320
what it does when it makes that

1102
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,200
selection is it also taps into your

1103
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,839
procedural knowing your sets of skills

1104
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,400
your sensory motor routines for

1105
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,079
interacting with the viru

1106
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,240
environment your procedural knowledge

1107
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,599
this is your know-how this is your

1108
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,040
knowing how

1109
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,000
to do

1110
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,960
and then

1111
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,839
only

1112
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,160
within a subset of your knowing how you

1113
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,560
know how to make certain inferences you

1114
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,000
know how to

1115
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,680
uh make certain proposals and

1116
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,520
propositions etc and that's your

1117
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,880
propositional knowing so action is going

1118
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,280
up that stack

1119
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,960
that's my proposal it's the

1120
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960
participatory knowing that it's taking

1121
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,359
up by perspectival knowing that is taken

1122
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,599
up by procedural knowing that can be

1123
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,079
reflected and extended by propositional

1124
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,400
knowing

1125
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,359
one other aspect of action which i saw

1126
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,040
in the

1127
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,760
tension or compromise between thinking

1128
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,280
different threads

1129
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,760
and only having one mouth

1130
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,640
is action is like the eye of the needle

1131
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,520
because the embodied entity is able to

1132
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,319
only engage in one action selection at a

1133
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,920
time with potentially serious and even

1134
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,720
fatal consequence exactly exactly

1135
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,240
that out that's that's important thank

1136
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,359
you

1137
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,440
and cognitive systems

1138
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,640
either as if as we model them or in

1139
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,480
their actuality can engage in

1140
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,560
all of these interesting phenomena that

1141
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,640
we've been exploring

1142
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,680
like counter factuals planning um all

1143
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,400
these different aspects that help one

1144
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,560
emulate simulate however we want to

1145
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,119
think about that but consider

1146
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,400
alternate pasts and presence which is

1147
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,510
like the

1148
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,800
[Music]

1149
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,680
perspective

1150
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,359
counterfactual and alternate futures

1151
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,800
which we must engage with to understand

1152
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,760
which sequences of actions we prefer to

1153
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,960
select

1154
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,240
and then

1155
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,000
in predictive processing the imperative

1156
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,599
becomes to

1157
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,280
um among other things reduce our

1158
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,440
surprise about the world which can be an

1159
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,599
optimistic model we're reducing surprise

1160
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,160
about so it's not that we've expunged

1161
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,960
pragmatic value in fact we've balanced

1162
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,280
and as we'll explore formally soon

1163
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,240
balanced epistemic and pragmatic value

1164
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,319
through action selection

1165
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,599
by way of replacing this like monolithic

1166
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,440
reward pursuit

1167
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,400
and seeing curiosity and epistem as

1168
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,839
merely like a tributary to reward

1169
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,680
exactly and so

1170
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,359
that that's another that's that's part

1171
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,119
of what i meant with the the analogy i

1172
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,560
gave earlier about uh genetics and and

1173
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,640
and uh evolutionary theory uh because

1174
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,400
you know

1175
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,160
and we're all familiar people

1176
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,240
who initially encounter this say but i

1177
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,000
don't want to reduce all surprises i

1178
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,280
want and then

1179
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,800
what the typical

1180
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,040
predictive processing is oh but you'll

1181
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,880
will sometimes go for

1182
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,359
a short term increase in surprise for

1183
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,800
long-term reduction and then what we're

1184
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,640
talking about is overall rate but the

1185
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,440
problem is you then need

1186
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,599
something that is selecting between

1187
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:52,560
different

1188
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,079
longitudinal domains are processing um

1189
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,599
because of course it's not always the

1190
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,839
case that you should prefer long term

1191
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,240
over short term right and

1192
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,319
there's right there isn't there aren't

1193
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,440
simple

1194
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,520
comparative algorithms for this you need

1195
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,839
dynamic trade-off relationships between

1196
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,480
short-term long-term between

1197
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,880
you know well i i like some short terms

1198
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,880
i don't want all my short-term surprises

1199
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,520
to go away because if if that was to go

1200
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,480
away then i you know that would impact

1201
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,960
greatly on my long-term learning because

1202
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,520
i get locked in local minima and and

1203
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,800
that's not the only explanation for

1204
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,560
curiosity but that's that's one kind of

1205
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,800
explanation you give and you go yeah

1206
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,040
right but you know that means you can't

1207
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,800
use a simple hill climbing you got to do

1208
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,720
other things what are you doing and you

1209
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,920
know there's you know there's people

1210
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,079
there's people like brett and i who

1211
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,760
think that you know there's there's

1212
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,960
things happening in the brain like

1213
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,200
self-organizing criticality at multiple

1214
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,800
levels of firing

1215
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,640
small world network organization of

1216
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,720
multiple worlds multiple levels of

1217
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,440
wiring that are trying to

1218
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,839
constantly dynamically optimize these

1219
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,480
trade-off relationships and chris honey

1220
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,760
has talked about the fact that you can

1221
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,560
see the brain processing at multiple

1222
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,640
levels he actually argues and i don't

1223
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,240
know i don't know if i completely agree

1224
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,319
with this but you know he argues and i

1225
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,640
knew chris was at ufc for a while

1226
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,000
he argues that there actually isn't

1227
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,400
memory there's just different speeds

1228
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,160
longitudinal rates at which information

1229
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,200
is being processed uh which is a really

1230
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,960
cool idea um and um so

1231
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,839
again what this does is soon as you

1232
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,079
start to

1233
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:32,880
make

1234
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,599
those completely legitimate moves on

1235
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,440
behalf of predictive processing

1236
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,960
explaining things

1237
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,920
like curiosity like

1238
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,160
insight like wonder because wonder and

1239
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,319
curiosity aren't the same curiosity is

1240
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,160
there's something missing

1241
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,200
and you

1242
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,800
a piece of information and you go

1243
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,400
looking to fill it in and get rid of

1244
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,880
your ignorance wondering as you wish

1245
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,760
when you call yourself and your world

1246
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,000
into question in order to set yourself

1247
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,480
onto a developmental pathway

1248
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,880
it's an aspirational uh project and so

1249
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,599
predictive processing when it opens up

1250
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,880
its theoretical language in order to

1251
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,560
address these

1252
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,720
you can see how it starts to lean more

1253
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,599
and more into the kind of language that

1254
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,079
is afforded by recursive relevance

1255
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,880
realization theory

1256
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,560
great one

1257
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,079
closing note um before we move to active

1258
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,040
inference

1259
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,680
is this question of

1260
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,319
does the fact that these models are

1261
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,240
reducing or bounding surprise mean i

1262
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,000
can't have any surprise

1263
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,079
and the nest there's as you pointed out

1264
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,079
there's various ways to approach or

1265
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,520
balance that

1266
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,040
um critique

1267
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,960
for example considering the long term or

1268
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,880
the rate of surprise

1269
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,119
and one of the most powerful responses

1270
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,760
is nested modeling which could be like

1271
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,560
the self-belief i expect and prefer to

1272
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,240
hear from diverse and novel perspectives

1273
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,200
then yes one will be surprised in a

1274
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,839
little sense you know lowercase surprise

1275
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,599
by every phoneme

1276
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,640
but then in a deeper sense who we are

1277
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,960
we can be connected with by hearing new

1278
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,280
information so it's um

1279
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,760
absolutely a valid critique of the

1280
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,960
kernel of a single layer surprise

1281
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,800
minimizer just like you would have

1282
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,119
various trivial critiques of single

1283
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,839
layer reward maximizers however

1284
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,319
especially with nested architectures and

1285
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,000
considering embodiness we can see how

1286
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,640
higher level beliefs about the self

1287
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,480
which can include like the rhetorical

1288
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,839
and the narrative

1289
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,319
absolutely provide a context by which

1290
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,119
lower level surprises are

1291
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,880
accommodated if not surfed on top of

1292
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,359
just one thing i i i think we can make

1293
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,200
we can even make some significant

1294
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,280
progress and i did this in a series with

1295
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,960
greg enriquez and christopher master

1296
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,640
pietro the elusive eye sort of

1297
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,160
integrating predictive processing and

1298
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,839
relevance realization

1299
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,480
models uh to give an account of the self

1300
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,079
you take you know the all the

1301
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,839
accumulating evidence that self

1302
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,440
reference which is really just self

1303
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,520
relevance is the glue of cognition and

1304
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,680
perception relevance realization and

1305
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,920
then you you you can basically integrate

1306
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,640
that with uh howie and other people's i

1307
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,800
think it's how we michael their uh idea

1308
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,520
of uh a predictive processing model uh

1309
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,480
of the self um and then they just

1310
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,079
go together very nicely and then you can

1311
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,480
talk about well there's relevance

1312
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,760
realization to the self and this is not

1313
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,480
just a homuncular thing and you can also

1314
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,720
point out the fact that cells are

1315
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,240
because we're mammalian primates and

1316
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,400
this is greg's point is we learn to turn

1317
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,720
the arrow of relevance the other way we

1318
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,720
we are not just for our whole

1319
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,480
development how are things relevant for

1320
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,440
me

1321
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,000
we also develop how am i relevant

1322
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,800
to others and to the world and even to

1323
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,240
my culture

1324
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,480
and that again starts to connect up with

1325
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,119
meaning in life how am i connected to

1326
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,520
something bigger than myself this is the

1327
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,520
metaphor that people use see what i mean

1328
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,079
there's just so many things that can be

1329
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,800
brought into a convergent and powerful

1330
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,359
conversation once we get this

1331
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,880
integration going i'm not saying it's

1332
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,839
complete but i i i'm trying to at least

1333
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:23,520
make it plausible that it is it has

1334
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,280
plausible promise to extend the scope

1335
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,599
and power of our scientific explanation

1336
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,240
into domains that it has hitherto been

1337
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,599
blocked from getting at

1338
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:36,800
that's heavy

1339
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,920
that's

1340
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,160
a massive cognitive

1341
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,480
entity that's groovy we're in the path

1342
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,119
of least action together let us move to

1343
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,400
active inference

1344
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,599
so right

1345
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:48,960
in the paper

1346
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,599
you mentioned active inference one time

1347
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,520
though i think we can see it uh

1348
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,599
interwoven densely

1349
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,920
and the quotation in the paper was

1350
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,119
pointing to sajid at all 2020's paper it

1351
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,119
has recently been argued that active

1352
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,680
inference and free energy minimization

1353
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,079
necessarily entail the minimization of

1354
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,800
redundancy and the maximization of

1355
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,640
degeneracy

1356
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,800
first just by the way

1357
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,880
i just wanted to highlight redundancy

1358
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,480
and maximization just to give another

1359
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,480
example are drawn directly from cutting

1360
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,640
edge biology i keep wanting to show

1361
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,880
again and again that this is not a

1362
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,359
trivial claim of autophaises and

1363
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,920
embodiment we are making use of

1364
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,720
fundamental biological principles

1365
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,440
uh this is again to give a basis for a

1366
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,559
reply to evan's i think

1367
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,160
everything that evan does is brilliant

1368
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,400
right and so this is but this is a again

1369
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,400
i just i just i i'm sorry

1370
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,240
i take i have a deep respect for his

1371
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,440
critique and i just want to keep

1372
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,920
pointing out here's a possible response

1373
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,800
great

1374
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,640
so we have a few um

1375
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,839
images

1376
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,000
and pieces of information about active

1377
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
inference which we will uncover through

1378
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
action we will reduce our surprise about

1379
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,680
what is under the gray box through

1380
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,319
action but first just wanted to hear

1381
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,680
your perspective

1382
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,160
what is active inference how did it come

1383
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,720
into play and when and what was it doing

1384
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,839
in your recent paper

1385
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,559
so um

1386
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,119
for me and i know there's variation on

1387
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,119
this between people i see active

1388
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:26,160
inference within the predictive

1389
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,559
processing framework because i see

1390
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,119
the idea of the interplay between active

1391
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,319
inference and perception and and that

1392
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,040
first of all um

1393
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,040
mark and brett and many of the people

1394
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,400
that we cite

1395
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,920
are not

1396
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,960
bound to a strict

1397
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,280
propositional logical or sorry the

1398
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,280
logical manipulation of propositions

1399
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,760
when they use the word inference

1400
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,280
if they would do that

1401
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,520
then evan really does have a purchase

1402
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,200
point because then they are being

1403
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,240
they're being locked at the

1404
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,240
propositional level of processing

1405
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,839
they're they're not tapping into all the

1406
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:05,280
non-propositional um you know in in a

1407
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,240
deep way uh but mark for example very

1408
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,960
much an active embodied he says we just

1409
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,880
use imprints because that's was the

1410
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,359
original term and it just stayed as a

1411
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:18,880
as a way of talking

1412
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,880
so the way i think about it is like this

1413
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,400
you have two ways of dealing with the

1414
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,640
error you can change your model or you

1415
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,079
can change the world um and changing

1416
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,440
your model is broadly

1417
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,920
perception i just want to stop here and

1418
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,200
open that up

1419
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,119
when we say perception we don't mean

1420
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,040
what the empiricist gave us with the

1421
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,839
sense of perception we don't mean just a

1422
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,800
purely receptive bottom up taking in of

1423
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,160
information

1424
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,280
because we also mean prediction

1425
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,800
right and so in a very real sense when

1426
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,960
i'm looking around this room

1427
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,000
i'm not detecting most of what i'm

1428
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,839
seeing i'm predicting it now that

1429
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,559
doesn't mean it's an illusion

1430
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,960
true predictions are true if you don't

1431
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,240
believe that you know you don't believe

1432
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,760
in science

1433
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,960
like you have to give up this sort of

1434
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,119
empiricist thing that unless i touched

1435
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,480
it somehow in detection it's not true

1436
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,040
no true predictions are true they are

1437
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,839
real relations they are true to the

1438
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,680
world right in an important way so

1439
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,960
i would put it to you that to get closer

1440
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,280
to what is meant by perception we have

1441
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,280
to take two terms that were separated in

1442
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,920
empiricism and then put a weird

1443
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,359
relationship through the enlightenment

1444
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,319
we have to actually integrate

1445
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,480
imagination and perception together you

1446
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,880
are constantly imagine perceiving and

1447
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,680
percepto imagining your environment but

1448
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,599
that doesn't mean it's an illusion so

1449
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,559
first of all that uh point

1450
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,000
right

1451
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,800
and that opens so much up for explaining

1452
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,800
the the the imagination and

1453
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,440
distinguishing imaginary from imaginal

1454
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,520
and all kinds of important and powerful

1455
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,480
things

1456
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,599
the other thing you can do is you can

1457
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:04,880
change the world

1458
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,720
right and what and i take it that

1459
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,880
active inference is a generic term for

1460
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,800
many different species of how we can

1461
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,599
change the world uh we can change the

1462
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,359
world by

1463
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,280
simply and we're constantly doing this

1464
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,040
by the way um

1465
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,680
we can just slightly alter our

1466
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,599
perspective again the perspectival

1467
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,359
knowing and you're you know and you're

1468
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:30,640
constantly doing this you're constantly

1469
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,880
just shifting your attention around so

1470
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,280
the world is disclosing itself to you in

1471
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,280
new ways and you right and you say well

1472
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,559
that's just a new way of seeing it's not

1473
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,160
just a new way of seeing

1474
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,440
you are disclo you are look

1475
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,960
you can't

1476
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,559
ever see

1477
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:50,319
all of one object you only see

1478
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,160
an aspect of it no matter what you're

1479
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,559
doing yet you think you're seeing the

1480
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,440
whole thing because what you're doing

1481
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,160
with this active inference is you are

1482
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,880
tracking and i really want to play on

1483
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,880
that sensory motor metaphor you are

1484
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,880
tracking the through line between all of

1485
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,520
these aspects for me that's one of the

1486
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,319
fundamental things that active inference

1487
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:15,040
means it means that i am

1488
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,040
look look at how i'm doing and but

1489
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,160
notice how actually you unstable how

1490
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,640
unsurprised you are as i do this

1491
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,839
that

1492
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:26,960
is so

1493
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,960
right active entrance is not just i make

1494
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,520
stuff in the world it is that too you

1495
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,599
know i get the water and i drink it and

1496
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,480
so now i'm no longer thirsty but

1497
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,680
it's even in the it's even in how you

1498
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,800
are tracking which is an action a

1499
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,200
sensory motor action how you are

1500
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,200
tracking the through line in the

1501
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,960
multi-aspectuality

1502
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,640
of anything in the world because the

1503
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,799
amount of information that any object

1504
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,319
can present to you is actually

1505
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:57,200
combinatorially explosive

1506
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,240
for me

1507
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,319
right and again i'm not denying the

1508
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,280
gross motor changes in the world of

1509
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,079
active inference but i'm most interested

1510
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,119
in this cognitive navigation of the

1511
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,880
multi-aspectuality

1512
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,960
and multiple perspectives

1513
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,520
of the world such that we find the

1514
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,040
through line and here's the thing that's

1515
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,880
really intriguing daniel the through

1516
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,599
line is not itself an aspect it's not

1517
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,319
itself a perspective it is something

1518
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,000
that runs through them and ties them

1519
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,559
together and that is the track i propose

1520
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,720
to you of active inference at its most

1521
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,680
primordial level

1522
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,520
excellent i think that golden thread

1523
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,880
is how

1524
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,680
the broader system changes through time

1525
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,720
which

1526
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,880
we model action as influencing how

1527
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,319
things change through time and the

1528
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,280
causal structure of the world um but to

1529
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,880
pull a step back

1530
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,000
you pointed towards the two ways

1531
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,799
that a given agent can reduce the free

1532
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:59,760
energy of their generative model so this

1533
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,480
is not gibbs free energy this isn't the

1534
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,880
thermochemical free energy that causes

1535
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,520
combustion this isn't tesla tech free

1536
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,520
energy though i eagerly await the day

1537
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,079
when that synthesis is made this is an

1538
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:14,559
information theoretic quantity that

1539
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:16,240
bears resemblance

1540
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,240
to the free energy

1541
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,400
calculations used in chemistry and

1542
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,640
physics and other areas and we call that

1543
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,720
bayesian mechanics and the process

1544
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,960
theory by which it occurs being active

1545
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,920
inference and so you point into two ways

1546
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,319
in which a given agent can

1547
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,319
reduce the free energy which bounds the

1548
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,040
surprisal with a tractable heuristic

1549
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,799
of their generative model

1550
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,760
and those are to change the model so

1551
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,040
change one's self and that can subsume

1552
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,720
an entire taxonomy of cognitive types

1553
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,319
and parameters

1554
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,079
as modeled they don't have to be

1555
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,040
specific anatomical region

1556
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,000
and those

1557
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,680
parameters that can be changing to

1558
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,079
reduce free energy of a generative model

1559
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,280
can include the continuum of perception

1560
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,680
learning as well as expectation

1561
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,799
preferences and also models of action

1562
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,280
and the other way in which a given

1563
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,400
entity can bound their free energy

1564
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,480
and seek to reduce it is through taking

1565
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,480
action in the world and so active

1566
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,559
inference is built around the action

1567
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:24,400
perception loop and it gives two meta

1568
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,760
affordances

1569
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,559
for

1570
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,799
reducing the free energy

1571
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,280
by way of minimizing surprise so i'm

1572
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,680
going to go one more level into detail

1573
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,720
with the active inference by revealing

1574
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,040
the first gray box

1575
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,440
so this is an image from

1576
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,359
a recent paper this year by chris

1577
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:45,200
thornton called an informal

1578
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,880
reconstruction of the free energy

1579
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,880
framework examining the conceptual

1580
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,880
problems that arise

1581
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,599
and the red text is a additional

1582
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,079
annotation that we've added into this

1583
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,000
excellent summary figure

1584
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,520
and we can

1585
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,040
read this figure

1586
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,359
as being a uh perhaps a kairos based

1587
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:07,119
historiography it's not a literal

1588
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:09,760
chronology of history but we can see it

1589
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,760
as part of the dialectic of research

1590
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,839
progression and it begins with the

1591
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:16,559
necessity of learning and developing

1592
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,640
which leads one to adopt a bayesian

1593
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,079
inferential scheme

1594
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,839
my personal preference is that last

1595
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:24,240
names don't stay attached to terms but

1596
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,160
bayesian inference broadly just means

1597
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,480
models that update as opposed to for

1598
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,839
example descriptive frequentist

1599
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:33,440
statistics right the necessity of

1600
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,760
heuristics for bayesian inference comes

1601
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,440
very early because exact base is very

1602
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,160
hard to compute especially on large or

1603
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,880
unknown state spaces

1604
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,880
the necessity of heuristics takes a

1605
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,520
further developmental stage

1606
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,920
by the necessity of proxies that bound

1607
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,079
the exact bayesian or even a heuristic

1608
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,559
or approximate bayesian solution and so

1609
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,400
we can consider that like uncertainty

1610
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,760
reduction

1611
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,720
and then

1612
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,000
this is all pre-fristen at all

1613
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,720
um here dion and uh with the bayesian

1614
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,960
brain work and also the work of hinton

1615
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,079
and others

1616
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,000
in level four where we see the free

1617
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,599
energy minimization

1618
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,680
free energy minimization

1619
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,119
is a computational heuristic

1620
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,319
that is already widely in use going back

1621
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,559
to feynman and before

1622
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,400
to uh

1623
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,559
bound uncertainty

1624
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,119
with a attractable computational

1625
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,160
approach

1626
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,960
that includes reducing uncertainty and

1627
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,799
kind of being on this pareto optimal

1628
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:41,359
frontier of uh

1629
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,760
not collapsing uncertainty too much or

1630
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,799
too little

1631
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,480
and in a way that's kind of like the

1632
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,640
energy and the enthalpy term in the

1633
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,400
gibbs free energy world

1634
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,559
except we're in an informational world

1635
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,599
now so that's where we were at before

1636
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:56,559
the

1637
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,359
recent work um in the last say 10 to 20

1638
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:00,240
years

1639
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,920
of especially carl fristen and

1640
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,280
collaborators

1641
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,000
and what thornton points to as some of

1642
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,480
the key contributions that were made

1643
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,599
was this particularly agentic

1644
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,119
interpretation

1645
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:16,000
of the lower four levels

1646
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,160
by suggesting that the figure could be

1647
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,079
separated from the grounds that the

1648
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:22,400
generative model could be separated or

1649
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,280
partitioned from the generative process

1650
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,880
which is the niche

1651
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,160
and that

1652
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,880
entails a process theory which we call

1653
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,319
active inference

1654
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:35,280
which is suggesting a synthesis of

1655
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,200
inference broadly considered as you

1656
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,760
pointed to and action

1657
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,720
and

1658
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,880
finding all the contact points and the

1659
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,799
ways that inference and action come

1660
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:46,880
together just as the term active

1661
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,280
inference would suggest which means like

1662
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,839
action is used to improve inference you

1663
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:55,119
turn over the object inference is about

1664
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:57,920
action it's about selecting action it's

1665
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,000
about learning the consequences of

1666
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,079
action and how conditional they are on

1667
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:03,760
world states and other hidden state

1668
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,359
inferences and so the one level seven

1669
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,520
that we can bring in which in the active

1670
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,520
inference textbook is called the high

1671
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,520
road to active inference is the

1672
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,760
necessity of persistence and quite

1673
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,240
simply objects that aren't acting at

1674
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,359
least as if they're surviving will not

1675
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:24,640
be around to be observed later so

1676
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,799
whether it's a rock or whether it's a

1677
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:28,799
computer or whether it's a biological

1678
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:29,839
system

1679
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:32,000
it must at least be acting for the time

1680
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,240
that you're observing it or modeling it

1681
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,319
as if it is surviving

1682
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,960
in a potentially very complex

1683
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,400
statistical

1684
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,359
niche

1685
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:43,920
and so these six levels um do an

1686
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,359
excellent job of describing how general

1687
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:49,440
statistical and learning frameworks like

1688
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,359
bayesian statistics

1689
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,280
can become

1690
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,280
improved and elaborated upon through

1691
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,880
computational

1692
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,640
approaches which have only been

1693
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,319
developed for example the bayesian graph

1694
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,400
approach and so on in the previous

1695
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,319
several decades

1696
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:06,880
in the agentic frame

1697
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,680
directly leads us to considerations of

1698
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,760
active inference and understanding how

1699
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,599
inference and self-modeling including

1700
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:16,079
self-modeling about action of the agent

1701
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,319
are a way that either we can either

1702
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:19,520
think of what

1703
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,240
agents are actually doing or at the very

1704
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,960
least we can model what agents are doing

1705
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,440
through active inference

1706
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,559
excellent

1707
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,559
i'd like to i don't know this paper uh

1708
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,319
it looks like a paper i would like to

1709
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:35,440
have uh so i'll i'll ask you to send me

1710
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,520
a link later

1711
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,200
awesome so then

1712
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,599
do you want to add any more or we can go

1713
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,280
one more level

1714
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,240
i mean i i i think uh uh i don't know if

1715
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,240
what i'm proposing is an a a is an

1716
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,319
additional level maybe it is or maybe

1717
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:53,359
it's a way of adding a dimension to the

1718
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:54,559
highest level

1719
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:57,359
uh or dimensions to all of the at least

1720
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:00,480
maybe level seven six and five uh

1721
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,280
relevance realization um and then again

1722
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,440
we we uh relevance realization and

1723
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,359
predictive processing have common

1724
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,520
ancestors uh jeff hinton who of course

1725
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,000
was at u of t uh and deep learning was

1726
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,240
one of the explicit things we drew upon

1727
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,760
when we were trying to talk about

1728
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,240
relevance realization and remember the

1729
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,640
title of the paper relevance realization

1730
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,559
and the emerging framework in cognitive

1731
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,400
science we were trying to say look there

1732
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,160
are general strategies in different

1733
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,799
areas that look remarkably similar and

1734
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:30,720
they seem to be strategies for dealing

1735
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,640
with this central problem of relevance

1736
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,079
realization

1737
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,960
we could see the organism's persistence

1738
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:37,880
or

1739
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,720
eco-evolutionary fitness as being like

1740
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,880
the environment as the selector of

1741
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,400
relevance

1742
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,400
and then we can think the view from the

1743
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,119
inside the psychological or even

1744
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,400
experiential aspects of relevance to be

1745
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,960
um a part of that broader system and we

1746
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,160
can imagine kind of two cases one is

1747
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,599
where the the organisms experience and

1748
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:04,079
cognition around relevance is aligned

1749
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,559
with ecologically selective fitness

1750
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,720
yes at which case you're going to find

1751
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,079
that entity

1752
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:12,319
surviving and thriving you can also

1753
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:15,599
imagine where relevance leads us askew

1754
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,000
and things become relevant whether it's

1755
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,839
repetitive behavior self-destructive

1756
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:22,000
behavior through information filtering

1757
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,240
all these cases in which our relevance

1758
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,760
realization

1759
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,640
is

1760
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,599
missing the mark it sins with respect to

1761
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,520
the ecological selection

1762
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,559
exactly and that's my point how

1763
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,960
the very process that makes you adaptive

1764
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,960
also makes you perennially susceptible

1765
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,119
to self-destructive self-destructive

1766
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,079
behavior you sin you miss the mark in a

1767
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:48,160
way that you can't realize you're doing

1768
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,079
and we calibrate and we learn as long as

1769
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:52,880
we

1770
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,240
are around

1771
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,240
right well what i meant is as long as

1772
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,039
you're remaining in your sin that it it

1773
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,559
itself encloses and the adaptivity

1774
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,799
the ability of an adaptive system to

1775
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:07,200
reduce reduce perturbation means when

1776
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,799
you have these kinds of parasitic

1777
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,599
processing going on it hijacks that

1778
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,920
adductivity and prevents your attempts

1779
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,559
to perturb it and break and help you

1780
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,559
break out of the inappropriate framing

1781
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,400
that's why you need very comprehensive

1782
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,559
ecologies of practices in order to

1783
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,119
cultivate wisdom it's why simply knowing

1784
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:27,119
that you shouldn't do that same stupid

1785
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:28,400
thing you do in your romantic

1786
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,039
relationships is massively insufficient

1787
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,799
for not doing that same stupid thing you

1788
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:33,920
keep doing in your romantic

1789
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,400
relationships

1790
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,799
yes in the agentic framework

1791
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:41,520
with the ecological richness that is

1792
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,720
being brought in

1793
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,720
helps us contextualize and take a

1794
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,960
pluralistic approach towards the various

1795
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,880
kinds of interventions which might be

1796
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,200
suggested because interventions for

1797
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,400
different kinds of relevance um

1798
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,880
you know mal alignments self-perceived

1799
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,880
other perceived and cases where there's

1800
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,039
conflict there they could include like

1801
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:03,720
neurochemical it could include an

1802
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,599
action-oriented there's so many

1803
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,000
different ways in which this nexus of

1804
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,400
the entity engaging in inference and

1805
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,440
action can be modified and shaped

1806
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,720
that um without integrative models

1807
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,559
to help us understand

1808
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,160
it can descend into kind of a

1809
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,520
disciplinary

1810
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,839
preference show off

1811
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,839
yeah yeah with the church of the level i

1812
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:27,599
call it the church of the level of

1813
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,760
analysis you believe everybody should be

1814
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,680
working at yes

1815
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:35,680
great so let's look at a second

1816
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,720
aspect of active inference which is its

1817
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,160
uh formal

1818
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,359
basis

1819
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:43,920
now there are many ongoing developments

1820
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,240
in the formalisms around octave

1821
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,480
inference and the free energy principle

1822
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,880
and so this is barely even the tip of

1823
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,520
the iceberg but hopefully showing these

1824
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,000
formalisms which we explore in much

1825
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,720
greater detail in many of the other uh

1826
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,640
several hundred live streams that you'll

1827
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,200
find at the active inference institute

1828
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,119
um just to show

1829
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:07,440
a few of the aspects of the formalism so

1830
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,599
people can triangulate

1831
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,240
and have a little bit of a sense for

1832
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,880
where is active inference between so

1833
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,279
this is from a paper of de costa at all

1834
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,920
from 2020 active inference on discrete

1835
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,399
state spaces a synthesis

1836
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,640
so i'll make this image as large as i

1837
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,560
can

1838
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,679
there's two key aspects

1839
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:31,679
in this figure

1840
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,120
the top

1841
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,600
which we won't go into detail in

1842
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,238
is describing two types of inference

1843
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:40,158
which are on the bottom perceptual

1844
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,799
inference which is like a best fitting

1845
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:44,719
estimate for perception

1846
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:46,238
given the sensory data which are

1847
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:48,640
incoming which includes the blind spot

1848
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,319
and the low resolution outside of the

1849
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:52,000
fovea and the lack of color vision

1850
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,520
outside the fovean all these other

1851
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,719
attributes of our generative model such

1852
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:57,920
that we even know that we're in a

1853
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,000
generative model and not for example

1854
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,920
within some sort of naive signal

1855
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,040
processing uh inward only view so i see

1856
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,279
this as just absolute slam dunk for

1857
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:08,960
predictive processing architectures

1858
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,279
broadly that we don't experience the

1859
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,359
blind spot we don't see it and that's

1860
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,839
normal because our salience has been

1861
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:18,399
tuned down to blurriness in that area

1862
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:20,399
and so on and in the top

1863
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:22,238
we have expected free energy

1864
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,158
minimization which in contrast with the

1865
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:26,399
variational free energy minimization

1866
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,960
expected free energy is prospective it's

1867
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,920
about selecting expect amongst

1868
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,080
policies sequences of actions sequences

1869
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,719
of affordances that can be expected to

1870
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,960
result in different outcomes now the

1871
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,960
entity could be wrong and that could

1872
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,198
lead to the entity not existing but

1873
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,839
within the scope of the generative model

1874
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:47,439
expected free energy is how different

1875
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:48,640
policies

1876
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,520
about one's own world states about the

1877
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,400
markov blanket here which are the set of

1878
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,280
perceptual and active nodes that mediate

1879
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,920
the interface between the entity and the

1880
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,199
niche

1881
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,679
the way that those are balanced in

1882
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,760
prospective inference is summarized on

1883
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:06,880
the top

1884
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,239
and then it's quite interesting to look

1885
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:10,159
at some of these special cases on the

1886
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:12,239
bottom and so we can think about these

1887
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,400
as like the polls

1888
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,480
in which the big tent of active

1889
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,960
inference is propped up on

1890
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,600
these are cases where when one parameter

1891
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,480
is minimized or maximized or doesn't

1892
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,040
exist there are various special cases

1893
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,840
that arise so just to give a few

1894
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,040
examples

1895
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:34,080
where there is no preference

1896
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,120
we see

1897
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,840
information gain maximization

1898
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,480
that's like a pure novelty search

1899
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,840
in contrast

1900
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,440
where we have no ambiguity or risk

1901
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,920
so we have complete information

1902
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,480
then we can engage in classical

1903
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,120
utility-like calculations

1904
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,800
so that's kind of like when we don't

1905
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,480
have to learn anything or reduce our

1906
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,679
uncertainty

1907
01:10:57,679 --> 01:10:58,640
then

1908
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,440
that's a special case in which pragmatic

1909
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,679
value alone can be pursued where

1910
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,840
pragmatic value has been taken off the

1911
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,400
table because all outcomes are equal

1912
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,000
because our preferences across them are

1913
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:10,880
flat

1914
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:11,679
then

1915
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:13,760
the inference can move into a more

1916
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,320
exploratory mode represented by like

1917
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,080
optimal surprise or information

1918
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,440
maximization

1919
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,360
and there are some deeper and more

1920
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,760
subtle links with maximum entropy

1921
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,320
principles but this is just to show a

1922
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,320
few of the kinds of formalisms that we

1923
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,640
explore in active inference which bring

1924
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,760
together many previous threads in

1925
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,080
perceptional perceptual inference as

1926
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,080
well as inference about action for

1927
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,400
example from cybernetics control theory

1928
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,879
and so on

1929
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,600
just a few notes

1930
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,560
um and then one last piece that i think

1931
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,840
will um

1932
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,400
hopefully connect us to thinking about

1933
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,760
communication

1934
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,320
culture and then also bridge to the

1935
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,960
questions that i've seen stack up in the

1936
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,320
live chat

1937
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,520
so these are um from the active

1938
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,800
inference ontology which is a project

1939
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,480
at the active inference institute that

1940
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,679
we've been developing for uh well over

1941
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:13,199
a year now

1942
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:14,880
and what we have

1943
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,719
is a uh

1944
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:18,719
what started as a terms list but

1945
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:20,719
continues to develop to be much much

1946
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:24,320
more and we think of active inference in

1947
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:27,199
building competency and familiarity with

1948
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:29,440
learning and applying active inference

1949
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,440
in terms of quite literally skilled

1950
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,920
performance of a language

1951
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,000
the terms and how they're related

1952
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,800
constitute the active inference ontology

1953
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,080
and so two views that speak hopefully to

1954
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,000
the directions that this can help us

1955
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,840
pursue rigor as well as accessibility

1956
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:48,880
simple

1957
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,120
english definitions

1958
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,239
that link to other terms just like you'd

1959
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:56,080
see in a dictionary a dictionary doesn't

1960
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,320
really tell you what the word means it

1961
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,080
just has more words

1962
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,239
yet it still is considered a useful

1963
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,239
artifact by those who are learning and

1964
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:06,000
applying a language and so that's

1965
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,159
exactly what our

1966
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:11,040
terms and definitions provide which are

1967
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,600
natural language definitions for some of

1968
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,920
these terms which often straddle the

1969
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,199
line or confuse optimally between

1970
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:22,239
everyday usages and technical usages

1971
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:24,560
again surprise attention all these

1972
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,560
different terms which you might hear

1973
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,360
day to day being used informally

1974
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,199
they sometimes are used both in an

1975
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,679
informal and quite technical sense in

1976
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:36,320
active inference and a second aspect

1977
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,159
that's been a great

1978
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:41,040
direction and and really inclusive area

1979
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,480
of participation

1980
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,199
is with translating all of those terms

1981
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:47,600
into different natural languages

1982
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,880
so here we see english as well as

1983
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,199
equal partners with spanish portuguese

1984
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:56,719
french italian russian hebrew persian

1985
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,360
and hopefully many more to come

1986
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,320
and so by treating this linguistic

1987
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,640
artifact as a collaborative and

1988
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,800
participatory project

1989
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,880
and being able to bring in

1990
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,440
natural languages that people have as

1991
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,760
well as bring in computer languages like

1992
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,080
our nomenclature and how we name

1993
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,080
computer variables

1994
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:18,800
we

1995
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,600
aim for something like a triple play

1996
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,920
where we can connect natural language

1997
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,520
descriptions

1998
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,560
of

1999
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,400
everyday settings or of contrived

2000
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,520
settings

2001
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,199
those everyday natural language

2002
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:33,920
descriptions can be visualized

2003
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,000
and they can also be rendered as

2004
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,760
executable models

2005
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,640
because we see that as where the promise

2006
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,480
of applying active inference can be most

2007
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,679
powerful

2008
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:46,080
when people are engaging

2009
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:49,280
in the skills and in the ways that feel

2010
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,480
natural and meaningful to them such as

2011
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,360
in community engaging in practices

2012
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,400
and that is supported and scaffolded in

2013
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,600
feedback

2014
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,000
with computational systems that

2015
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,400
facilitate the communication

2016
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,280
and

2017
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,600
imagination around the discussion for

2018
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,520
example visualization

2019
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:14,159
and also provide in the same flow

2020
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,880
executable simulations so it's not just

2021
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,400
like there's people who are having a

2022
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,880
conversation at the chalkboard and then

2023
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,560
the modelers go take it into a different

2024
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,400
room and that's where like the alchemy

2025
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,840
happens

2026
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,360
we think that by connecting the ontology

2027
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,560
with

2028
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,080
natural terms

2029
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,480
and computational representations that

2030
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,320
there will be new ways

2031
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,560
to be developing certain kinds of

2032
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,760
cognitive

2033
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,520
models and infrastructure together

2034
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,320
so you're actually trying to afford

2035
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,719
wisdom

2036
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,159
what does that mean or what does it look

2037
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,600
like

2038
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,159
well i mean insofar as you're helping

2039
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:57,760
people to applaud sophia into promises

2040
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,040
these are the two words for wisdom and

2041
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,120
ancient greek sophia is your knowledge

2042
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,120
of first principles and phromesis is how

2043
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,080
you apply it within a particular context

2044
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,320
so that it is effective both giving you

2045
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,880
virtuosity and virtue you're trying to

2046
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,719
help people translate sofia into

2047
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:15,760
phronesis uh which is

2048
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,239
the sort of meta ability that is

2049
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:22,400
required for people to be genuinely wise

2050
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,600
with virtuosity and virtue

2051
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,159
i see a lot of

2052
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:31,360
what

2053
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:32,960
could be

2054
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,800
positive for

2055
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,840
research and technical areas which is

2056
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,360
it's not enough to have virtuosity alone

2057
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,679
someone could be very skilled at taking

2058
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:44,560
aim

2059
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,640
in a variety of different domains maybe

2060
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,880
one domain maybe across domains

2061
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,600
but without virtue

2062
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,840
then

2063
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,040
what

2064
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,480
you have skill and capacity without

2065
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,679
alignment

2066
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,840
maybe even the propositional belief that

2067
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,199
alignment doesn't exist or it's

2068
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,360
impossible it's useless or worthless or

2069
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,880
meaningless

2070
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,760
and then all that virtuosity

2071
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,040
to say it's for naught would be an

2072
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,159
understatement because that person

2073
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:13,840
already made that claim but it could be

2074
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,520
worse than for not

2075
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,560
and so

2076
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,679
yeah and

2077
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,280
i want to say the opposite is also the

2078
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,679
case virtue without virtuosity

2079
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,560
is something that undermines

2080
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,199
uh the respect that virtue is due

2081
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:28,880
because you have people

2082
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,400
sort of

2083
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,960
attempting virtue without having the

2084
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,159
capacity

2085
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:36,480
the virtuosity needed to genuinely

2086
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:39,520
empower it in the world

2087
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,920
and so that's also problematic

2088
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,679
and so you can get you can get the

2089
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:45,760
reduction of virtue to

2090
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,040
following simplistic rules or merely

2091
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,280
signaling the presence of something

2092
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,600
without having the requisite virtuosity

2093
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:58,360
to bring it reliably into being

2094
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:04,000
how does what you've been working on

2095
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:07,360
point towards or help us come to terms

2096
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:11,559
with wise technologies

2097
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,080
so that's

2098
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,440
i mean

2099
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,719
for me

2100
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:19,120
i try to take

2101
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,920
i mean a big part of my pr i wear three

2102
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,040
hats

2103
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,000
one is

2104
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,520
the scientist hat which i've been mostly

2105
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,880
wearing today

2106
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,480
in our conversation

2107
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:32,239
but i also uh i also wear a hat where i

2108
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:33,840
help to

2109
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,800
develop teach curate create cultivate

2110
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,880
ecologies and practices

2111
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,400
as you said pluralism i wanted to

2112
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,000
strengthen the pluralism point you made

2113
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:42,880
but i

2114
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,400
wasn't right for me to intervene at the

2115
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,480
time pluralism i mean

2116
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,800
one of the things that the framework i'm

2117
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,760
i'm proposing with brat and mark

2118
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,360
is to

2119
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,920
note that a lot of relevance realization

2120
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,159
enhanced predictive processing is taking

2121
01:18:58,159 --> 01:18:59,120
place

2122
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,560
by

2123
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,080
making use

2124
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,800
of trade-off relationships between

2125
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,199
different values different

2126
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:09,199
properties of the environment i gave you

2127
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:10,400
the opponent processing with the

2128
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,400
detention you can think of the opponent

2129
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,560
processing within the autonomic nervous

2130
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,800
system for constantly calibrating so

2131
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,640
what you do is you get a system that is

2132
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,480
two systems that are biased in opposite

2133
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,320
directions one is trying to interpret

2134
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,400
everything as threat and opportunity

2135
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,840
another one is trying to interpret

2136
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,800
everything as uh safety and uh

2137
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,679
recuperation and they're pulling in on

2138
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,280
each other like this constantly and

2139
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,199
that's how your level of arousal in a

2140
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:37,199
non-homuncular fashion is constantly

2141
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:40,400
evolving its calibration to the world so

2142
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,280
many examples of this uh right often in

2143
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,440
multiple

2144
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,800
multiple dimensions where i mean

2145
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,960
trade-off relationships that are also in

2146
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,560
trade-off relationships with each other

2147
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,480
that's why i use the metaphor of an

2148
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,719
ecology if you think of ecology as all

2149
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:57,040
these checks and balances both you know

2150
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,120
at the same level and between levels of

2151
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,560
organization

2152
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,760
ecology there is no panacea practice no

2153
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,920
free lunch theorem etc etc there is no

2154
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:09,040
panacea practice they right you need you

2155
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,600
need to get a dynamic ecology of

2156
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,960
practices

2157
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,560
that

2158
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,560
well optimizes

2159
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,600
for

2160
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,719
that

2161
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:21,760
multi-layered opponent processing

2162
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,960
and

2163
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:23,760
so

2164
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,239
i try to use

2165
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:28,640
my knowledge as a scientist

2166
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,400
to look for

2167
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,360
places within traditional and emerging

2168
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,840
ecologies of practices where i can see

2169
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,560
those design principles being applied

2170
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,760
very well or being developed very well

2171
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:45,199
and then i help to develop those

2172
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:47,360
cultivate them uh help build those

2173
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,560
communities

2174
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,000
and

2175
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,760
then

2176
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,760
that takes me into my third hat which i

2177
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,159
didn't ever think i'd be wearing and i'm

2178
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:58,880
wearing which is what is it to build

2179
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,960
these communities so that

2180
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:01,760
the

2181
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:04,480
wisdom of individual cognition

2182
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,560
and the wisdom of distributed cognition

2183
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,280
are

2184
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,199
optimally aligned

2185
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:12,159
so that we have the best access within a

2186
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:13,679
community and then build those

2187
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:15,120
communities into communities of

2188
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,640
communities

2189
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:17,679
that's

2190
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:19,760
uh this project that i now find i'm

2191
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,239
actually engaged in a lot

2192
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:24,239
i do not claim to have any particular

2193
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:26,159
expertise for this it's just that i have

2194
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:28,560
fallen into it and i seem to be the

2195
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,360
person that is undertaking it so that's

2196
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,520
why i'm sort of hesitant but i'm doing

2197
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,679
it with other people um

2198
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:37,360
and so

2199
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,280
the answer to your question is i wear

2200
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,600
these three hats and i try to integrate

2201
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,679
them so that they mutually afford and

2202
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:45,280
constrain each other as much as i

2203
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,000
possibly can

2204
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:53,280
very interesting a lot to

2205
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,440
say there

2206
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,639
uh

2207
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:59,199
there's a few ways we can go i think

2208
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:00,560
let's

2209
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,280
bring up one topic and then we'll go in

2210
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,840
the end to the uh questions so if people

2211
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,600
have any questions please feel free to

2212
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,199
add them now

2213
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:11,280
and it's a term that's one of

2214
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,360
my personal favorites which is oh i like

2215
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,159
it

2216
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:16,000
i like this term you introduced the i

2217
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,440
did not know this term until our

2218
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,280
previous conversation off camera where

2219
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,719
you introduced this term to me which i

2220
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:22,639
really liked

2221
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:25,840
it's a great term arising from work on

2222
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:30,080
insects and the uh work of haligan

2223
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,560
defines stigma g as a mechanism of

2224
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,280
indirect coordination in which the trace

2225
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:38,239
left by an action in a medium stimulates

2226
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:40,639
subsequent actions stigma g enables

2227
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:43,440
complex coordinated activity without any

2228
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,920
need for planning control communication

2229
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,800
simultaneous presence or even mutual

2230
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,480
awareness

2231
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,320
i think it's a really fascinating and

2232
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,480
provocative idea because a lot of times

2233
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,480
when we hear about

2234
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,400
collective intelligence or just

2235
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,120
collective algorithms more broadly there

2236
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:04,719
are examples like flocks of birds which

2237
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:07,280
absolutely swarm and flock and they use

2238
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,960
visual coordination but they don't leave

2239
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,480
a trace on their aerial environment or

2240
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,719
you have the examples of traffic jams or

2241
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:17,199
of swarms or mobs of people in which

2242
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:18,800
case again there's jostling there's

2243
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,400
contact amongst entities

2244
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,920
but a trace is not left and so those

2245
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,600
one might think of as like a live

2246
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,120
conversation

2247
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,840
where no trace is recorded and that kind

2248
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,679
of synchronous coordination is

2249
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:33,679
absolutely an important component to

2250
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:34,800
consider

2251
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,120
but especially when we think about at

2252
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,679
least two incredibly important cases

2253
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:42,400
which are our digital environments and

2254
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,159
the various modifications that we make

2255
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:47,520
to them and our physical ecosystems and

2256
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,280
the kinds of modifications that are made

2257
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,960
to these niches

2258
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,880
neither of those cases

2259
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,440
are going to even be hinted at if we

2260
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:58,080
only consider non-stigmatic collective

2261
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,239
behavior and collective wisdom

2262
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:03,280
and so um in some recent work with

2263
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,400
colleagues

2264
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,800
we've continued exploration that has

2265
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,800
been existing since the earliest days of

2266
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,719
wikipedia and before

2267
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:13,760
around digital coordination as digital

2268
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:16,080
stigmergy because although there are

2269
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,560
times for synchronous coordination

2270
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,040
for example in this conversation

2271
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,400
broadly

2272
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,040
through all kinds of modifications

2273
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,679
including this video as an artifact that

2274
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,760
could be re-watched or transcribed or

2275
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,440
analyzed in the future

2276
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:34,080
broadly communication

2277
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,040
in the online setting can be said to

2278
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,280
result in complex coordinated activity

2279
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,600
without the need for planning control

2280
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,800
etc etc so just wanted to hear your

2281
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,560
thoughts on stick mercy yeah i've got

2282
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:47,600
three things i want to say about that

2283
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,280
because it's super cool

2284
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,320
first of all uh i i for me where stigma

2285
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:56,320
jury uh really called out for me is is

2286
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,280
how it affords cultural ratcheting uh a

2287
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,880
proposal that one of our primary

2288
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,639
capacities for adaptivity is cultural

2289
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,560
ratcheting which means we don't really

2290
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,960
learn from scratch we can't we we come

2291
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,199
in and culture has preserved previous

2292
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:11,360
learning and then we ratchet it up so we

2293
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,040
culturally ratchet

2294
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,440
in a very powerful way and so that gives

2295
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,840
us a kind of adaptivity that is closed

2296
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:18,880
off to

2297
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,280
most organisms there are a few species

2298
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,800
that you could plausibly say chimps

2299
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,639
bonobos

2300
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:26,159
maybe some evidence from dolphins and

2301
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:28,159
elephants uh where there's something

2302
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:32,400
like a culture um uh but this now this

2303
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,239
is where human beings excel and stigma

2304
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:36,080
major seems to fit right in there

2305
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,440
powerfully

2306
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,440
and you wanna you wanna note

2307
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:42,480
that um what we're doing right now

2308
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,960
is so and so important because we're

2309
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,840
actually where we're we're we are

2310
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,679
collapsing the boundary that used to be

2311
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:50,400
the

2312
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:54,000
exists between live speech and writing

2313
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,239
because we have all the spontaneity

2314
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:57,280
of this

2315
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,440
but then we it's preserved and it can

2316
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,440
enter into this meta dialogue with other

2317
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,440
videos where people are moving between

2318
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,560
the videos in dialogical fashion um

2319
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,960
until you get this layering effect

2320
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,639
which is also working within the

2321
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:13,199
cultural ratcheting and that is very

2322
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:14,639
very interesting and needs to be

2323
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,159
explored

2324
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:17,199
so

2325
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:19,600
that's cool and then uh

2326
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,800
i wanted to connect what you just said

2327
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,960
with the issue that

2328
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,800
the neuroscientist reid montague talks

2329
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,760
about of mutual modeling

2330
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,360
and this is something that i think needs

2331
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,280
to be properly integrated

2332
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,239
into this overarching framework that's

2333
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,639
being built um i've done some work

2334
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:40,400
especially with respect to

2335
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,159
aspects of consciousness mutual modeling

2336
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:42,960
so

2337
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,480
um

2338
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,719
he talks about that you you faced a

2339
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:48,400
certain kind of problem

2340
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,360
um in communication um

2341
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,280
um and it's he calls it the it's an

2342
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,120
efficiency paradox so

2343
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,520
the idea is well one of the things i

2344
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,440
need to do to increase efficiency is to

2345
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:02,000
reduce acting at cross purposes so i

2346
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,760
reduce acting at cross purposes by

2347
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,239
having two or more systems talk

2348
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,880
more to each other they communicate more

2349
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,880
but another way classically of course by

2350
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,560
which i improve efficiency is i reduce

2351
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:17,440
the metabolic costs or whatever the cost

2352
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,560
of

2353
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,239
my problem solving

2354
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:23,120
and of course communication is very time

2355
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,960
and energy expensive

2356
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,000
uh

2357
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,040
and so

2358
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,600
he says notice how these and i'm doing

2359
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,960
this on purpose are in a trade-off

2360
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,199
relationship right the more we

2361
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:34,960
communicate the more we increase our

2362
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,280
costs and we lose efficiency

2363
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,360
the more we reduce communication we

2364
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,600
reduce our metabolic costs but we

2365
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,840
increase acting at cross purposes and

2366
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,679
our efficiency also goes down how do we

2367
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:47,600
solve this and then he gives the he

2368
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,280
gives a wonderful analogy before he

2369
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,040
moves to the brain and he says we'll

2370
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,080
consider an old married couple happily

2371
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,679
married some people stay married because

2372
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:56,719
they hate each other and that's the best

2373
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:58,239
way they can torture each other but i'm

2374
01:27:58,239 --> 01:27:59,440
talking about people who stay married

2375
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,159
because they they they are are loved

2376
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:04,159
they have almost like this telepathy

2377
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:06,000
with each other

2378
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,600
and he didn't quite use this language

2379
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,600
but he uses the language of modeling but

2380
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,440
i think calling it generative modeling

2381
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,840
is no imposition on him and he says

2382
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,840
his his example is straight that's too

2383
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,760
strong like a straight relationship i'm

2384
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,040
just going to use that for ease of

2385
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,960
reference i'm not prioritizing that or

2386
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,040
making any uh cultural claim i'm just

2387
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,639
saying it's easier to talk because i can

2388
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:27,120
just quickly use common language right

2389
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,480
so the husband

2390
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:31,440
right has a generative model of his wife

2391
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:32,960
and the wife has a generative model of

2392
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,199
the husband so that they can actually

2393
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:37,040
coordinate their behavior without having

2394
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,920
to talk to each other very much so

2395
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,440
that's where he leaves it now what i

2396
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,400
argued is

2397
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,800
kinda that's right but you have to cycle

2398
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,239
because periodically they have to come

2399
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:49,040
back together and talk to each other

2400
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,400
right to make sure their model the

2401
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:51,920
general models aren't getting out of

2402
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,639
whack and then they can go off and do

2403
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:56,560
their coordinated uncommunicating

2404
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,280
behavior and they cycle and then i said

2405
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,960
you can you can actually see the brain

2406
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,920
doing this it you do the task focused

2407
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,440
where you're processing all the world

2408
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,960
and your coordinate all these different

2409
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,800
areas of the brain are coordinated

2410
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,400
without having to communicate much on

2411
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,880
the task and then you go to default mode

2412
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,080
where what are they doing well they're

2413
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,360
all centrally hubbed and they're all

2414
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,199
checking in with each other because you

2415
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:19,600
you just do all this sort of you know uh

2416
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,400
you know self-referential imagination

2417
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,320
making sure all the models are in sync

2418
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:27,600
and then you go back on the world

2419
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,440
you know sync up again go back on the

2420
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,520
world sync up again all these trade-off

2421
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,080
relationships and how you resolve

2422
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:34,880
the

2423
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,800
the paradox and then i thought you know

2424
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:39,199
mutual modeling and stigma g right like

2425
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:41,840
they really belong together as

2426
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,239
underlying concepts now montague's

2427
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:45,679
argument is

2428
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:47,760
you see the brain adopting this strategy

2429
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,080
you see the brain doing this

2430
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,960
all right where you've got areas are are

2431
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,719
engaged in generative modeling of each

2432
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:56,480
other and think how easily this could

2433
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,400
fit into predictive processing framework

2434
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,280
because

2435
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:00,960
there's areas of the brain are

2436
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,199
predicting other errors but the idea in

2437
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:04,639
any you know you can point to evidence

2438
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:06,320
of synesthesia

2439
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,120
uh cross-modal enhancement of perception

2440
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:12,400
uh the fact that one uh supposedly

2441
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,719
specialized area like acoustics can

2442
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:16,560
actually take over sight in people that

2443
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,239
teach blind people who teach themselves

2444
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:20,400
echolocation synesthesia and a whole

2445
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,040
bunch of other things just pile up as

2446
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,639
evidence that the brain is adopting this

2447
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:26,960
strategy and so i thought

2448
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,440
this was an interesting thing because

2449
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,840
this notion in one sense points to

2450
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,639
cultural ratcheting and stigma g and

2451
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:36,719
mutual modeling between people but it

2452
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:40,239
also points inward um to mutual modeling

2453
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:42,320
within the brain and like i said i think

2454
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:45,199
this is so close already to

2455
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:47,199
a lot of what's going on in the

2456
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:48,400
framework we're talking about they're

2457
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,639
bringing this in and then again then we

2458
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:52,639
could extend the explanation to things

2459
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:55,120
like synesthesia

2460
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,440
that you can get cross-modal enhancement

2461
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,239
that you can have one area of the brain

2462
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:01,920
supposedly dedicated to one sense

2463
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:05,040
modality picking up the ability for uh

2464
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:09,280
right in rehabilitation etc etc etc

2465
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:12,320
well two two layers of marital stigma g

2466
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,800
the first would be the neuroanatomical

2467
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,320
stigma g by which local synaptic changes

2468
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,320
and other sort of neuro architectural

2469
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:21,520
changes

2470
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,760
enable complex coordinated activity

2471
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,679
without the need for a central neuron so

2472
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:27,600
at the micro scale we have the

2473
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,600
physicality of learning excellent and

2474
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,120
then

2475
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,960
there's the post-it note

2476
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,880
and there's the note on the door there's

2477
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,280
the modification of the environment

2478
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:40,239
which is stimulating subsequent activity

2479
01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:42,960
and it doesn't need to be the recipe for

2480
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,920
dinner it can just be a note or an

2481
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,560
inside joke and so when we have a model

2482
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,239
that's integrative and allows us to

2483
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:53,440
situate advanced cognitive agents

2484
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,520
in their niche

2485
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,000
then we can actually bring in those

2486
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
kinds of modifications which is the root

2487
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,400
of stigma g to mark stigma

2488
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:05,280
not in a taboo way but to mark the

2489
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:06,400
environment

2490
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,880
and the ways that that can elicit action

2491
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,480
whether it's again a post-it note on the

2492
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:13,440
door in the relationship or a comment on

2493
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,440
a video these are all ways that we can

2494
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,120
spur others to action

2495
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,840
or and so you can just when you can take

2496
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,320
the mutual modeling idea and then do

2497
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,000
george herbert mead

2498
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,239
you're right you're in a baseball you're

2499
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:27,920
on a baseball team and you don't

2500
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,840
necessarily need to form a specific

2501
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,080
model of all the other players you might

2502
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,000
want to have that a bit but you can he

2503
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,120
he said what you do is you create the

2504
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:38,400
generalized other you create a model uh

2505
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,239
right will allow you to interact with

2506
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:42,639
all of them very effectively and so

2507
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:45,520
right we can carry around we can like

2508
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,000
we we can have stackings we can have

2509
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,800
more specific mutual models for how i

2510
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:53,840
relate to my partner but then they are

2511
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,080
in a right dynamic recursive

2512
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,159
relationship with a generalized

2513
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:02,080
other model uh and that also is a trace

2514
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,719
of others like in the guts of our

2515
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:06,639
cognitive modeling in a very very

2516
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:08,480
powerful way

2517
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:12,000
yes multi-player rituals

2518
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,639
as cultural ratcheting

2519
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:17,280
enables people to be involved in

2520
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,679
cumulative as well as re-experienced and

2521
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:23,600
reimagined cultural praxis and

2522
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,560
if there's a level to generalize out to

2523
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,560
perhaps it is one of them that is

2524
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,480
relevant such that we can have

2525
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,719
participatory ritual

2526
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:33,760
as

2527
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,040
one can say every single culture has

2528
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,800
but taking

2529
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,320
awareness

2530
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:43,199
and wisdom into the process

2531
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:44,719
of shaping

2532
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:46,560
our rituals so maybe they can be aligned

2533
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,400
with our preferences

2534
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:49,920
that's exactly right and there's a whole

2535
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,400
movement and i'm i'm involved in it uh

2536
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,960
and i i spoke to this one at the a

2537
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,480
recent invited lecture i gave at

2538
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,440
cambridge about uh ritual knowing and

2539
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,040
the connections between ritual the

2540
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:05,679
imaginal and being rational um and so

2541
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:08,719
very much very much uh i'll

2542
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:10,239
allow me i'll give you one instance of

2543
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:12,159
this

2544
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:13,440
and think about how this goes to

2545
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,960
updating and all the stuff we're talking

2546
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,320
about in predictive processing and

2547
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,639
reducing surprise okay so

2548
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:19,840
um

2549
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,199
you go into academics who are supposed

2550
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:22,719
to be the cream of the crop

2551
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:24,000
so a little bit of self-deprecation

2552
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,520
there

2553
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:27,360
and

2554
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:28,880
you give them

2555
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,040
convincing evidence

2556
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,520
locked salt you know rigorously tight

2557
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,960
arguments that they should start saving

2558
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,800
for their retirement now you allow them

2559
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,719
to raise whatever objections they have

2560
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:41,040
you meet them you get them to all agree

2561
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,639
that you've convinced them that they

2562
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:44,800
should save for their retirement

2563
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,480
you go away

2564
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,920
you come back in six months none of them

2565
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,840
are saving for the retirement

2566
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,520
hyperbolic discounting et cetera et

2567
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,679
cetera hyperbolic discounting is an

2568
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:55,679
adaptive thing etc i won't go into all

2569
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:57,199
of that right

2570
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:58,800
but then what you do and there's

2571
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,320
like you know hirschfield and other

2572
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,159
people all this what you do is you now

2573
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:03,679
do something else

2574
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:05,199
you get them

2575
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:07,120
and this is the imaginal not imaginary

2576
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:09,040
you get them to imagine their future

2577
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:12,000
self as a family member that they have a

2578
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,800
responsibility for and that they love

2579
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,639
and they want to give the best possible

2580
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:18,159
life to

2581
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:19,760
two things you find when you come back

2582
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,199
six months later

2583
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:23,199
the people that did the do the imagining

2584
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:25,840
start to save and the more vividly they

2585
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,600
can imagine

2586
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,440
the more they save

2587
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:33,520
so you overcome a kind of egocentric

2588
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,320
hyperbolic discounting through an in an

2589
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:37,520
imaginal

2590
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,760
it's basically a ritual this imaginal

2591
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,719
binding of yourself to your future self

2592
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:45,440
so that you get a more adaptive

2593
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,159
relationship

2594
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,600
it makes me think about

2595
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:52,159
variational free energy which is about

2596
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:54,239
the present and the past

2597
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:56,639
as religion really

2598
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,960
and then expected free energy as pre

2599
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,280
legare because we need to bind ourselves

2600
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,280
to futures that haven't happened

2601
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,199
yeah there's an asper there's there

2602
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:08,480
there's other there's there's a you know

2603
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:10,639
there's a current agentic

2604
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:12,880
right way in which religio that's my

2605
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,880
preferred etymological origin for

2606
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,280
religion binding connectedness and

2607
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:19,520
there's also aspirational religion and

2608
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,400
what religion often does is try to trade

2609
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,480
and try to find a sweet spot an optimal

2610
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,719
relationship between current and

2611
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:30,000
aspirational religio

2612
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,480
amazing let us look at some of these

2613
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:35,360
comments so any of them

2614
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,280
feel free to add comments or give a

2615
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,120
response so

2616
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,840
first ali has written

2617
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:44,800
in de luz's words relevance questions

2618
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,600
are how much and how

2619
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,119
in what cases

2620
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:51,920
and who questions as opposed to what is

2621
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:52,880
x

2622
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,040
questions from difference in repetition

2623
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,280
so what are the questions that bring us

2624
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,760
towards relevance as opposed to

2625
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,119
questions that

2626
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:04,400
make relevance obscured

2627
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,679
um

2628
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:09,119
that's a really interesting question i'm

2629
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:10,320
not

2630
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,000
i don't know much to lose i've read a

2631
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,639
little bit about the lose and and that's

2632
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:16,560
i should read more to lose because i i'm

2633
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:19,119
a deep fan of spinoza and he has a very

2634
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:21,280
interesting reading i have the book by

2635
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:24,480
the lewis on spinoza but um i i'm i'm

2636
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,760
really hesitant to give much of an

2637
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,679
answer here because i don't know de luz

2638
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:29,600
very well um it doesn't have to be a

2639
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,440
delusion answer just what kinds of

2640
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:33,360
questions and and um

2641
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,600
interrogative practices

2642
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,280
help us find relevance

2643
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:43,440
so um i think that

2644
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:47,119
to collapse a large argument built from

2645
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:50,320
sperber and wilson and their work on a

2646
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:53,840
book entitled relevance by the way um

2647
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:55,760
at least within communication

2648
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:57,199
i think actually this is where i

2649
01:37:57,199 --> 01:37:58,719
disagree with the lose but this is why i

2650
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:01,040
hesitant because i don't know to lose

2651
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,199
well so that's my hesitancy i think all

2652
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:06,480
of the questions are ways of trying to

2653
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,880
get a reformulation of what we find

2654
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,840
relevant they bring out there they bring

2655
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,679
out different aspects bring in different

2656
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:15,679
perspectives and point the arrow of

2657
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:17,600
relevance in different direction and

2658
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,199
what sperber and wilson

2659
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:21,119
they took for they said okay

2660
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:23,360
you have pr the pragmatic aspect of all

2661
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,560
communication

2662
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,560
what's pragmatics pragmatics is what you

2663
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,639
convey beyond what you can say

2664
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:31,040
because i can't actually put into my

2665
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,880
words every all of the information i'm

2666
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,840
trying to convey to you because if i if

2667
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:39,280
i did that well if if and by the use of

2668
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:42,239
if i'm making use of not the logical if

2669
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:45,600
but the temporal and conditional if i in

2670
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,440
this case i'm referring to me and i'm

2671
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,119
referring to me insofar as i'm in this

2672
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:51,360
current situation um

2673
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,920
did that and that was referring to what

2674
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,920
of all the things i've spoken of i'm

2675
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,800
speaking of uh you know trying to uh

2676
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:02,239
give give the specific uh verbal form of

2677
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:04,080
everything i'm trying to convey and then

2678
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:05,760
for each one of those current what do i

2679
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,520
mean by the current you see what happens

2680
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,679
you get a penumbra of ever expanding

2681
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:12,080
attempts to to to translate the

2682
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,199
conveyance

2683
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:16,159
and you get a combinatorially explosive

2684
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:17,520
list of

2685
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,639
sentences that i can't say and you do

2686
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:23,199
you do this all the time you know when

2687
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:25,040
you drive up and you open your window

2688
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,119
and you say excuse me i'm out of gas you

2689
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:28,800
mean your car is out of gas you're not

2690
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,719
trying to be more flatulent you mean gas

2691
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:32,400
is actually standing for gasoline you

2692
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,920
mean you're not completely out of gas

2693
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,360
you have some for you can drive at least

2694
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,920
a few more minutes

2695
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,440
right and you know all of these things

2696
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,280
are at work because if you violate any

2697
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,679
one of those expectations you get pissed

2698
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:45,840
off if if they say to you there's a gas

2699
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,080
station at the corner and you drive to

2700
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,600
the corner and the gas station has been

2701
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,679
closed for 10 years you don't go whoa

2702
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:55,119
well he told me the truth because you

2703
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:57,360
right it was conveyed to you that you

2704
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:58,719
could make use

2705
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:00,719
of the gas station because you're out of

2706
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:02,560
gas i won't go on that i'm just trying

2707
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:04,560
to give an intuitive example and so

2708
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:08,080
grice gives these four maxims that we

2709
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:10,560
are trying to always follow

2710
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:13,440
when in order to manage the conveyance

2711
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,199
so it doesn't become combinatorially

2712
01:40:15,199 --> 01:40:18,000
explosive and it's the

2713
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,560
in its manner and

2714
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:24,480
uh formats and what is quality

2715
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:27,360
so he gives three that are not relevance

2716
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,119
and the fourth one is relevance

2717
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:30,960
explicitly so and then sperber and

2718
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,960
wilson just basically argue all the

2719
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:36,239
other ones collapse into relevance like

2720
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:38,960
uh quality is tell the truth well not no

2721
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,320
you don't tell the truth you don't tell

2722
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,840
everything that's in your mind when

2723
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:44,639
you're speaking to somebody you select

2724
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:47,119
out of all of this in there a subset

2725
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:49,280
that's relevant so give the relevant

2726
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:52,800
truth the relevant manner etc etc

2727
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:53,920
so

2728
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:56,400
we always are doing this and i think

2729
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:59,119
questions actually operate right

2730
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:01,600
primarily at the pragmatic level of

2731
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:03,840
course they have semantic consequence

2732
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:05,840
but what we're constantly doing is

2733
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:06,880
asking

2734
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:07,760
which

2735
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,440
what are you conveying and what are the

2736
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,199
implicatures

2737
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:12,320
which are not the same thing as

2738
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,159
implications what are the relevant

2739
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:16,880
implicatures before i try and derive the

2740
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,119
implications of what you're saying

2741
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:22,159
that's what questions i think do

2742
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:24,159
now

2743
01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:29,040
i want to also be clear about this that

2744
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:30,840
we we need to be

2745
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:34,320
directing the questions in two

2746
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:37,119
directions

2747
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,760
sometimes we are probing

2748
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,360
are we aspectualizing framing the arena

2749
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,679
well

2750
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:48,239
in terms of is the world just so we

2751
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:49,920
check to see is the world disclosing

2752
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:53,840
itself to us such that we are solving

2753
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,960
our problems and flourishing

2754
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,800
but sometimes we also need to step back

2755
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,960
and look at the framing itself

2756
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,760
and ask is the framing

2757
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,840
right actually misdirecting or

2758
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,239
misleading me so i think

2759
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:10,880
questions are always trying to

2760
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:14,480
reconfigure the fittedness and one of

2761
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,000
the things we and therefore they're

2762
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,159
trying to enhance relevance realization

2763
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:20,000
at the pragmatic level

2764
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,040
but we should always remember to

2765
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:24,880
direct the questions in at least these

2766
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:28,040
two directions

2767
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:29,840
thank you

2768
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:33,199
all right here's a question from brock

2769
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:35,440
can you give some examples of how

2770
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:38,400
depending on ignoring to realize

2771
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:39,600
relevance

2772
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:43,040
can prevent realization of meaning

2773
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:45,440
does this relate to reciprocal narrowing

2774
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:46,639
and opening

2775
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:49,119
yes yes totally and so brock is familiar

2776
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:51,600
with my work and i'll just

2777
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,440
um let me just quickly

2778
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:56,239
uh open those the the the those final

2779
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:57,920
things up so other people are aware of

2780
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,600
what he's alluding to thank you brock

2781
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,760
for doing that uh so the notion of

2782
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,840
reciprocal narrowing is drawn from my

2783
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,520
friend and colleague mark lewis who has

2784
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,639
proposed a learning model of addiction

2785
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:10,880
rather than a disease model of predict

2786
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,639
of addiction so our current model which

2787
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:14,239
governments and agencies like is that

2788
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:15,520
the disease model you have this thing

2789
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:18,159
it's infected you and you're trying to

2790
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:19,440
like and and it's still it's

2791
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:22,000
debilitating you um now

2792
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,760
i want to make something very clear mark

2793
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,280
is not saying that there is not a

2794
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:26,800
neurochemical

2795
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:29,199
layer but he's trying to well he's

2796
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:30,560
trying to get an insight he's trying to

2797
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,480
get you to realize that the disease

2798
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:34,159
model makes all kinds of predictions

2799
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:36,880
that have been empirically disconfirmed

2800
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,719
i won't go through all of them but they

2801
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:40,639
they have to do with the effect that you

2802
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:43,119
know when we have that model

2803
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:45,440
they'll tend to think of the substance

2804
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:48,000
as in and of itself addictive

2805
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,920
um you know cocaine is so addictive

2806
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:53,119
heroin is so addictive well you know

2807
01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:54,960
yeah there was lots of

2808
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:58,239
uh soldiers in vietnam using opioids

2809
01:43:58,239 --> 01:43:59,840
and when they came back the vast

2810
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,440
majority of them stopped without having

2811
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,440
to have any special treatment

2812
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,600
they stopped using opioids

2813
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:08,239
but opioids are so addictive well what's

2814
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:09,280
different

2815
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:11,280
because

2816
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:12,480
presumably

2817
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:14,080
this destruction the chemical structure

2818
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,520
of heroin in vietnam in the united

2819
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:17,520
states is the same what is different the

2820
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:20,400
asian arena relationship is different

2821
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,800
you're a soldier in a traumatic

2822
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:25,040
circumstance in vietnam the united

2823
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,679
states you're a citizen and you're not

2824
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:29,040
and of course that caused all kinds of

2825
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,360
other problems for these people because

2826
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,280
the agent or relationships are so

2827
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:36,159
different here's what mark proposes

2828
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:37,119
so

2829
01:44:37,119 --> 01:44:39,119
i'll use alcohol because it's one people

2830
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:40,960
can easily relate to

2831
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,159
i have a very challenging arena and i'm

2832
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:46,880
stressed so i take some alcohol and it

2833
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,960
reduces the stress but it actually

2834
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,920
limits my cognitive flexibility so my

2835
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:54,159
problem-solving abilities go down so the

2836
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:55,840
options available to me in the world

2837
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,400
goes down so the world narrows as the

2838
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,239
world narrows it becomes more stressful

2839
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:02,480
to me so now i want to take more alcohol

2840
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,480
to keep the stress away but that's now

2841
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:05,679
impairing

2842
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:08,159
my cognitive flexibility you see what's

2843
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:10,719
happening the world as an arena is

2844
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:13,760
narrowing and my capacity as an agent is

2845
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:15,600
narrowing so you've got reciprocal

2846
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,480
narrowing until i can't be any other

2847
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:21,760
than i am and there is no future for me

2848
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:22,719
at all

2849
01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:25,119
other than this moment of taking the

2850
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:26,320
drug and that's addiction it's

2851
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:29,119
reciprocal narrowing now i was literally

2852
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:30,800
daniel i was literally at lunch with

2853
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,199
mark lewis and i said but mark if

2854
01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:35,360
there's reciprocal narrowing there has

2855
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:38,000
to be reciprocal opening and he went

2856
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,520
oh you're right

2857
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:41,679
and i talked about how plato talks about

2858
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:44,320
this and the model of uh what's called

2859
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:46,080
anagage

2860
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,320
this model in the republic of how you

2861
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:51,199
ascend out of the cave into

2862
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:54,239
seeing the real world reciprocal opening

2863
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:55,520
and so

2864
01:45:55,520 --> 01:46:01,600
um i think when we engage in

2865
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:06,799
ignoring relevant information

2866
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:10,719
we will often very readily fall prey to

2867
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:12,400
a very powerful

2868
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:13,360
kind

2869
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:16,560
of reciprocal narrowing

2870
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:18,480
so let's let's go back to the example i

2871
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:20,718
used

2872
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:23,040
you don't have the insight

2873
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,639
you think she's angry when she's

2874
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:26,159
actually afraid you don't have the

2875
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:28,800
insight and so you push on her and you

2876
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:31,280
only take evidence confirming

2877
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:34,400
confirmation bias that she's angry in to

2878
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,880
your model and then you only act towards

2879
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:39,440
her as if she's and she's gonna start

2880
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,199
probably

2881
01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:43,280
almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy

2882
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,679
respond more and more because your anger

2883
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:47,760
right you start to act towards her in a

2884
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,520
way that gets increasingly aggressive

2885
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,760
and you reciprocally narrow and then it

2886
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,440
gets harder and harder for you to see

2887
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:55,520
that she's not angry and it gets harder

2888
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:58,080
for her not to communicate to you in a

2889
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:00,239
way that you have to interpret as anger

2890
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:01,840
because when she tries to give you

2891
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:04,239
something else you ignore it in zero and

2892
01:47:04,239 --> 01:47:06,719
you have been in arguments and fights

2893
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:08,960
like this at some point in your life

2894
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:11,440
with somebody that you don't want to be

2895
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,280
severed from

2896
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:16,000
but that kind of thing can sever

2897
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,320
the connectedness and when you're at the

2898
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,880
end of your life you don't really care

2899
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:23,840
how many objects you've manipulated you

2900
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,480
don't care how many french fries you eat

2901
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:29,040
you care about the relationships you had

2902
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,600
and how deep they are and if you didn't

2903
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,480
pay attention at that time you lost a

2904
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:37,679
relationship and severed a connectedness

2905
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:41,040
that enhances your meaning in life

2906
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,360
you you fell into reciprocal narrowing

2907
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:45,119
it severed a relationship and your

2908
01:47:45,119 --> 01:47:46,560
connectedness

2909
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,639
mattering to another human being has

2910
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:51,280
been lost

2911
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:52,560
there's no more

2912
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,800
interpersonal gravity and the

2913
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,800
relationship does not matter

2914
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,920
yes

2915
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,679
all right i'm going to read just a few

2916
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:00,480
uh

2917
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,719
non-question comments and then get to a

2918
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:04,800
question in these last minutes

2919
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:05,679
so

01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:08,639
griswold wrote ants hold hands in the

2923
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,920
that's wonderful

ah

2930
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:29,760
wow nice very cool

2931
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,520
all right and here's one more uh

2932
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:34,320
question this is from dave

2933
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:37,840
so uh dave says have you found uh

2934
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:38,880
oh i don't know if this is the correct

2935
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,400
way to pronounce the name but guiles

2936

uh work on mental spaces and conceptual

2938
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:47,600
fusion useful in explaining and

2939
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,840
improving the evolution of concrete

2940
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:52,560
mental activities and we can also see

2941
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:55,679
this work on uh generalized space and

2942
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:58,320
navigation with chris fields and mike

2943
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,400
levin and many others so whether you're

2944
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:02,159
familiar with that researcher or not how

2945
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:05,280
does this idea of cognitive spaces help

2946
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:09,119
us work in physical and social spaces

2947
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:11,679
uh for me um

2948
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:13,920
again and this how you know the

2949
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,600
connection to relevance realization and

2950
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:17,119
its collection to buy connections to

2951
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:19,600
biology and evolutionary modeling is

2952
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:21,360
really helpful here

2953
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:24,080
uh so give me a moment and then i'll uh

2954
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:24,800
uh

2955
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,199
so one of the ways in which evolution

2956
01:49:27,199 --> 01:49:30,320
selects is it exacts acceptation means

2957
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:31,679
it doesn't have to

2958
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:33,840
generate an entirely new

2959
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:36,800
uh mechanism um and so let me give you a

2960
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,400
concrete example it's one of my favorite

2961
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:39,920
favorite ones what i'm doing with my

2962
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:41,600
tongue right now is speaking

2963
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,199
of course tongues did not evolve for

2964
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:45,199
speech because we have so many organisms

2965
01:49:45,199 --> 01:49:46,320
that have tongues and they aren't

2966
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,400
capable of speech but what does the

2967
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:50,400
tongue do well it helps masticate so it

2968
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,040
has to be highly flexible um it has to

2969
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,600
be a poison and calorie detector so it

2970
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,199
has to have lots of nerve endings and it

2971
01:49:57,199 --> 01:49:58,880
has to be it's in the air passageway

2972
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,040
because that's how we evolved right and

2973
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,840
so it's it's almost pre-designed as some

2974
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:06,239
people say pre-adapted for speech and so

2975
01:50:06,239 --> 01:50:09,119
it gets exacted into speech

2976
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:11,440
i think there's growing evidence uh look

2977
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,199
at barbara taversky's book mind in

2978
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:14,239
motion

2979
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:16,239
that the brain

2980
01:50:16,239 --> 01:50:17,600
and this goes to the work of michael

2981
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:20,000
anderson and to han and others

2982
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,199
the brain is uh an exactive

2983
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:24,560
process

2984
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:28,480
the brain is constantly exacting

2985
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:33,040
machinery that emerged for one

2986
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:36,239
arena set of actions for another

2987
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:39,119
specifically it looks like

2988
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:40,239
the

2989
01:50:40,239 --> 01:50:42,159
set of abilities

2990
01:50:42,159 --> 01:50:44,560
that we generate

2991
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,880
for navigating

2992
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:49,679
physical space is exacted into moving

2993
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:51,840
around in conceptual space the fact that

2994
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:54,239
we've been calling it conceptual space

2995
01:50:54,239 --> 01:50:55,760
and we talk about things being higher

2996
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,560
and lower and we move between et cetera

2997
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,480
you can it's just it's just totally

2998
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:02,719
impregnated with navigational language

2999
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:04,480
and we talk about orientation and

3000
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:06,960
finding our way or losing our way can

3001
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:09,119
you follow this argument

3002
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:11,119
what that's tracking language can you

3003
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:13,440
follow this argument where is it going

3004
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:17,520
to right uh you know i lost the thread

3005
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:20,080
just like again and again and again and

3006
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:22,239
again and and and

3007
01:51:22,239 --> 01:51:23,119
and so

3008
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:25,040
it really and it helps explain really

3009
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:27,119
weird stuff that's otherwise not well

3010
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:28,239
explained

3011
01:51:28,239 --> 01:51:31,280
okay cerebellum more neurons than your

3012
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:34,719
neocortex uh often not included in fmris

3013
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:37,119
by the way which is a mistake you know

3014
01:51:37,119 --> 01:51:39,360
many fmris i think should be removed

3015
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:40,639
from their findings because the

3016
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:43,199
cerebellum is not included and we we are

3017
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:45,199
now getting overwhelming evidence for

3018
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:47,760
the cerebellar uh

3019
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:51,119
uh cortex loop and by excluding the

3020
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:53,840
cerebellum from our fmris we are conf we

3021
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:56,560
are we are smuggling in a confound that

3022
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:59,199
has not been properly controlled for so

3023
01:51:59,199 --> 01:52:01,440
just a general point there

3024
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:03,679
when people are sitting in what's the

3025
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:05,360
cerebellum for you know sensory motor

3026
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:07,280
balance right

3027
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:09,040
when people are sitting absolutely still

3028
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:11,199
eyes closed

3029
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:13,679
perfectly stable in meditation their

3030
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:18,320
cerebellum is firing like crazy why

3031
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:19,840
they're not doing anything they're not

3032
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,360
moving they're in a position where they

3033
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:24,000
can be deeply comfortable because they

3034
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,400
are aligned with gravity and like

3035
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:28,880
they're stable stable stable their eyes

3036
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:30,000
are

3037
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,560
presumably because they are navigating

3038
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:35,119
and they're trying to balance complex

3039
01:52:35,119 --> 01:52:37,760
contingencies of attention and move

3040
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:38,719
through

3041
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:41,520
the experiential space in a powerful way

3042
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:42,960
and the cerebellum

3043
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:44,639
this this when i started talking about

3044
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:46,719
this it was controversial now it's

3045
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:48,639
approaching consensus position that this

3046
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:50,960
is the cerebellum has been exacted for

3047
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:53,760
these kinds of functions so i i think

3048
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,520
the idea

3049
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:56,480
that

3050
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:57,440
um

3051
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,520
we but that

3052
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:01,199
and i'm not i'm i i've only briefly

3053
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:02,560
looked at fukunier's work when i was

3054
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,080
doing work on metaphor i didn't find it

3055
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:05,920
particularly helpful for metaphor so i

3056
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:08,560
didn't go into it more deeply um

3057
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:09,760
but

3058
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:14,000
the the idea that we are doing something

3059
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,320
like mapping between spaces i i think

3060
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:18,159
this is

3061
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:19,840
i think yeah

3062
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,400
i i think this just plugs into the

3063
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,800
exactive nature of our cognition that it

3064
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:29,760
is a form of rapid cognitive evolution

3065
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:32,000
awesome well

3066
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,320
in the final minutes

3067
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:36,960
do you have any words of wisdom any

3068
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:38,800
thoughts where do we go from here where

3069
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:41,760
do people go from here

3070
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,360
well it depends i mean you can go

3071
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:44,719
theoretically in which you can look at

3072
01:53:44,719 --> 01:53:47,360
my publications and and mark uh is

3073
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:50,080
coming he got an amazing grant

3074
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:52,320
and other grants and uh

3075
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:54,719
um and so he's coming to uft he and i

3076
01:53:54,719 --> 01:53:56,880
are going to do work brett and i are are

3077
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:58,880
doing work uh the three of us are going

3078
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:01,199
to continue to work so look for that uh

3079
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:02,719
gary and i who published the paper on

3080
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:04,960
relevance realization and personality

3081
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:06,000
have one

3082
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,599
pretty well written on integrating

3083
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:10,080
relevance realization and attachment

3084
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:12,960
theory um in terms of uh attachment is

3085
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:15,360
actually um a uh

3086
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:17,119
optimal gripping practice between the

3087
01:54:17,119 --> 01:54:19,920
child and the mother or

3088
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:21,840
frequently the mother the the primary

3089
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:24,400
caregiver i should say um

3090
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:25,360
and so

3091
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:28,320
um you can look for all of that um for

3092
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,159
those of you who are interested more in

3093
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:31,679
the wisdom stuff you can look at the

3094
01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:33,679
stuff i published on wisdom

3095
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:34,639
um

3096
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:35,840
some

3097
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:37,199
i don't think i wrote any wisdom papers

3098
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:38,719
on my own they're they're with other

3099
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:39,599
people

3100
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:40,400
uh

3101
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,719
you if you're interested in mindfulness

3102
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:45,679
i've got two publications one on a an

3103
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:47,040
oxford book

3104
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:50,000
uh an anthology edited by emir raz on

3105
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,560
hypnosis and meditation and more recent

3106
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,719
one which i recommend in the routledge

3107
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:57,040
handbook on the philosophy of meditation

3108
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:59,199
where i talk about all this having how

3109
01:54:59,199 --> 01:55:01,280
this all works out in terms of attention

3110
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:02,960
and meditation and contemplation why

3111
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:04,239
they're not the same thing why they're

3112
01:55:04,239 --> 01:55:06,159
an opponent processing relationship why

3113
01:55:06,159 --> 01:55:09,119
that's conducive to

3114
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:12,000
insight and more systemic and systematic

3115
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,920
insight et cetera

3116
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:16,239
if you're interested in learning about

3117
01:55:16,239 --> 01:55:18,320
the meeting crisis you can go to my

3118
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:20,560
youtube series awakening for the meeting

3119
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:22,239
crisis and follow that argument all the

3120
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:24,639
way through i have a new series coming

3121
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:27,760
out which is about trying to

3122
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:31,599
tap into how we can afford these kinds

3123
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:34,800
of flowing emergent conversations that

3124
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,960
take us beyond where we can go in an

3125
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:40,159
individual cognition and empower us

3126
01:55:40,159 --> 01:55:41,760
and it's called after socrates where i'm

3127
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:44,320
tracing out what's going on in dialectic

3128
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:48,320
into the logos that's coming out uh this

3129
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:51,119
year probably october november uh rebel

3130
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:52,719
wisdom david fuller they're making a

3131
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:55,199
documentary film about my me and my work

3132
01:55:55,199 --> 01:55:57,440
that's coming out also october november

3133
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:59,440
of this year so that's a bunch of things

3134
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:01,840
you can look for and look at

3135
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:04,239
amazing well thank you very much for
