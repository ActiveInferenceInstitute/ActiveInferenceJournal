10
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:10,510
FRIEDMAN: Hello, everyone.

20
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,611
Welcome.

30
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,381
It is September 13th, 2022.

40
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,683
We're here at the Active Inference

50
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,518
Institute with John Vervaeke.

60
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,953
So, John, welcome.

70
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,888
Thank you for joining.

80
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:22,555
I'm very much

90
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:24,691
looking forward to this conversation.

100
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,094
Hello. And to you.

110
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:28,762
VERVAEKE: Thank you, Daniel.

120
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,163
It's a great pleasure being here.

130
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,832
Looking forward to this.

140
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,368
FRIEDMAN: Is there any introduction or hello

150
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,903
that you would like to provide

160
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:39,873
as we head into this journey together?

170
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,541
VERVAEKE: I guess I can give

180
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,609
just a little bit of background

190
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,677
so people know where I'm coming from.

200
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,979
I'm an associate professor

210
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,881
at the University of Toronto.

220
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,817
I'm in I'm appointed both in cognitive

230
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,853
psychology and in cognitive science.

240
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,488
I teach in both,

250
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,090
and I am the director

260
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,259
of the Cognitive Science Program.

270
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,561
So I do a lot of work integrating,

280
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,896
especially psychology

290
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,631
and ideas

300
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,332
from artificial intelligence,

310
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:06,966
large framework

320
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,735
models, philosophical framework models

330
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,270
for the nature of the mind.

340
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,872
I especially do work on intelligent

350
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,942
and consciousness, insight, flow,

360
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,610
mindfulness and wisdom

370
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,914
all centered upon a notion of,

380
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,282
well, not a notion,

390
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,284
a proposal, a theoretical proposal

400
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,819
that I call relevance realization.

410
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:26,753
And perhaps we'll get into that

420
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,756
at some point.

1210
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,458
FRIEDMAN: Into it we go.

1220
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,561
So to provide some context.

1230
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:36,229
These live

1240
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,632
streams are multi-directional roads.

1250
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,101
We're going to be talking

1260
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,635
about different ideas.

1270
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:43,503
For some people,

1280
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,971
it'll be their day to day

1290
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,840
life and the water they swim in.

1300
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,108
For other people,

1310
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,509
it might be their first time

1320
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,977
hearing about relevance,

1330
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,512
realization, or predictive

1340
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,581
processing or active inference.

1350
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,483
And so we always want

1360
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:57,817
to make it accessible

1370
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,120
and also provide depth.

1380
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,921
So yesterday

1390
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,757
in speaking with some other participants

1400
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:05,892
at the Institute

1410
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,394
about how to frame this discussion,

1420
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,029
I was bringing

1430
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,098
a notion of a three legged stool

1440
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,734
and the three legs of this stool

1450
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,103
that provided stability

1460
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:17,971
are, again,

1470
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,973
those relevance, realization, predictive

1480
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,075
processing and active inference.

1490
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:23,843
And then

1500
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,812
a participant, Dean, said,

1510
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,913
Flip the stool.

1520
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,748
It's still stable.

1530
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,750
And so that led to some discussions

1540
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,785
of what was the between

1550
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:33,953
this of these ideas

1560
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,989
and what were they really doing alone

1570
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,224
and what did they do together?

1580
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,926
And we're going to approach that.

1590
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:43,062
So first, we'll be exploring

1600
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,764
relevance, realization

1610
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,900
and predictive processing.

1620
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,700
VERVAEKE: Mm hmm.

1630
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,869
In terms of what they are

1640
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,071
and how you recently connected them

1650
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,406
in a recent paper.

1660
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,475
And then we'll bring in active inference

1670
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,011
as a third guest to the party.

1680
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,679
But first,

1690
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,781
what is relevance, realization

1700
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,083
and what is predictive processing?

1710
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,785
How did you bring those two together

1720
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:06,653
in the recent work

1730
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,656
with Brett Anderson and Mark Miller?

1740
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,225
So the two lines were

1750
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,361
working independently.

1760
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,564
I first got my first paper

1770
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,832
officially accepted in 2009,

1780
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,101
didn't get published until 2012

1790
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,870
because they were holding it back

1800
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,471
for a special issue

1810
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,240
that took forever to come out.

1820
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,708
The reason I mentioned the earlier date

1830
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,443
is that's before

1840
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,778
I think most of Kristen's

1850
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,814
major publications, and that's just

1860
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,516
an I'm not claiming precedent

1870
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:36,916
or anything, I'm

1880
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,284
just claiming independence.

1890
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,385
I didn't know about his work

1900
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,154
until after the theory

1910
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:41,955
was well developed,

1920
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:42,889
and I assumed

1930
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,291
he might even not know of mine even now.

1940
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,428
And that's fine.

1950
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:49,929
So the idea behind

1960
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,030
relevance realization

1970
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,798
is that

1980
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:52,899
if you take a look

1990
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,368
at many different problems

2000
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,102
within attempts

2010
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,771
to explain the mind in a non muscular,

2020
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,074
non question begging manner,

2030
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,242
you hit this problem

2040
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,610
of relevance realization.

2050
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,146
So for example,

2060
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,982
how does categorization work?

2070
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:09,716
Well, we noticed

2080
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,750
the two things are similar.

2090
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,251
What does it mean

2100
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,685
to say they're similar?

2110
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:13,920
Well, logically,

2120
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,023
it means they share many properties

2130
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,325
and then Goodman famously pointed out

2140
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,360
that any two objects

2150
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:20,860
share an

2160
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,130
indefinite number of true properties.

2170
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,533
You know, a plumb and a lawnmower.

2180
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,869
Both have rounded shiny surfaces.

2190
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,237
They're both found in North America.

2200
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,438
Neither one existed

2210
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,140
300 million years ago.

2220
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,341
Both have an odor.

2230
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:35,908
Neither one is

2240
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,310
a particularly good weapon,

2250
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,878
etc., etc., etc..

2260
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,680
And what people will say to me is

2270
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,748
they can't say those are false

2280
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:42,482
because they're all true.

2290
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,017
They'll say, But that doesn't matter.

2300
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:47,053
And that's the move, right where you go

2310
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,855
from logical similarity

2320
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,590
to psychological similarity,

2330
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,291
you'd say,

2340
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,460
well, I zero in on the relevant

2350
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,964
comparisons are and how do you do that?

2360
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,098
And that, of course,

2370
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,067
is still the crux

2380
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,503
of the categorization problem.

2390
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,138
Let's take a look at inference.

2400
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,740
Well well, inference is just to follow

2410
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,275
all the implications of a proposition

2420
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,210
in relation to other propositions.

2430
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,246
Well, how many are those?

2440
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,114
Well, let's take a proposition.

2450
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,383
It's it's going to be windy tomorrow

2460
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,018
that has you know,

2470
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,486
that would have implications for me

2480
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,921
if I'm silly,

2490
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:22,422
that are different

2500
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,756
for the implications for me

2510
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,091
if I'm flying a kite

2520
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,526
or if I'm planning to have a picnic

2530
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,894
or a planning to stay inside,

2540
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,829
or if I'm planning to take an airplane

2550
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,164
and do a check out

2560
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,632
all the possible connections

2570
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:33,800
between that proposition.

2580
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,135
No, I only

2590
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,071
select those that are relevant.

2600
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,305
And this was a point made very,

2610
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,173
very well

2620
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,507
quite a while ago by Christopher.

2630
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,810
Christopher Chernick in his book

2640
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,212
Minimal Rationality,

2650
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:47,714
Problem Solving.

2660
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,582
I many of you are already familiar

2670
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:50,817
with this, so I'll just state it.

2680
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:51,384
We know that

2690
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,252
the search space for most problems

2700
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,121
is combinatorial explosive.

2710
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,589
You can't search the whole space,

2720
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,257
so you have to somehow ignore

2730
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,692
most of the space.

2740
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,127
Well, nevertheless, reliably

2750
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:01,527
being able

2760
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:01,961
to solve

2770
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,162
a wide variety of problems

2780
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,398
in a wide variety of domains,

2790
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,566
I can make similar arguments

2800
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,467
for communication

2810
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,668
and I can make similar arguments

2820
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,635
for learning, etc..

2830
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,037
I won't go into them.

2840
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,273
I'm just giving enough to exemplify that

2850
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,808
independently.

2860
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:16,876
All of these things

2870
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,911
keep crashing into this issue

2880
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,446
of zeroing in

2890
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,181
on the relevant information,

2900
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,385
and you can you to note it at,

2910
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,553
you know, in your everyday experience,

2920
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,122
what should you pay attention to

2930
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,123
right now?

2940
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,290
What should you draw from

2950
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,458
working memory?

2960
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,092
What should you draw

2970
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,094
from long term memory?

2980
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,662
Especially with the fact

2990
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,430
that you can combine

3000
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,065
different things from long term memory?

3010
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,333
What sequence of actions

3020
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,467
should you perform?

3030
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,435
What possibilities

3040
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,670
you could consider, etc.?

3050
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,405
I take it

3060
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,507
that this is at least

3070
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,841
plausible enough for me to go on.

3080
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,710
People can take a look at

3090
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,978
all the publications to see

3100
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,613
the arguments more in depth.

3110
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,914
So there's crucial ability

3120
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,383
for relevance, realization

3130
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,551
needs to be addressed

3140
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,686
if we're ever going to provide.

3150
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,822
I've argued I've argued since my thesis,

3160
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,157
if we're going to provide

3170
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,892
a naturalistic explanation of the mind

3180
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:06,459
and the read,

3190
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,760
which we avoid it,

3200
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,430
try to just pretend it's not there, etc.

3210
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,167
I think

3220
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,401
it undermines our efforts

3230
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,103
to give a naturalistic explanation.

3240
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,104
Now, this is sometimes

3250
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,206
called the frame problem.

3260
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,607
I don't call it that anymore

3270
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,377
because Shanahan has rightly argued

3280
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,311
that the frame problem

3290
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,313
was two separate problems.

3300
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,549
One was to create a viable logic

3310
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,284
for change

3320
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,784
that didn't

3330
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,186
get you sort of enmeshed in that

3340
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,287
and a bleed out

3350
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,522
of all kind of identities.

3360
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,691
And he argues that that

3370
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:39,659
challenging problem

3380
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,961
has largely been solved.

3390
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:42,829
He claims to be

3400
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:43,896
one of the people that solved it.

3410
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:44,430
Nobody seems

3420
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,832
to be challenging him on that.

3430
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,401
I don't either.

3440
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,969
What he says remains,

3450
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,537
and that is, are his words not mine,

3460
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,272
is the deeper problem of relevance.

3470
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,841
That's exactly what he calls it,

3480
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,776
the relevance problem.

3490
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,745
So this problem is a key problem.

3500
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:00,713
And

3510
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,783
I have a proposal that

3520
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,685
I've worked on with other people

3530
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,988
Tim Little, Blake Richards, Leo Ferraro,

3540
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,890
Brett Anderson and Mark Miller

3550
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,458
in the recent paper

3560
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,926
Gary Hobbesian and a paper

3570
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,795
we recently published.

3580
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,463
Also Integrating Relevance

3590
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,698
Realization Theory

3600
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:19,365
and an inactive

3610
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,734
Big Five personality theory.

3620
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,303
And the proposal, I mean,

3630
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,705
the proposal has more sort

3640
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:26,572
of technical details,

3650
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,975
but just to give the idea

3660
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,810
and we're not claiming that

3670
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,144
this I'm not claiming

3680
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:32,612
none of us

3690
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:33,679
claim that this proposal

3700
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,082
is completely novel.

3710
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,183
What we're claiming is

3720
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,084
you see it implicit

3730
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,418
in many different areas

3740
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,220
where progress is being made

3750
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,154
and you can draw it out

3760
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:45,224
and explicate it and therefore

3770
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,759
make more specific proposals

3780
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,760
of how to look for it

3790
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,829
or how to engineer a mind.

3800
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,098
This is the proposal that

3810
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,332
the brain basically uses

3820
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,667
at many different levels

3830
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,868
opponent processing.

3840
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:57,370
And what

3850
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,237
it's doing is

3860
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,672
it's doing something very analogous

3870
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,907
to evolution.

3880
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,209
It's opening up variations

3890
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,143
and then putting selective

3900
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,111
pressure on them.

3910
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:05,912
And then from that,

3920
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:06,979
opening up variations,

3930
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,582
putting selective pressure on them.

3940
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,683
And you

3950
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:11,450
you can see this

3960
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,785
at many different levels.

3970
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,388
Your attention is doing it right now.

3980
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:15,922
You default

3990
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:16,556
mode network

4000
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,557
is trying to make your attention

4010
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,027
wander off and introduce new ideas.

4020
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:22,728
Your task, folks,

4030
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,163
its network is drawing it back

4040
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,198
in, killing off most of those options.

4050
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:26,933
But one or two of them

4060
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,068
might be actually relevant to

4070
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,571
what's going on. You keep them.

4080
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,873
And the idea is that you do this

4090
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,207
and there's many of these trade off

4100
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:35,875
relationships.

4110
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,610
I'm just giving one example.

4120
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,911
There's many of these trade off

4130
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,079
relationships.

4140
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,581
They're operating

4150
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,415
in a massively

4160
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,750
recursive, multidimensional,

4170
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,485
self-organizing process

4180
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,120
to help you repeatedly zero

4190
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,122
in on the relevant information.

4200
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,691
Like I say, there's more detail,

4210
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,060
obviously,

4220
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,063
but that's as fast as I could make it.

4230
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,366
A gist of what the theory

4240
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,136
is is proposing.

4250
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,671
FRIEDMAN: Thank you for the summary.

4260
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,407
Definitely a lot there.

4270
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,476
In one way,

4280
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:11,611
it's like moving

4290
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,913
from the sketch of the continents

4300
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,014
and the lay of the land,

4310
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,682
the space of the possible

4320
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:17,883
for cognitive science

4330
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,952
across these different domains,

4340
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,688
and then asking how the relevant

4350
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,292
view combinations are selected.

4360
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,562
And then one can point to a broad

4370
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,632
range of so-called cognitive phenomena

4380
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,400
in human

4390
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,769
as well as in other cognitive systems

4400
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,772
learning, memory planning, attention

4410
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,641
composition, ality action,

4420
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,743
selection of policy inference.

4430
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,045
All of these areas

4440
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,147
which one might imagine

4450
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,549
could have bespoke custom theory.

4460
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,753
Or there might be a way to look

4470
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:57,023
at some similarities, ironically or not,

4480
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,291
finding the relevant similarities

4490
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,327
in these different cognitive domains

4500
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:01,994
and asking

4510
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,563
whether we could improve our inference

4520
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,266
and our action regarding those domains

4530
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,334
through the usage

4540
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,902
of an integrative framework

4550
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,038
like relevance realization.

4560
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:12,638
VERVAEKE: That's excellent.

4570
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:13,039
Daniel

4580
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,541
And so just to add to why

4590
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,309
I think it's reasonable

4600
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,412
and perhaps even plausible

4610
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,347
that there is such a domain

4620
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,084
general central capacity is we have

4630
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,621
robustly replicated evidence

4640
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,923
for the existence

4650
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,425
of general intelligence.

4660
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,592
By the way, general intelligence

4670
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:34,260
doesn't mean

4680
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,062
it can't be analyzed in components.

4690
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,330
It means that it's functional level.

4700
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,000
It forms a causal whole

4710
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,169
that has no reliable

4720
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,070
predictive relations.

4730
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,137
And we have it's

4740
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:45,504
you know, it's

4750
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,806
the most powerful psychometric

4760
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:47,807
in psychology.

4770
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,508
People don't like to hear that.

4780
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,144
But it is nevertheless the case with.

4790
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,280
And so we have evidence

4800
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,782
that there is above all and not in

4810
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,617
not in place of

4820
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,653
but above all, the specific learning

4830
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,488
you have for specific domains.

4840
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,957
There is powerful evidence

4850
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,992
for general intelligence,

4860
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,828
a domain, general ability.

4870
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,429
The way we test for it,

4880
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,664
Leo and I made this argument

4890
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:12,631
in another paper

4900
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,399
is basically

4910
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:13,833
we test

4920
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,000
for people's capacity

4930
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,569
at relevance realization

4940
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,770
again and again and again.

4950
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,639
And so

4960
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,173
that's why I

4970
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:21,974
think it's plausible

4980
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:25,344
that there is this underlying

4990
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,645
capacity.

5000
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,982
And what that helps do is it helps it,

5010
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,884
it allows you

5020
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:32,918
it allows to bridge

5030
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,153
into more comprehensive

5040
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,555
of patterns of explanation we have.

5050
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,224
So for example,

5060
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,160
the model I just proposed to you

5070
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,329
is explicitly

5080
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,464
an analogy, but a strong analogy,

5090
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:46,232
you know,

5100
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:46,866
to the way

5110
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,267
evolutionary processes

5120
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,969
produce adaptive morphology

5130
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,471
for market organisms,

5140
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,774
the evolution variation, selection

5150
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,741
and the

5160
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:56,776
and it doesn't require

5170
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,477
an intelligent designer.

5180
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:58,778
Right.

5190
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,846
Says evolution is clearly a process

5200
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:01,547
that is itself

5210
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,281
not intelligent

5220
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,849
and can produce intelligence.

5230
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,551
And so that gives us

5240
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,452
the potential way

5250
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,020
out of any homunculus,

5260
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,422
our explanations of intelligence

5270
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:10,790
like, you know,

5280
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,257
the central

5290
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,025
executive selects this or that

5300
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,094
and those kinds of explanations

5310
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,295
that just presuppose

5320
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,930
an answer to this question.

5330
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,231
And so instead,

5340
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,068
the idea is, no, no, the brain

5350
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,870
at this general level, again,

5360
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,872
I'm not denying specific heuristics,

5370
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,340
although I'm proposing that perhaps

5380
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,341
relevance realization

5390
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,043
is how those specific heuristics

5400
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,311
might be generated.

5410
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,512
I'm not I'm not denying

5420
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,513
specific heuristics.

5430
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,281
I'm not denying

5440
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,782
domain specific knowledge.

5450
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:37,883
I'm not denying any of that.

5460
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:38,350
But I'm saying

5470
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,286
there is a general ability

5480
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,787
just like there is right,

5490
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,156
this general process of evolution

5500
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,125
for biological activity.

5510
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,259
There is this general,

5520
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,460
if you'll allow me,

5530
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,662
cognitive evolution

5540
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,832
of your fitness, your cognitive fitness

5550
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,335
as a problem solver to your environment.

5560
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:58,637
FRIEDMAN: Yes.

5570
00:13:58,637 --> 00:13:59,972
In those ways, it's

5580
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,242
very resonant with generalized

5590
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,411
Darwinian models

5600
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,613
or like neural Darwinism,

5610
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:11,550
as well as the trend in eco evo

5620
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,253
devo ecology, evolution and developments

5630
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,323
by way of looking at proliferation

5640
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,692
and that pruning back process

5650
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,227
in different spatial

5660
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,928
and temporal scales, different systems

5670
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,363
like the way that it might happen

5680
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,698
with synapses forming

5690
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,799
and then being pruned

5700
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,000
during development.

5710
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,135
The way this ecosystem assembly

5720
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:30,836
might occur

5730
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,771
with initial plants

5740
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,673
forming some sort of substrate

5750
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,142
that later forms ground for development,

5760
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,411
and then even at slower and longer

5770
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,012
time scales

5780
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,180
with evolution,

5790
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,948
and especially when we think

5800
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,617
about the neural aspects,

5810
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,151
learning and behavior

5820
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,620
are part of development.

5830
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,420
They're processes

5840
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,756
that happen within a lifetime

5850
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:54,360
and that is a great angle to consider.

5860
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,795
So relevance realization

5870
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,298
in our first pocket.

5880
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,433
Let's move to the second leg.

5890
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,969
Predictive processing.

5900
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,205
What is predictive processing

5910
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,873
and how did it come into play

5920
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:08,474
and why did it

5930
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,210
come into play for this recent work?

5940
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,145
VERVAEKE: So I've been familiar

5950
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,114
with predictive processing

5960
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,982
and I would often be an annoyance

5970
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:17,883
that the conferences

5980
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,852
were predictive processing

5990
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,120
was being presented

6000
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,854
because I would ask,

6010
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,323
where does the model come from and

6020
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,291
where does the innovations

6030
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:25,724
for the model

6040
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,860
come from and things like that,

6050
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,996
because I was right

6060
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,631
and the questions were genuine.

6070
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:33,232
I wasn't, you know,

6080
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,233
I wasn't trying to sabotage.

6090
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,936
I wanted to understand how this was

6100
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,839
integrated and I wasn't getting to

6110
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:41,373
be fair.

6120
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,242
And, you know, and the fault is probably

6130
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,009
also mine.

6140
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,744
You know, I was

6150
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:46,779
I was learning all about this.

6160
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,947
I've learned about it quite a bit.

6170
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,949
And, you know, and I have my bias.

6180
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,518
But Bret Brett Anderson approached me

6190
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:56,789
and he said, look,

6200
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,923
I think that what you're doing

6210
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:58,357
in relevance

6220
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,125
realization is really needed

6230
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,427
for predictive processing.

6240
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,396
And then at the very same time, almost

6250
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,131
and this is one of those

6260
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,533
happy coincidences

6270
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,001
that are the shadows of God

6280
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,402
or something like that.

6290
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,370
A former student of mine

6300
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:11,870
who went through

6310
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,905
the cognitive science program.

6320
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,206
With me, Mark Miller,

6330
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,641
who has work with Andy Clarke

6340
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,942
and a bunch of the other

6350
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:17,843
predictive processing

6360
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,913
people, came and he said, John,

6370
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,915
I want to start working with you again

6380
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,683
and I want to integrate

6390
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:25,584
what you've been doing

6400
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:26,518
and I've been doing.

6410
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,786
And so

6420
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:31,256
the three of us started talking and

6430
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:32,925
and,

6440
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:34,193
you know,

6450
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,728
when we went back and forth a lot

6460
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,163
and we came up with

6470
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,531
a way in which we saw these

6480
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,466
two theories converging.

6490
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,700
So predictive processing,

6500
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,134
I mean, there's

6510
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,836
a lot of technicalities and people

6520
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,971
very to the degree to which

6530
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,673
they're committed to,

6540
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,141
you know, a strong Bayesian

6550
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,042
or a weaker Bayesian,

6560
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:50,809
everybody agrees

6570
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:51,910
that you can't be pure Bayes

6580
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,411
because it would be

6590
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,113
computationally intractable.

6600
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,981
You have to do some approximation.

6610
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,182
And then the idea is you

6620
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,817
have a massively recursive

6630
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,420
network

6640
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,023
that is basically

6650
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,658
doing something really interesting.

6660
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:07,760
Now, again,

6670
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,296
not to claim priority or precedence,

6680
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,367
but independently in the 2012 paper,

6690
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,337
we predicted that the brain basically

6700
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,540
tries to model itself in order to model

6710
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:22,941
the environment,

6720
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,611
because this actually gets you

6730
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,046
through a lot,

6740
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,715
passed a lot of difficult problems.

6750
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,750
And that was an independently

6760
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,519
and again, like

6770
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,187
I want to give due credit

6780
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,722
that the idea was, no, no,

6790
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,058
the brain shouldn't predict the world.

6800
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,693
The brain should predict itself

6810
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,195
in a multiple recursive

6820
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,963
self-correcting fashion

6830
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,632
in order to predict the world.

6840
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:47,599
And for reasons

6850
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,068
that I won't go into right now,

6860
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:49,935
that just that

6870
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,970
that just gets you past

6880
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,206
so many of these roadblocks. Right.

6890
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:54,840
And then the idea

6900
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,341
is, well, what should the brain

6910
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,276
what is the brain doing

6920
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,446
when it's predicting itself?

6930
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,346
You know,

6940
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,282
there's all kinds of math, but,

6950
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:03,615
you know,

6960
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,150
a good interpretation is

6970
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:05,584
the brain

6980
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,419
is trying to reduce the degree

6990
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,153
to which

7000
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:08,954
it surprises

7010
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,657
itself, the brain at higher levels.

7020
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,925
Well, all right.

7030
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,860
You've got a level of the brain

7040
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,095
level is meant to be taken

7050
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:16,862
as an abstraction,

7060
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,363
not an anatomical region.

7070
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,932
There's a level of the brain

7080
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,201
that is, you know, doing

7090
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,402
sensory motor interaction

7100
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:23,902
with the world.

7110
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,437
And the idea is this is a loop.

7120
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,705
It's not input output,

7130
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,140
it's a continuous loop

7140
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,441
where sensation

7150
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,009
perception is modifying action

7160
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,612
and action is modifying perception.

7170
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,581
And so there's

7180
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:36,682
there's a level of the brain

7190
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:37,883
that is just registering

7200
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,485
that as patterns of activity

7210
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,320
in that causal interaction

7220
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,089
and then layers above it, try to predict

7230
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,692
how that patterns is going to unfold.

7240
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:47,726
And when there's error,

7250
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,095
the error is fed back into that layer

7260
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,430
and it is corrected

7270
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,865
to try and make a better prediction.

7280
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,299
And then what you do is you do this

7290
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,868
massively recursively.

7300
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:56,535
You have layers

7310
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:57,903
predicting the layers below them,

7320
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,172
so on, and you propagate error up

7330
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,708
and you propagate prediction down.

7340
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,310
And what that does is it

7350
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,114
it allows you to slowly, slowly

7360
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,517
hone in on the causal structure

7370
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,284
of the world.

7380
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,219
And it doesn't promise to get you

7390
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:14,753
the perfect

7400
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:15,988
causal structure of the world

7410
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,724
or any Cartesian thing like that.

7420
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,759
But what's really interesting

7430
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,660
and one of the things

7440
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,861
we talked about is,

7450
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:23,162
you know,

7460
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,863
you also have that recursive sort

7470
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:25,898
of stacking

7480
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:26,665
of layers

7490
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,534
of prediction in various models

7500
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:29,835
of deep learning.

7510
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,004
And deep learning also does. Right.

7520
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,071
It was one of the inspirations

7530
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,439
for relevance realization theory.

7540
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,441
It does the variation and selection,

7550
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,176
you know, in,

7560
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,443
in things like the wake sleep

7570
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,645
algorithm, right.

7580
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,345
And we thought, hey,

7590
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,447
there's a lot of things converging here.

7600
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,949
And then, you know,

7610
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,151
we started examining this

7620
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,020
with other people like Clark, you know,

7630
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,321
and we were going through it.

7640
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,822
He says, Well, you know what?

7650
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,392
What do you predict?

7660
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,860
There's there's a combinatorial

7670
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,261
explosive number of patterns.

7680
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,030
You could predict an environment.

7690
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,231
Well, then, you know,

7700
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,265
you predict the

7710
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,767
the important ones are the relevant ones

7720
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,769
or oops, that's going to be problematic.

7730
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:04,536
And then they tried

7740
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,904
to predict the reliable ones.

7750
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,373
No, that's not good yet enough.

7760
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,309
And then you had the idea of precision

7770
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:10,842
weighting

7780
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,879
in which you're trying to prioritize

7790
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:18,050
which patterns are given process,

7800
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,619
which is basically a model.

7810
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,221
And many people explicitly claim

7820
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,189
this in the predictive processing

7830
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,824
framework of attention.

7840
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,159
That's what attention is.

7850
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,161
Attention is psychologically

7860
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,096
a prioritization process

7870
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,164
that's doing the precision

7880
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,800
weighting that that helps the,

7890
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,604
the predictive processing avoid

7900
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,640
the combinatorial explosion.

7910
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,774
You can see the convergence

7920
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,142
coming in here.

7930
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,745
But then, you know, and

7940
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,681
fairly recently I think was 2017, 2018,

7950
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,416
Clark was talking about this

7960
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,317
and he said, well,

7970
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,085
precision weighting

7980
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,286
also ultimately comes down

7990
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,954
to task relevance.

8000
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,723
And we and, you know, and

8010
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,324
it was like, oh, no, right.

8020
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,460
That's just a mankiller.

8030
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,362
We we need a little man in there

8040
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,731
that's relevant. That's not relevant.

8050
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,099
And that can't be it.

8060
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:07,532
And then what

8070
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,534
you see is predict

8080
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,069
the predictive processing framework

8090
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:11,670
is moving

8100
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,505
to trying to come up with sort of

8110
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,574
dynamical self-correcting

8120
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,542
way in which

8130
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:18,010
the trade

8140
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,512
off relationships in the environment

8150
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,282
are being used in order to help

8160
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,684
trade off relationships. Sorry.

8170
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,586
And the way the organism

8180
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,188
is trying to survive in its environment

8190
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,157
that's more accurate

8200
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,793
can be made use of in an opponent

8210
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,429
processing fashion to help right

8220
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,130
get a non

8230
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,864
molecular account

8240
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:39,665
of the precision weighting.

8250
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:42,167
And we saw the two theories as just

8260
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,568
oh wow, they're converging,

8270
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,103
they're coming right together.

8280
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,471
And then it looks like

8290
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,173
they could actually help each other.

8300
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,408
The relevance realization

8310
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,543
can help, you know, explicate

8320
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,011
what these trade offs are like

8330
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,046
and the kind of opponent

8340
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,013
processing make.

8350
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,214
And I do mean explicate.

8360
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,816
I think this is already implicit

8370
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,618
in the most cutting edge work

8380
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,919
within precision

8390
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,455
weighting and predictive processing

8400
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,257
and the predictive processing.

8410
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:07,292
I sometimes like to use this analogy

8420
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,094
and don't push it too far,

8430
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,729
but I think the predictive processing

8440
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,730
is basically giving us

8450
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,832
the Mendelian genetics of intelligence

8460
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,834
and relevance.

8470
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,002
Realization is giving us

8480
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,171
the Darwinian evolutionary theory,

8490
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,239
and they need each other very deeply.

8500
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,574
And there's a lot of things

8510
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:23,575
that the relevance

8520
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:24,509
realization theory

8530
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,311
can give to the predictive

8540
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:28,013
processing that it doesn't do

8550
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:32,184
as directly on its own.

8560
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,752
These are things like

8570
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,320
helping to explain connections

8580
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,090
to a lot of phenomenological features.

8590
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,958
Salience,

8600
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,494
precisely the

8610
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,329
the linkage

8620
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,397
to theories of consciousness.

8630
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,399
I can go into all of this in detail,

8640
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,600
and so

8650
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,069
the two theories just feed together

8660
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,204
and they really strongly

8670
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,372
support each other.

8680
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,874
I think a very strong advantage

8690
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,509
which is coming out now

8700
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,910
and this is something

8710
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,212
we're just starting to work on.

8720
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,314
So I don't have too much to say

8730
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,482
that I'm very confident about,

8740
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,584
but I'm confident in the intuition

8750
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,619
that I will have something to say,

8760
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,421
which is that,

8770
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:09,688
you know,

8780
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:10,956
there's been a very strong critique

8790
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,224
of the predictive processing

8800
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,593
framework coming out of somebody

8810
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:15,994
who I hold in very high regard.

8820
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,496
Evan Thompson

8830
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,698
And it's complex

8840
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,900
and there's an ongoing debate.

8850
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,201
I do think that

8860
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,471
Evan's main point,

8870
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:26,905
if I can

8880
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,940
boil down a very complex argument,

8890
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,776
and I hope Evan will forgive me

8900
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:31,443
because I'm just trying

8910
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,544
to make

8920
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:33,712
sort of a promise here,

8930
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,648
but make it a plausible promise

8940
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,818
is that the predictive processing

8950
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:41,953
can be sort of refuted with,

8960
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:42,587
you know, easy

8970
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,256
counterexamples of, you know,

8980
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,557
pendulum clocks

8990
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,125
in training on a mantelpiece

9000
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:47,959
and all kinds of.

9010
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,995
So you get you get panpsychism

9020
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,363
all over the place.

9030
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,297
If predictive

9040
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,432
of these predictive processing,

9050
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,466
they're supposed to be

9060
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,767
the model of the cognitive.

9070
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,635
I've heard some

9080
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:57,836
predictive processing people

9090
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,872
despite that bullet, but for me

9100
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,975
that seems implausible.

9110
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,511
I think the answer,

9120
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,779
which is

9130
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,082
almost the forefront

9140
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,918
it in some ways in Evan's point

9150
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,120
is that predictive processing

9160
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,889
is not really as far as it claims to be.

9170
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:18,924
It's not properly

9180
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,091
embodied, embedded

9190
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,462
and active and extended.

9200
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,262
Now, I think

9210
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:28,266
the way out of that is by

9220
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,670
the connection, the integration

9230
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,938
with relevance realization theory,

9240
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,841
because relevance realization theory

9250
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,577
rounds out in the bio economy

9260
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,479
of an organism

9270
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:44,583
and it grounds out in the fact

9280
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,686
that relevance is always relevant

9290
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,622
to a system that is auto poetic.

9300
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,591
Montague put it very well.

9310
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:53,825
We're different from computers

9320
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,092
in that

9330
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,660
they don't care about the information

9340
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,728
they process,

9350
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,230
we care about the information

9360
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,331
we process.

9370
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,165
And I propose to you

9380
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,800
we care about the information we process

9390
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,001
because we are fundamentally

9400
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,569
taking care of ourselves.

9410
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,271
We are auto poetic beings

9420
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,773
and the theory of relevance realization

9430
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,108
ultimately grounds out.

9440
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,643
It says that relevance is deeper

9450
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,044
than representation, it's

9460
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,846
deeper than inference, steeper

9470
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,747
than logic.

9480
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:16,982
It's actually running off

9490
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,351
the bio economics of the organism

9500
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:20,652
and it is working

9510
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,354
in terms of the auto processes

9520
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,589
and so I think if

9530
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,258
predictive processing is integrated

9540
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,526
with relevance realization,

9550
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,227
it gets very clearly

9560
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,496
and explicitly and deeply integrated

9570
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:44,309
within both.

9580
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,310
Continue

9590
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,413
with embodiment and embeddedness.

9600
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,115
And that would address,

9610
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,950
I think, many of the criticisms

9620
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,184
that are

9630
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:54,452
emerging from

9640
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,988
from Evan Thompson's critique.

9650
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,990
So that's that's a

9660
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,724
so not only

9670
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,092
is there increased

9680
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,727
explanatory power outward

9690
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,462
in terms of explaining

9700
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,699
fundamental phenomena, there is a

9710
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,467
there's increased explanatory power

9720
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,703
in responding to deep criticism.

9730
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,104
So that's sort of

9740
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:16,541
where we're at right now.

9750
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,108
FRIEDMAN: Amazing.

9760
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,177
Many ways to go here

9770
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,812
and many great questions

9780
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:21,813
in live chat that I know

9790
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,281
we'll be able to get to

9800
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,117
one footnote

9810
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:29,487
that we'll come to as well is connecting

9820
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,323
so many of the terms

9830
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,792
that we're using here,

9840
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,193
which are being used

9850
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,829
in a technical sense,

9860
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,764
scientific or even formal

9870
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,832
and mathematical

9880
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,601
to their everyday uses

9890
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,737
ranging from attention and relevance

9900
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,505
to all these different notions

9910
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,974
of prediction,

9920
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,910
explanation, design, control

9930
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:52,844
and so forth.

9940
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,813
So connecting these natural

9950
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,047
language terms

9960
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,315
to the way that they're used in

9970
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,985
cognitive sciences is a very rich area

9980
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:01,753
for the predictive

9990
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,822
processing architecture itself.

10000
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,992
You absolutely conveyed it, which is it

10010
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:10,128
is building from Bayesian formalism

10020
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,765
around inference and uses

10030
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,501
a vertical nested model

10040
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,571
spatial metaphor.

10050
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,272
It's not actually like a skyscraper

10060
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,474
or anything like that

10070
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,743
where higher levels are making

10080
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,411
ongoing predictions

10090
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,579
and lower levels are

10100
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,180
said to be feeding upwards

10110
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,216
observations.

10120
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,685
And initially, or at the most peripheral

10130
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,253
aspects of the agents

10140
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:35,987
we have

10150
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,990
what are most sensory like observations,

10160
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,759
but those can become

10170
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,861
processed in a predictive framework

10180
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:44,829
step by step,

10190
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,097
for example, edge

10200
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,332
detection and vision,

10210
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,501
object recognition and so on.

10220
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,738
And then very interesting

10230
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:57,242
how even at the very beginning

10240
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,512
asking how this came about,

10250
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,214
you spoke to the way that and Mark

10260
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:04,983
became involved

10270
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:07,252
in this ongoing line of research,

10280
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,154
which I think speaks to the social

10290
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,922
and action of research

10300
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:11,823
and the distributed

10310
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,558
cognitive elements

10320
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,994
of development, of theory and practice.

10330
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,763
And then to bring to the very end

10340
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,632
that the relevance

10350
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:23,134
is a genic and situational.

10360
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,071
And that's kind of like the strange loop

10370
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,940
or like the quasi tautology,

10380
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,408
like fitness

10390
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:31,309
in an evolutionary

10400
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:35,246
setting is situational and it is both

10410
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,282
the most mysterious

10420
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,484
and explanatory phenomena

10430
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,520
and it's the most circular phenomena.

10440
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,789
And so relevance as well

10450
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:47,158
is so hyper situational

10460
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,594
that it can seem like

10470
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:52,130
it's going to evade generalization.

10480
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,666
Yet by combining

10490
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,701
computational architectures

10500
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,370
which are inspired by both advances

10510
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,772
in modern machine learning

10520
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,808
and artificial intelligence and deeper

10530
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:06,644
investigations of natural intelligences

10540
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:07,712
of diverse

10550
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,847
kinds ranging

10560
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,982
from ecological psychology

10570
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,218
and all these other fields.

10580
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,853
That is what you pointed to in the

10590
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:15,787
in the title

10600
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,622
conversion solutions

10610
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,624
to the frame problem. And

10620
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,127
so anything else

10630
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:22,527
to add

10640
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,762
on predictive processing,

10650
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,163
relevance, realization

10660
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,632
or there and before we add more in.

10670
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,402
VERVAEKE: Yeah, I mean, there's an important point

10680
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,640
which is important to both Bret

10690
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,109
and Mark as well as myself.

10700
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,845
I wanted to first of all, try to lay out

10710
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,080
what you might call

10720
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,782
the scientific provenance

10730
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,650
of what we're talking about here.

10740
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,419
But now I want to also talk about

10750
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,523
a domain in which it offers

10760
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,160
significant promise.

10770
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,061
I won't go over the argument here.

10780
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:00,799
I've done it in multiple places, both

10790
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,567
in many different video series.

10800
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,935
I won't even name them.

10810
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,970
The point is, in talks

10820
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,639
I've given at conferences,

10830
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,841
the relevance, realization, machinery.

10840
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,242
I think you can make a very

10850
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:12,577
plausibly strong case

10860
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,712
because relevance realization

10870
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:15,947
is not cold calculation.

10880
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,081
It's about caring.

10890
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,550
It's about what grabs your attention.

10900
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,685
It's about what calibrate your arousal.

10910
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:21,719
It's about what binds

10920
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,221
you adaptively to the environment.

10930
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,923
This is about the fundamental

10940
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,925
agent arena fitness

10950
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,194
that makes you a cognitive agent.

10960
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,030
It generates the primary affordances

10970
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:32,997
that are brought

10980
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,866
into your cognition

10990
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,935
through salience, etc.

11000
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,136
What I'm trying to get at is

11010
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,370
this is like a promo,

11020
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,905
a primordial connectedness

11030
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,374
that is constitutive of your agency.

11040
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:44,242
I think

11050
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,543
relevance, realization,

11060
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,245
and that kind of connectedness

11070
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,180
and constitution of your agency

11080
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,315
is very much

11090
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,217
what people are

11100
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,651
seeking

11110
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,320
when they're seeking this domain.

11120
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,723
General feature of meaning in life.

11130
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,625
It's a kind of connectedness.

11140
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,793
The language that is used

11150
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:05,964
is mattering, being connected,

11160
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,098
the having a fit

11170
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:08,366
between you and the world

11180
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,602
that you make a difference, right?

11190
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,036
All of this language,

11200
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:12,971
which is almost

11210
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,072
always metaphorical, that

11220
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:14,339
in fact

11230
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,407
using the word meaning as a metaphor,

11240
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:17,242
we're taking something

11250
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,142
from propositions.

11260
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:18,910
We're trying to talk

11270
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,778
about our relatedness

11280
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,213
to the environment.

11290
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,315
And I think

11300
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,784
the relevance realization

11310
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:29,254
start relevance realization

11320
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:31,122
when it is giving you

11330
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,590
what Merleau-Ponty would call

11340
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,691
an optimal grip

11350
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:34,259
and a met

11360
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,427
or in fact a meta optimal grip on

11370
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:37,562
the environment

11380
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,231
is actually affording that

11390
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,799
meaning in life.

11400
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,001
That's one point

11410
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:43,902
I want to make another point

11420
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:44,202
that I'm going

11430
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:45,270
to bring the two points together.

11440
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,804
So a bit of patience.

11450
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:47,639
If you take a look

11460
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,774
at how relevance realization works

11470
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:51,643
and this is one of the advantages.

11480
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:52,644
So I've done a lot of work

11490
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,212
in sort of insight and self-deception

11500
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,847
that have not been gone

11510
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,082
into as much in predictive processing,

11520
00:31:59,050 --> 00:31:59,350
you know,

11530
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,385
because everybody's doing

11540
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:03,488
what has attracted their interest

11550
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:04,055
and what they

11560
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:07,892
find relevant, to coin a phrase.

11570
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:08,493
But what

11580
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:09,661
what I would say to you

11590
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:10,962
is the very processes

11600
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,864
that make us adaptively intelligent,

11610
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,666
make us perennially

11620
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:15,967
prone to self-destructive,

11630
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:19,003
self-destructive behavior, because

11640
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,973
we are intelligent by

11650
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:25,677
by ignoring so much information,

11660
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,946
we always run the risk

11670
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,280
that we are actually ignoring

11680
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,315
the information needed

11690
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,783
to solve the problem.

11700
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,952
And you can catch this

11710
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,987
in the evolutionary dynamics

11720
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,088
of relevance, realization.

11730
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,791
When you have an aha moment,

11740
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,425
when you go,

11750
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,826
you have an insight, you realize,

11760
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,928
Oh, I've been I've been framing

11770
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:44,896
this, we'll even sometimes

11780
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:45,897
use that word.

11790
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:48,032
I've been looking at this the wrong way

11800
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,400
and we don't need visual perception.

11810
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,535
We mean right.

11820
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,170
I thought she was angry,

11830
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,005
but it turns out she's actually afraid.

11840
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,040
I've completely misinterpreted

11850
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,442
and you know what I'm talking

11860
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,177
about those insight moments.

11870
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,945
And that's when the system right.

11880
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,814
Is is actually doing something

11890
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,515
like punctuated equilibrium,

11900
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:05,984
like an evolution.

11910
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:06,617
But the point is,

11920
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:08,920
we don't always have insights.

11930
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,321
We have the opposite of insight,

11940
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,690
which is we get locked into blocked

11950
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,126
into mis framing situations.

11960
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,260
And in itself

11970
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,895
deceptive, self destructive manner.

11980
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:18,429
We can do this

11990
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,664
individually and collectively,

12000
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,766
echo chamber risk, etc.

12010
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:22,934
and therefore

12020
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,002
we need

12030
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,837
processes that ameliorate

12040
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,640
the self-deception without hamstringing

12050
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,242
the adaptive relevance

12060
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,410
realization

12070
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,912
that enhance insight, enhance

12080
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:35,680
that connected.

12090
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,216
That's that's meaning in life

12100
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,751
while reducing the foolishness,

12110
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:40,585
the self-destructive,

12120
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:41,953
self-destructive behavior.

12130
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,755
And I put it to you that across

12140
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:44,555
time and across

12150
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:45,757
cultures, people have come up

12160
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,058
with ecologies of practices

12170
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:47,925
for doing that.

12180
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,961
And that's what I would call wisdom.

12190
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,362
It's a kind of rationally self

12200
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,197
transcending rationality

12210
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,067
and therefore there are deep connections

12220
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,169
that can be made

12230
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,104
scientifically plausible,

12240
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:01,572
empirically testable,

12250
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:02,774
and with some of the testing

12260
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:03,574
is already occurring

12270
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,844
about central aspects

12280
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,948
of what goes into a lot of falls

12290
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,050
under the name.

12300
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:12,917
I don't like this term,

12310
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,218
but we don't seem to have a better term

12320
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,853
for spirituality

12330
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,355
where people are primarily

12340
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,857
sort of in an often nebulous fashion,

12350
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:23,961
talking about wisdom, insight,

12360
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,998
the alteration of consciousness.

12370
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:30,835
And somehow but if you think about it,

12380
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,004
a wise person is a person

12390
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:33,271
that can

12400
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:36,607
go into a very messy, complex situation

12410
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,443
and somehow zero

12420
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,645
in on the relevant information

12430
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:41,913
what really matters

12440
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,047
and appropriately

12450
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:45,183
fit themselves to that situation,

12460
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:48,453
to a difference to it in a way that

12470
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,123
brings about a movement towards

12480
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,226
flourishing for all parties involved.

12490
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,328
And so an additional thing

12500
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:58,529
that the connection

12510
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:00,264
to relevance realization provides

12520
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,300
that predictive processing doesn't have.

12530
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,568
I'm not saying it couldn't have,

12540
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,436
but I'm saying this just speeds it up

12550
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,604
and makes it is

12560
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:09,307
a connection to a lot of the work

12570
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,008
that has been done

12580
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,043
by me and others

12590
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,277
collecting relevance

12600
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,912
realization to meaning in life,

12610
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:15,513
altered states

12620
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:19,350
of consciousness, insight, flow, wisdom.

12630
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,019
And that is a powerful way

12640
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,521
to extend

12650
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,390
the explanatory scope of the theory

12660
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:29,760
while also increasing its existential

12670
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,798
and cultural relevance.

12680
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,532
FRIEDMAN: Thank you.

12690
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,834
Very interesting there.

12700
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,904
I want to pick up where you mentioned

12710
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,140
this may be towards

12720
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,741
what people can be seeking

12730
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,777
with questions around life's meaning.

12740
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,679
People search for meaning

12750
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,882
and you use some terms that are like

12760
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,683
things that matter.

12770
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,585
And you've brought up in writing

12780
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,487
and in conversation

12790
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,389
about asking people questions around

12800
00:35:58,389 --> 00:35:59,123
what matters

12810
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,825
and seeing that as an entry point

12820
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,793
into further investigation

12830
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,996
as well as like connection and fit.

12840
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,230
And you also

12850
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,133
brought up from ecological psychology

12860
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,902
the notion of affordances,

12870
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,838
capacities for action and optimal grip,

12880
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,573
where we need to hold

12890
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:19,076
the sports, implement enough to use it,

12900
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,411
but it has to be flexible

12910
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,947
and adaptive and situational as well.

12920
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:25,917
And this points in our language

12930
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,151
and thought

12940
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:30,888
to extensive spatial and visual, visual

12950
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,024
and physical metaphors

12960
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:33,958
and figures of speech.

12970
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,960
We talk about sketching ideas

12980
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,563
and even tangible aspects like

12990
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,999
comprehension and grasping ideas.

13000
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,701
So we even use this kind of

13010
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,770
optimal grip language

13020
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,772
around cognitive ideas.

13030
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,807
And this is being

13040
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,443
dovetailed in a new way

13050
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,278
with cognitive physics

13060
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,180
and the Bayesian mechanics

13070
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,481
that we'll be exploring

13080
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,183
more in active inference.

13090
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:01,385
So I think that's extremely interesting

13100
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:05,022
that even the formal isms are seeing

13110
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,492
convergence and similarity

13120
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:12,697
in terms of the physicality of things

13130
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:13,731
that might seem

13140
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,566
cognitive, mental, abstract,

13150
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,169
even spiritual and vice versa.

13160
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:21,572
And I wanted to know where's action

13170
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:22,773
in this picture?

13180
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,811
VERVAEKE: So I mean, action

13190
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,747
for me is the

13200
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,221
how do I say this without I'm

13210
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:38,322
trying to not say

13220
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:41,492
too many things all at once.

13230
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:42,059
There's

13240
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,295
agent arena relationships,

13250
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,864
set up affordances.

13260
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,601
And that's a basic level of relevance

13270
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,769
realization, a level I call

13280
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,671
participatory, knowing

13290
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,273
where the environment, the

13300
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,407
the arena and the agent

13310
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,608
are co shaping each other

13320
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,176
so that affordances open up

13330
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,212
and you don't make affordances.

13340
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,546
They're not subjective,

13350
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:03,247
they're not in you,

13360
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,449
they're not features of the environment.

13370
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,584
They're real relations.

13380
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:07,918
I say they're trans,

13390
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:09,420
just genitive relations.

13400
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,321
That's when affordances

13410
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,189
that we need to open up our ontology.

13420
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:12,990
And this has been a

13430
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,459
this has been sort of a philosophical

13440
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,061
dimension of a lot of this.

13450
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,429
Like we need to

13460
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,498
we need to bring back the idea

13470
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,233
of real relations

13480
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,601
that we've already been implicitly

13490
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,270
assuming them captivity is a

13500
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:26,837
is the

13510
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,472
is the activity of the great white

13520
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,540
shark in the shark.

13530
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,008
No, put it in the Sahara Desert.

13540
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:31,709
It dies.

13550
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,210
Is it in the ocean? No.

13560
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,578
If I put an elephant in the ocean,

13570
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:35,313
it drowns.

13580
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,314
Right. So, no, no.

13590
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,648
It's a real relationship,

13600
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,684
a real relation of fitness.

13610
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:40,584
So we need that.

13620
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,720
We need to have an ontology

13630
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,021
of real relations.

13640
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:47,591
And so the participatory knowing is

13650
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:48,693
and you remember

13660
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:49,860
this is something

13670
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,695
come out of philosophy

13680
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:51,729
is what I'm not I'm trying

13690
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,197
not to do too many arguments at once.

13700
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:53,964
You don't have to know,

13710
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,433
you know, in order to know,

13720
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,400
because if you do that,

13730
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,301
you get into infinite

13740
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:58,736
regressions, skepticism.

13750
00:38:58,736 --> 00:38:59,437
So these are

13760
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,471
this is a kind of knowing

13770
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,472
that you don't know that, you know,

13780
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:02,940
because it makes all other kinds

13790
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,608
of knowing possible for you.

13800
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:07,244
It's a co shaping by the physics,

13810
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,013
by the biology.

13820
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,281
Right, but even by the culture

13830
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,582
between you and the environment.

13840
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,818
So that affordances open up, right?

13850
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,786
So agent arena affordances

13860
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,356
are there perspectival knowing is

13870
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,057
layers up

13880
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:21,092
of recursive relevance

13890
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,094
realization in which

13900
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,062
the relevance is being translated

13910
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:27,231
as relevance to something like

13920
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:28,899
working memory.

13930
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,267
And that's what salience is.

13940
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:30,868
I put it to you

13950
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,103
that salience is relevance

13960
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,904
to working memory.

13970
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:35,706
I do not think we should be saying

13980
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,675
that salience is a property of objects

13990
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,177
or a subjective phenomena.

14000
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:41,946
It's that again,

14010
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:42,613
doesn't

14020
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:46,083
ultimately make ontological sense,

14030
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:49,086
but I'll just keep going

14040
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,188
perspectival knowing is knowing

14050
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,190
what it's like to be you here

14060
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,092
now in this state of mind,

14070
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,094
in this situation.

14080
00:39:57,094 --> 00:40:00,197
And the situation is how the arena is

14090
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,500
made afford to you

14100
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,001
and your state of mind is

14110
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,170
how you are fitted to the arena.

14120
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,873
But now you are salience landscaping it.

14130
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,842
You are foregrounding and backgrounding.

14140
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,944
You are sizing up some things.

14150
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,379
You're leaving other things

14160
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:18,382
not as distorted together more penumbra

14170
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:21,185
right and it's dynamic and it's flowing.

14180
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,220
You're always salience landscaping

14190
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:24,221
and the function

14200
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:25,022
of that salience

14210
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:27,558
landscaping is to select.

14220
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:28,826
And I mean this like

14230
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:30,327
in an evolutionary sense

14240
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:31,028
to select,

14250
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,763
which affordances

14260
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,799
are going to be enacted

14270
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:35,699
that your perspective

14280
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:36,434
perspectival knowing

14290
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,401
and what it does

14300
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,036
when it makes that selection is it

14310
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,372
also taps into your procedural

14320
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,541
knowing your sets of skills,

14330
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,676
your sensory motor routines

14340
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:46,777
for interacting with the

14350
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,914
environment, a procedural knowledge.

14360
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:50,848
This is your know how,

14370
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,250
this is your knowing how to do it.

14380
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,486
And then only

14390
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,087
within a subset of your knowing

14400
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,389
how you know how

14410
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,090
to make certain inferences,

14420
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,059
you know how to

14430
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,227
make certain proposals

14440
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,862
and propositions, etc.

14450
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,297
And that's your propositional knowing.

14460
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:10,935
So action is going up that stack.

14470
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,336
That's my proposal.

14480
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:13,404
It's the participatory

14490
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,706
knowing that is taking up by perspective

14500
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:16,440
of knowing

14510
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,542
that is taken up by procedural knowing

14520
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,044
that can be reflected

14530
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:25,983
and extended by propositional knowing.

14540
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:26,517
FRIEDMAN: One other

14550
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,854
aspect of action which I saw in the

14560
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:31,188
tension

14570
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,289
or compromise

14580
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,391
between thinking different threads

14590
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,328
and only having one mouth

14600
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,763
is action is like the eye of the needle

14610
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,933
because the embodied entity is able

14620
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,101
to only engage

14630
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,303
in one action selection at a time

14640
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,672
with potentially serious

14650
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,175
and even fatal consequence.

14660
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,377
VERVAEKE: Exactly. Exactly that.

14670
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:54,745
Take that out.

14680
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,947
That's that's important. Thank you.

14690
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:59,049
FRIEDMAN: And cognitive systems

14700
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:01,318
either as if as we model them

14710
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:04,655
or in their actuality can engage

14720
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:08,125
in all of these interesting phenomena

14730
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,261
that we've been exploring,

14740
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,363
like counterfactuals, planning

14750
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,266
all these different aspects that help

14760
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,401
one emulate, simulate.

14770
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:18,969
However we want to think about that,

14780
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,671
but consider

14790
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:24,041
alternate pasts and presence, which is

14800
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:24,842
like the

14810
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,212
perspective,

14820
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,814
counterfactual and alternate futures,

14830
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:34,351
which we must engage with to understand

14840
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,320
which sequences of actions

14850
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,556
we prefer to select.

14860
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,657
And then

14870
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:40,991
in predictive processing,

14880
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,561
the imperative becomes to,

14890
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,428
among other things,

14900
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,263
reduce our surprise about the world,

14910
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,299
which can be an optimistic model

14920
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,633
we're reducing surprise about.

14930
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:50,868
So it's not that we've

14940
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:53,203
expunged pragmatic.

14950
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:53,704
In fact,

14960
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:54,672
we've balanced

14970
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,907
in, as we'll explore formally soon,

14980
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,610
balanced epistemic and pragmatic value

14990
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:02,680
through actions selection by way

15000
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,214
of replacing this

15010
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,450
like monolithic reward pursuits

15020
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:09,587
and seeing curiosity and epistemic

15030
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:13,223
as merely like a tributary to reward.

15040
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:14,358
VERVAEKE: Exactly.

15050
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:15,492
And so

15060
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:16,660
that's another that's

15070
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,595
that's part of what I met

15080
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,763
with the analogy I gave earlier about

15090
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:23,901
genetics and and evolutionary theory

15100
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:27,805
because, you know,

15110
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:29,873
and we're all familiar people

15120
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,442
who initially encounter their say,

15130
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,577
but I don't want to reduce all surprises

15140
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:33,877
I want

15150
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:34,612
and then

15160
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:36,547
what the typical

15170
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:37,881
predictive processing is.

15180
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,250
Oh, but you will sometimes go for

15190
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:42,286
the short term increase

15200
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,054
and surprise for a long term reduction.

15210
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:44,888
And then what we're talking about

15220
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:45,990
is overall rate.

15230
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,758
But the problem is you

15240
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,928
then need something that is selecting

15250
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:51,662
between different

15260
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:54,932
large longitudinal domains of processing

15270
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:56,500
because of course, it's

15280
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,568
not always the case

15290
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:58,769
that you should prefer

15300
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,971
long term over short term, right?

15310
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,806
And there's right

15320
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:03,307
there isn't

15330
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,075
there aren't simple

15340
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,810
comparative algorithms for this

15350
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,778
you need dynamic

15360
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,179
tradeoff relationships

15370
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,582
between short term, long term between

15380
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,485
you know, well, I like some short term.

15390
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:14,952
I don't want

15400
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,287
all my short term surprises to go away

15410
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,623
because if that was to go away,

15420
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:20,824
then I, you know,

15430
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,126
that would impact

15440
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,861
greatly on my long

15450
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:24,495
term learning

15460
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,597
because I get lock in local minima.

15470
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,298
And that's not the only explanation

15480
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:29,066
for curiosity,

15490
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:29,867
but that's that's one

15500
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,468
kind of explanation you give

15510
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,137
and you go, yeah, right.

15520
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:33,937
But, you know,

15530
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:34,972
that means you can't use

15540
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:36,006
a simple hill climbing.

15550
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,274
You got to do other things.

15560
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,042
What are you doing?

15570
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,176
And, you know, there's,

15580
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,344
you know, there's people

15590
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:41,912
there's

15600
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:43,514
people like Bret and I

15610
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,015
who think that, you know, there's

15620
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,450
there's things happening in the brain,

15630
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,118
like self-organizing criticality

15640
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:50,521
at multiple levels of

15650
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,189
small world network, organization

15660
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,424
of multiple worlds,

15670
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,125
multiple levels of wiring

15680
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,226
that are trying

15690
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,728
to constantly,

15700
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:59,263
dynamically optimize

15710
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,998
these tradeoff relationships.

15720
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:01,865
And Chris

15730
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:02,566
Honey has talked

15740
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:03,600
about the fact that you can see

15750
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,737
the brain processing at multiple levels.

15760
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,872
He actually argues and I don't know,

15770
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:09,239
I don't know

15780
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,140
if I completely agree with this.

15790
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,642
But, you know, he argues

15800
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,310
and I knew that Chris was at U of T

15810
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,278
for a while.

15820
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:15,312
He argues that there actually

15830
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:16,280
isn't memory,

15840
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,015
there's just different speeds,

15850
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:19,083
longitudinal rates

15860
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,785
at which information is being processed,

15870
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:24,688
which is a really cool idea.

15880
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:27,091
And so again,

15890
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,461
what this does is soon as you start to

15900
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:33,263
make those

15910
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:34,531
completely legitimate

15920
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:35,799
moves on behalf

15930
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:37,034
of predictive processing,

15940
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:40,170
explaining things like curiosity,

15950
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:43,207
like insight, like wonder,

15960
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:44,408
because wondering curiosity

15970
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:44,942
aren't the same.

15980
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:47,311
Curiosity is there's something missing

15990
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:49,947
and you a piece of information

16000
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:51,582
and you go looking to fill it in

16010
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,950
and get rid of your ignorance,

16020
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:53,917
wondering is it was

16030
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:54,551
it was

16040
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:56,353
when you call yourself

16050
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,489
and your world into question

16060
00:45:58,489 --> 00:45:59,690
in order to set yourself

16070
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,192
on to a developmental pathway.

16080
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:05,562
It's an aspirational project and so

16090
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,333
predictive processing when it opens up

16100
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,368
its theoretical language

16110
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,771
in order to address these,

16120
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,006
you can see how it starts to lead

16130
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,909
more and more into the kind of language

16140
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,310
that is afforded

16150
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,745
by recursive relevance

16160
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:24,548
realization, theory.

16170
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:25,182
FRIEDMAN: Great.

16180
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,317
One closing note

16190
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,654
before we move to active inference

16200
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:32,790
is this question of

16210
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,793
does the fact that these models

16220
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,661
are reducing or bounding surprise

16230
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,630
mean I can't have any surprise?

16240
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,798
And then that's

16250
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:41,765
there's as you pointed out,

16260
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:42,966
there's various ways to

16270
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,601
approach or balance that

16280
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:46,570
critique.

16290
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:47,304
For example,

16300
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,539
considering the long term

16310
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,474
or the rate of surprise.

16320
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,743
And one of the most powerful responses

16330
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,411
is nested modeling,

16340
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,580
which could be like the self-belief

16350
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,081
I expect and prefer

16360
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:58,448
to hear

16370
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:00,517
from diverse and novel perspectives.

16380
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,655
Then yes, one will be surprised

16390
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,489
in a little sense,

16400
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,524
you know, lowercase surprise

16410
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:09,259
by every phoneme,

16420
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,929
but then in a deeper sense who we are,

16430
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:13,263
we can be connected

16440
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:15,332
with by hearing new information.

16450
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:18,335
So it's absolutely a valid

16460
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,270
critique of the kernel

16470
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,772
of a single layer.

16480
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:22,573
Surprise.

16490
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:23,540
Minimize your

16500
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,875
just like you would have various

16510
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,211
trivial critiques of single layer

16520
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:28,779
reward maximizers.

16530
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:29,546
Yes, or

16540
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,682
especially with nested architectures

16550
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,717
and considering and hardiness

16560
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:37,020
we can see how higher level beliefs

16570
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,255
about the self

16580
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:40,190
which can include like the rhetorical

16590
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,425
and the narrative

16600
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,360
absolutely provide a context

16610
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,528
by which lower level

16620
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,731
surprises are accommodated, if

16630
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,132
not surfed on top of

16640
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:50,434
VERVAEKE: it.

16650
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:51,301
Just one thing

16660
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:52,502
I think

16670
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:53,070
we can make,

16680
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:53,937
we can even make

16690
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:55,772
some significant progress.

16700
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:57,241
And I did this in a series with Greg

16710
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:59,042
Enriquez and Christopher Masturbator,

16720
00:47:59,042 --> 00:47:59,509
the elusive

16730
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:00,310
AI part of

16740
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,111
integrating predictive

16750
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:02,279
processing and relevance

16760
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:04,448
realization models

16770
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:06,683
to give an account of the self you take.

16780
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:07,117
You know,

16790
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:08,886
the all the accumulating evidence

16800
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,020
that self-reference,

16810
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,822
which is really just self relevance,

16820
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,924
is the glue of cognition and perception,

16830
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,292
relevance, realization.

16840
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:15,893
And then you,

16850
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,561
you can basically integrate

16860
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,163
that with how we and other people's,

16870
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:20,898
I think it's how we

16880
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,634
might call their idea of a predictive

16890
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,936
processing model of the self.

16900
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,171
And then they just

16910
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,239
go together very nicely.

16920
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,774
And then you can talk about,

16930
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:31,308
well,

16940
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:32,142
there's relevance,

16950
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,211
realization to the self

16960
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:37,114
and this is not just a computer thing.

16970
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:38,515
And you could also point out

16980
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:40,384
the fact that cells are

16990
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:41,852
because we're mammalian primates

17000
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:42,953
and this is Greg's point,

17010
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:45,055
is we learn to turn the irrelevance

17020
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,023
the other way.

17030
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:47,891
We we are not just

17040
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:48,992
for our whole development.

17050
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:51,094
How are things relevant for me?

17060
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,095
We also develop

17070
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,331
how am I relevant to others

17080
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:57,200
and to the world and even to my culture.

17090
00:48:57,868 --> 00:48:59,336
And that again starts

17100
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,138
to connect up with meaning in life.

17110
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:02,706
How am I connected to

17120
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:04,641
something bigger than myself?

17130
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:06,476
This is the metaphor that people use.

17140
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:07,244
See what I mean?

17150
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,179
There's just so many things

17160
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:10,180
that can be brought

17170
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,615
into a convergent

17180
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,550
and powerful conversation

17190
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,886
once we get this integration going.

17200
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,354
I'm not saying it's complete,

17210
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:19,356
but I'm trying to at least

17220
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:21,825
make it plausible that it is.

17230
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:24,761
It has plausible promise

17240
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,263
to extend

17250
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:27,431
the scope and power

17260
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,166
of our scientific explanation

17270
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:30,434
into domains

17280
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:32,669
that it has hitherto been blocked from

17290
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:33,637
getting out.

17300
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,440
FRIEDMAN: That's heavy.

17310
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,377
That's a massive cognitive entity.

17320
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:41,411
That's groovy.

17330
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:44,014
We're the path of least action together.

17340
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:45,983
Let us move to active inference.

17350
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,985
So right in the paper

17360
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:50,320
you mentioned active inference.

17370
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,188
One time

17380
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,190
though I think we can see it

17390
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,192
interwoven densely

17400
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:56,893
and the quotation in the paper

17410
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:59,162
was pointing to subdued at all

17420
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,630
times paper.

17430
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,132
It has recently been argued

17440
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:03,333
that active inference

17450
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,302
and free energy minimization

17460
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:06,603
necessarily entail

17470
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:08,638
the minimization of redundancy

17480
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:11,641
and the maximization of degeneracy.

17490
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:13,043
VERVAEKE: So yes. First.

17500
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,177
Just by the way,

17510
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:15,846
I just wanted to highlight

17520
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,447
redundancy and maximization.

17530
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:18,648
Just to give another example,

17540
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:19,649
I've drawn directly

17550
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,385
from cutting edge biology.

17560
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,487
I keep wanting to show again and again

17570
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,155
that this is not a trivial

17580
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:27,591
claim of proposed tacit embodiment.

17590
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,427
We are making use of fundamental

17600
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:31,795
biological principles.

17610
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:33,130
This is

17620
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:33,830
again

17630
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,900
to give a basis for a reply to evidence.

17640
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,935
I think that everything that happened

17650
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:40,103
does is brilliant, right?

17660
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,339
And so this is but this is again, I just

17670
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,041
I just I'm sorry.

17680
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:44,474
I take

17690
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:46,376
I have a deep respect for his critique,

17700
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,078
and I just want to keep pointing out

17710
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:51,515
here's a possible response.

17720
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:52,315
FRIEDMAN: Great.

17730
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,752
So we have a few

17740
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,955
images and pieces of information

17750
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:00,090
about active inference

17760
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,092
which we will uncover through action.

17770
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,693
We will reduce our surprise about

17780
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,062
what is under the gray box

17790
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,196
through action.

17800
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:06,730
But first,

17810
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,932
I just wanted to hear your perspective.

17820
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:11,001
What is active inference?

17830
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,469
How did it come into play

17840
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,136
and when

17850
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:13,603
and what

17860
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:17,941
was it doing in your recent paper?

17870
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:19,042
VERVAEKE: So

17880
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:21,578
for me

17890
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:22,712
and I know there's variation

17900
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:24,081
on this between people,

17910
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,082
I see active inference

17920
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,817
within predictive processing framework

17930
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:30,020
because I see the idea of the interplay

17940
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,022
between active inference and perception

17950
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:33,990
and that,

17960
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:37,828
first of all, Mark and Brett

17970
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:39,996
and many of the people that we cite

17980
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:44,101
are not bound to a strict

17990
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:46,103
proposition, final, logical

18000
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:46,503
or sorry

18010
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:48,171
to the logical manipulation

18020
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:48,972
of propositions

18030
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:50,273
when they use the word inference.

18040
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,009
If they would do that,

18050
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:54,277
then Evan really does

18060
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,412
have a purchase point,

18070
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:56,880
because then they are being

18080
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,714
they're being locked

18090
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:58,515
at the propositional

18100
00:51:58,515 --> 00:51:59,916
level of processing.

18110
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:00,317
They're

18120
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,018
they're not tapping into

18130
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:03,887
all the non propositional,

18140
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:06,223
you know, in a deep way.

18150
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:07,624
But Mark, for example,

18160
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,659
very much in active in body

18170
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,528
he says we just use inference

18180
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:13,730
because that's was the original term

18190
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,133
and it's just stayed as a

18200
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,568
as a way of talking.

18210
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,670
So the way I think about it is like this

18220
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:23,874
you have two ways of dealing

18230
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:24,841
with the error.

18240
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:26,209
You can change your model

18250
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:28,011
or you can change the world.

18260
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,614
And changing your model

18270
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:33,783
is broadly perception.

18280
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,385
And I just want to stop here

18290
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:36,853
and open that up.

18300
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:38,155
When we say perception,

18310
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:38,822
we don't mean

18320
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,390
what the empiricist gave us

18330
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,791
with the sense of perception.

18340
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:45,061
We don't just a purely receptive

18350
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:47,230
bottom up taking in information

18360
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,833
because we also mean prediction,

18370
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:51,535
right?

18380
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:52,802
And so

18390
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:53,336
in a very

18400
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,237
real sense,

18410
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:56,606
when I'm looking around this room,

18420
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,642
I'm not detecting

18430
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:00,076
most of what I'm seeing.

18440
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:01,311
I'm predicting it now.

18450
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:04,181
That does it mean it's an illusion.

18460
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,216
True predictions are true.

18470
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:07,484
If you don't believe that you're

18480
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,653
you don't believe in science,

18490
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:10,520
you have to give up this sort

18500
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,721
of empiricist thing that.

18510
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:12,923
Unless I touched it

18520
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,392
somehow in detection, it's not true.

18530
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:18,261
No two predictions are true.

18540
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,330
They are real relations.

18550
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,299
They are true to the world.

18560
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,301
Right. In an important way.

18570
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,703
So I would put it to you

18580
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,705
that to get closer

18590
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,640
to what is meant by perception,

18600
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,942
we have to take two terms

18610
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:33,977
that were separated in empiricism

18620
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,213
and then put at weird relationship

18630
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,080
through the Enlightenment.

18640
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,014
We have to actually integrate

18650
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:39,950
imagination and perception together.

18660
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,518
You are constantly imagining,

18670
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:43,220
perceiving and perceptive

18680
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,121
imagining your environment,

18690
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,123
but that doesn't mean it's an illusion.

18700
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:51,695
So first of all, that point right,

18710
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,163
and that opens so much up

18720
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:56,299
for explaining the the imagination

18730
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:57,167
and distinguishing

18740
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:59,102
imaginary from imaginal

18750
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,537
and all kinds of important

18760
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:02,205
and powerful things.

18770
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:03,073
The other thing you can do is

18780
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,541
you can change the world.

18790
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:04,908
Right.

18800
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,010
And what and I take it that

18810
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:10,380
active inference is a generic term

18820
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,915
for many different species

18830
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:15,719
of how we can change the world,

18840
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:19,489
we can change the world by simply

18850
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:20,924
and we are constantly doing this,

18860
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:24,227
by the way, we can just slightly alter

18870
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:26,529
our perspective again,

18880
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:27,931
the perspective of knowing.

18890
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,833
And you're you're constantly doing this.

18900
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:30,300
You're constantly

18910
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,369
just shifting your attention around.

18920
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,437
So the world is disclosing itself to you

18930
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:35,572
in new ways.

18940
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:36,172
And you

18950
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:36,973
write and you say, Well,

18960
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:38,008
that's just a new way of saying

18970
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,776
it's not just a new way of seeing

18980
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,077
you are disclosure.

18990
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,046
You are look,

19000
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:47,817
you can't ever see all of one object.

19010
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,021
You only see an aspect of it

19020
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,455
no matter what you're doing.

19030
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,556
Yet you think

19040
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:55,392
you're seeing the whole thing

19050
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,427
because what you're doing with

19060
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:58,428
this active

19070
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:00,497
inference is you are tracking

19080
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:01,931
and I really want to

19090
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:04,000
play on that sensory motor metaphor.

19100
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,802
You are tracking the through line

19110
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,704
between all of these aspects.

19120
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:08,505
For me,

19130
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:10,540
that's one of the fundamental things

19140
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,375
that active inference means.

19150
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:15,478
It's means that I am look, look at

19160
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,313
how I'm doing,

19170
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,348
but notice how actually you

19180
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,151
how understood, how unsurprised you are

19190
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:24,354
as I do this.

19200
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:25,822
That is.

19210
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,191
So the active inference is not just

19220
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:29,592
I make stuff in the world,

19230
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:31,428
it is that too, you know,

19240
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:33,196
I get the water and I drink it.

19250
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,332
And so now I no longer thirsty,

19260
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,168
but it's even in the it's

19270
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,437
even in how you are tracking,

19280
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,238
which is an action,

19290
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:44,341
a sensory motor action,

19300
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,476
how you are tracking the through line

19310
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:48,611
in the multi aspect duality

19320
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:49,879
of anything in the world.

19330
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,481
Because the amount of information

19340
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,350
that any object can present to you

19350
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,119
is actually called militarily explosive

19360
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:57,921
for me.

19370
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:58,488
Right.

19380
00:55:58,488 --> 00:55:58,922
And again,

19390
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:01,391
I'm not denying the gross motor changes

19400
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,727
in the world of active inference,

19410
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,729
but I'm most interested

19420
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:06,596
in this

19430
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,498
cognitive navigation

19440
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:10,500
of the multiuse, factuality

19450
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,703
and multiple perspectives of the world

19460
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:15,739
such that we find the throughline.

19470
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:16,539
And here's the thing

19480
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,074
that's really intriguing, Daniel.

19490
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:19,676
The through line is not itself

19500
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:20,810
an aspect.

19510
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,712
It's not itself a perspective.

19520
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,014
It is something that runs through them

19530
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:26,282
and ties them together.

19540
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:27,617
And that is the track

19550
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:29,853
I proposed to you of active inference

19560
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:33,990
at its most primordial level.

19570
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:34,824
FRIEDMAN: Excellent.

19580
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:38,094
I think that golden thread is how

19590
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:40,730
the broader system changes through time,

19600
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,567
which we model action as influencing how

19610
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,702
things change through time

19620
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:47,704
and the causal structure of the world.

19630
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:50,540
But to pull a step back,

19640
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,376
you pointed towards the two ways

19650
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:55,011
that a given agents

19660
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:57,046
can reduce the free energy

19670
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:58,848
of their generative model.

19680
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:00,150
So this is not.

19690
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,484
Gibbs free energy.

19700
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:01,985
This isn't

19710
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:03,820
the thermochemical free energy

19720
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,422
that causes combustion.

19730
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,657
This isn't Tesla Tech free energy.

19740
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:08,958
Though I eagerly await

19750
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,027
the day when that synthesis is made.

19760
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,395
This is an information

19770
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:14,030
theoretic quantity

19780
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:15,865
that bears resemblance

19790
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:17,834
to the free energy

19800
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:19,469
calculations used in

19810
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,571
chemistry and physics and other areas.

19820
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:23,339
And we call that Bayesian mechanics

19830
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:24,774
and the process theory

19840
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,975
by which it occurs

19850
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:27,243
being active inference.

19860
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:30,046
And so you point to two ways in which

19870
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:31,147
a given agent

19880
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,349
can reduce the free energy,

19890
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:33,917
which balance

19900
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:34,484
the surprise

19910
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,653
or with a tractable heuristic

19920
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:38,455
of their generative model.

19930
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,990
And those are to change the model.

19940
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,892
So change one's self,

19950
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:46,396
and that can subsume an entire taxonomy

19960
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:49,265
of cognitive types and parameters

19970
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:50,700
as model.

19980
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,802
They don't have to be a specific neural

19990
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,637
anatomical region.

20000
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,306
And those parameters

20010
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,173
that can be changing

20020
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:58,441
to reduce free energy

20030
00:57:58,441 --> 00:57:59,676
of a generative model

20040
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:02,779
can include the continuum of perception

20050
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:03,847
learning

20060
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,182
as well as expectation preferences

20070
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:08,518
and also models of action

20080
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:09,385
and the other way

20090
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:10,320
in which

20100
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,621
a given entity

20110
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:14,057
can balance their free energy

20120
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:14,958
and seek to reduce

20130
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,593
it is through taking action

20140
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:17,327
in the world.

20150
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:17,760
And so

20160
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,661
active inference

20170
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:19,729
is built around

20180
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,831
the action perception loop

20190
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,968
and it gives to meta affordances

20200
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:27,904
for reducing the free energy

20210
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,406
by way of minimizing surprise.

20220
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:31,541
So I'm going to go

20230
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,309
one more level into detail

20240
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:35,211
with the active inference

20250
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,780
by revealing the first gray box.

20260
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:42,051
So this is an image from a recent paper

20270
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:43,820
this year by Chris Thorne

20280
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,755
called an informal reconstruction

20290
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:46,556
of the Free Energy

20300
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:47,790
Framework, examining

20310
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:50,493
the conceptual problems that arise.

20320
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,195
And the red text

20330
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,997
is an additional annotation

20340
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,732
that we've added into this

20350
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:57,600
excellent summary figure,

20360
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:02,071
and we can read this figure as being a

20370
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:06,075
perhaps a kairos based historiography.

20380
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:06,809
It's not a literal

20390
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,678
chronology of history,

20400
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:09,445
but we can see it

20410
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:10,880
as part of the dialectic

20420
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,415
of research progression,

20430
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:14,551
and it begins with the necessity

20440
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,219
of learning and developing,

20450
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,321
which leads one to adopt a Bayesian

20460
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:19,722
inferential scheme.

20470
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,924
My personal preference

20480
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:21,958
is that last names

20490
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,760
don't stay attached to terms,

20500
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,327
but Bayesian

20510
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,195
inference broadly just means models

20520
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:27,730
that update as opposed

20530
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:28,731
to, for example,

20540
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:31,000
descriptive frequentist statistics.

20550
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,836
But the necessity of Harris NICS

20560
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:34,470
for Bayesian

20570
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,539
inference comes a very early

20580
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:39,475
because exact Bayes is hard

20590
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:40,276
to compute,

20600
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:41,678
especially on large

20610
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:43,112
or unknown state spaces.

20620
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,181
The necessity

20630
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:46,082
of Harris sticks

20640
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,418
takes a further developmental stage

20650
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,688
by the necessity of proxies

20660
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:54,791
that bound the exact Bayesian

20670
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:56,459
or even the Harris stick or approximate

20680
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:57,961
Bayesian solution

20690
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:58,895
and so we can consider

20700
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,431
that like uncertainty reduction.

20710
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:05,134
And then this is all pre friston at all

20720
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:06,536
here.

20730
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:09,072
Diane And with Bayesian brain work

20740
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:11,107
and also the work of Hinton and others

20750
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,409
in level four where we see

20760
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,278
free energy minimization,

20770
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,280
free energy minimization

20780
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,149
is computational Harris stick

20790
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:24,020
that is already widely in use going back

20800
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,689
to Feynman and before to

20810
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:30,259
bound uncertainty

20820
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:33,363
with a tractable computational approach

20830
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,065
that includes reducing uncertainty

20840
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:37,934
and kind of being on this perennial

20850
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:41,371
optimal frontier of not

20860
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:42,805
collapsing uncertainty

20870
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:44,440
too much or too little.

20880
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,308
And in a way

20890
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,542
that's kind of like the energy

20900
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:47,944
and Wolpe term

20910
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:50,013
in the Gibbs free energy world,

20920
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:50,947
except we're in an

20930
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,915
informational world now.

20940
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:53,282
So that's

20950
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:57,053
where we were at before the recent work

20960
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,522
in the last, say, 10 to 20 years

20970
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,024
of especially Karl

20980
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:02,892
Friston and collaborators.

20990
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:04,594
And what Thornton points

21000
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:06,229
to as some of the key

21010
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:08,064
contribution ins that were made

21020
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:09,098
was this

21030
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:12,235
particularly a genetic interpretation

21040
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,804
of the lower four levels

21050
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:17,206
by suggesting that

21060
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:18,374
the figure could be separated

21070
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:19,375
from the grounds,

21080
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:20,977
that the generative model

21090
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:22,945
could be separated or partitioned

21100
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,981
from the generative process,

21110
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:28,551
which is the niche and that entails

21120
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,886
a process theory

21130
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,954
which we call active inference,

21140
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:34,290
which is suggesting a synthesis

21150
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:35,558
of inference,

21160
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:36,526
broadly considered,

21170
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,795
as you pointed to, and action

21180
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:42,265
and finding all the contact points

21190
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:44,133
and the ways that inference and action

21200
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:45,068
come together

21210
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,536
just as the term active

21220
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,770
inference would suggest,

21230
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,139
which means like action is used

21240
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:52,341
to improve inference, you turn over

21250
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:53,476
the object.

21260
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:55,211
Inference is about action.

21270
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,346
It's about selecting action.

21280
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:58,548
It's about learning

21290
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,216
the consequences of action

21300
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,084
and how conditional

21310
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:02,085
they are on world

21320
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:02,885
states and other

21330
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,420
hidden state inferences.

21340
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,056
And so the one level

21350
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,491
that we can bring in, which

21360
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,426
in the active inference textbook

21370
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:11,627
is called the high road

21380
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:12,862
to active inference

21390
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:15,031
is the necessity of persistence

21400
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:16,532
and quite simply, objects

21410
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:18,234
that aren't acting at least

21420
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,470
as if they're surviving

21430
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:23,239
will not be around to be observed later.

21440
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:25,541
So whether it's a rock

21450
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:27,043
or whether it's a computer

21460
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:29,445
or whether it's a biological system,

21470
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:31,681
it must at least be acting for the time

21480
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:33,916
that you're observing it or modeling it

21490
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:37,553
as if it is surviving in a potentially

21500
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:40,356
very complex statistical niche.

21510
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,059
And so these six levels

21520
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:45,695
do an excellent job of describing

21530
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,864
how general statistical

21540
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:48,998
and learning frameworks

21550
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:49,532
like Bayesian

21560
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:53,536
statistics can become improved

21570
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:54,637
and elaborated upon

21580
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:57,240
through computational approaches

21590
01:02:57,473 --> 01:02:58,741
which have only been developed,

21600
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:00,376
for example, the Bayesian graph approach

21610
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:01,277
and so on.

21620
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,912
In the previous several decades

21630
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,516
in the agents frame

21640
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:09,185
directly leads us to considerations

21650
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:10,953
of active inference and understanding

21660
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:11,854
how inference

21670
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:12,321
and self

21680
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:13,923
modeling, including self modeling

21690
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:15,691
about action of the agents,

21700
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:17,960
are a way that either we can either

21710
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,162
think of what

21720
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:20,663
agents are actually doing,

21730
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:23,132
or at the very least we can model

21740
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,901
what agents are doing through

21750
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:26,402
active inference.

21760
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:28,004
VERVAEKE: Excellent.

21770
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:30,206
I'd like to I don't know. This paper.

21780
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:31,207
It looks like a paper

21790
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:32,809
I would like to have.

21800
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,778
So I'll ask you to send me a link later.

21810
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:37,847
FRIEDMAN: Awesome.

21820
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:40,416
So then do you want to add any more?

21830
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,251
Or we can go one more level.

21840
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:43,319
VERVAEKE: And I mean,

21850
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:45,154
I think

21860
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,356
I don't know if what I'm proposing is a

21870
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:49,559
is an additional level, maybe it is

21880
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:50,893
or maybe it's a way

21890
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:52,228
of adding a dimension

21900
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,530
to the highest level

21910
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,098
or dimensions to all of it,

21920
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:57,033
or at least

21930
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,034
maybe level

21940
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:00,236
seven, six and five

21950
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:02,171
relevance realization.

21960
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,540
And, and again, we, we relevance

21970
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,475
realization predictive processing

21980
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:08,010
have common ancestors.

21990
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:08,644
Jeff Hinton,

22000
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:10,713
who of course was at U of T

22010
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:11,180
and deep

22020
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,815
learning, was one of the explicit things

22030
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:13,916
we drew upon

22040
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:15,251
where we were trying to talk

22050
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:16,919
about relevance, realization

22060
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:19,055
and remember the title of the paper,

22070
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,289
Relevance Realization

22080
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:21,624
and the emerging framework

22090
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:22,792
in Cognitive Science.

22100
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:23,926
We were trying to say, look,

22110
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:25,328
there are general strategies

22120
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:26,495
in different areas

22130
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:28,297
that look remarkably similar

22140
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:29,966
and they seem to be strategies

22150
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:31,767
for dealing with this central problem,

22160
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:33,769
a relevance realization.

22170
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:35,638
FRIEDMAN: We could see the organisms

22180
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:39,075
persistence or eco evolutionary fitness

22190
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:40,443
as being like

22200
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:41,310
the environment,

22210
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:44,013
as the selector of relevance.

22220
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:45,715
And then we can think the view

22230
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,083
from the inside,

22240
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,417
the psychological

22250
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:49,485
or even experiential

22260
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:53,122
aspects of relevance to be a part

22270
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,390
that broader system.

22280
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:57,093
And we can imagine kind of two cases.

22290
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:58,327
One is where the

22300
01:04:58,327 --> 01:04:59,762
the organisms

22310
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:01,864
experience and cognition

22320
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:02,899
around relevance

22330
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:03,833
is aligned

22340
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,235
with ecologically selective fitness.

22350
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:06,602
Yes.

22360
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:07,503
At which case

22370
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:09,672
you're going to find that entity

22380
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:11,240
surviving and thriving.

22390
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,541
You can also imagine

22400
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:14,710
where relevance leads us askew

22410
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:17,113
and things become relevance,

22420
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:18,781
whether it's repetitive behavior,

22430
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:20,049
self-destructive behavior

22440
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:20,816
through information

22450
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:21,651
filtering

22460
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:22,518
all these cases

22470
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:24,754
in which our relevance realization

22480
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:26,722
is missing

22490
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:27,189
the mark

22500
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:28,958
it sends with respect

22510
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:31,794
to the ecological selection. Exactly.

22520
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:33,162
VERVAEKE: And that's my point,

22530
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:35,231
how the very process

22540
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,965
that makes you

22550
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:36,933
adaptive also

22560
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,668
makes you perennially susceptible

22570
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:39,902
to self-destructive,

22580
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:41,370
self-destructive behavior.

22590
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:43,406
You sin, you miss the mark

22600
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:44,273
in a way

22610
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:48,678
that you can't realize you're doing.

22620
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:49,745
FRIEDMAN: And we calibrate

22630
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:53,115
and we learn as long as we are around.

22640
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:54,550
VERVAEKE: Right.

22650
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:54,884
Well,

22660
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:55,318
what I meant

22670
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:56,085
is as long as you're

22680
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:59,155
remaining in your said that it's self

22690
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:01,590
and closes and the other activity

22700
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:04,293
the ability of an adaptive system

22710
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,395
to reduce reduced perturbation means

22720
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:08,431
when you have these kinds of parasitic

22730
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:09,365
processing going

22740
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:12,001
on, it hijacks that out activity

22750
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:13,002
and prevents

22760
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:13,602
your attempts

22770
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:14,437
to perturb

22780
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:16,072
it and break and help

22790
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:16,772
you break out

22800
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:18,240
of the inappropriate framing.

22810
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,076
That's why you need very comprehensive

22820
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:21,811
ecologies of practices

22830
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,312
in order to cultivate wisdom.

22840
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,814
It's why simply knowing

22850
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:25,948
that you shouldn't do that

22860
01:06:25,948 --> 01:06:27,283
same stupid thing you do

22870
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:28,951
in your romantic relationships

22880
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:30,753
is massively insufficient

22890
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:31,554
for not doing that

22900
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:32,922
same stupid thing you keep doing

22910
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:34,390
in your romantic relationships.

22920
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:38,060
FRIEDMAN: Yes, in the antique framework

22930
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:40,730
with the ecological richness

22940
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:41,697
that is being brought

22950
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:43,833
in, helps us contextualize

22960
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,801
and take a pluralistic approach

22970
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:46,969
towards the various kinds

22980
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:47,937
of interventions

22990
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,071
which might be suggested,

23000
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:50,673
because interventions

23010
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:54,076
for different kinds of relevance,

23020
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,112
you know, mal alignments, self

23030
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:58,147
other perceived in cases

23040
01:06:58,147 --> 01:06:59,682
where there's conflict there,

23050
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,884
they could include like neurochemical,

23060
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:04,520
it could include an action oriented.

23070
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,088
There's so many different ways

23080
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:08,524
in which this nexus of the entity

23090
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,925
engaging in inference

23100
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:10,893
and action

23110
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:13,362
can be modified and shaped, that

23120
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,432
without integrative models

23130
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:18,167
to help us understand

23140
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:19,502
it can descend into

23150
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,871
kind of a disciplinary preference

23160
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,305
show off.

23170
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:24,373
VERVAEKE: Yeah, yeah.

23180
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:25,441
The church of the level

23190
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:26,242
I call that

23200
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,877
the church of the level of analysis

23210
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,145
you believe everybody

23220
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:30,379
should be working at. Yes.

23230
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:31,847
FRIEDMAN: Great.

23240
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:35,885
So let's look at a second aspect

23250
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:39,422
of active inference, which is its formal

23260
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:40,990
basis.

23270
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,725
Now, there are many ongoing

23280
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:45,061
developments in the formalism

23290
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:46,429
around active inference

23300
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:48,064
and the free energy principle.

23310
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,166
And so this is barely even

23320
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:51,534
the tip of the iceberg,

23330
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:54,003
but hopefully showing these formal isms,

23340
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:56,772
which we explore in much greater detail

23350
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,441
in many of the other

23360
01:07:58,441 --> 01:07:59,075
several hundred

23370
01:07:59,075 --> 01:07:59,975
live streams

23380
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:00,743
that you'll find

23390
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:03,512
at the Active Inference Institute,

23400
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:05,848
just to show a few of the aspects

23410
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:06,816
of the formalism

23420
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:09,218
so people can triangulate

23430
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:11,487
and have a little bit of a sense

23440
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,923
for where is active inference between.

23450
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,592
So this is from a paper of to Costa

23460
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,127
at all from 2020

23470
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:18,894
active inference

23480
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:21,230
on discrete state spaces a synthesis.

23490
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:24,066
So I'll make this image as large

23500
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:26,202
as I can.

23510
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:30,339
There's two key aspects in this figure

23520
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:34,210
the top which we won't go into detail

23530
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:36,212
in, is describing

23540
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:37,847
two types of inference

23550
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:39,115
which are on the bottom

23560
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,549
perceptual inference,

23570
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,418
which is like a best fitting

23580
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:44,286
estimate for perception

23590
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,621
given the sensory data

23600
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,755
which are incoming,

23610
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:48,324
which includes the blind spot

23620
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:49,492
and the low resolution

23630
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:50,526
outside of the fovea,

23640
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:51,660
and the lack of color vision

23650
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:52,428
outside the phobia

23660
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:54,029
and all these other attributes

23670
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:54,830
of our

23680
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,132
generative model,

23690
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,099
such that we even know

23700
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:57,366
that we're

23710
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:58,934
in a generative model and not,

23720
01:08:58,934 --> 01:08:59,702
for example,

23730
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:01,237
within some sort of naive

23740
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:04,240
signal processing inward only.

23750
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,142
So I see this as just absolute

23760
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:06,842
slam dunk

23770
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:07,443
for predictive

23780
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,512
processing architectures broadly

23790
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:11,480
that we don't experience the blind spot,

23800
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,782
we don't see it, and that's normal

23810
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:14,750
because our salience

23820
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,819
has been tuned down

23830
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,088
to blurriness in that area and so on.

23840
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:20,022
And in the top

23850
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,323
we have expected

23860
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,691
free energy minimization,

23870
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:23,759
which in contrast

23880
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,828
the variational free energy minimization

23890
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,197
expected free energy is prospective.

23900
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,966
It's about selecting expect among

23910
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:32,768
policies, sequences

23920
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:34,970
of action sequences of affordances

23930
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,272
that can be expected

23940
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,040
to result in different outcomes.

23950
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,942
Now the entity could be wrong

23960
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,310
and that could lead to the entity

23970
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:44,113
not existing, but within the scope.

23980
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:45,514
The generative model

23990
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:46,515
expected free energy

24000
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,284
is how different policies

24010
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:49,351
about one's

24020
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,686
own world states

24030
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,621
about the Markoff blanket here

24040
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:54,723
which are the set of perceptual

24050
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,192
and active nodes

24060
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,360
that mediate the interface between

24070
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,862
the entity and the niche.

24080
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,131
The way that those are

24090
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:03,866
balanced in prospect

24100
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,569
ID inference is summarized on the top.

24110
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:07,670
And then it's quite interesting

24120
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,538
to look at some of these special cases

24130
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:10,639
on the bottom.

24140
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:12,608
And so we can think about these as like

24150
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:14,043
the Poles

24160
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:14,977
in which

24170
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:16,111
the big tent of active

24180
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:18,581
inference is propped up on.

24190
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:19,682
These are cases

24200
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:21,183
where when one parameter

24210
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,452
is minimized or maximized

24220
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:24,920
or doesn't exist,

24230
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:25,721
there are various

24240
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,790
special cases that arise.

24250
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:30,192
So just to give a few examples

24260
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:33,662
where there is no preference,

24270
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:36,932
we see information gain maximization.

24280
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:40,135
That's like a pure novelty search.

24290
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:42,504
In contrast, where we have

24300
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:45,040
ambiguity or risk,

24310
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,476
so we have complete information.

24320
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:50,946
Then we can engage in classical utility

24330
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:52,748
like calculations.

24340
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:53,849
So that's kind of like

24350
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:55,651
when we don't have to learn anything

24360
01:10:55,651 --> 01:10:57,353
or reduce our uncertainty,

24370
01:10:57,353 --> 01:10:59,555
then that's a special case

24380
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:01,890
in which pragmatic value alone

24390
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,025
can be pursued,

24400
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:04,526
where pragmatic value

24410
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:06,262
has been taken off the table

24420
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,097
because all outcomes are equal,

24430
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,365
because our preferences across

24440
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:10,532
them are flat,

24450
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:12,835
then the inference can move

24460
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:14,803
into a more exploratory mode

24470
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:17,106
represented by like optimal surprise

24480
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,108
or information maximization.

24490
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,442
And there are some deeper

24500
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:21,343
and more subtle

24510
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,946
links with maximum entropy principles.

24520
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:25,914
But this is just to show

24530
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:27,750
a few of the kinds of formalism

24540
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,852
that we explore in active inference

24550
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:30,919
which bring together

24560
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:32,655
many previous threads

24570
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:35,357
in perceptual perceptual inference

24580
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:37,559
as well as inference about action,

24590
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:39,261
for example, from cybernetics,

24600
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:43,599
control theory and so on.

24610
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:44,466
Just a few notes,

24620
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:46,035
and then

24630
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:48,604
one last piece that I think will

24640
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,607
hopefully connect us to thinking

24650
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:54,009
about communication, culture,

24660
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:56,478
and then also bridge to the questions

24670
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:57,646
that I've seen

24680
01:11:57,646 --> 01:12:00,015
stack up in the live chat.

24690
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:01,583
So these are

24700
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:04,420
from the Active Inference Ontology,

24710
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,455
which is a project

24720
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:07,990
at the Active Inference Institute

24730
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,358
that we've been developing

24740
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:12,061
for a while over a year now.

24750
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,597
And what we have is a

24760
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,000
what started as a terms list

24770
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,668
but continues to develop

24780
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:21,570
to be much, much more.

24790
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,872
And we think of active inference

24800
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:24,740
in building

24810
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:26,642
competency and familiarity

24820
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:27,876
with learning and applying

24830
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:29,044
active inference

24840
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:29,611
in terms

24850
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:31,113
of quite literally skilled

24860
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:33,582
performance of a language.

24870
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:34,216
The terms

24880
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:35,584
and how they're related

24890
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:36,385
constitute

24900
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:38,454
the active inference ontology.

24910
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:41,056
And so two views that speak

24920
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,825
hopefully to the directions

24930
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:44,360
that this can help us pursue

24940
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,061
rigor as well as accessibility.

24950
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:50,232
Simple English definitions

24960
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:52,835
that link to other terms,

24970
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:55,003
just like you'd see in a dictionary.

24980
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:55,771
A dictionary doesn't

24990
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:57,840
really tell you what the word means.

25000
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,675
It just has more words.

25010
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,477
Yet It still is considered

25020
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:02,544
a useful artifact

25030
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:03,812
by those who are learning

25040
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:05,214
in applying a language.

25050
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,782
And so that's exactly what

25060
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:09,985
our terms and definitions provide,

25070
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:12,421
which are natural language definitions

25080
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:13,822
for some of these terms,

25090
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:16,058
which often straddle the line

25100
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,293
or confuse optimally

25110
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:20,262
between everyday usages

25120
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:21,797
and technical usages.

25130
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:23,766
Again, surprise, attention.

25140
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:24,900
All these different terms

25150
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,169
which you might hear day to day

25160
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:29,037
being used informally.

25170
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:30,305
They sometimes are used

25180
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:31,573
both in an informal

25190
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:33,175
and quite technical sense

25200
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:34,543
in active inference.

25210
01:13:34,543 --> 01:13:35,978
And the second aspect

25220
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:38,914
that's been a great direction and,

25230
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,382
and really inclusive

25240
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:42,084
area of participation

25250
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,453
is with translating all of those terms

25260
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:46,789
into different natural languages.

25270
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,526
So here we see English as well as,

25280
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:51,493
equal partners

25290
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:52,227
with Spanish,

25300
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:53,262
Portuguese, French,

25310
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:55,864
Italian, Czech, Russian, Hebrew, Persian

25320
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:59,034
and hopefully many more to come.

25330
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:00,602
And so by treating

25340
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,704
this linguistic artifact

25350
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:04,173
as a collaborative

25360
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,408
and participatory projects

25370
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:07,409
and being able

25380
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:09,611
to bring in natural languages

25390
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:10,846
that people have,

25400
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:13,081
as well as bring in computer languages

25410
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:13,816
like our

25420
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:15,751
nomenclature and how we name

25430
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:17,653
computer variables,

25440
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:20,756
we aim for something like a triple play

25450
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,491
where we can connect

25460
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,493
natural language descriptions

25470
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:27,262
of everyday settings

25480
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:29,164
or of contrived settings.

25490
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:30,165
Those everyday

25500
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:30,899
natural language

25510
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:33,135
descriptions can be visualized

25520
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:35,337
and they can also be rendered

25530
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:37,406
as executable models

25540
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:40,075
because we see that as the promise

25550
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:41,677
of applying active inference

25560
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:43,212
can be most powerful.

25570
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:46,982
When people are engaging in the skills

25580
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:49,618
and in the ways that feel natural

25590
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:51,587
and meaningful to them,

25600
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:52,921
such as in community

25610
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:54,990
engaging in practices

25620
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,826
and that is supported and scaffolded in

25630
01:14:57,826 --> 01:14:59,161
in feedback

25640
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,163
with computational systems

25650
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:04,366
that facilitate the communication and

25660
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,001
imagination

25670
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:07,102
around the discussion,

25680
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:09,104
for example, of visualization

25690
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:12,941
and also provide in the same flow

25700
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:15,644
executable simulations.

25710
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:17,546
So it's not just like there's people

25720
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:18,847
who are having a conversation

25730
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,282
at the chalkboard

25740
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:21,183
and then the modelers

25750
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,718
go take it into a different room.

25760
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:23,185
And that's

25770
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,487
where like the alchemy happens.

25780
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:28,590
We think that by connecting the ontology

25790
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:31,293
with natural terms

25800
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:33,962
and computational representations,

25810
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:35,931
that there will be new ways

25820
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:37,432
to be developing

25830
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:38,033
certain kinds

25840
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,368
of cognitive

25850
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:43,739
models and infrastructure together.

25860
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:44,306
VERVAEKE: So you're

25870
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:48,410
actually trying to afford wisdom.

25880
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:49,278
FRIEDMAN: What does that mean or

25890
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:50,078
what does it look like?

25900
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,080
VERVAEKE: Well, I mean,

25910
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,081
insofar as

25920
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:54,283
you're helping people

25930
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:57,452
to apply Sophia into parenthesis,

25940
01:15:57,452 --> 01:15:57,819
these are the

25950
01:15:57,819 --> 01:15:58,620
two words for wisdom

25960
01:15:58,620 --> 01:15:59,187
in ancient Greek,

25970
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:00,822
Sophia, is your knowledge

25980
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:01,823
of first principles.

25990
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:02,291
And from this,

26000
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:03,692
this is how you apply it

26010
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:05,827
within a particular context

26020
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:07,362
so that it is effective,

26030
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:09,364
both giving you virtuosity and virtue.

26040
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:11,099
You're trying to help people

26050
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:13,168
translate Sophia into promises,

26060
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:17,372
which is the sort of meta ability

26070
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:18,840
that is required for people

26080
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,376
to be genuinely wise.

26090
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:26,048
FRIEDMAN: With virtuosity and virtue.

26100
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:29,785
I see a lot of

26110
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:33,355
what could be positive

26120
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,391
for research and technical areas,

26130
01:16:36,391 --> 01:16:37,459
which is

26140
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:38,694
it's not enough

26150
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:41,063
to have virtuosity alone.

26160
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:43,699
Someone can very skilled at taking aim

26170
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,001
in a variety of different domains,

26180
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:48,503
maybe one domain, maybe across domains,

26190
01:16:48,503 --> 01:16:51,173
but without virtue.

26200
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:51,673
Then

26210
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,210
what you have is

26220
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:58,880
skill and capacity, without alignment.

26230
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:01,383
Maybe even the propositional belief

26240
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:02,551
alignment doesn't exist

26250
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:03,552
or it's impossible.

26260
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:04,953
It's useless or worthless

26270
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:06,488
or meaningless.

26280
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:08,790
And then all that virtuosity

26290
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:09,758
to say

26300
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:11,193
it's for not would be an understatement,

26310
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:11,827
because that person

26320
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:12,894
already made that claim.

26330
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:15,130
But it could be worse than for not.

26340
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,231
And so.

26350
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:16,531
VERVAEKE: Yeah.

26360
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:17,332
And I want

26370
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:17,799
I want to say

26380
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,701
the opposite is also the case virtually

26390
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:21,303
without virtuosity

26400
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,672
is something that undermines

26410
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:26,842
the respect that virtue is due

26420
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:29,044
because you have people sort of

26430
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:31,647
attempting by virtue

26440
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,849
without having the capacity,

26450
01:17:33,849 --> 01:17:35,117
the virtuosity needed

26460
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:37,919
to genuinely empower it in the world.

26470
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:41,556
And so that's also problematic

26480
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:42,758
and so you can get that

26490
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:44,593
you can get the reduction of virtue

26500
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:47,329
to following simplistic rules

26510
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:48,597
or merely

26520
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:50,766
signaling the presence of something

26530
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:53,101
without having the requisite virtuosity

26540
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:58,740
to bring it reliably into being.

26550
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:01,843
FRIEDMAN: How does what you've been working on

26560
01:18:03,745 --> 01:18:05,313
points towards or

26570
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:06,982
help us come to terms

26580
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:12,187
with wise technologies?

26590
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:15,824
VERVAEKE: So that's I mean, for me,

26600
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:18,360
I try to take

26610
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:21,563
I mean, a big part of my aware of three

26620
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:22,597
hats.

26630
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:24,533
One is that the scientist hat,

26640
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,501
which I've been mostly wearing today

26650
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:28,203
in our conversation,

26660
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:30,872
but I also I also wear a hat

26670
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:35,377
where I help to develop, teach, curate,

26680
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:36,478
create, cultivate

26690
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:38,413
ecologies of practices,

26700
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:39,681
as you said, pluralism.

26710
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:40,482
I wanted to strengthen

26720
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:41,683
the pluralism point you made.

26730
01:18:41,683 --> 01:18:43,819
But it wasn't right for me to intervene

26740
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:44,820
at the time.

26750
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:45,320
Pluralism.

26760
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,021
I mean,

26770
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:48,423
one of the things that the framework I'm

26780
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:50,592
I'm proposing with, Brett and Mark,

26790
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:54,896
is to note that a lot of relevance

26800
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:56,598
realization and had predictive

26810
01:18:56,598 --> 01:18:58,667
processing is taking place

26820
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:03,505
by making use of trade off relationships

26830
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:05,841
between different values

26840
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:08,176
different properties of the environment.

26850
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:09,845
I gave you the upon processing

26860
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:11,012
with the detention,

26870
01:19:11,012 --> 01:19:12,647
you can think of the opponent processing

26880
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:14,683
within the autonomic nervous system

26890
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:16,351
for constantly calibrating.

26900
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:16,885
So what you do

26910
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:17,686
is you get a system

26920
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:18,954
that is two systems

26930
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:21,022
that are biased in opposite directions.

26940
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:21,990
One is trying to interpret

26950
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:23,825
everything is threaded opportunity.

26960
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:25,460
Another one is trying to interpret

26970
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:29,364
everything as a safety and recuperation

26980
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:31,800
and they are pulling in on each other

26990
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:32,834
like this constantly.

27000
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:34,603
And that's how your level of arousal

27010
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:35,170
in a non

27020
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:35,704
homunculus

27030
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:37,839
fashion is constantly evolving

27040
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:39,307
its calibration to the world.

27050
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:42,410
So many examples of this, right?

27060
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:43,745
And often in multiple multi

27070
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:46,214
multiple dimensions where

27080
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:47,883
I mean trade off relationships

27090
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:49,684
that are also in trade off relationships

27100
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:50,252
with each other.

27110
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:50,552
That's why

27120
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:52,954
I use the metaphor of an ecology.

27130
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:54,156
If you think of ecology

27140
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:55,891
is all these checks and balances,

27150
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:57,626
both, you know, at the same level

27160
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,661
and between levels of organization

27170
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:01,029
and ecology,

27180
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:03,231
there is no panacea practice,

27190
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:05,033
no free lunch theorem, etc., etc.

27200
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:06,902
There is no panacea practice.

27210
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:08,503
They right, you need

27220
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:09,538
you need to get

27230
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:12,908
a dynamic ecology of practices that

27240
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:16,178
well optimizes

27250
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:18,280
for that

27260
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,816
multi-layered opponent processing.

27270
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:25,020
And so I try to use

27280
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:28,290
my knowledge as a scientist

27290
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:30,725
to look for places

27300
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:32,460
within traditional

27310
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,696
and emerging ecologies of practices

27320
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:36,998
where I can see those design principles

27330
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:38,166
being applied

27340
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,702
very well or being developed very well.

27350
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:44,739
And then I help to develop those,

27360
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:46,374
cultivate them,

27370
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:48,176
help build those communities.

27380
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:50,045
And then

27390
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:53,148
that takes me into my third,

27400
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:54,649
which I didn't ever

27410
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:56,551
think I'd be wearing and I'm wearing,

27420
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:57,485
which is

27430
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:59,521
what is it to build these communities

27440
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:00,522
so that

27450
01:21:00,589 --> 01:21:03,391
the wisdom of individual cognition

27460
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:05,493
and the wisdom of distributed

27470
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:08,163
cognition are optimal aligned

27480
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:11,132
so that we have the best access

27490
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:12,634
within a community

27500
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:13,935
and then build those communities

27510
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:16,204
into communities of communities.

27520
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:18,840
That's this project that I now

27530
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,176
find I'm actually engaged in a lot.

27540
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,245
I do not claim to have

27550
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:24,980
any particular expertize for this.

27560
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,948
It's just that I have fallen into it

27570
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:28,717
and I seem to be the person

27580
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,418
that is undertaking it.

27590
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:32,220
So this one sort of hesitant,

27600
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,322
but I'm doing it with other people

27610
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:36,658
and so

27620
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:38,460
the answer to your question is

27630
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:39,928
I wear these three hats

27640
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:41,963
and I try to integrate them

27650
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:43,198
so that they mutually afford

27660
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:44,232
and constrain each other

27670
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:49,404
as much as I possibly can.

27680
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:51,740
FRIEDMAN: Very interesting. A lot to

27690
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:53,341
say.

27700
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:54,009
There

27710
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:58,079
are there's a few ways we can go,

27720
01:21:58,179 --> 01:22:01,750
I think let's bring up one topic

27730
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:02,751
and then we'll go

27740
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:04,886
in the end to the questions.

27750
01:22:04,886 --> 01:22:06,421
So if have any questions,

27760
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:08,790
please feel free to add them now.

27770
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,992
And it's a term that's one of

27780
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:12,527
my personal favorites, which is.

27790
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:14,496
VERVAEKE: Oh, I like these, I like this term.

27800
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:15,397
You introduce the

27810
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:16,665
I did not know this term

27820
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:18,300
until our previous conversation off

27830
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:18,833
camera

27840
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:19,601
where you introduce

27850
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:22,270
this term to me, which I really liked.

27860
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:23,872
FRIEDMAN: It's a great term

27870
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:26,207
arising from work on insects

27880
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:28,944
and the work of Heligan

27890
01:22:29,744 --> 01:22:31,046
defines stigma

27900
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:33,581
as a mechanism of indirect coordination

27910
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:36,051
in which the trace left, by an action

27920
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:36,952
in a medium,

27930
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,254
stimulates subsequent actions,

27940
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:40,956
stigmatize, enables complex

27950
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,624
coordinated activity

27960
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:43,992
without any need for planning

27970
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:45,493
control, communication,

27980
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:47,362
simultaneous presence

27990
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:49,197
or even mutual awareness.

28000
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:50,732
I think it's a

28010
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:53,201
really fascinating and provocative idea

28020
01:22:53,201 --> 01:22:54,202
because a lot of times

28030
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:56,171
when we hear about

28040
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:57,405
collective intelligence

28050
01:22:57,405 --> 01:22:58,573
or just collective

28060
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:00,542
algorithms more broadly,

28070
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:03,211
there are examples like flocks of birds

28080
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:06,281
which absolutely swarm and flock,

28090
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:07,916
and they use visual coordination,

28100
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:09,551
but they don't leave a trace

28110
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:11,686
on their aerial environments.

28120
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,021
Or you have the examples

28130
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:13,555
of traffic

28140
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:16,191
jams of swarms or mobs of people,

28150
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:18,193
in which case, again, there's jostling,

28160
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:20,095
there's contact among entities,

28170
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:22,030
but a trace is not left.

28180
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:24,799
And so those one might think of as like

28190
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:26,735
a live conversation

28200
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:28,803
where no trace is recorded.

28210
01:23:28,803 --> 01:23:30,372
And that kind of synchronous

28220
01:23:30,372 --> 01:23:31,072
coordination

28230
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:33,274
is absolutely an important component

28240
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:34,442
to consider,

28250
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:36,211
but especially when we think

28260
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:37,445
about at least two

28270
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:39,347
incredibly important cases

28280
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:41,616
which are our digital environments

28290
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,418
and the various modifications

28300
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:44,586
that we make to them

28310
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:47,155
and our physical ecosystems

28320
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:48,423
and the kinds of modifications

28330
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:50,492
that are made to these niches.

28340
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:52,527
Neither of those cases

28350
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:54,662
are going to even be hinted at

28360
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:55,997
if we only consider

28370
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:57,198
non stigma, logic,

28380
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:58,233
collective behavior

28390
01:23:58,233 --> 01:23:59,834
and collective wisdom.

28400
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:01,136
And so

28410
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:03,571
in some recent work with colleagues,

28420
01:24:04,005 --> 01:24:05,874
we've continued exploration

28430
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,208
that has been existing

28440
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:09,144
since the earliest days of Wikipedia

28450
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:10,345
and before

28460
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:12,514
around digital coordination

28470
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:13,848
as digital stigma.

28480
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:14,883
G Because

28490
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,084
although there are times

28500
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:18,219
for synchronous coordination,

28510
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:20,588
for example, in this conversation

28520
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:21,990
broadly

28530
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:24,359
through all kinds of modifications,

28540
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:27,195
including this video as an artifact

28550
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:29,330
that could be rewatched or transcribed

28560
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:31,032
or analyzed in the future.

28570
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:33,668
Broadly, communication, even

28580
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:35,370
in the online setting,

28590
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:37,138
can be said to result

28600
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:38,973
in complex, coordinated activity

28610
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:39,774
without the need

28620
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:42,377
for planning and control, etc., etc.

28630
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:44,746
So I just wanted to hear your thoughts

28640
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:45,613
on Stig merging.

28650
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:46,648
VERVAEKE: Yeah, that three things

28660
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:47,315
I want to say about that

28670
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:48,983
because it's super cool.

28680
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:51,653
First of all, I for me where

28690
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:52,954
stegeman Jerry

28700
01:24:52,987 --> 01:24:56,357
really called out for me is, is how it

28710
01:24:56,357 --> 01:24:57,759
affects cultural ratcheting

28720
01:24:58,993 --> 01:24:59,761
proposal that

28730
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:01,396
one of our primary capacities for that

28740
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:02,797
activity is cultural ratcheting,

28750
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:03,631
which means

28760
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:05,433
we don't really learn from scratch.

28770
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:06,234
We can't we

28780
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:07,068
we come in

28790
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:08,436
and culture has preserved

28800
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:09,437
previous learning

28810
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:10,638
and then we ratcheted up.

28820
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:12,707
So we culturally ratchet

28830
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:14,042
in a very powerful way.

28840
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:15,243
And so that gives us

28850
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:16,311
a kind of add activity

28860
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:19,447
that is closed off to most organisms.

28870
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:20,415
There are a few

28880
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:21,983
species that you could plausibly

28890
01:25:21,983 --> 01:25:24,385
say chimps, bonobos,

28900
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:25,120
maybe some evidence

28910
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,888
from dolphins in elephants

28920
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:29,891
where there's something like a culture

28930
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:31,926
at fact, this now

28940
01:25:31,926 --> 01:25:32,827
this is where human beings

28950
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:33,495
excel

28960
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:34,963
and stigmatism seems to fit

28970
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:37,232
right in there powerfully.

28980
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:37,832
And you want to

28990
01:25:37,832 --> 01:25:39,000
you want to note

29000
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,503
that what doing right now

29010
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:43,972
is so, so important

29020
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:47,475
because we're actually where we are

29030
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:49,344
collapsing the boundary that used to be

29040
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:53,515
between live speech and writing,

29050
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:55,884
because we have all the spontaneity

29060
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:56,918
of this,

29070
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,653
but then it's preserved

29080
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,655
and it can enter into meta dialog

29090
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:01,556
with other videos

29100
01:26:01,556 --> 01:26:02,757
where people are moving

29110
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:04,025
between the videos

29120
01:26:04,025 --> 01:26:06,227
in dialogical fashion.

29130
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:08,496
And so you get this layering effect,

29140
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:09,764
which is also working

29150
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:11,499
within the cultural ratcheting

29160
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:12,867
and that is very,

29170
01:26:12,867 --> 01:26:13,701
very interesting

29180
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:15,803
and needs to be explored.

29190
01:26:15,803 --> 01:26:17,605
So that's cool.

29200
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:18,306
And then

29210
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:21,543
I wanted to connect what you just said

29220
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:25,547
with the issue that the neuroscientist

29230
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:26,214
Reid Montague

29240
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:29,450
talks about of mutual modeling.

29250
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:30,752
And this is something that I think

29260
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:32,820
needs to be properly integrated

29270
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,989
into this overarching framework

29280
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:37,358
that's being built.

29290
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:38,359
I've done some work,

29300
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:40,495
especially with respect to aspects

29310
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:41,796
of consciousness, mutual modeling.

29320
01:26:41,796 --> 01:26:42,330
So

29330
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:45,900
it talks about that you

29340
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:48,336
you faced a certain kind of problem

29350
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:51,472
in communication,

29360
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:52,307
and he calls it

29370
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:53,975
the it's an efficiency paradox.

29380
01:26:53,975 --> 01:26:56,511
So the idea is, well,

29390
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:57,078
one of the things

29400
01:26:57,078 --> 01:26:58,046
I need to do to increase

29410
01:26:58,046 --> 01:26:59,581
efficiency is to reduce

29420
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:01,316
acting at cross-purposes.

29430
01:27:01,316 --> 01:27:03,351
So I reduce acting at cross-purposes

29440
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:04,953
by having two or more systems

29450
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:06,654
talk more to each other.

29460
01:27:06,654 --> 01:27:07,488
They communicate more.

29470
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:09,424
But another way.

29480
01:27:09,424 --> 01:27:10,425
Classically, of course,

29490
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:12,427
by which I improve efficiency,

29500
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:15,597
is I reduce the metabolic costs

29510
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:16,531
or whatever

29520
01:27:16,531 --> 01:27:19,267
the costs of my problem solving

29530
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:21,369
and of course communication

29540
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:23,972
is very time and energy expensive.

29550
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:26,708
And so

29560
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:29,377
he says, notice how these and I'm doing

29570
01:27:29,377 --> 01:27:29,611
this on

29580
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:30,612
purpose are in a tradeoff

29590
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:32,380
relationship, right?

29600
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,548
The more we communicate,

29610
01:27:33,548 --> 01:27:34,983
the more we increase our costs

29620
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:37,018
and we lose efficiency,

29630
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:38,886
the more we reduce communication,

29640
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:40,822
we reduce our metabolic costs,

29650
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:43,191
but we increase acting at cross-purposes

29660
01:27:43,358 --> 01:27:44,892
and our efficiency also goes down.

29670
01:27:44,892 --> 01:27:46,294
How do we solve this?

29680
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:47,195
And then he gives

29690
01:27:47,195 --> 01:27:48,663
he gives a wonderful analogy

29700
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:50,531
before he moves to brain and he says,

29710
01:27:50,531 --> 01:27:51,599
well, consider

29720
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:54,035
an old married couple happily married.

29730
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:55,203
Some people stay married

29740
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:55,937
because they hate each other,

29750
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:56,537
and that's the best way

29760
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:57,639
they can torture each other.

29770
01:27:57,639 --> 01:27:58,206
But I'm talking about

29780
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:00,241
people who stay married because they

29790
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:01,809
they they are love.

29800
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:03,878
They have almost like this telepathy

29810
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:04,545
with each other.

29820
01:28:05,647 --> 01:28:05,980
And he

29830
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:07,282
didn't quite use this language,

29840
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:09,150
but he uses the language of modeling.

29850
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:09,917
But I think calling it

29860
01:28:09,917 --> 01:28:11,052
generative modeling

29870
01:28:11,052 --> 01:28:12,420
is no imposition on him.

29880
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:13,488
And he says

29890
01:28:13,488 --> 01:28:15,923
his his example is straight as to like

29900
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:17,292
a straight relationship.

29910
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:18,192
I'm just going to use that

29920
01:28:18,192 --> 01:28:19,093
for ease of reference.

29930
01:28:19,093 --> 01:28:20,161
I'm not prioritizing,

29940
01:28:20,161 --> 01:28:22,497
not making any cultural claim.

29950
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:23,031
I'm just saying

29960
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:23,931
it's easier to talk

29970
01:28:23,931 --> 01:28:25,433
because I can just quickly use

29980
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:26,768
common language, right?

29990
01:28:26,768 --> 01:28:28,102
So the husband.

30000
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:29,070
Right, has

30010
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:31,105
a generative model of his wife

30020
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:31,839
and the wife has

30030
01:28:31,839 --> 01:28:33,541
a generative model of the husband

30040
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:34,842
so that they can actually

30050
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:36,210
coordinate their behavior

30060
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:37,979
without having to talk to each other

30070
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:38,780
very much.

30080
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:40,581
So that's what he leaves it.

30090
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:42,650
Now, what I argued is kinder.

30100
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:43,618
That's right.

30110
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:44,452
But you have to cycle

30120
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:45,353
because periodically

30130
01:28:45,353 --> 01:28:46,888
they have to come back together

30140
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:48,723
and talk to each other

30150
01:28:48,723 --> 01:28:49,891
right to make sure their model,

30160
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:50,792
the general models

30170
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:52,226
aren't getting out of whack

30180
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:53,928
and then they can go off

30190
01:28:53,928 --> 01:28:55,229
and do their coordinated

30200
01:28:55,229 --> 01:28:56,931
on communicating behavior

30210
01:28:56,931 --> 01:28:57,999
and they cycle.

30220
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,534
And then I said you can

30230
01:28:59,534 --> 01:29:00,601
you can actually see the brain

30240
01:29:00,601 --> 01:29:01,302
doing this it

30250
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:03,371
how you do the task focused

30260
01:29:03,638 --> 01:29:05,139
where you're processing all the world

30270
01:29:05,139 --> 01:29:06,074
and you coordinate

30280
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:07,608
all these different areas of the brain

30290
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:08,543
are coordinated

30300
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:09,610
without having to communicate

30310
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:10,878
much on the task.

30320
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:12,480
And then you go to default mode.

30330
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,481
Where what are they doing?

30340
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:14,582
Well, they're all centrally hubs

30350
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:15,550
and they're all checking in

30360
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:16,451
with each other

30370
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:16,884
because you

30380
01:29:16,884 --> 01:29:18,219
you just do all this sort of,

30390
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:19,153
you know,

30400
01:29:19,153 --> 01:29:19,787
you know,

30410
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:21,823
self-referential imagination,

30420
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:23,925
making sure all the models are in sync.

30430
01:29:23,925 --> 01:29:27,328
And then you go back on the world,

30440
01:29:27,328 --> 01:29:28,563
you know, sync up again,

30450
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:30,298
go back on the world, sync up again,

30460
01:29:30,298 --> 01:29:31,966
all these trade off relationships

30470
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:34,202
and how you resolve that.

30480
01:29:34,502 --> 01:29:35,269
The paradox

30490
01:29:35,269 --> 01:29:36,504
and then I thought you know

30500
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:38,673
mutual modeling and stigma

30510
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:40,708
like they really belong together

30520
01:29:40,942 --> 01:29:43,077
as underlying concepts.

30530
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:45,446
Now Montague's argument is

30540
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:46,114
you see the brain

30550
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:47,448
adopting this strategy,

30560
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:50,118
you see the brain doing this, all right,

30570
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:51,719
where you've got areas

30580
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:53,054
are are engaged

30590
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:54,722
in generative modeling each other

30600
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:55,823
and think how easily

30610
01:29:55,823 --> 01:29:57,091
this could fit in to predictive

30620
01:29:57,091 --> 01:29:58,960
processing framework because you're

30630
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,528
there's areas of the brain

30640
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:02,730
are predicting other areas but the idea

30650
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:03,431
and then you know

30660
01:30:03,431 --> 01:30:05,666
you can point to evidence of synesthesia

30670
01:30:06,267 --> 01:30:08,603
across model enhancement of perception

30680
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:10,805
the fact that one

30690
01:30:10,805 --> 01:30:13,341
supposedly specialized area

30700
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:15,042
like acoustics can actually take over

30710
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:17,178
sight in people that teach blind people

30720
01:30:17,178 --> 01:30:17,912
who teach themselves

30730
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:19,881
echolocation, synesthesia,

30740
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:21,182
a whole bunch of other things

30750
01:30:21,182 --> 01:30:22,283
just pile up

30760
01:30:22,283 --> 01:30:23,084
as evidence

30770
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:23,684
that the brain is

30780
01:30:23,684 --> 01:30:24,986
adopting that strategy.

30790
01:30:24,986 --> 01:30:26,687
And so I thought

30800
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:28,322
this was an interesting thing

30810
01:30:28,322 --> 01:30:30,725
because this notion in one sense

30820
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:33,661
points to cultural ratcheting and stigma

30830
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:36,097
and mutual modeling between people,

30840
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:37,565
but it also points inward

30850
01:30:38,566 --> 01:30:40,735
to mutual modeling within the brain.

30860
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:41,669
And like I said,

30870
01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:43,471
I think this is so close

30880
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:46,207
already to a lot of what's going on

30890
01:30:46,474 --> 01:30:47,942
in the framework we're talking about.

30900
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:49,977
They're bringing this in and then again,

30910
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:51,813
then we could extend the explanation

30920
01:30:51,813 --> 01:30:55,049
to things like synesthesia that.

30930
01:30:55,049 --> 01:30:57,151
You could get cross modal enhancement

30940
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:58,586
that you can have one

30950
01:30:58,586 --> 01:30:59,954
area of the brain

30960
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:00,555
supposedly

30970
01:31:00,555 --> 01:31:02,423
dedicated to one sense modality,

30980
01:31:02,423 --> 01:31:05,059
picking up the ability for right

30990
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:07,929
in rehabilitation, etc., etc., etc..

31000
01:31:08,763 --> 01:31:10,998
FRIEDMAN: Well to two layers of marital

31010
01:31:10,998 --> 01:31:12,033
stigma e.g.

31020
01:31:12,033 --> 01:31:13,734
the first would be the neuro

31030
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:15,570
anatomical stigma e.g.

31040
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:18,005
by which local synaptic changes

31050
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:19,307
and other sort of neuro

31060
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,142
architectural changes

31070
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:23,377
enable complex coordinated activity

31080
01:31:23,511 --> 01:31:25,146
without the need for a central neuron.

31090
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:26,681
So at the micro scale

31100
01:31:26,681 --> 01:31:28,783
we have the physicality of learning.

31110
01:31:29,183 --> 01:31:29,650
And then

31120
01:31:30,785 --> 01:31:32,587
there's the Post-it note

31130
01:31:32,587 --> 01:31:34,288
and there's the note on the door,

31140
01:31:34,288 --> 01:31:35,490
there's the modification

31150
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:36,924
of the environments

31160
01:31:36,924 --> 01:31:39,560
which is stimulating subsequent activity

31170
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:41,596
and it doesn't need to be

31180
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:43,431
the recipe for dinner.

31190
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:46,400
It can just be a note or an inside joke.

31200
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,302
And so when we have a model

31210
01:31:48,302 --> 01:31:49,036
that's integrative

31220
01:31:49,036 --> 01:31:50,738
and allows us to situate

31230
01:31:50,738 --> 01:31:53,007
advanced cognitive agents

31240
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:55,042
in their niche,

31250
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:57,144
then we can actually bring

31260
01:31:57,144 --> 01:31:58,880
in those kinds of modifications,

31270
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,214
which is the root of stigma

31280
01:32:00,214 --> 01:32:02,049
due to mask stigma,

31290
01:32:02,049 --> 01:32:03,618
not in a taboo way,

31300
01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:05,686
but to mark the environments

31310
01:32:06,053 --> 01:32:06,821
and the ways that

31320
01:32:06,821 --> 01:32:08,489
that can elicit action,

31330
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:09,690
whether it's, again, a Post-it

31340
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:12,026
note on the door in the relationship

31350
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:13,761
or a comment on a video.

31360
01:32:13,761 --> 01:32:14,762
So these are all ways

31370
01:32:14,762 --> 01:32:16,731
that we can spur others to action.

31380
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:18,833
VERVAEKE: Or and so you can just

31390
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:19,600
when you can take

31400
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,102
the mutual modeling idea

31410
01:32:21,102 --> 01:32:24,005
and then do George Herbert Mead, you're

31420
01:32:24,272 --> 01:32:24,572
right.

31430
01:32:24,572 --> 01:32:25,740
You're in a baseball

31440
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:26,841
you're on a baseball team.

31450
01:32:26,841 --> 01:32:27,542
And you don't

31460
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:28,376
necessarily need

31470
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:29,977
to form a specific model

31480
01:32:29,977 --> 01:32:31,512
of all the other players.

31490
01:32:31,512 --> 01:32:32,647
You might want to have that a bit,

31500
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:33,981
but you can, he said.

31510
01:32:33,981 --> 01:32:34,315
What you do

31520
01:32:34,315 --> 01:32:36,117
is you create the generalized other.

31530
01:32:36,117 --> 01:32:38,352
You create a model, right,

31540
01:32:38,352 --> 01:32:39,687
which will allow you to interact

31550
01:32:39,687 --> 01:32:41,489
with all of them very effectively.

31560
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:42,557
And so right.

31570
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:43,591
We can carry around.

31580
01:32:43,591 --> 01:32:46,727
We can like we can have stockings,

31590
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:49,830
we can have more specific mutual models

31600
01:32:49,964 --> 01:32:52,033
for how I relate to my partner.

31610
01:32:52,033 --> 01:32:54,969
But then they in a right dynamic

31620
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:56,304
recursive relationship

31630
01:32:56,304 --> 01:32:58,906
with a generalized other model.

31640
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:02,510
And that also is a trace of others

31650
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:04,845
like the guts of our cognitive

31660
01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:06,981
modeling in a very, very powerful way.

31670
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:10,585
FRIEDMAN: Yes, multi-player rituals

31680
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:14,221
as cultural ratcheting

31690
01:33:14,221 --> 01:33:15,323
in more people

31700
01:33:15,323 --> 01:33:17,625
to be involved in cumulative

31710
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:19,160
as well as re-experience

31720
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:23,230
and reimagined cultural practices and.

31730
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:25,466
If there's a level to generalize out to,

31740
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,768
perhaps it is one of them

31750
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:29,136
that is relevance

31760
01:33:29,136 --> 01:33:29,670
such that

31770
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:32,840
we can have participatory ritual, as

31780
01:33:33,374 --> 01:33:36,077
one can say every single culture has,

31790
01:33:36,577 --> 01:33:39,313
but taking awareness

31800
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:42,249
and wisdom into the process

31810
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:45,019
of shaping our rituals

31820
01:33:45,019 --> 01:33:46,220
so maybe they can be aligned

31830
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:48,022
with our preferences.

31840
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:49,023
VERVAEKE: That's exactly right.

31850
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:50,024
And there's a whole movement

31860
01:33:50,024 --> 01:33:52,059
and I'm involved in it.

31870
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:54,061
And I spoke to this

31880
01:33:54,061 --> 01:33:55,796
at a recent invited lecture

31890
01:33:55,796 --> 01:33:57,064
I gave at Cambridge

31900
01:33:57,064 --> 01:33:59,700
about ritual knowing and the connections

31910
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:00,601
between ritual,

31920
01:34:00,601 --> 01:34:03,537
the imaginal and being rational.

31930
01:34:03,537 --> 01:34:05,973
And so very much,

31940
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:07,074
very much

31950
01:34:07,341 --> 01:34:08,743
I you allow me,

31960
01:34:08,743 --> 01:34:10,111
I'll give you one instance of this

31970
01:34:11,846 --> 01:34:12,747
and think about how this

31980
01:34:12,747 --> 01:34:13,648
goes to updating

31990
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:14,115
and all the stuff

32000
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:14,882
we're talking about

32010
01:34:14,882 --> 01:34:15,883
in predictive processing

32020
01:34:15,883 --> 01:34:17,952
and reducing surprise. Okay, stuff.

32030
01:34:17,952 --> 01:34:18,519
So

32040
01:34:19,553 --> 01:34:20,554
you go into academics

32050
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:21,322
who are supposed to be the cream

32060
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:22,289
of, the crop.

32070
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:22,957
So a little bit of

32080
01:34:22,957 --> 01:34:25,526
self-deprecation there and

32090
01:34:26,994 --> 01:34:29,830
you give them convincing evidence

32100
01:34:30,564 --> 01:34:31,732
locked salt,

32110
01:34:31,732 --> 01:34:32,099
you know,

32120
01:34:32,099 --> 01:34:33,634
rigorously tight arguments

32130
01:34:33,634 --> 01:34:34,669
that they should start saving

32140
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:35,469
for their retirement.

32150
01:34:35,469 --> 01:34:36,871
Now you allow them to raise

32160
01:34:36,871 --> 01:34:38,406
whatever objections they have.

32170
01:34:38,406 --> 01:34:39,440
You meet them.

32180
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:40,941
You get them to all agree that.

32190
01:34:40,941 --> 01:34:42,076
You've convinced them

32200
01:34:42,076 --> 01:34:42,743
that they should save

32210
01:34:42,743 --> 01:34:44,111
for their retirement.

32220
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:45,813
You go away,

32230
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:47,281
you come back in six months.

32240
01:34:47,281 --> 01:34:48,015
None of them are saving

32250
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:49,283
for their retirement.

32260
01:34:49,617 --> 01:34:52,119
Hyperbolic discounting, etc., etc.

32270
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:53,120
Hyperbolic discounting

32280
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:54,689
is an adaptive thing, etc.

32290
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:56,924
I won't go into all of that. Right?

32300
01:34:56,924 --> 01:34:58,826
But then when you do and there's like,

32310
01:34:58,826 --> 01:34:59,660
you know, Hirschfield

32320
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:00,928
and other people all this,

32330
01:35:00,928 --> 01:35:03,330
what you do is you do something else,

32340
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:04,899
you get them,

32350
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:06,767
and this is the imaginal, not imaginary.

32360
01:35:06,767 --> 01:35:07,468
You get them to

32370
01:35:07,468 --> 01:35:09,370
imagine their future self

32380
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:11,072
as a family member

32390
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:13,140
that they have a responsibility for

32400
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:14,442
and that they love

32410
01:35:14,442 --> 01:35:15,543
and they want to give

32420
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:16,811
the best possible life to

32430
01:35:17,812 --> 01:35:19,447
two things you find when you come back

32440
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:19,847
six months

32450
01:35:19,847 --> 01:35:21,749
later, the people that did

32460
01:35:21,749 --> 01:35:24,051
the do the imagining start to save

32470
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:26,287
and the more vividly they can imagine,

32480
01:35:27,354 --> 01:35:28,923
the more they save.

32490
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:33,060
So you overcome a kind of egocentric,

32500
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:35,096
hyperbolic discounting through

32510
01:35:35,096 --> 01:35:36,931
and in in in imaginal.

32520
01:35:36,931 --> 01:35:38,499
It's basically a ritual,

32530
01:35:38,499 --> 01:35:40,801
this imaginal binding of

32540
01:35:40,801 --> 01:35:43,804
to your future self so that you get

32550
01:35:43,804 --> 01:35:45,873
a more adaptive relationship.

32560
01:35:47,808 --> 01:35:50,044
FRIEDMAN: It makes me think about variational

32570
01:35:50,077 --> 01:35:50,945
free energy,

32580
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:53,114
which is about the present in the past

32590
01:35:53,881 --> 01:35:56,283
as religion religare

32600
01:35:56,283 --> 01:35:57,918
and then expected free energy

32610
01:35:57,918 --> 01:35:59,954
as pre the glory because.

32620
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:01,522
We need to bind ourself to futures

32630
01:36:01,522 --> 01:36:02,990
that haven't happened.

32640
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:04,859
Yeah, there's an aspect there.

32650
01:36:04,859 --> 01:36:07,261
VERVAEKE: There's a there there's there's a,

32660
01:36:07,628 --> 01:36:08,162
you know,

32670
01:36:08,162 --> 01:36:10,231
there's a current, a genetic

32680
01:36:10,231 --> 01:36:11,999
right way in which religio

32690
01:36:11,999 --> 01:36:13,334
that's my preferred

32700
01:36:13,334 --> 01:36:15,169
etymological origin for religion

32710
01:36:15,169 --> 01:36:16,837
binding connectedness

32720
01:36:16,837 --> 01:36:19,106
and there's also aspirational religio

32730
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:21,041
and what it religion often does

32740
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:22,276
is try to trade it

32750
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:23,611
try to find a sweet spot

32760
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:25,146
an optimal relationship

32770
01:36:25,146 --> 01:36:27,748
between current and aspirational religio

32780
01:36:30,017 --> 01:36:30,618
FRIEDMAN: mazing.

32790
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:31,252
Let us

32800
01:36:31,252 --> 01:36:31,852
look at some

32810
01:36:31,852 --> 01:36:33,854
of these comments so any of them

32820
01:36:35,022 --> 01:36:36,524
feel free to add comments

32830
01:36:36,524 --> 01:36:37,892
or give a response.

32840
01:36:37,892 --> 01:36:40,461
So first, Ali has written

32850
01:36:41,428 --> 01:36:43,197
in to lose his words.

32860
01:36:43,197 --> 01:36:45,733
Relevance questions are how much

32870
01:36:46,033 --> 01:36:47,234
and how.

32880
01:36:47,234 --> 01:36:48,769
In what cases

32890
01:36:48,769 --> 01:36:50,971
and who questions, as opposed to

32900
01:36:51,005 --> 01:36:53,107
what is X questions

32910
01:36:53,107 --> 01:36:54,775
from difference in repetition?

32920
01:36:54,775 --> 01:36:55,810
So what are the questions

32930
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:58,112
that bring us towards relevance

32940
01:36:58,512 --> 01:36:59,980
as opposed to questions

32950
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:07,354
that make relevance obscured?

32960
01:37:07,354 --> 01:37:08,589
VERVAEKE: That's a really interesting question.

32970
01:37:08,589 --> 01:37:11,325
I'm not I don't know much to lose.

32980
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:13,093
I read a little bit about Deleuze

32990
01:37:13,093 --> 01:37:14,328
and that's

33000
01:37:14,328 --> 01:37:15,429
I should read more Deleuze

33010
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:17,565
because I'm a deep fan of Spinoza

33020
01:37:17,898 --> 01:37:19,667
and he has a very interesting reading.

33030
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:20,868
I have the book

33040
01:37:20,868 --> 01:37:22,870
My To Lose on Spinoza, but

33050
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:24,772
I am really hesitant

33060
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:25,906
to give much of an answer here

33070
01:37:25,906 --> 01:37:28,609
because I don't know Deleuze very well.

33080
01:37:28,609 --> 01:37:29,376
FRIEDMAN: It doesn't have to be a dull

33090
01:37:29,376 --> 01:37:30,277
Lucien answer

33100
01:37:30,277 --> 01:37:32,479
just what kinds of questions and and

33110
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:33,781
interrogate interrogative

33120
01:37:35,249 --> 01:37:38,919
help us find both and.

33130
01:37:38,919 --> 01:37:43,324
VERVAEKE: So I think that I want

33140
01:37:44,391 --> 01:37:46,427
to collapse a large argument built

33150
01:37:46,427 --> 01:37:47,294
from Sperber

33160
01:37:47,294 --> 01:37:48,462
and Wilson

33170
01:37:48,462 --> 01:37:49,196
and their work

33180
01:37:49,196 --> 01:37:50,231
on a book

33190
01:37:50,231 --> 01:37:51,465
entitled Relevance,

33200
01:37:51,465 --> 01:37:53,467
by the way,

33210
01:37:53,467 --> 01:37:55,336
at least within communication.

33220
01:37:55,336 --> 01:37:56,303
I think

33230
01:37:56,303 --> 01:37:57,805
this is where I disagree with to lose,

33240
01:37:57,805 --> 01:37:59,340
but this is why I hesitate

33250
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:00,307
because I don't know.

33260
01:38:00,307 --> 01:38:02,409
Deleuze Well, so that's my hesitancy.

33270
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:03,577
I think all of the questions

33280
01:38:03,577 --> 01:38:04,478
are ways

33290
01:38:04,478 --> 01:38:05,646
of trying

33300
01:38:05,646 --> 01:38:07,848
to get a reformulation

33310
01:38:07,848 --> 01:38:09,149
of what we find relevant.

33320
01:38:09,149 --> 01:38:11,085
They bring out that

33330
01:38:11,085 --> 01:38:12,586
they bring out different

33340
01:38:12,586 --> 01:38:14,221
bring in different perspectives

33350
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:15,856
and point the arrow of relevance

33360
01:38:15,856 --> 01:38:17,191
in different direction.

33370
01:38:17,191 --> 01:38:19,293
And what Sperber and Wilson they took,

33380
01:38:19,493 --> 01:38:20,794
they said, okay, you know,

33390
01:38:20,794 --> 01:38:22,496
you have the pragmatic

33400
01:38:22,496 --> 01:38:24,231
of all communication.

33410
01:38:24,231 --> 01:38:25,099
What's pragmatics?

33420
01:38:25,099 --> 01:38:26,700
Pragmatics is what you convey

33430
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:28,335
beyond what you can say,

33440
01:38:28,335 --> 01:38:29,069
because I can't

33450
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:31,071
actually put into my words

33460
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:32,406
every all of the information

33470
01:38:32,406 --> 01:38:33,841
I'm trying to convey to you.

33480
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:37,444
Because if I if I did that well, if

33490
01:38:37,811 --> 01:38:38,879
if and by the use of

33500
01:38:38,879 --> 01:38:40,214
if I'm making use

33510
01:38:40,214 --> 01:38:41,882
of not the logical F,

33520
01:38:41,882 --> 01:38:43,918
but the temporal and conditional,

33530
01:38:44,084 --> 01:38:46,720
if I in this case, I'm referring to me

33540
01:38:46,854 --> 01:38:48,555
and I'm referring to me insofar as I'm

33550
01:38:48,555 --> 01:38:49,857
in this current situation.

33560
01:38:50,858 --> 01:38:51,959
Did that

33570
01:38:51,959 --> 01:38:52,860
and that was

33580
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:53,327
referring to

33590
01:38:53,327 --> 01:38:55,429
what of all the things I've spoken of,

33600
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:56,730
I'm speaking of

33610
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:57,331
a, you know,

33620
01:38:57,331 --> 01:39:00,234
trying to give this specific

33630
01:39:01,101 --> 01:39:02,269
verbal form of everything

33640
01:39:02,269 --> 01:39:03,370
I'm trying to convey.

33650
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:05,172
And then for each one of those,

33660
01:39:05,172 --> 01:39:06,440
what do I mean by the current?

33670
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:07,174
You see what happens.

33680
01:39:07,174 --> 01:39:08,142
You get a penumbra

33690
01:39:08,142 --> 01:39:10,210
of ever expanding attempts

33700
01:39:10,210 --> 01:39:12,446
to get you to translate the conveyance,

33710
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:15,282
and you get a combinatorial explosive

33720
01:39:15,749 --> 01:39:19,720
list of sentences that I can't say.

33730
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:20,321
And you do.

33740
01:39:20,321 --> 01:39:21,855
You do all the time.

33750
01:39:21,855 --> 01:39:22,623
You know,

33760
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:23,590
you drive up

33770
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:24,692
and you open your window

33780
01:39:24,692 --> 01:39:26,593
and you say, Excuse me, I'm out of gas.

33790
01:39:26,593 --> 01:39:28,228
You mean your car is out of gas?

33800
01:39:28,228 --> 01:39:29,663
You're not trying to be more flatulent.

33810
01:39:29,663 --> 01:39:30,030
You mean

33820
01:39:30,030 --> 01:39:31,999
gas is actually standing for gasoline?

33830
01:39:31,999 --> 01:39:32,399
You mean you're

33840
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:33,600
not completely out of gas?

33850
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:34,201
You have some

33860
01:39:34,201 --> 01:39:34,702
you can drive

33870
01:39:34,702 --> 01:39:36,637
at least a few more minutes if you're

33880
01:39:37,571 --> 01:39:37,805
right.

33890
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:38,706
And you know, all of

33900
01:39:38,706 --> 01:39:39,606
these things are at work

33910
01:39:39,606 --> 01:39:40,674
because if you violate

33920
01:39:40,674 --> 01:39:42,643
any one of those expectations,

33930
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:43,811
you get pissed off.

33940
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:45,045
If they say to you,

33950
01:39:45,045 --> 01:39:46,814
there's a gas station at the corner

33960
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:48,215
and you drive to the corner

33970
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:49,616
and the gas station has been closed

33980
01:39:49,616 --> 01:39:51,285
for ten years, you don't go, Whoa.

33990
01:39:51,285 --> 01:39:53,554
Well, he told me the truth

34000
01:39:53,554 --> 01:39:55,222
because you write,

34010
01:39:55,222 --> 01:39:56,690
it was conveyed to you

34020
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:58,359
that you could make use

34030
01:39:58,359 --> 01:39:59,760
of the gas station

34040
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:00,928
because you're out of gas.

34050
01:40:00,928 --> 01:40:01,862
I won't go on to that.

34060
01:40:01,862 --> 01:40:02,463
I'm just trying to give

34070
01:40:02,463 --> 01:40:03,897
an intuitive example.

34080
01:40:03,897 --> 01:40:07,034
And so Grice gives these four maxims

34090
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:09,870
that we are trying to always follow

34100
01:40:10,137 --> 01:40:12,873
where in order to manage the conveyance

34110
01:40:13,107 --> 01:40:14,041
so it doesn't become

34120
01:40:14,041 --> 01:40:16,110
combinatorial explosive

34130
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:19,146
and it's the in its manner

34140
01:40:19,146 --> 01:40:23,283
and formats and what is quality.

34150
01:40:24,151 --> 01:40:26,820
So he gives three that are not relevant

34160
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:28,822
and the fourth one is relevance

34170
01:40:28,822 --> 01:40:29,390
explicitly.

34180
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:31,091
So and then Sperber and Wilson

34190
01:40:31,091 --> 01:40:32,259
just basically argue

34200
01:40:32,259 --> 01:40:33,560
all the other ones

34210
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:35,629
collapse into relevance

34220
01:40:35,629 --> 01:40:37,297
like quality is tell the truth.

34230
01:40:37,297 --> 01:40:38,999
Well not no don't

34240
01:40:38,999 --> 01:40:39,466
tell the truth

34250
01:40:39,466 --> 01:40:40,534
you don't tell everything

34260
01:40:40,534 --> 01:40:41,402
that's in your mind

34270
01:40:41,402 --> 01:40:43,037
when you're speaking to somebody

34280
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:44,371
you select

34290
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:46,173
out of all that that's in there,

34300
01:40:46,173 --> 01:40:47,641
a subset that's relevant.

34310
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:49,443
So give the relevant truth,

34320
01:40:49,443 --> 01:40:51,845
the relevant manner, etc., etc..

34330
01:40:52,413 --> 01:40:55,249
So we always are doing this

34340
01:40:55,249 --> 01:40:57,885
and I think questions actually operate

34350
01:40:58,318 --> 01:41:01,121
right primarily at the pragmatic level.

34360
01:41:01,121 --> 01:41:01,488
Of course

34370
01:41:01,488 --> 01:41:03,590
they have semantic consequence,

34380
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:04,691
but what we're constantly

34390
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:06,326
doing is asking,

34400
01:41:06,326 --> 01:41:07,861
which what are you

34410
01:41:07,861 --> 01:41:09,063
conveying and what are the

34420
01:41:10,931 --> 01:41:11,698
which are not the same

34430
01:41:11,698 --> 01:41:12,633
thing as implications?

34440
01:41:12,633 --> 01:41:14,701
What are the relevant implications

34450
01:41:14,701 --> 01:41:17,504
before I try and derive the implications

34460
01:41:17,771 --> 01:41:18,772
of what you're saying,

34470
01:41:18,772 --> 01:41:21,175
that's what questions I think do.

34480
01:41:21,842 --> 01:41:22,676
Now,

34490
01:41:23,844 --> 01:41:25,679
I want to also be clear

34500
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:27,881
about this, that

34510
01:41:28,949 --> 01:41:30,984
we need to be directing

34520
01:41:31,685 --> 01:41:36,857
the questions into directions.

34530
01:41:36,857 --> 01:41:39,860
Sometimes we are probing our

34540
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:42,963
we ask sexualizing, framing the arena.

34550
01:41:42,963 --> 01:41:44,031
Well,

34560
01:41:45,365 --> 01:41:46,667
in terms of

34570
01:41:46,667 --> 01:41:48,435
is the world we check to see

34580
01:41:48,435 --> 01:41:50,771
is the world disclosing itself to us

34590
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:53,540
such that we are solving

34600
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:56,710
our problems and flourishing.

34610
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:58,412
But sometimes we also need to step back

34620
01:41:58,412 --> 01:42:00,547
and look at the framing itself

34630
01:42:00,547 --> 01:42:02,783
and ask, Is the framing

34640
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:05,319
right actually misdirecting

34650
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:06,453
or misleading me?

34660
01:42:06,453 --> 01:42:09,423
So I think questions are always

34670
01:42:09,723 --> 01:42:12,693
trying to reconfigure the fitness.

34680
01:42:12,993 --> 01:42:14,561
And one of the things

34690
01:42:14,561 --> 01:42:15,496
we and therefore

34700
01:42:15,496 --> 01:42:16,497
they're trying to enhance

34710
01:42:16,497 --> 01:42:17,798
relevance realization

34720
01:42:17,798 --> 01:42:19,666
at the pragmatic level.

34730
01:42:19,666 --> 01:42:21,835
But we should always remember

34740
01:42:21,835 --> 01:42:23,871
to direct the questions

34750
01:42:23,871 --> 01:42:25,539
in at least these two directions.

34760
01:42:27,441 --> 01:42:27,975
FRIEDMAN: Excellent.

34770
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:28,942
Thank you.

34780
01:42:29,476 --> 01:42:30,144
All right.

34790
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:32,913
Here's a question from Brock.

34800
01:42:32,913 --> 01:42:34,548
Can you give some examples

34810
01:42:34,548 --> 01:42:35,782
of how depending

34820
01:42:35,782 --> 01:42:38,719
on ignoring to realize relevance

34830
01:42:39,219 --> 01:42:41,522
can prevent realization of meaning?

34840
01:42:42,689 --> 01:42:45,058
Does this relate to reciprocal narrowing

34850
01:42:45,058 --> 01:42:46,293
and opening.

34860
01:42:46,293 --> 01:42:47,794
VERVAEKE: Yes, yes, totally.

34870
01:42:47,794 --> 01:42:49,930
And so Brock is familiar with my work

34880
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:53,700
and I'll just let me just quickly open

34890
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:55,435
those the

34900
01:42:55,435 --> 01:42:56,370
those final things up

34910
01:42:56,370 --> 01:42:57,538
so other people are aware

34920
01:42:57,538 --> 01:42:58,539
of what he's alluding to.

34930
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:00,507
Thank you for doing that.

34940
01:43:00,507 --> 01:43:02,042
So the notion of reciprocal

34950
01:43:02,042 --> 01:43:03,777
narrowing is drawn from my friend

34960
01:43:03,777 --> 01:43:04,278
and colleague

34970
01:43:04,278 --> 01:43:06,213
Mark Lewis, who has proposed

34980
01:43:06,213 --> 01:43:08,282
a learning model of addiction

34990
01:43:08,282 --> 01:43:09,750
rather than a disease model

35000
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:11,318
of predicting of addiction.

35010
01:43:11,318 --> 01:43:12,152
So our current model,

35020
01:43:12,152 --> 01:43:13,520
which governments and agencies

35030
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:14,621
like, is that the disease model?

35040
01:43:14,621 --> 01:43:16,023
You have this thing, it's infected

35050
01:43:16,023 --> 01:43:18,091
you and you're trying to like

35060
01:43:18,091 --> 01:43:20,827
and it's it's debilitating you.

35070
01:43:20,827 --> 01:43:21,562
Now,

35080
01:43:21,728 --> 01:43:23,197
I want to make something very clear.

35090
01:43:23,197 --> 01:43:24,097
Mark is not saying

35100
01:43:24,097 --> 01:43:26,767
that there is not a neurochemical layer,

35110
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:28,368
but he's trying to

35120
01:43:28,368 --> 01:43:29,369
while he's trying to get

35130
01:43:29,369 --> 01:43:29,970
an insight, he's

35140
01:43:29,970 --> 01:43:31,405
trying to get you to realize

35150
01:43:31,405 --> 01:43:32,539
that the disease model

35160
01:43:32,539 --> 01:43:33,840
makes all kinds of predictions

35170
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:34,808
that have been empirically

35180
01:43:34,808 --> 01:43:35,576
just confirmed.

35190
01:43:36,577 --> 01:43:38,045
I won't go through all of them,

35200
01:43:38,045 --> 01:43:40,147
but they have to do with the fact that,

35210
01:43:40,147 --> 01:43:42,182
you know, when we have that model

35220
01:43:42,883 --> 01:43:43,817
will tend to think

35230
01:43:43,817 --> 01:43:45,085
the substance,

35240
01:43:45,085 --> 01:43:48,188
as in and of itself, addictive.

35250
01:43:48,188 --> 01:43:49,623
You know, cocaine is so addictive.

35260
01:43:49,623 --> 01:43:50,958
Heroin is so addictive.

35270
01:43:50,958 --> 01:43:52,726
Well, you know,

35280
01:43:52,726 --> 01:43:55,696
yet there was lots of soldiers

35290
01:43:55,696 --> 01:43:57,931
in Vietnam using opioids.

35300
01:43:57,931 --> 01:43:58,665
And when they came

35310
01:43:58,665 --> 01:43:59,533
back, the vast

35320
01:43:59,533 --> 01:44:00,634
majority of them stopped

35330
01:44:00,634 --> 01:44:01,168
without having

35340
01:44:01,168 --> 01:44:03,170
to have any special treatment.

35350
01:44:03,170 --> 01:44:05,239
They stopped using opioids.

35360
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:06,840
But opioids are so addictive.

35370
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,976
Well, what's different

35380
01:44:08,976 --> 01:44:11,678
because I ask you that presumably

35390
01:44:12,145 --> 01:44:13,080
this destructive

35400
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:14,281
the chemical structure of heroin

35410
01:44:14,281 --> 01:44:14,848
in Vietnam, in

35420
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,183
the United States is the same.

35430
01:44:16,183 --> 01:44:16,984
What is different?

35440
01:44:16,984 --> 01:44:18,085
The agent arena

35450
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:20,087
relationship is different.

35460
01:44:20,087 --> 01:44:21,255
You're a soldier

35470
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:23,957
in a traumatic circumstance in Vietnam,

35480
01:44:24,291 --> 01:44:25,525
the United States,

35490
01:44:25,525 --> 01:44:27,361
you're a citizen and you're not.

35500
01:44:27,361 --> 01:44:27,961
And of course, that

35510
01:44:27,961 --> 01:44:29,496
caused all kinds of other problems

35520
01:44:29,496 --> 01:44:30,731
for these people

35530
01:44:30,731 --> 01:44:31,932
because the agent arena

35540
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:33,834
relationships are so different.

35550
01:44:33,834 --> 01:44:35,802
Here's what Mark proposes.

35560
01:44:35,802 --> 01:44:37,070
So let's

35570
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:37,804
all use alcohol

35580
01:44:37,804 --> 01:44:38,205
because it's

35590
01:44:38,205 --> 01:44:40,707
one people can easily relate to.

35600
01:44:40,707 --> 01:44:43,076
I have a very challenging arena

35610
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:44,311
and I'm stressed.

35620
01:44:44,311 --> 01:44:46,380
So it takes some alcohol

35630
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:47,547
and it reduces the stress,

35640
01:44:47,547 --> 01:44:49,583
but it actually limits

35650
01:44:49,583 --> 01:44:51,151
my cognitive flexibility.

35660
01:44:51,151 --> 01:44:53,220
So my problem solving abilities go down.

35670
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:55,022
So the options available to me

35680
01:44:55,022 --> 01:44:56,223
in the world goes down.

35690
01:44:56,223 --> 01:44:57,791
So the world narrows.

35700
01:44:57,791 --> 01:44:58,859
As the world narrows,

35710
01:44:58,859 --> 01:45:00,394
it becomes more stressful to me.

35720
01:45:00,394 --> 01:45:02,162
So now I want to take more alcohol

35730
01:45:02,162 --> 01:45:03,530
to keep the stress away,

35740
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:05,332
but that's now impairing

35750
01:45:05,332 --> 01:45:07,367
my cognitive flexibility.

35760
01:45:07,367 --> 01:45:08,502
You see what's happening.

35770
01:45:08,502 --> 01:45:10,704
The world as an arena is narrow

35780
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:12,205
and my capacity

35790
01:45:12,205 --> 01:45:14,141
as an agent is narrowing.

35800
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:15,776
So you've got reciprocal narrowing

35810
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:18,945
until I can't be any other than I am,

35820
01:45:19,146 --> 01:45:22,015
and there is no future for me at all

35830
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:24,084
other than this moment

35840
01:45:24,084 --> 01:45:25,152
of taking the drug.

35850
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:25,886
And that's addiction.

35860
01:45:25,886 --> 01:45:27,321
It's reciprocal narrowing.

35870
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:29,122
Now, I was literally Daniel,

35880
01:45:29,122 --> 01:45:30,991
I was literally at lunch with Mark Lewis

35890
01:45:30,991 --> 01:45:32,693
and I said, But Mark,

35900
01:45:32,693 --> 01:45:34,728
if there's reciprocal narrowing,

35910
01:45:34,728 --> 01:45:36,697
there has to be reciprocal opening.

35920
01:45:36,697 --> 01:45:39,132
And he went, Oh, you're right.

35930
01:45:39,132 --> 01:45:40,200
And I talked about

35940
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,101
how Plato talks

35950
01:45:41,101 --> 01:45:43,403
about this in the model of

35960
01:45:43,403 --> 01:45:45,072
what's called and again,

35970
01:45:45,072 --> 01:45:47,541
the his model in the Republic

35980
01:45:47,541 --> 01:45:49,910
of how you ascend out of the cave into

35990
01:45:50,844 --> 01:45:52,145
seeing the real world

36000
01:45:52,145 --> 01:45:54,748
reciprocal opening. And so

36010
01:45:55,782 --> 01:45:57,351
I think when

36020
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:59,519
we engage in

36030
01:46:01,788 --> 01:46:02,856
ignoring

36040
01:46:02,856 --> 01:46:06,360
relevant information,

36050
01:46:06,493 --> 01:46:10,163
we will often very readily fall prey

36060
01:46:10,230 --> 01:46:12,599
to a very powerful kind

36070
01:46:12,966 --> 01:46:15,235
of reciprocal narrowing.

36080
01:46:16,236 --> 01:46:16,636
So let

36090
01:46:16,636 --> 01:46:17,971
let's let's go back to the example

36100
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:20,574
I used.

36110
01:46:20,574 --> 01:46:22,676
You don't have the insight.

36120
01:46:22,676 --> 01:46:23,910
You think she's angry

36130
01:46:23,910 --> 01:46:25,045
when she's actually afraid?

36140
01:46:25,045 --> 01:46:26,480
You don't have the insight.

36150
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,014
And so you push on her

36160
01:46:28,014 --> 01:46:30,784
and you only take evidence confirming

36170
01:46:30,884 --> 01:46:32,285
confirmation bias

36180
01:46:32,285 --> 01:46:34,688
that she's angry in to your model

36190
01:46:34,955 --> 01:46:36,723
and then you only act towards her

36200
01:46:36,723 --> 01:46:37,457
as if she's

36210
01:46:37,457 --> 01:46:39,893
and she's going to start probably

36220
01:46:40,861 --> 01:46:42,896
almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy,

36230
01:46:42,896 --> 01:46:44,064
respond more and more

36240
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:45,565
because your anger, right,

36250
01:46:45,565 --> 01:46:47,300
you start to act towards her

36260
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:47,634
in a way

36270
01:46:47,634 --> 01:46:49,169
that gets increasingly aggressive

36280
01:46:49,169 --> 01:46:51,004
and you whisper darkly narrow,

36290
01:46:51,004 --> 01:46:52,539
and then it gets harder and harder

36300
01:46:52,539 --> 01:46:54,441
for you to see that she's not angry

36310
01:46:54,441 --> 01:46:55,976
and it gets harder for her

36320
01:46:55,976 --> 01:46:57,544
not to communicate to you

36330
01:46:57,544 --> 01:46:59,346
in a way that you have to interpret.

36340
01:46:59,346 --> 01:46:59,980
His anger.

36350
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:00,847
Because when she tries

36360
01:47:00,847 --> 01:47:02,249
to give you something else,

36370
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:03,650
you ignore it in zero.

36380
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:05,685
And you have been in arguments

36390
01:47:05,685 --> 01:47:06,887
and fights like this

36400
01:47:06,887 --> 01:47:08,555
at some point in your life

36410
01:47:08,555 --> 01:47:09,790
with somebody

36420
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:11,892
that you don't want to be severed from,

36430
01:47:12,926 --> 01:47:13,860
but that kind of

36440
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:16,830
thing can sever that connectedness.

36450
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:18,799
And when you're at the end of your life,

36460
01:47:18,799 --> 01:47:20,500
you don't really care

36470
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:22,969
how many objects you've manipulated.

36480
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:24,271
You don't care

36490
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:26,072
how many french fries you eat.

36500
01:47:26,072 --> 01:47:28,241
You care about the relationships

36510
01:47:28,241 --> 01:47:30,143
you had and how deep they are.

36520
01:47:30,143 --> 01:47:32,045
And if you didn't pay attention

36530
01:47:32,045 --> 01:47:35,048
at that time, you lost a relationship

36540
01:47:35,215 --> 01:47:37,350
and severed a connectedness

36550
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:39,953
that enhances your meaning in life.

36560
01:47:40,687 --> 01:47:41,188
You've

36570
01:47:41,188 --> 01:47:42,989
you fell into reciprocal narrowing.

36580
01:47:42,989 --> 01:47:44,391
It severed a relationship,

36590
01:47:44,391 --> 01:47:46,059
and your connectedness

36600
01:47:46,059 --> 01:47:47,194
mattering to another

36610
01:47:47,194 --> 01:47:51,031
human being has been lost.

36620
01:47:51,031 --> 01:47:53,700
FRIEDMAN: There's no more interpersonal gravity

36630
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,403
and the relationship does not matter.

36640
01:47:56,403 --> 01:47:57,871
VERVAEKE: Yes. All right.

36650
01:47:57,871 --> 01:48:00,073
FRIEDMAN: I'm going to read just a few

36660
01:48:00,073 --> 01:48:01,508
non question comments

36670
01:48:01,508 --> 01:48:02,843
and then get to a question

36680
01:48:02,843 --> 01:48:04,411
in these last minutes.

36690
01:48:04,411 --> 01:48:07,214
So Griswold wrote, Ants

36700
01:48:07,214 --> 01:48:09,516
hold hands in the river of information

36710
01:48:09,516 --> 01:48:13,453
to float along together.

36720
01:48:13,453 --> 01:48:14,221
VERVAEKE: That's wonderful.

36730
01:48:15,522 --> 01:48:16,857
FRIEDMAN: Ian wrote

36740
01:48:16,857 --> 01:48:17,390
Vision and

36750
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:19,459
fusion communities coupling

36760
01:48:19,459 --> 01:48:22,762
and decoupling and imagination

36770
01:48:22,762 --> 01:48:24,297
in as our static

36780
01:48:24,297 --> 01:48:26,433
remembering of the future.

36790
01:48:26,433 --> 01:48:28,368
VERVAEKE: Oh, wow. Nice.

36800
01:48:28,368 --> 01:48:29,469
FRIEDMAN: Very cool.

36810
01:48:29,469 --> 01:48:29,703
All right.

36820
01:48:29,703 --> 01:48:31,805
And here's one more question.

36830
01:48:31,805 --> 01:48:33,907
This is from Dave.

36840
01:48:33,907 --> 01:48:36,543
So Dave says, have you found

36850
01:48:37,244 --> 01:48:38,078
oh, I don't know

36860
01:48:38,078 --> 01:48:38,712
if this is the correct way

36870
01:48:38,712 --> 01:48:40,046
to pronounce the name, but Giles

36880
01:48:40,046 --> 01:48:42,249
FALGUNI Ayres

36890
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:43,416
work on mental

36900
01:48:43,416 --> 01:48:46,052
spaces and conceptual fusion, useful

36910
01:48:46,052 --> 01:48:47,087
in explaining

36920
01:48:47,087 --> 01:48:48,655
and improving the evolution

36930
01:48:48,655 --> 01:48:51,024
of concrete mental activities.

36940
01:48:51,024 --> 01:48:53,260
And we can also see this work on

36950
01:48:53,693 --> 01:48:55,161
generalized space

36960
01:48:55,161 --> 01:48:56,162
and navigation

36970
01:48:56,162 --> 01:48:57,397
with Chris Fields

36980
01:48:57,397 --> 01:48:59,199
and Mike Levin and many others.

36990
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:00,333
So whether you're familiar

37000
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:01,635
with that researcher or not,

37010
01:49:01,635 --> 01:49:04,237
how does this idea of cognitive spaces

37020
01:49:04,638 --> 01:49:05,338
help us

37030
01:49:05,338 --> 01:49:07,941
work in physical and social spaces?

37040
01:49:09,276 --> 01:49:10,377
VERVAEKE: For me,

37050
01:49:11,311 --> 01:49:13,313
again, and this how,

37060
01:49:13,313 --> 01:49:13,980
you know, the connection

37070
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:15,181
to relevance realization

37080
01:49:15,181 --> 01:49:15,849
and its connection

37090
01:49:15,849 --> 01:49:17,384
to connections to biology

37100
01:49:17,384 --> 01:49:19,119
and evolutionary modeling

37110
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:20,120
is really helpful here.

37120
01:49:21,354 --> 01:49:24,424
So me a moment and then I'll.

37130
01:49:24,424 --> 01:49:25,659
So one of the ways

37140
01:49:25,659 --> 01:49:28,461
in which evolution selects is it accepts

37150
01:49:28,862 --> 01:49:30,030
expectation means

37160
01:49:30,030 --> 01:49:31,298
it doesn't have to

37170
01:49:31,298 --> 01:49:34,668
generate an entirely new mechanism.

37180
01:49:35,302 --> 01:49:36,469
And so let me give you

37190
01:49:36,469 --> 01:49:37,370
a concrete example.

37200
01:49:37,370 --> 01:49:38,772
It's one of my favorite ones.

37210
01:49:38,772 --> 01:49:40,140
What I'm doing with my tongue right now

37220
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:41,274
is speaking.

37230
01:49:41,274 --> 01:49:41,808
Of course,

37240
01:49:41,808 --> 01:49:43,310
times did not evolve for speech

37250
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:44,878
because we have so many organisms

37260
01:49:44,878 --> 01:49:45,512
that have tongues

37270
01:49:45,512 --> 01:49:47,314
and they aren't capable of speech.

37280
01:49:47,314 --> 01:49:48,481
But what does the tongue do?

37290
01:49:48,481 --> 01:49:49,883
Well, it helps Master Kate,

37300
01:49:49,883 --> 01:49:52,152
so it has to be highly flexible.

37310
01:49:52,152 --> 01:49:53,553
It has to be a poison

37320
01:49:53,553 --> 01:49:55,055
and calorie detector.

37330
01:49:55,055 --> 01:49:56,623
So it has to have lots of nerve endings

37340
01:49:56,623 --> 01:49:57,457
and it has to be

37350
01:49:57,457 --> 01:49:58,592
it's in the air passageway

37360
01:49:58,592 --> 01:50:00,760
because that's how we evolved right.

37370
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:02,862
So it's it's almost predesigned.

37380
01:50:02,862 --> 01:50:05,098
It's some people say pre adapted

37390
01:50:05,098 --> 01:50:05,699
for speech

37400
01:50:05,699 --> 01:50:07,968
and so it gets exact it into speech.

37410
01:50:08,802 --> 01:50:10,971
I think there's growing evidence

37420
01:50:10,971 --> 01:50:12,138
look at barbecue verses

37430
01:50:12,138 --> 01:50:15,175
book mind in motion that the brain

37440
01:50:15,942 --> 01:50:16,843
and this goes to the work

37450
01:50:16,843 --> 01:50:18,845
of Michael Anderson and the and others

37460
01:50:19,646 --> 01:50:22,315
the brain is an executive

37470
01:50:22,716 --> 01:50:24,651
process of the brain

37480
01:50:24,651 --> 01:50:26,453
is constantly exacting

37490
01:50:28,154 --> 01:50:29,456
machinery that

37500
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:32,659
emerged one

37510
01:50:32,659 --> 01:50:35,195
arena set of actions for another

37520
01:50:35,929 --> 01:50:38,131
specifically it looks like

37530
01:50:38,798 --> 01:50:43,336
the set of abilities that we generate

37540
01:50:44,204 --> 01:50:46,373
for navigating

37550
01:50:46,539 --> 01:50:49,109
physical space is exacted into moving

37560
01:50:49,275 --> 01:50:51,077
around in conceptual space.

37570
01:50:51,077 --> 01:50:52,512
The fact that we have been calling it

37580
01:50:52,512 --> 01:50:53,947
conceptual space

37590
01:50:53,947 --> 01:50:54,848
and we talk about things

37600
01:50:54,848 --> 01:50:56,282
being higher and lower

37610
01:50:56,282 --> 01:50:57,684
and we move between,

37620
01:50:57,684 --> 01:50:58,652
etc., you can

37630
01:50:58,652 --> 01:50:59,352
it's just it's

37640
01:50:59,352 --> 01:51:00,854
just totally impregnated

37650
01:51:00,854 --> 01:51:02,489
with navigational language.

37660
01:51:02,489 --> 01:51:03,990
And we talk about orientation

37670
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:06,092
and finding our way or losing our way.

37680
01:51:06,326 --> 01:51:08,762
I Can you follow this argument?

37690
01:51:08,762 --> 01:51:10,497
Well, that's tracking language.

37700
01:51:10,497 --> 01:51:11,931
Can you follow this argument?

37710
01:51:11,931 --> 01:51:13,933
Where is it going to? Right.

37720
01:51:14,334 --> 01:51:16,903
You know, I lost the thread of what?

37730
01:51:17,170 --> 01:51:18,571
Just like again

37740
01:51:18,571 --> 01:51:20,440
and again and again and again.

37750
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:23,343
And and so it really

37760
01:51:23,343 --> 01:51:24,177
and it helps to explain

37770
01:51:24,177 --> 01:51:26,112
really weird stuff that's otherwise

37780
01:51:26,112 --> 01:51:27,847
not well explained.

37790
01:51:27,847 --> 01:51:28,415
Okay.

37800
01:51:28,415 --> 01:51:29,516
Cerebellum

37810
01:51:29,516 --> 01:51:31,885
More neurons than your neocortex,

37820
01:51:32,452 --> 01:51:32,819
often

37830
01:51:32,819 --> 01:51:34,821
not included in F memorized, by the way,

37840
01:51:34,821 --> 01:51:36,056
which is a mistake

37850
01:51:36,056 --> 01:51:37,757
in a mini f memorized

37860
01:51:37,757 --> 01:51:39,959
I think should be removed their findings

37870
01:51:39,959 --> 01:51:42,028
because the cerebellum is not included

37880
01:51:42,028 --> 01:51:44,264
and we we are now getting overwhelming

37890
01:51:44,264 --> 01:51:45,732
evidence for the cerebellar

37900
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:49,135
cerebellum cortex loop.

37910
01:51:49,135 --> 01:51:51,371
And by excluding the cerebellum

37920
01:51:51,371 --> 01:51:52,505
from our f of our eyes,

37930
01:51:52,505 --> 01:51:53,239
we are

37940
01:51:53,339 --> 01:51:56,109
we are we are smuggling in a confound

37950
01:51:56,109 --> 01:51:57,444
that has not been properly

37960
01:51:57,444 --> 01:51:58,445
controlled for

37970
01:51:58,445 --> 01:52:01,081
so just a general point there,

37980
01:52:01,081 --> 01:52:03,116
when people are sitting in a

37990
01:52:03,116 --> 01:52:04,117
what's the cerebellum for,

38000
01:52:04,117 --> 01:52:06,920
you know, sensorimotor balance, right,

38010
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:07,887
then people are sitting

38020
01:52:07,887 --> 01:52:10,924
absolutely still eyes closed,

38030
01:52:10,924 --> 01:52:13,126
perfectly stable in meditation.

38040
01:52:13,126 --> 01:52:15,261
Their cerebellum is firing like crazy.

38050
01:52:15,528 --> 01:52:17,130
Why

38060
01:52:18,031 --> 01:52:19,232
they're not doing anything.

38070
01:52:19,232 --> 01:52:19,933
They're not moving.

38080
01:52:19,933 --> 01:52:20,734
They're in a position

38090
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:23,169
where they can be deeply comfortable

38100
01:52:23,169 --> 01:52:25,338
because they are aligned with gravity

38110
01:52:25,338 --> 01:52:28,074
and like they're stable, stable, stable.

38120
01:52:28,074 --> 01:52:29,342
Their eyes are

38130
01:52:29,442 --> 01:52:30,510
well, presumably

38140
01:52:30,510 --> 01:52:32,278
because they are navigating

38150
01:52:32,278 --> 01:52:33,947
and they're trying to balance

38160
01:52:33,947 --> 01:52:36,282
complex contingencies of attention

38170
01:52:36,483 --> 01:52:40,053
and move through the experiential space

38180
01:52:40,053 --> 01:52:41,187
in a powerful way.

38190
01:52:41,187 --> 01:52:42,756
And the cerebellum

38200
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:44,524
this when I started talking about this,

38210
01:52:44,524 --> 01:52:45,825
it was controversial.

38220
01:52:45,825 --> 01:52:47,894
Now it's approaching consensus position

38230
01:52:47,894 --> 01:52:48,628
that this is

38240
01:52:48,628 --> 01:52:49,496
the cerebellum

38250
01:52:49,496 --> 01:52:50,497
has been exacted

38260
01:52:50,497 --> 01:52:51,965
for these kinds of functions.

38270
01:52:51,965 --> 01:52:55,635
So I think the idea that

38280
01:52:57,003 --> 01:52:59,072
we but that

38290
01:52:59,072 --> 01:52:59,672
and I'm not

38300
01:52:59,672 --> 01:53:01,207
I've only briefly looked at

38310
01:53:01,207 --> 01:53:01,941
Fukunaga's work

38320
01:53:01,941 --> 01:53:03,143
when I was doing work on metaphor,

38330
01:53:03,143 --> 01:53:03,710
I didn't find it

38340
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:05,411
particularly helpful for metaphor,

38350
01:53:05,411 --> 01:53:08,214
so I didn't go into it more deeply.

38360
01:53:08,214 --> 01:53:12,986
But the the idea that we are doing

38370
01:53:12,986 --> 01:53:15,421
something like mapping between spaces,

38380
01:53:15,421 --> 01:53:17,557
I think this is

38390
01:53:17,857 --> 01:53:19,526
I think yeah,

38400
01:53:19,526 --> 01:53:20,827
I think this just plugs

38410
01:53:20,827 --> 01:53:23,096
into the exhaustive nature

38420
01:53:23,096 --> 01:53:23,997
of our cognition

38430
01:53:23,997 --> 01:53:26,866
that it is a form of rapid cognitive

38440
01:53:29,602 --> 01:53:30,336
awesome.

38450
01:53:30,336 --> 01:53:33,506
FRIEDMAN: Well, in the final minutes,

38460
01:53:34,073 --> 01:53:36,242
do you have any words of wisdom?

38470
01:53:36,242 --> 01:53:37,010
Any thoughts?

38480
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:38,311
Where do we go from here?

38490
01:53:38,311 --> 01:53:41,314
Where do people go from here?

38500
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:42,248
VERVAEKE: Well, it depends.

38510
01:53:42,248 --> 01:53:43,616
I mean, you can go theoretically

38520
01:53:43,616 --> 01:53:44,250
in which you can look

38530
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:45,618
at my publications and

38540
01:53:45,618 --> 01:53:47,420
and Mark is coming.

38550
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:49,689
He got an amazing grant

38560
01:53:49,689 --> 01:53:51,224
and other grants. And

38570
01:53:52,592 --> 01:53:54,027
so he's come maybe you to

38580
01:53:54,027 --> 01:53:55,028
he and I are going to do work

38590
01:53:55,028 --> 01:53:57,263
Brett and I are doing work.

38600
01:53:57,931 --> 01:53:58,431
The three of

38610
01:53:58,431 --> 01:53:59,299
are going to continue to work.

38620
01:53:59,299 --> 01:54:00,800
So look for that.

38630
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,302
Gary and I, who published the paper

38640
01:54:02,302 --> 01:54:03,603
on relevance, realization

38650
01:54:03,603 --> 01:54:04,604
and personality,

38660
01:54:04,604 --> 01:54:05,672
have one

38670
01:54:05,672 --> 01:54:06,606
pretty well-written

38680
01:54:06,606 --> 01:54:08,842
on integrating relevance realization

38690
01:54:08,842 --> 01:54:10,643
and attachment theory

38700
01:54:10,643 --> 01:54:14,247
in terms of attachment is actually a

38710
01:54:14,814 --> 01:54:16,349
an optimal gripping practice

38720
01:54:16,349 --> 01:54:18,351
between the child and the mother

38730
01:54:18,618 --> 01:54:20,086
or frequently

38740
01:54:20,086 --> 01:54:20,820
the mother, the

38750
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:23,923
the primary caregiver, I should say.

38760
01:54:24,057 --> 01:54:26,693
And so you can look for all of that,

38770
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:28,561
for of you

38780
01:54:28,561 --> 01:54:29,362
who are interested

38790
01:54:29,362 --> 01:54:30,630
more in the wisdom stuff.

38800
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:31,564
You can look at the stuff

38810
01:54:31,564 --> 01:54:34,200
I published on wisdom

38820
01:54:34,267 --> 01:54:34,868
some.

38830
01:54:35,501 --> 01:54:36,135
I don't think I wrote

38840
01:54:36,135 --> 01:54:37,270
any wisdom papers on my own.

38850
01:54:37,270 --> 01:54:38,838
There are with other people

38860
01:54:39,973 --> 01:54:41,174
you if you're interested

38870
01:54:41,174 --> 01:54:42,375
in mindfulness,

38880
01:54:42,375 --> 01:54:44,410
I've got two publications, one on

38890
01:54:45,011 --> 01:54:48,014
an Oxford book, the anthology

38900
01:54:48,014 --> 01:54:49,082
edited by Amir

38910
01:54:49,082 --> 01:54:50,416
RAZ on hypnosis

38920
01:54:50,416 --> 01:54:51,584
and meditation,

38930
01:54:51,584 --> 01:54:52,452
and more recent one

38940
01:54:52,452 --> 01:54:54,420
which I recommend in the Routledge

38950
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:55,655
Handbook on the philosophy

38960
01:54:55,655 --> 01:54:56,689
of meditation,

38970
01:54:56,689 --> 01:54:58,258
where I talk about all of this.

38980
01:54:58,258 --> 01:54:59,525
I think how this all works out

38990
01:54:59,525 --> 01:55:00,927
in terms of attention

39000
01:55:00,927 --> 01:55:02,495
and meditation and contemplation,

39010
01:55:02,495 --> 01:55:03,563
why they're not the same thing,

39020
01:55:03,563 --> 01:55:04,297
why they're an important

39030
01:55:04,297 --> 01:55:05,665
processing relationship,

39040
01:55:05,665 --> 01:55:08,101
why that's conducive to

39050
01:55:09,102 --> 01:55:10,470
insight and more

39060
01:55:10,470 --> 01:55:12,538
systemic and systematic insight, etc..

39070
01:55:13,506 --> 01:55:15,808
If you're interested in learning

39080
01:55:15,808 --> 01:55:16,943
about the meaning crisis,

39090
01:55:16,943 --> 01:55:18,945
you can go to my YouTube series,

39100
01:55:19,245 --> 01:55:20,213
Awakening for the Meeting

39110
01:55:20,213 --> 01:55:21,714
Crisis and follow that argument

39120
01:55:21,714 --> 01:55:22,916
all the way through.

39130
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:24,017
I have a new series

39140
01:55:24,017 --> 01:55:24,617
coming out

39150
01:55:24,617 --> 01:55:28,554
which is about trying to tap into

39160
01:55:28,721 --> 01:55:30,089
how we can afford

39170
01:55:30,089 --> 01:55:32,625
these kinds of flowing,

39180
01:55:32,625 --> 01:55:34,260
emergent conversations

39190
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:35,161
that take us

39200
01:55:35,161 --> 01:55:36,529

an individual cognition and empower us.

39220
01:55:39,899 --> 01:55:40,333
And it's called

39230
01:55:40,333 --> 01:55:41,267
After Socrates, where

39240
01:55:41,267 --> 01:55:42,268
I'm tracing out

39250
01:55:42,268 --> 01:55:43,036
what's going on

39260
01:55:43,036 --> 01:55:45,672

39270
01:55:45,672 --> 01:55:47,140
that's coming out

39280
01:55:47,140 --> 01:55:49,842

01:55:54,247 --> 01:55:54,914
me and my work
