00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,920
hello everyone welcome to actin flab

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,920
guest stream number 19.1 it's march 25th

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,480
2022

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,600
and we are here with marco falcon and we

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,760
are going to be discussing the recent

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,080
paper extended predictive minds do

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,160
markov blankets matter so if you're

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,480
watching live please feel free to

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,679
put

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,679
comments or questions in the live chat

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,680
and hopefully we can address them

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,719
and marco really appreciate you joining

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,040
looking forward to hearing about this

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,520
paper and your lines of research so

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,040
would be awesome to hear an introduction

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,120
and take it away

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,120
okay hi everyone so i'm mark of akin i

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,320
actually am a phd candidate in italy

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,160
and

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,440
steep paper basically is an attempt to

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,879
understand

22
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,719
what was going on

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,960
in the active inference literature with

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,600
the externalism internalism debate from

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,000
a philosophical perspective

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,439
so i

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,920
studied philosophy for the most part i'm

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,880
not super mathematically savvy and i

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,280
have basically a background in

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,080
embodied extended cognition

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,200
and i stumbled upon the papers by whole

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,439
year after another and i

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,680
wanted to understand what was going on

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,560
with

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,560
the mark of blanket talk

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,600
and so i wrote a paper about it to to

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,840
understand what was going on

38
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,560
and to try to suggest that maybe

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,280
that much emphasis on markov blanket is

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,520
a bit misplaced

41
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,720
and yes

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,880
that's it for a general introduction for

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,799
the paper i think

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,040
and

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,240
then here for any question or any doctor

46
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,000
okay cool so maybe um i'll just ask some

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,759
questions and we'll just see where it

48
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,200
goes

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,119
for somebody who was

50
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,440
unfamiliar with

51
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,200
extended cognitive

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,599
processes or the state of the art maybe

53
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,680
outside of active inference just what is

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,480
this area how are people looking at it

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,360
outside of the active inference fep

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,760
angle and like what is the contemporary

57
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,480
state of that area

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,680
so okay

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,440
so the extended cognition stuff

60
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,280
say officially is something that

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,840
spawn out a paper by clark and chalmers

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,959
in the early 2000s basically

63
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,080
and their original idea was

64
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,040
as i understand it at least this that

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,440
sometimes at least

66
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,360
you interact with the environment in a

67
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,800
way such that part of cognition happens

68
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,519
in the environment itself so my go-to

69
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,000
example is using pen and paper to them

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,280
off

71
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
when you use pen and paper to do math

72
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,239
you write down partial results

73
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,519
and that scrap of paper is working as

74
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,000
a piece of your working memory it's just

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,879
that it's not inside your brain is

76
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,800
around you on your

77
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,000
desk or whenever you're doing enough

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,319
and so that was basically the original

79
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,680
idea and from that

80
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,519
there has been a reach collaboration

81
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,440
with people like richard minari

82
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,080
suggesting that

83
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,560
actually ddtdd

84
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,080
we should think that

85
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,640
extended cognitive processes as

86
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,040
processes that transform our cognitive

87
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,959
capacities is not just

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,560
more stuff more memory more symbols but

89
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,000
new stuff new capacities new symbols new

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,799
uh

91
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,840
cognitive processes that take place in

92
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,080
the interaction in between the subject

93
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,519
and the environment

94
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,000
so we have that line of research and

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,400
then you have a more say an active line

96
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,159
of research that

97
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,280
tends to stress the edd idea that

98
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,599
basically all cognition takes place in

99
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,640
the world interacting with affordances

100
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,680
or interacting with

101
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,839
your surrounding environments

102
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,000
but i'm not super

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,320
expert on that line of research on the

104
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,840
extended miner a bit more

105
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,880
conservative so

106
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,280
the punchline would be this that

107
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,960
sometimes

108
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,759
stuff in the external world really is in

109
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,479
the most literal sense possible a cog of

110
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,840
the machinery that does your

111
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,320
thinking that is

112
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,199
clearest and the most forceful way in

113
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,000
which i'm able to put a deity of

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,240
the extended mind

115
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,639
and of course sorry once you have this

116
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,360
idea on the table the question is okay

117
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,800
but where

118
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,120
when where does it stop

119
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,080
is pen and paper is in but i don't know

120
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,720
are our cell phones in

121
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,600
our

122
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,360
are books in here at my uh left

123
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,120
you might not be able to see it but

124
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,759
there is a big library with a lot of

125
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,080
books there right are all those books

126
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,639
part of my memory probably not

127
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,840
but you need some sort of

128
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,919
and that's the full mark of blood of

129
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,400
course so i'll leave it

130
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,479
like this

131
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,479
well i i like this you said it was like

132
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,039
a cog and it's kind of like cognition so

133
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,479
it's right there in the word even though

134
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,840
that's a little bit of a word play um

135
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,400
and also very interesting about the more

136
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,479
is different like we're not just

137
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,400
augmenting the computer with a bigger

138
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,880
hard drive or more ram it truly can be

139
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
different and so i think maybe we could

140
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,800
return to this idea of like what is the

141
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,440
space of the adjacent possible for

142
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,520
cognitive systems especially if they

143
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,800
compose in these non-linear ways

144
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,479
but could you maybe

145
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,479
walk us through

146
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,759
some of the pieces of the paper like

147
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,560
what

148
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,400
brought you to the introduction what

149
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,039
brought you to writing this

150
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,520
paper on markov blankets and then what

151
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,360
did you sort of weave together in the

152
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,120
introduction how did you clash him in

153
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,639
the middle and then where did you leave

154
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,720
us at the end

155
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,600
so did you walk through to the paper is

156
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,639
something

157
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,880
not super sure i'll be able to do

158
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,440
satisfactory at least

159
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,840
so

160
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,199
ddddd first step

161
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,960
was to

162
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,280
what motivated me was to try and figure

163
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,240
out what was going on between andy clark

164
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,840
jakob hoey ramstad

165
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,639
and mark of blankets of course

166
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,599
and what i wanted to argue basically was

167
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,080
something like this

168
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,280
that even if you set aside dddd works by

169
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,319
yellow barineburg and others or menarian

170
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,280
gillettes that

171
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,199
tend to give you this sort of message

172
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,880
like we have a

173
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,120
perfectly fine mathematical concept of

174
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,639
markup blankets

175
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,199
and then a strange concept of recent

176
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,440
blankets that is a big mathematical and

177
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,160
a bit ontological and we are not really

178
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,880
sure what it is even if you leave this

179
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,960
sort of worries aside

180
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,440
what i wanted to say is that the way in

181
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,000
which markov blankets are used

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,639
uh for when it comes to discussing the

183
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,599
extended mind stuff uh is very limited

184
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,400
to the specific application but

185
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,319
for the extended mind the usage of

186
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,360
markup blankets

187
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,680
is not really useful

188
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,599
does

189
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,639
nothing

190
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,039
of particular value

191
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,080
and

192
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,960
tends to give a big headache to the

193
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,280
people that are not interactive in

194
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,919
france so i would recommend not using

195
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,440
them

196
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,120
if the main arguments

197
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,160
i think

198
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,120
there is no main argument doctor i think

199
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,319
i have three arguments

200
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,639
that are well first

201
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,759
in order to find a mark of blankets

202
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,000
it seems that you must already know what

203
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,720
is inside

204
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,479
if you think about a graph

205
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,680
there is

206
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,319
no way in which i can give you a graph

207
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,519
and and just ask you okay please show me

208
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,839
where is the marker blanket in there i

209
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,559
need to tell you of

210
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,279
about which node i'm interested in right

211
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,560
so you must already know what is inside

212
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,200
and when it comes to demand cognitive

213
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,760
machinery knowing what is inside is

214
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,279
knowing

215
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,360
which are the cards

216
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,600
which will presumably include

217
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,920
brain plus maybe stuff in the

218
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,880
environment pen and paper and whatever

219
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,920
and if you already know that which you

220
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,000
must already know in order to find the

221
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,480
relevant markup blanket

222
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,399
that intuitively you already know

223
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,279
whether the mind extends or not

224
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,959
and if you already know whether the mind

225
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,560
extends or not

226
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,880
you know whether it stands or not there

227
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,560
is no new

228
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,480
you this is a no new piece of

229
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,959
information to to be gained by thinking

230
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,800
about whether mind extends or not in

231
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,279
terms of marker blanket that is the e4

232
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,040
the first argument

233
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,519
the second one which is a bit messy

234
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,279
could i just pause there make a comment

235
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,040
on the first one just okay

236
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,600
awesome so

237
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,240
though the markov blanket uh if only it

238
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,000
were like the blankets on our bed and

239
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,519
you could pick it up and it was a

240
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,200
blanket whether it was inside the box or

241
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,360
around the box or whatever

242
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200
that's not

243
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,000
really how they are defined it's really

244
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,120
like a co-partitioning of internal and

245
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,279
external states with respect to a

246
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,959
blanket or a blanket with respect to

247
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,880
some other internal and external states

248
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,800
so the blanket states are the ones that

249
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,120
make two other sets of states internally

250
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,519
external conditionally independent and

251
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,800
so it's not that a node can be even in a

252
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,320
purely statistical sense so without

253
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,519
getting into the whole what do they

254
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,040
physically map onto

255
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,680
a given node is not like a blanket state

256
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,440
or an internal state it's a blanket

257
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,480
state with respect to some other states

258
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,000
because it's part of this partitioning

259
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,760
that's co-instantiated at the same

260
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,279
moment so it's an excellent point where

261
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,560
if you know what your system of

262
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,519
interests internal states are

263
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,760
then you can talk about what states

264
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,680
blanket them with respect to some other

265
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,640
states

266
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,800
but if the question is about the

267
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,760
extended mind and what are the internal

268
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,320
states of mind then there's kind of this

269
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,480
catch 22 cat in the hat scenario where

270
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,079
if you knew

271
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,440
where to

272
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,120
even focus

273
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,600
you would have already sort of addressed

274
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,000
the question up front just to sort of

275
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,360
unpack that and connect it to some of

276
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,600
the other ways we've talked about it

277
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,760
yeah that's a great unboxing

278
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,680
the keyword you said and that i forgot

279
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,800
to set

280
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,120
is the system you're interested in

281
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,320
uh why i want to do to focus on this

282
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,079
right now because

283
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,120
the uh extended mind stuff

284
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,720
is supposed to be hyper realistic

285
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,279
uh the idea is not that

286
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,079
uh i mean we can treat pen and paper as

287
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,560
if they were a form of external memory

288
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,120
that is something you can do

289
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,920
but is not the claim that interests me

290
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
clark menari

291
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,600
the claim is that

292
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,639
that interests me clark and minari is

293
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,240
that pen and paper really are with the

294
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,360
capital r a on of r

295
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,680
really are a piece of memory in the

296
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,440
external world

297
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,240
right

298
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,399
they are memory in the same sentence in

299
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,160
which

300
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,920
parts of your neural activation or

301
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,639
memory system are memory

302
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,480
that is ddd relevant claim so there is

303
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,920
nothing

304
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,079
observer dependent or interest

305
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,360
dependence

306
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,279
is

307
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,000
really a hardcore metaphysics about how

308
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,240
the word actually is independently about

309
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,800
what you know about it

310
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,200
so that's the point that i should

311
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,839
probably have meet sooner

312
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,440
well you made it in the paper with uh

313
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,279
the direction of identification runs

314
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,680
from target variables to markup blankets

315
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,920
not the other way around

316
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,000
so yeah

317
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,959
yeah

318
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,639
so that's the first argument the second

319
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,120
one is very muddy and also very

320
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,200
dependent on the

321
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,040
how the editors were on the extended

322
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,000
minds

323
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,120
and mark of blanca develop

324
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,519
but the point is basically this

325
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,120
uh

326
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,360
that from the very beginning

327
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,360
that would be probably who is

328
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,079
2016 paper the self-evidencing brain

329
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,680
uh

330
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,880
d message look there are

331
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,360
many possible blankets and we have

332
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
somehow to choose one

333
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
uh that sort of message get got through

334
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,959
the literature here

335
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,320
and the way in which yeah hui

336
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,519
and others tried to

337
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,399
single out the super special blankets

338
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,519
among the many possible was to look at

339
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,880
south of the dancing in the long run

340
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,639
about

341
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,639
keeping your

342
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,760
keeping yourself close to your set point

343
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,000
in the long run

344
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,920
and their idea as i understood it

345
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,639
was to say that well the machinery of

346
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,399
the mind

347
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,199
is identical to the machinery that keeps

348
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,839
yourself near your set point in the long

349
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,079
run

350
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,399
and that sounds persuasive from a free

351
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,839
energy principle perspective

352
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,160
but it's not super persuasive if you are

353
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,120
not

354
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,959
very into the free energy principle

355
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,600
because there is a lot of stuff that

356
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
keep us alive and kicking in the long

357
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,279
run our liver

358
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,720
our guts

359
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,920
our kidneys and prima faction

360
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,199
none of those organs does thinking in an

361
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,079
intelligible sense

362
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,720
and so did you worry here

363
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,680
that

364
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,079
probably is never actually stated in the

365
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,920
paper is that we are confusing

366
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,440
cognizing

367
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,760
in some broad and fuzzy sense with

368
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,560
staying alive

369
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,959
i mean

370
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,399
i've nothing

371
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,639
against the claim that living things

372
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,959
tend to cognize or tend to behave

373
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,399
intelligently

374
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,279
plants do behave intelligently even if

375
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,639
very slowly

376
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,079
says behave intelligently

377
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,480
but i'm not super sure about

378
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
equating the two

379
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,800
and that would be probably my second

380
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,120
point

381
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,399
okay let's

382
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,720
stay on this because that's also a great

383
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,800
point so

384
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,480
if not

385
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,279
one and the same as staying alive

386
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,000
what other perspectives on cognition

387
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,120
might there be like what is thinking

388
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,199
other than staying alive or what is it

389
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,120
that for example the neurons and the

390
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,839
glia are doing that the um

391
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,759
cartilage in the knee is not doing

392
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,680
a fascial processing information would

393
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,079
be a different dancer if you take tiny

394
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,440
or at least censor inflammation

395
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,880
so

396
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,839
that

397
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,600
that's the question i'm struggling with

398
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,839
right now

399
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,399
and my two cents would be

400
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,279
this

401
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,240
that's

402
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,720
we have a big problem because

403
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,120
not because we don't have a definition

404
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,600
of cognition but because we have too

405
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,240
many definition of cognition we have too

406
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,959
many research programs

407
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,279
telling us what cognition is so you have

408
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,639
ddd

409
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,839
classic

410
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,880
cognitive science what is cognition well

411
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,839
symbol manipulation when you go with the

412
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,639
connection is what is cognition well

413
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,120
vector transformation sub-symbolic

414
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,800
computation then you have the

415
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,240
inactivists

416
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,560
what is cognition um

417
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,240
sense making

418
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,480
slash autonomy

419
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,639
uh ecological psychologists what has

420
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,120
cognition while interacting skillfully

421
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,399
with affordances and so on and so forth

422
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,040
and my big problem is that

423
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,279
no one here is clearly wrong

424
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,400
no one is obviously dead wrong and that

425
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,160
thing clearly cannot be cognition

426
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,280
and so what i think i would suggest is a

427
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,520
sort of pluralism

428
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,760
about cognition cognition is not a

429
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,640
single thing it's not like dancing what

430
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,119
is dancing well moving your arms yes

431
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,679
sometimes but sometimes dancing might

432
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,720
even be staying still in a certain piece

433
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,880
of art there might be

434
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,840
some regimented stainless steel as a

435
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,840
part of dancing

436
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,000
and that would be the analogy

437
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,039
so

438
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,600
something that gets done in a variety of

439
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
ways

440
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,039
none of which

441
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,320
seems to apply to kidneys livers cloves

442
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,280
and that sort of things

443
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,000
if i can layer

444
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,290
one more sort of um

445
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,480
[Music]

446
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,080
and or there's the experience and the

447
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,600
phenomenology

448
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,640
of us as ourselves and as people and

449
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,440
then there's sort of the behaviorism

450
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,760
or at the very least animal behavioral

451
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,520
sciences or just behavioral studies in

452
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,480
general

453
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
which is like from the outside looking

454
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,280
at a system and so there's this

455
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,240
gap

456
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,960
between like us doing the

457
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,480
um thinking about cognition

458
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,240
and the experience of that thinking

459
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,919
about cognition and then the question

460
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,640
about recognizing cognition in

461
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,679
other people in children in non-humans

462
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,919
et cetera and so like i really like that

463
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,440
how you lay like there's the symbol the

464
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,760
sub-symbolic inactive and then no one

465
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,080
disagrees no one is saying that bacteria

466
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,160
make bad decisions on the whole they're

467
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,919
here aren't they and no one's saying

468
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,160
like a tree doesn't have a metabolic

469
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,480
coupling with a fungus and no one's

470
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
saying that the fungus doesn't defuse

471
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,520
signals

472
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,880
but then the

473
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,600
aspects of these systems

474
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,679
that people focus their regime of

475
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,960
attention on

476
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,640
and where they choose to start their

477
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,280
talks and what they decide to talk about

478
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,360
and what experiments they design

479
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,799
that frames the discussion

480
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,760
about cognition

481
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,080
that's a wonderful way to do it

482
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,919
and i'm a bit

483
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,640
sad because the paper

484
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,240
about cognition has already been

485
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,840
submitted

486
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,320
if i hadn't submitted it already i would

487
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,880
have stolen the framing part because

488
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,600
it's wonderful i said

489
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,760
that said

490
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,080
so there are two things i'd like to say

491
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,880
about

492
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,039
that so the first one is

493
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,000
no one really disagrees i'm not sure i

494
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,400
think that there is some genuine

495
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
disagreement

496
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,640
so the hardcore ecological psychologist

497
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,320
i believe

498
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,880
and feel free to correct me if there are

499
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,799
any ecological set of colleges really

500
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,880
think that cognition is interacting with

501
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,720
affordances

502
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,919
full stop

503
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,480
and that there is no symbol manipulation

504
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,960
going on in the background

505
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,919
and

506
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,360
i the classic cognitivists i think

507
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,080
really think that cognizing justice

508
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,480
manipulation manipulating symbols in the

509
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,000
background so there are genuine

510
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
disagreements

511
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,240
uh

512
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,360
what i'm

513
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,200
not super sure about is whether

514
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,520
those disagreements

515
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,440
are solvable in the sense that you can

516
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,080
provide a master argument or even master

517
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,679
experiments

518
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:42,559
uh

519
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,720
from which you can just read off oh the

520
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,000
ecological psychologist was wrong

521
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,080
classic cognitiveness was

522
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,399
right

523
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,799
i think that the best we can do is

524
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,320
accept some form of plurality about what

525
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,039
cognition is and perhaps but i'm not

526
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,039
super sure we might have to accept that

527
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,799
there may be things that are neither

528
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,600
determinately cognitive neither

529
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,799
determinately not cognitive

530
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,400
i mean

531
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,760
plants

532
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,320
do behave do cope with their environment

533
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,240
well

534
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,480
i'm not entirely comfortable about

535
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,840
saying that there are

536
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,320
cognizers in the exact same sense in

537
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,440
which i am recognizer

538
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,520
maybe it's just because their behavior

539
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,080
is very slow if compared to mine maybe

540
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,480
it's because i have certain

541
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,120
cultural prejudices which i mean they

542
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,240
exist

543
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,360
and

544
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,600
dddd

545
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,720
call

546
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,120
calling something a cognizer is

547
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,240
influenced by your prejudices if you go

548
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,600
back to the

549
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,240
early analytic philosopher pretty much

550
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,039
no one votes animals think and now is

551
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,159
unbelievable that's someone

552
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,679
for someone to have that position so

553
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,840
so there is that but it's not super

554
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,399
holdout

555
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,559
but the big message would probably be

556
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,380
this put simply there might be something

557
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,760
[Music]

558
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,400
something of a gray area between

559
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,640
thinking with symbols surely cognitive

560
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,840
and

561
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,159
being a rock really not cognitive the

562
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,720
sort of big gray area in which you have

563
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,799
intelligence coping with the environment

564
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,679
coping with the environment well

565
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:32,559
adaptability

566
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,280
flexibility

567
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,640
but still

568
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,440
not

569
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
not be really sure about whether there

570
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
is some cognition with the capital c

571
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,679
going on in there

572
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,320
and that's the first thing

573
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,400
then you also mentioned polio and

574
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,320
consciousness but

575
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,679
i am very scared about that stuff

576
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,440
okay so

577
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,520
another interesting piece as evidenced

578
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,880
by the um the um

579
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,400
think about what to say carefully don't

580
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
want to say that it's a lane we could

581
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,880
veer off into but right that is a more

582
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,799
purely philosophical

583
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,760
discussion whereas

584
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,039
neurobehavioral studies and cognitive

585
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,559
science frames itself as science

586
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,120
and in science usually we think about

587
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,320
like unique explanations predictions the

588
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,640
ability to design and control and

589
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,960
perturb systems

590
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,120
so

591
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,200
is this

592
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,120
science what kind of science what are we

593
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,120
looking for here in a cognitive model

594
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,919
and how do we resolve or accommodate

595
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,679
this tension between like unique

596
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,520
explanations and predictions which is

597
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,480
the

598
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,480
bedrock of one type of science

599
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,360
with

600
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,360
the call for pluralism

601
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,240
that you just made

602
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,039
i think that the answer here is

603
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,640
do nothing

604
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,240
in the sense that

605
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,039
the call for pluralism

606
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,520
is not a very

607
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,000
not a call

608
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,279
cognitive science is splintered you have

609
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,000
everyone doing its own thing in its own

610
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,440
lab

611
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,600
there is cooperation

612
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,799
uh in the sense that

613
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,320
uh

614
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,559
i mean

615
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,960
the various research groups are not

616
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,679
entirely isolated is not the case that

617
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,159
people working on mirror neurons know

618
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,960
nothing about connectionism or

619
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,360
classical computationalism or whatever

620
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,840
there is some communication

621
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,559
but on the face of it what i say as a

622
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,720
philosopher looking at science

623
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,080
it is a splintering

624
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,600
of ddd cognitive science enterprise in a

625
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,840
variety of groups

626
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,880
each with its own peculiar research

627
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,279
tradition

628
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,520
and i think that that is basically fine

629
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,840
if no one has a

630
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,880
strong call or a strong argument or a

631
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,080
strong model that

632
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,559
does what newton did for physics and

633
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,080
unifies everything under a single banner

634
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,840
plurality is fine

635
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,799
so

636
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,960
there is no qualities more something

637
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,679
like well that's reality let's try to

638
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,000
like it

639
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,600
i'm

640
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,200
on board with that

641
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,120
but with this banner

642
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,080
what

643
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,919
shape would it be or how would we know

644
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,960
it when we saw it

645
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,200
i have no clue

646
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,279
we probably just

647
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,360
would just know it when we saw it in the

648
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
sense that we would see a research

649
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,879
tradition starting to

650
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,240
absorb

651
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,480
all others

652
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,360
uh

653
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,679
we would probably see

654
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,840
people trying to demonstrate us that

655
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,880
there is a real and significant

656
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,080
equivalence between

657
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,000
our

658
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,720
powerful research tradition uniform

659
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,320
research tradition and all the others

660
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,960
and probably the winning research

661
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,640
tradition the one that really got

662
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,799
cognition really got thinking

663
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:35,760
uh

664
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
would be able to make some novel

665
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,879
prediction that

666
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,480
no one else

667
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,000
was able to mate

668
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,919
and that would be probably a strong

669
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,320
marker that that's the way to go

670
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,279
if the implicit question is do i think

671
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,080
that

672
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,480
the free energy principle is that sort

673
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,960
of research tradition

674
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,360
i'm not sure

675
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,640
and my answer would probably be a

676
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,360
qualified no

677
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,880
because we

678
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,640
do not have

679
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
right now dddd

680
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,840
proof that is unifying as it wants to be

681
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,240
it makes big unifying claims

682
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,279
and it might be good in the sense that

683
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,000
they may foster cooperation at the very

684
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,559
least so you have at least that

685
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,120
pragmatic advantage

686
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,240
uh whether it's succeeding unifying

687
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,600
as

688
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,240
it wants to unify is still an open

689
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,520
question

690
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,760
and

691
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,080
and so the appropriate thing to do is to

692
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,000
for me at least to wait and see for

693
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,760
others perhaps is to

694
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,159
pick up your tools and try to unify and

695
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,320
show that it really is the right thing

696
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,840
or

697
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,159
just argue against even negative

698
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,120
arguments are useful right

699
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,880
uh non-action is an action that's true

700
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,440
in world knowledge traditions and also

701
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,919
in bayesian statistics like it can be

702
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,080
useful to wait to gather more

703
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,760
information

704
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,080
i wanted to return to what you said

705
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,520
earlier about

706
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,640
you need some boundaries

707
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
and a lot of this discussion of course

708
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,960
it's like extended how extended what is

709
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,559
extending and

710
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,880
what are we looking for with a boundary

711
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,159
model

712
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,120
in the fep and active world certainly we

713
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,399
talk a lot about

714
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,159
different kinds of blankets and bayesian

715
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,080
graphs and things like that but those

716
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,600
are not the only ways to think about

717
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,399
boundaries so just wanted to learn about

718
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,640
what are some other ways of thinking

719
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,000
about

720
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
boundaries cognitive boundaries of

721
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,840
different kinds and

722
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,919
what are you looking for in a boundary

723
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,919
model

724
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,240
not super sure about how to answer so

725
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,880
my understanding is that

726
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,200
markov blankets enter

727
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
into debate

728
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,480
as a sort of

729
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,880
tool to

730
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,640
understand what the boundaries of the

731
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,720
mind are

732
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,360
but there are no other

733
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,080
big alternative if not for something

734
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,159
said by chalmers about action and

735
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,919
perception

736
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,480
intuitive boundaries of the mind

737
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,120
but what i think he had in mind when he

738
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,600
said that was

739
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,279
something like look

740
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,120
our intuitive image of the mind is that

741
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,720
of something that is freeze between

742
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,840
perception and action

743
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,240
something like

744
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,440
we are

745
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,440
intuitively

746
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,880
predisposed to say that something like

747
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,919
the classical cognitive sandwich is true

748
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,480
we encounter reward for perception and

749
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,640
action

750
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,960
and

751
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,600
i'm not really sure whether

752
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
that sort of boundary would be a

753
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,760
boundary in the sense in which markov

754
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,399
blankets

755
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,360
would like to be boundaries or are used

756
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,520
to play the role of a boundary in the

757
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,440
sense of something that

758
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,919
individuates a single system and tells

759
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,440
it apart from anything else

760
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,080
the uh problem

761
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,159
i think for the extended mind and the

762
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,120
need for a boundary

763
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,320
is a need fueled by the strong desire

764
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,440
uh not to say that everything counts as

765
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,960
a cog in the cognitive machinery

766
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,360
why well because if everything counts as

767
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,360
a cognitive cognitive machinery then he

768
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
claimed that pen and paper used to do

769
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,000
more accounts

770
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,960
is not a big claim it doesn't add much

771
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,240
right

772
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,360
in order

773
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,320
to

774
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,120
for a claim well x is part of the

775
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,200
cognitive system to be meaningful to be

776
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,799
impactful

777
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,120
uh there must be things that are not

778
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,279
part of the cognitive system

779
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,159
otherwise i mean you're just claiming

780
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,039
well

781
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,120
there is this thing which is exactly

782
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,479
identical to any other thing

783
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,840
in the paper you uh you were threading

784
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,720
together this question of short and long

785
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,440
term features of cognition like in the

786
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,240
instantaneous action perception

787
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,000
cognitive behavioral time scale and then

788
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,799
the quote in the long run where a lot of

789
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,279
the arguments rest like it reduces

790
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,919
surprise in the long run or on average

791
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,840
in the long run and then you talked

792
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
about like um

793
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,279
jumping into

794
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,159
uh

795
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,240
it would force one to count inordinate

796
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
amount of stuff as a cog in someone's

797
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,080
thinking machinery jumping into ponds of

798
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,919
water while on fire or shooting at a

799
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,519
tiger to avoid becoming the tiger's

800
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,600
dinner both contribute to one's

801
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,080
prolonged occupation of one's phenotypic

802
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,120
states

803
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,279
but neither pawns of water nor guns and

804
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,360
bullets can be properly counted as cogs

805
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,279
in the thinking machinery and i can

806
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,039
totally see how

807
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,159
one type of extended mind perspective

808
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,240
would say like yes the boundaries of the

809
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,519
cognitive system are just so and they're

810
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,440
so flexible that whatever it is in the

811
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,840
situation that enables the cognition to

812
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,519
happen

813
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,440
is the cognitive system

814
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,840
at which point the lines are extremely

815
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,840
blurred with just

816
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,720
the system as it is

817
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,919
it's

818
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,679
like a pan

819
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,440
perspective

820
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,399
and

821
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,600
that

822
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,880
ends up

823
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,200
at least from a bayesian perspective not

824
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,640
being informative

825
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,720
because we no longer reduce our surprise

826
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,640
by learning about anything

827
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,039
and we've sort of deflated cognition

828
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,080
away

829
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,600
so

830
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,919
where does that sit with you is that a

831
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,240
goal like what are we

832
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,480
looking for in delineating cognitive

833
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,880
systems from each other

834
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,279
do we prefer pan-cognitivism do we

835
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,559
prefer

836
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,600
anti-pan cognitivism or do we want

837
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,679
something in between where like humans

838
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,600
are special or linguistic entities are

839
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,000
special

840
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,159
so i think that punk cognitivism should

841
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,360
be avoided

842
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,440
in general if you have punch something

843
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,960
ism

844
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,919
uh you are on bad road traveling down a

845
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,000
bad road because if everything counts as

846
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,120
x

847
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,440
uh there is nothing gained about from

848
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,480
calling things access no one is puzzled

849
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,200
by things in general i think

850
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,360
so that's the first point cognitive

851
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,320
cognitivism should be avoided

852
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,600
uh

853
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,640
what

854
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,360
i think is a designer atom many would

855
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,399
buy

856
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,480
is to have something balanced in between

857
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,919
uh

858
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,600
individualism

859
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,440
and ddd

860
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,679
i think appealing intuition that

861
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,960
sometimes interacting with stuff

862
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,918
at least aids cognition in a very

863
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,918
substantial way

864
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,000
so i think that

865
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,079
go through the zeratum would be to have

866
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,960
a bubble around dd

867
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,599
individual pretty radically understood

868
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,040
many would disagree many would be

869
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,440
comfortable with group vote with group

870
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,280
minds

871
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,079
i think that is a minority view

872
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,839
but maybe they're right i mean

873
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,800
being right or wrong is not a question

874
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,119
it's not a matter of numbers

875
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,679
but still to friendly debates i wouldn't

876
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,719
follow the minority view so i would keep

877
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,960
that option in the

878
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,920
theoretical horizon but not use it

879
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,720
to orient research right now

880
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,800
so what i would do is to have sort of a

881
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,359
bubble around the biological individual

882
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,200
and for the time scale

883
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,320
i think

884
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,320
that

885
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,560
the right thing to do again just to

886
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,760
frame things and get them started

887
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,000
is to focus on short time skills

888
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,839
the

889
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,320
hyper long evolutionary time scale

890
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,680
is not something that

891
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,160
captures our go-to intuitive sense of

892
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,280
cognition

893
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,440
and when you start framing a debate you

894
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,480
start from your go to intuitive native

895
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,480
standpoint

896
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,800
so my sympathy is for short times

897
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,520
for here and now

898
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,200
it's very funny like um

899
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,680
you mentioned you know it's not a vote

900
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,640
a small group of people could be um

901
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,320
correct and a larger group could be

902
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,480
incorrect yet people often think about

903
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,119
voting as group cognition

904
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,200
yet cognition isn't

905
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,839
a vote so that's kind of an interesting

906
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,240
tension there

907
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,680
um

908
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,800
let me ask about section five

909
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,200
so it's is vehicle externalism

910
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,720
conditioned over markov blankets

911
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,960
possible and you said i want to argue

912
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,640
that resorting to markov blankets to

913
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,320
settle the debate over vehicle

914
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,880
externalism leads us to sidestep the

915
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,880
whole debate in a very real sense making

916
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,960
vehicle internalism

917
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,440
vacuously true so

918
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,400
just for like a little context what is

919
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,680
vehicle externalism and internalism like

920
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,760
what is the distinguishing features of

921
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,960
these

922
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,079
uh concepts why are people interested in

923
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,000
this debate and like what does it matter

924
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,280
for talking about cognitive systems

925
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,400
okay so

926
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,000
uh externalism and internalism are

927
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,760
things that pop up everywhere in

928
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,839
philosophy and

929
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,680
here we go to with the vehicle variety

930
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,240
uh which is internally more externalism

931
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,760
about the and the thinking

932
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,839
machinery about the material stuff that

933
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,240
does the thinking say

934
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,720
and the

935
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,880
[Music]

936
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,040
you need to have a boundary in mind to

937
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,839
say internal and external and the go-to

938
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,440
boundary is the scan basically the skin

939
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,240
of the biological individual folks he

940
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,640
understood

941
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,440
internalism would be inside the skin

942
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,359
so cognition

943
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,200
or vehicle internalism is the idea that

944
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
the machinery of thought is inside your

945
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
skin and more precisely inside your

946
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,720
cranium

947
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,000
externalism is that at least some pieces

948
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,040
of that machinery are outside in pen and

949
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,119
paper cell phones whatever you want

950
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,280
but notice here we have an intuitive

951
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,839
boundary which is this game

952
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,759
if you go with mark of blankets

953
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,000
i think you end up called in a dilemma

954
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,079
because

955
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,680
you either

956
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,400
start with some intuitive marker blanket

957
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,720
say at the skin use it to define

958
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,040
internal and external

959
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,680
and then you might discover something

960
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,160
external to that blanket counts as part

961
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,400
of the system

962
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
or you can do what

963
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,520
again yakul power effect did which is

964
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,480
well

965
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,760
first i find the markov blanket of that

966
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,640
thing

967
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,200
the real one the mark of blanket with

968
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,880
the capital m

969
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,839
and then use that blanket to define what

970
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,640
is internal and what is external

971
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,359
and if you do that clearly

972
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,760
everything that matters is internal by

973
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,359
how you have defined internal

974
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,960
which is the one horn on the other hand

975
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,680
you start with the

976
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,960
standard

977
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,280
intuitive distinction between internal

978
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,119
and external

979
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,079
and then try to find a mark of blankets

980
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,079
which is fine but then the mark of

981
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,160
blanket does no longer distinguish

982
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,800
between internal and external

983
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
or

984
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,280
there is a tension there are two senses

985
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,440
of internal and you need to disentangle

986
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,520
the two the intuitive one and the markov

987
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,560
blanket

988
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,560
relative to the real market market one

989
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,320
and that is not what

990
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,400
seems to be going on in the literature

991
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,640
right

992
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,400
so basically that is my problem which is

993
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,800
a purely philosophical problem i think

994
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,119
is a purely philosophical note

995
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,480
but still

996
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,960
my concerns were philosophical

997
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,360
so it counts

998
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,800
[Music]

999
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,960
fair enough um is is that what you were

1000
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,359
referring to when you said um

1001
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,119
i doubt such a redefinition of

1002
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,200
internalism would buy the internalist

1003
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,440
something more than a purely verbal

1004
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,520
victory

1005
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,680
yes that's exactly the point i mean

1006
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,480
the intern the vehicle internalists want

1007
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,400
at the end of the day to say something

1008
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,000
like this

1009
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,359
thinking happens in the brain

1010
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,560
or close to it

1011
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,000
if you go on the markup blanket path uh

1012
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,160
define internal in terms of a markup

1013
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,720
blanket and then discover that the mark

1014
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,040
of black contains the brain but also the

1015
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,200
spinal cord but also my hands but also

1016
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,119
pen and paper but also my cell phone and

1017
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,119
so on and so forth

1018
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,119
you can say well all that stuff is

1019
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,200
internal so internalism is true

1020
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,599
but i mean

1021
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,760
that's a verbal victory

1022
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,200
that is not one what you wanted to say

1023
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,880
at the beginning right

1024
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,280
that is a form of externalism that gets

1025
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,000
passed as internalism because of how you

1026
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,200
have defined your terms

1027
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,839
and notice that even if you go with that

1028
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,319
definition of internalism

1029
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,200
then there would be still say super

1030
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,000
internalists that say no no the real

1031
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,920
internal thing that does the thinking is

1032
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,920
just a brain and

1033
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,240
externalist and journalist or relaxing

1034
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,880
journalist that say no no no it's the

1035
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,440
brain plus other internal stuff within

1036
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,240
that

1037
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,040
markup blanket

1038
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,920
so

1039
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,079
the problem wouldn't be close you would

1040
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,720
still have a clash about

1041
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,880
cerebralis and non-cerebralis if you

1042
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,119
prefer people that thinks that

1043
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,280
it's just the brain or the brain plus

1044
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,040
the spinal cord and

1045
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,839
people that like external stuff

1046
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,960
doing part of the thing

1047
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,800
it makes me think of um

1048
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,079
like a

1049
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,000
thought experiment kind of like a tracer

1050
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,319
so like a radioactive tracer might be

1051
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,160
injected in a blood vessel then you can

1052
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,560
see where it flows or like a um a

1053
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,800
metabolic label might be given to a cell

1054
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,000
and then you can see how it gets

1055
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,880
metabolized so

1056
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,960
the tracer um let's just say we're

1057
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,319
following like we're gonna pluck one of

1058
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,560
the strings and trace the impact of like

1059
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,200
shining light on the retina

1060
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,480
initially

1061
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,319
it follows like

1062
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,319
nervous system paths but then let's say

1063
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,640
that light pattern induces

1064
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,000
the system to pick up that phone and

1065
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,800
reload a website so now that tracer is

1066
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,520
spreading everywhere it's calling

1067
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,599
servers in different parts of the world

1068
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,040
and it's like communicating through

1069
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,280
satellites and it's like that

1070
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,880
perturbation on the retina as

1071
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,560
space and time sort of zoom out it's

1072
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,240
like more and more gets wrapped into

1073
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,800
that and so like what i'm hearing you

1074
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,720
say is if we just say well wherever the

1075
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,079
tracer goes

1076
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,240
that's internalism internalism is the

1077
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,240
total cognitive apparatus including the

1078
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,240
satellite and the server in the other

1079
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,400
country

1080
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,440
or one could like retreat back

1081
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,160
to the epithelial boundary

1082
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,240
and just say like

1083
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,520
it is

1084
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,000
extended once they

1085
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,400
are everything outside of the skin is

1086
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,040
external

1087
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,520
so it's sort of like again no one denies

1088
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,040
that somebody could see something on

1089
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,839
their retina that causes a server

1090
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,240
far away to do something

1091
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,680
but

1092
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,359
where is our implicit or explicit

1093
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,040
boundary

1094
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,560
and will we just

1095
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,640
stay with the epithelium which gives us

1096
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,560
a

1097
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,560
boundary

1098
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,440
but then over different time scales

1099
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,520
clearly different parts of that

1100
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,079
total apparatus matter

1101
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,640
um like over one seconds maybe um

1102
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,760
the the oculomotor cicading

1103
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,240
and the some brain region is involved

1104
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,240
with processing meaning but then over

1105
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,400
hundreds of years

1106
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,400
there might be a more valid discussion

1107
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,520
about how

1108
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,040
it's actually interactions amongst

1109
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,000
people

1110
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,359
and slower

1111
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,880
reading and writing

1112
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,359
of like books or of other resources that

1113
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,200
actually contribute to like the semantic

1114
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,200
discussion and evolution

1115
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,800
um

1116
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,599
so it's it's like infuriating sometimes

1117
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:20,560
because

1118
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,520
again no one's saying that

1119
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,839
what's on the table

1120
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,839
isn't that way

1121
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,760
it's just like what are we really

1122
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,720
looking for in a cognitive theory

1123
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,440
and what are we gaining or what kind of

1124
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,920
value are we adding with these different

1125
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,480
framings

1126
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,640
yeah so

1127
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,839
again to kick thing off i think that i

1128
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,319
would stay close to the

1129
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,720
basic individual i would

1130
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,410
put the go to boundary at the scan

1131
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:56,560
[Music]

1132
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,480
and then

1133
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,440
wait and see how things able from that

1134
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,119
there is an important sense however

1135
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,680
in which ddtdc

1136
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,400
privilege of the scan uh putting the

1137
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,839
boundary there at the scan

1138
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,839
is

1139
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,960
inadequate in the sense that

1140
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,960
really if you look at us from a longer

1141
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,720
perspective

1142
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,760
perhaps as a species

1143
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,319
you notice that

1144
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,319
much on the of defense we do are

1145
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,720
extremely dependent on how our

1146
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,000
environment is our tools

1147
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,920
and our niche

1148
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,040
totally understood

1149
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,079
it's just that due to

1150
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,240
perhaps evolutionary reasons perhaps

1151
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,240
cultural reasons

1152
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,800
we tend to attach minds to

1153
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,400
single bodies

1154
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,599
say

1155
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,079
and we have an expectation one body one

1156
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,319
mind

1157
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,880
once that expectation is in place you

1158
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,280
can discover that the mind extends and

1159
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,200
that pen and paper and yourself on and

1160
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,560
so on and so forth

1161
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,880
really help you think and really should

1162
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,880
be considered part of the machinery that

1163
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,640
does your thinking

1164
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,880
if you don't have that expectation in

1165
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,280
place

1166
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,040
it's very hard to understand what

1167
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,760
the extended mind could be for you

1168
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,319
because there is no boundary relative to

1169
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:33,200
which

1170
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,319
there is an extension

1171
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,400
right

1172
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,880
you can't go farther farther than what

1173
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,920
exactly you just will have the mind

1174
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,640
cognition as it is in the real world

1175
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,880
and once you have that it makes little

1176
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,520
sense to say oh it's extended it might

1177
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,240
be extended relative to the individual

1178
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,760
to the biological body

1179
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,520
but if you don't have expectation that

1180
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,800
the two things go hand in hand

1181
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,400
you don't have the violation of

1182
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,319
expectation when you discover that they

1183
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,640
don't go hand in hand you don't have the

1184
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,480
sense of discovery

1185
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,000
it's just

1186
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,960
nothing strange happening that nothing

1187
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,079
to be

1188
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,480
amazed about nothing requiring anger

1189
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,640
so that's a nice point

1190
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,720
but as a matter of fact we

1191
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,400
have the expectation that minds are

1192
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,480
attached to individuals

1193
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,760
so

1194
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,760
there is a sense of wondering talking

1195
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,760
about the extended mind something that

1196
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,400
strikes us

1197
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,559
of course a lot to

1198
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,160
say there and connect back to like what

1199
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,400
you mentioned about the cultural priors

1200
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,720
um but sort of to

1201
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,640
hinge on the cultural priors and go in a

1202
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,079
slightly different way

1203
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,720
how does this relate to

1204
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,839
computationalism or

1205
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,480
cognition and computers

1206
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,200
not just us using computers to have like

1207
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,640
a human-to-human convo but

1208
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,599
what

1209
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,760
does computationalism

1210
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,480
add in to this discussion or how would

1211
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,559
you relate what you discussed in the

1212
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:17,520
paper

1213
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,839
to computational theories of cognition

1214
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,040
i'm not super sure so

1215
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,880
i think

1216
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,960
i think i think that combination is

1217
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,720
computational but i'm not super sure

1218
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,440
but if asked without any reflection i

1219
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,520
would say yes of course cognition is

1220
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,040
computation

1221
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,200
uh so i think i count as a computation

1222
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,520
i see no big problem in extended

1223
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,960
computations

1224
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,119
in the sense that

1225
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,079
if you think about computation as symbol

1226
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,599
manipulation or manipulation rule-based

1227
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,000
or rule sensitive manipulation of

1228
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,240
certain primitives that might be symbols

1229
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,040
or

1230
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,160
sub symbols or whatever

1231
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,839
clearly you can have root based

1232
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:09,760
manipulation of stuff outside your body

1233
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,319
there is an historical point which

1234
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,400
everyone i think knows that is well

1235
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,800
originally computers were people doing

1236
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,880
the math with pen and paper

1237
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,000
uh before the second world war before dg

1238
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,640
cell computer came about so there is

1239
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,599
nothing intrinsically strange about

1240
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,559
extended computation and computation

1241
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,240
taking place outside your body

1242
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,760
that being said

1243
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,040
it

1244
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,760
is true that most i would say

1245
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,839
computational models focus on the brain

1246
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,599
and that most of cognitive scientists

1247
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,599
think that the really interesting

1248
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,079
computation happens in between the two

1249
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,480
years

1250
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,640
then you have i mean rodney brooks

1251
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,559
which surely is one of the inspirator of

1252
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,720
and

1253
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,319
prime movers of embodied cognition

1254
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:10,480
anti-representational cognitive science

1255
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,200
and and that really has inspired

1256
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,440
extended cognition or at least the

1257
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,640
strand of extended cognition

1258
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,200
his mobiles were entirely computational

1259
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,119
we're finding stage automaton for the

1260
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,359
most part

1261
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,720
so you don't what i would like to say is

1262
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,720
that you don't necessarily have a clash

1263
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,119
in between computation and

1264
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,400
extended embodied cognitive science

1265
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,160
as for

1266
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,040
computational models of wider agent

1267
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,680
environment systems

1268
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,920
i know there are

1269
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,000
on the top of my fingers

1270
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,160
or on the top of my head i

1271
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,160
i don't have any examples

1272
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,760
but

1273
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,680
i can gather them if

1274
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:01,200
i were to remember by my uh by my artist

1275
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,200
but there are such models and i think

1276
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,439
that

1277
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,000
there should be no in-principle problems

1278
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,119
of making a free energy model about

1279
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,680
the agent environment system or even

1280
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,839
extended cognition indeed i think that

1281
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,040
fristen clark kearsev and someone else

1282
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,558
wrote a paper about that

1283
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,119
with a

1284
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,200
quick minimum model

1285
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,599
not sure about the title that i think is

1286
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,160
published on my language if someone

1287
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,879
wants to check

1288
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,000
this kind of uh it cracked me up with

1289
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,559
the the freudian slip with the pluralist

1290
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,160
slip you said at the top of my fingers

1291
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,040
the top of my head and it's like

1292
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,520
aren't those the different worlds though

1293
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,920
and so it's it's just like very

1294
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,559
interesting and it again comes back to

1295
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,079
the um the water we swim in

1296
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:00,079
the cultural priors and biases that

1297
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:01,920
help us like shape whether an idea is

1298
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,319
kind of outside of the overton window

1299
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,880
like rocks can't think versus like

1300
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,880
you're a heretic if you don't think that

1301
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,319
rocks think

1302
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,558
um

1303
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,079
as we sort of

1304
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,040
move towards a little fractal resolution

1305
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,040
of course

1306
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,359
this will probably be a um

1307
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,680
discussion for many years to come so you

1308
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,520
provided a quote from kirchoff and

1309
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,760
kirsten 2019

1310
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,720
um

1311
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,920
i'm not going to read the whole quote

1312
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,400
but it's visible on the stream and

1313
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,920
basically they just mentioned that the

1314
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,079
markov blanket formalism as applied to

1315
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,760
systems that approximate bayesian

1316
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,599
inference or we could even take it one

1317
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,920
more instrumental level to systems that

1318
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,880
we approximate with bayesian inference

1319
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,720
serves as an attractive statistical

1320
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,319
framework

1321
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:49,599
in their case for demarcating the

1322
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,920
boundaries of the mind but um other

1323
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,000
situations as well and then you

1324
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
mentioned like perhaps this is the

1325
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,520
correct way to think about the role

1326
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,280
markov blankets should play in the

1327
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,160
debate over vehicle externalism

1328
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,800
may be asking where can we draw a markov

1329
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,559
blanket around the thinking machinery

1330
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,880
yields more satisfactory results than

1331
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,839
trying to find the mark of the cognitive

1332
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,480
so um

1333
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,800
this is really like a really nice point

1334
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,440
and like what kinds of questions

1335
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,359
help us move forward as we do seek like

1336
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,760
productive but also you useful and

1337
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,440
accessible ways to think about these

1338
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,839
topics

1339
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,000
what sort of question moves forward

1340
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
yeah i have no idea probably

1341
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,040
the only sensible answer is

1342
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,839
ask questions and try to solve them

1343
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:44,960
some will

1344
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,880
and your retrospective you will be able

1345
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,880
to identify the ones that really pushed

1346
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,760
you forward from the ones that were not

1347
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,240
well posed

1348
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,440
so probably

1349
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,000
the only sensible question to which

1350
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,240
uh the only sensible answer is uh wait

1351
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,599
and see

1352
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,200
uh as for

1353
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,680
ddd kiershov and keith steinhortz

1354
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,800
i'm not super

1355
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,359
so

1356
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,200
a big

1357
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,200
problem i had with mark of blankets

1358
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,280
and extended mind is this

1359
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,480
is

1360
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,760
to me at least not super clear

1361
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,720
whether when market blankets are used

1362
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,280
the market blanket is something out

1363
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,599
there in the world

1364
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:36,400
like

1365
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,599
some mathematical entity instantiated

1366
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:40,720
somehow

1367
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,160
in the world

1368
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,240
or whether they are some sort of

1369
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,480
accurate representation of what is going

1370
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,240
on

1371
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,960
or whether they are just

1372
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,680
a mathematical tool to make sense of

1373
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,799
what is going on

1374
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:59,280
it seems to me that

1375
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,640
those three things are used together

1376
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,640
uh when it comes to discussing the

1377
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,440
boundaries of the mind

1378
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,839
but there are three different things i

1379
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,400
mean there are

1380
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,040
three different ideas about what a

1381
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,880
marker blankets are

1382
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,160
and by

1383
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,640
adhering to one coherently you have a

1384
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,480
very different

1385
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,920
outlook

1386
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,799
a

1387
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,960
and a very different

1388
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,200
metaphysics say of the free energy

1389
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,319
principle

1390
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:33,040
if market blankets are things out there

1391
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,839
in the real world

1392
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,319
then it seems that you must take the

1393
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:41,040
free energy story at face value

1394
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,559
you must be

1395
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,799
an hardcore realist about the free

1396
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,119
energy principle

1397
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,079
if they are just a tool you can take the

1398
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:53,200
free energy principle to be just perhaps

1399
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,640
a sort of

1400
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,280
mathematical machinery you can deploy to

1401
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,599
build interesting models

1402
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,240
of phenomena you want to study you can

1403
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,240
try just as you can

1404
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,880
use standard computational theory to

1405
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,200
build models of things you can use the

1406
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,040
free energy principle or you can use

1407
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,200
dynamical system theory you have various

1408
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,759
tools you can deploy

1409
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,399
but

1410
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,400
the

1411
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,680
point is that

1412
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,520
if you go super

1413
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,680
instrumentalist oh that's just a model

1414
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,040
and i do what i

1415
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,960
want with it

1416
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,559
my only guide is not truth but

1417
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,599
pragmatic discoveries and making science

1418
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,839
grow if you take that stance on the free

1419
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:46,240
energy principle

1420
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,920
you're forced not to make strong

1421
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,319
metaphysical claims about d boundaries

1422
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,720
of the minds and how things are you can

1423
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,480
make strong and interesting claims about

1424
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,880
how things are modeled

1425
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,799
but not about how things are on the

1426
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:02,480
other hand if you go super realist

1427
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:04,400
you can make strong claims about how

1428
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,520
things are

1429
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,720
[Music]

1430
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,359
but you also have a very strange

1431
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,839
outlook on reality i think

1432
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:14,079
with these sort of fractal boundaries

1433
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,760
within boundaries

1434
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,160
that are recycled reciprocal and so on

1435
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,720
and so forth

1436
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,480
my

1437
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,480
two cents would be that

1438
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,000
to follow the

1439
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,960
pragmatic non-realist

1440
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,119
usage of the free energy principle to

1441
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,040
take it as a model building

1442
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,880
tool

1443
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,520
uh

1444
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,400
but don't trust me

1445
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:47,440
there are mighty sense and

1446
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,599
i'm not super savvy

1447
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,920
about

1448
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,520
instrumentalism and model

1449
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,319
definitely this

1450
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:01,040
question or tension of instrumentalism

1451
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,720
and realism kind of map and territory

1452
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,599
in mel andrews 20 21 paper and several

1453
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,640
other times we've seen this discussion

1454
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,119
uh arise of course is

1455
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,200
active inference just a statistical

1456
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,119
model that we can apply to action

1457
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,440
cognition perception just like we could

1458
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,280
apply a linear model to height and

1459
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,440
weight but that doesn't make height and

1460
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,839
weight a linear regression so does

1461
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,319
applying the active inference structure

1462
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:29,960
to

1463
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,799
neurobehavioral data

1464
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:35,200
that cannot be taken as positive

1465
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,359
evidence that that system for example is

1466
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:39,839
doing active inference so um that's

1467
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:42,240
definitely a um a point well taken and

1468
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,640
the pragmatic turn

1469
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,280
which is associated in cognitive science

1470
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,079
with

1471
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,960
a movement towards action orientation

1472
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,480
and then there's like this meta

1473
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,960
pragmatic turn in cognitive science

1474
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,240
which is like

1475
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,040
better theories are more useful

1476
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,599
and that actually is um

1477
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,359
in contrast with

1478
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:06,240
what we were speaking about earlier with

1479
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,520
science as

1480
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,720
providing

1481
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,040
explanations predictions

1482
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,799
because the pragmatism actually

1483
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,640
highlights the ability to design and

1484
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,839
control it's like well if i used the

1485
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:19,520
epicycles to

1486
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,000
explain predict design control

1487
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,839
it's useful enough

1488
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,359
and

1489
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:26,400
that

1490
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,400
in a pragmatic world

1491
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,480
would be sufficient but then somebody is

1492
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,319
always coming out of um left field or

1493
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,160
right field or whatever with the

1494
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,839
questions about how things actually are

1495
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,119
in singapore but they're not actually

1496
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,079
moving

1497
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:39,119
um

1498
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,760
in that way

1499
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,400
yeah i perhaps

1500
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,839
do not see the ddd

1501
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,799
any strong clash between pragmatism and

1502
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:53,280
ureadism

1503
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,160
what you definitely have here

1504
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,880
are two say tendencies one to be

1505
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,599
hyperplatonic and say look

1506
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,920
reality is this way

1507
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,319
there is nothing in your data that can

1508
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:08,799
prove me wrong

1509
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:11,119
which

1510
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,079
is

1511
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,480
even even respectable sometimes for a

1512
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,000
certain class of entities like

1513
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,240
mathematical entities

1514
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,799
and the opposite tendency to say

1515
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,720
i don't really care about how things are

1516
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,040
i just care about prediction and control

1517
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,000
and making good science and

1518
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,920
predicting stuff and making discoveries

1519
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,880
i think that a sensible observation is

1520
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,960
that

1521
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,440
typically

1522
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,880
theories and models that

1523
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,160
tends to to make discovery and

1524
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,599
give you good prediction

1525
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:54,559
have a degree of

1526
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,319
accuracy tend to capture something about

1527
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,240
how things are

1528
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,200
i mean

1529
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,799
you cannot

1530
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:04,880
proceed arbitrarily

1531
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,040
in model building and do whatever you

1532
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,319
like

1533
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:10,799
you have some sort of resistance and

1534
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,760
intuitively i'd say that resistance is

1535
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,359
reality

1536
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:16,720
and so even

1537
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,119
going fully pragmatism

1538
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,640
prediction and control only

1539
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:27,200
you get something about reality

1540
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,400
maybe what is lacking is the

1541
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,440
sort of platonic ideal reality that is

1542
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:38,280
super independent about what you know

1543
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,119
but i mean

1544
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,440
that is something you encounter rarely

1545
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,000
and only when you do philosophy

1546
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,599
so if it gets left behind might not be

1547
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,319
the biggest tragedy

1548
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:55,119
of the human intellectual history that's

1549
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:57,680
in this way

1550
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,920
um

1551
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,680
so one thought um is that in active

1552
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,920
inference the way that we think about

1553
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,559
action selection policy selection is as

1554
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:09,839
related to

1555
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:12,640
providing pragmatic value which like

1556
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,160
brings you into alignment with your

1557
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,400
preferences and then epistemic value

1558
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,119
which reduces your uncertainty

1559
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,119
and it's almost like

1560
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:22,720
the utility

1561
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,119
is loaded on the pragmatic side

1562
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:27,839
but of course just narrowly pursuing the

1563
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,839
pragmatic value

1564
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:32,480
ends up leading into a blind corner

1565
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,119
and so it's good to um balance both and

1566
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:36,880
to have like diversity of thought within

1567
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,799
a person within a scientific community

1568
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:41,680
um we don't need to be 100

1569
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,480
convinced um or only on one side of the

1570
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,480
line as individuals or in a

1571
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,680
collaboration

1572
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,799
and then um to connect that to one other

1573
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:52,799
point that you made in the paper so it's

1574
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:55,359
on um

1575
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:56,880
not sure if there's page numbers but

1576
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,000
it's um

1577
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,520
there should be page numbers

1578
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:02,880
but there are

1579
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,520
but there aren't

1580
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,760
so i think it's the

1581
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,880
online version and so without yeah

1582
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,480
yeah exactly

1583
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,280
um

1584
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,039
so you were

1585
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,280
talking about benchmarks that

1586
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,960
adjudicate whether something counts as a

1587
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,440
constituent of the thinking machinery

1588
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,119
and so that's like something we've been

1589
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,440
talking about so then

1590
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,119
uh

1591
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:28,799
you wrote traditionally this benchmark

1592
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:30,640
is provided by the mark of the cognitive

1593
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,079
that one endorses

1594
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:33,039
again relate to what we've been

1595
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,880
discussing that is by what one

1596
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,200
implicitly or explicitly

1597
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,119
takes to be necessary or sufficient to

1598
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,039
make something a genuine contributor to

1599
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:43,119
thinking in the broadest sense

1600
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:46,000
so then i'm thinking about this paper

1601
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,799
so it's a single author paper

1602
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:50,240
however

1603
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,920
you mention like in a footnote like

1604
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,880
this observation and the example are due

1605
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,720
to chris delega

1606
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,160
you mentioned

1607
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,720
in the acknowledgements

1608
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,880
some people's names their citations

1609
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,400
which is of course in science how we

1610
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,960
communicate like attribution of ideas

1611
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,400
and then there's even like a little

1612
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,599
discussion with a reviewer

1613
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,599
and so it's like there's all these

1614
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,200
different

1615
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,280
contributions actually

1616
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,640
to this

1617
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,640
cognitive artifact this epistemic

1618
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,839
artifact

1619
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:28,240
and so um it's like the like you're

1620
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,160
you're supporting the biological

1621
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,119
individual epithelial boundary single

1622
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,440
author paper all these external

1623
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,079
contributors like they can get mentioned

1624
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:41,119
but they're not authors and then um like

1625
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:42,640
if it were going to be written by the

1626
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,799
radical pan-cognitivist

1627
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,280
like why not make everyone an author

1628
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,160
just

1629
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,760
let's have everybody

1630
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,520
as a contributor

1631
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,960
and so just sort of like a funny little

1632
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,799
microcosm there

1633
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:55,520
no

1634
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,039
no one not even the hyper radical would

1635
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:00,880
put everyone as

1636
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,680
an author because no one likes

1637
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,880
the academical suicide no

1638
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,880
i tend to privilege dd individual

1639
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,839
boundary but i mean i am pro extension

1640
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,200
at the end of the day i think i

1641
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,720
mentioned it in the paper that

1642
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:20,240
i am in favor of cognitive extension

1643
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,079
and perhaps because i want cognitive

1644
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,640
extension to be real i favor some

1645
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,039
conservative boundary which is easily

1646
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,319
transfast

1647
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:31,599
this is perhaps more psychoanalysis

1648
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:35,359
about my choices and my preferences

1649
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:38,720
but yes i mean

1650
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:39,760
i'm

1651
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,240
on board with gddr that

1652
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,879
you can have

1653
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,240
cognitive processes that are that run

1654
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,839
through multiple brains

1655
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,359
i'm not super sure what how common they

1656
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:56,240
are

1657
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,839
because even

1658
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,160
unless you do some real extreme

1659
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,038
brainstorm

1660
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:04,400
typically

1661
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,720
the input coming from others is very

1662
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,079
limited

1663
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:09,039
or

1664
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:11,599
not very sizable

1665
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,280
but

1666
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,200
i mean

1667
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,720
there are

1668
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,359
i would say genuinely

1669
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:23,279
multi-brain cognitive processes

1670
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,319
like a conversation

1671
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,440
yeah like very deep conversations

1672
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,520
uh in which at the end of the day you

1673
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,839
agree

1674
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:36,720
you do bring about some

1675
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,760
uh

1676
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,359
well-defined

1677
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:41,680
artifact or output

1678
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,000
just free-floating conversation i

1679
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,599
wouldn't say that is a

1680
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,799
a genuinely extended cognitive process

1681
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:51,920
but

1682
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,599
if you want to know there is a paper by

1683
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:57,920
yelebrarinebug and regina fabre in which

1684
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,039
they take all the

1685
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:03,039
extended mind stuff

1686
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,839
with mind wandering

1687
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:08,799
and that is fascinating because

1688
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:10,799
mind wondering

1689
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,720
is clearly a cognitive process it's

1690
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,880
clearly thought with the capital of t i

1691
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,400
would even say

1692
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,640
uh but isn't

1693
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,920
not something that has a definite output

1694
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,599
there is no

1695
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:26,839
sad endpoint to mind wondering

1696
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:30,079
right and yet they claim they might it

1697
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,760
might extend

1698
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,680
and if you take this sort of no set

1699
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,400
output no set endpoint perspective then

1700
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,839
maybe even converse causal conversation

1701
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:43,359
may qualify

1702
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:44,400
as

1703
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,839
intrapersonal cognitive processes

1704
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,799
but i'm not super sure about

1705
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,880
how one could

1706
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,839
develop that idea

1707
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:56,559
precisely

1708
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:59,359
it it kind of makes me think about um

1709
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,319
in a very transposed analogical way like

1710
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:04,799
to integrated information theory like if

1711
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:07,760
two people are speaking at each other

1712
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,680
but they're both having the conversation

1713
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,079
that they would have with a wall

1714
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:13,839
then it's like they're speaking past

1715
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,599
each other it's not like an emergent

1716
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,399
conversation whereas if people are

1717
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:20,880
engaged in like active listening

1718
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,439
and like actually

1719
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:25,439
integrating some novel stimuli and then

1720
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:26,479
coming up with something they wouldn't

1721
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:28,080
have said to a wall

1722
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,238
then that is like where that that third

1723
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,960
space arises where things can be

1724
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,479
productive but then also that's very

1725
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:37,040
interesting that they might not be and

1726
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,679
one one other note on the mind wandering

1727
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:40,640
is um

1728
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:45,839
as our technology in the niche changes

1729
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,120
with some neural recording

1730
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,040
opportunity

1731
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,399
say just let your mind wander

1732
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,960
and all of a sudden through biofeedback

1733
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,279
or the enabling of new cognitive

1734
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:00,560
linkages

1735
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,880
that mind wandering actually could leave

1736
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,000
a trace

1737
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,479
on the environment in a way where

1738
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:07,920
if it's

1739
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,479
just brain bound it um

1740
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:11,920
wouldn't

1741
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,479
which i think returns us to that earlier

1742
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:16,640
question just like that one

1743
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:21,239
thing i wanted to address about like

1744
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:24,479
composition of cognitive systems so

1745
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:25,600
whether we're

1746
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,719
internalist or externalist or whatever

1747
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:31,040
how do we think about this space of the

1748
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,799
adjacent possible

1749
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,279
for cognitive systems like what can we

1750
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,198
think of next

1751
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:39,359
what can we think of next or how could

1752
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:40,880
we think differently if there were some

1753
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,560
structural changes

1754
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,279
to our environment

1755
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:47,198
like the pen until it existed or the

1756
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:50,319
writing implement until it existed

1757
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,000
wasn't there and there was

1758
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,238
pre-adaptations and evolutionary basis

1759
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:56,560
for utilizing it etc

1760
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,360
but when it was there it

1761
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,320
changed the game in a quantum way so how

1762
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,600
do we think about those kinds of

1763
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,800
transformations of cognition

1764
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,280
i'm super not an expert

1765
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,679
about this topic

1766
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:14,840
and i'm a bit ashamed i guess

1767
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,600
frankly but i

1768
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,840
and i need to catch up

1769
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,000
but i think it is

1770
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,880
probably strongest case study you could

1771
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,679
make for transformation

1772
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:31,280
is with reading and doing math

1773
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,400
we have

1774
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,679
of course busy visual capacities

1775
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:36,960
but reading

1776
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,159
seems to be

1777
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,640
a purely cultural thing

1778
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,280
something that you need culture to to

1779
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,280
learn and something that deeply

1780
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,040
transforms your

1781
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:51,120
cognitive abilities so just

1782
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,199
the ability to

1783
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:00,640
target

1784
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,199
your own thought crystallized in a

1785
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,040
written form

1786
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,920
gives you a level of meta reflection

1787
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,840
that would be

1788
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,320
hard to maintain with your brain alone

1789
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,560
or the ability to crystallize your

1790
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,679
thoughts in a scrap of paper

1791
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:20,239
leave it there

1792
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:23,520
two to ferment and then go back at it

1793
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,679
one week later two weeks later three

1794
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:28,080
weeks later with a fresh mind

1795
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,080
this sort of thing is not something you

1796
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,000
can do without

1797
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,920
externalizing your thought

1798
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:38,159
you can just remember your passports

1799
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:38,880
and

1800
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,199
objectively look at them as you

1801
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:43,280
objectively look at your past four

1802
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,960
written paper

1803
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,360
and the other thing of course is math

1804
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,920
we have some basic familiarity with

1805
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,360
numbers that is biologically endowed

1806
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,280
uh but

1807
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:59,760
pretty much from arithmetic on it is

1808
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,480
all bootstrapped by culture

1809
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,040
and of course here you have the biggest

1810
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,560
transformation

1811
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,000
possible with

1812
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,840
mathematical objects

1813
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,880
uh modeling and all sort of things so

1814
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,520
those would probably be the case studies

1815
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:20,719
to to try and have a sense of what ddd

1816
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:23,520
space of the decent possible mind might

1817
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,679
be

1818
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,840
uh

1819
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,280
and this is pretty

1820
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,800
backward looking

1821
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,960
i'm trying really hard right now to

1822
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,960
think something more forward-looking

1823
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,560
something more

1824
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,360
propositive something more

1825
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,239
hands-on let's build a new mind but i

1826
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:45,920
don't have any idea right now

1827
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,679
um about that

1828
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:50,239
we'll like look back to look forward

1829
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:52,320
it's an it's an interesting idea and

1830
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,320
theme i you know of course wish you luck

1831
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,080
on the forward-looking but when you

1832
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,400
talked about asking questions

1833
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,199
um

1834
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:01,440
it made me write down and subsequently

1835
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,120
remind myself later

1836
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,719
either the question

1837
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,280
will have been asked already

1838
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,159
doesn't mean that it's been

1839
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:10,000
satisfactorily answered

1840
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,760
to anyone or to you but either the

1841
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,600
question has been asked in its

1842
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,840
rhetorical structure

1843
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,480
and then it'd be awesome to point people

1844
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,880
towards a knowledge resource or it's a

1845
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,239
novel question

1846
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:25,520
and novel questions are awesome and then

1847
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,719
looking back it may be possible to know

1848
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:31,600
which of those novel questions led to a

1849
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,719
useful

1850
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:35,679
line of discussion or application

1851
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:36,400
but

1852
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,600
to

1853
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,920
wait before the question

1854
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,000
and say well i only want to ask the best

1855
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,920
question

1856
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,440
it's like

1857
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,719
in a way we

1858
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:49,199
don't know since it's so many steps down

1859
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,199
the road from the question at least one

1860
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:52,239
or two

1861
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:54,800
till we can evaluate

1862
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,480
the impact of the question and so um

1863
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,520
like

1864
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,400
as a hack or a heuristic

1865
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:02,780
um

1866
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:04,159
[Music]

1867
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,199
having

1868
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:06,880
rigorous scholarships so that when the

1869
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,400
questions have been asked we're not

1870
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,040
doing truly redundant work but then also

1871
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,280
like recognizing and raising up new

1872
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,120
questions

1873
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,320
helps

1874
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,520
expand the frontier and the fringe

1875
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,000
and some fraction of those may develop

1876
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,400
into useful avenues and then later on

1877
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,960
people might say well it was obvious

1878
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,719
somebody should have connected

1879
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,560
the sequential database with the

1880
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,040
encryption and with an economic system

1881
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,440
but those things existed long ago

1882
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,199
and it's like looking back that some of

1883
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:38,719
the synthesis

1884
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,440
conceptually or technologically

1885
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,480
um

1886
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:43,679
post hoc

1887
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:46,560
make more sense but again waiting

1888
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,679
and not acting for it to make sense

1889
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:52,560
a priori it's like it

1890
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,719
it doesn't seem like just a 2022 thing

1891
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:56,719
that that's not gonna work that seems to

1892
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:58,880
be like in principle a very challenging

1893
01:14:58,880 --> 01:14:59,760
way

1894
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,520
to expect effective action

1895
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:08,000
yeah i'm not super sure i got the point

1896
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,199
so

1897
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:11,440
uh jdr

1898
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,440
would be this

1899
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,920
that you don't have any sort of

1900
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,239
precognition about where a question will

1901
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:19,199
lead you

1902
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:22,239
you cannot evaluate questions beforehand

1903
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:25,280
before asking them to see oh this person

1904
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,640
right here

1905
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,560
a long way to go it's a good one and

1906
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,159
this other is

1907
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:31,600
waste of time

1908
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,679
right is that the point

1909
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:36,480
yeah even if there was no um yeah we

1910
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,120
shouldn't uh pre-judge

1911
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,120
questions we could easily sort questions

1912
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,800
into those that have already been asked

1913
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,880
and those that have not been asked

1914
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,960
and so to those that have been asked we

1915
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,120
can use scholarship to those that have

1916
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:52,000
been asked we can like recognize novelty

1917
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,960
um

1918
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,159
so even we don't need to finesse that

1919
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:58,480
too much and just to kind of connect

1920
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,719
that however vaguely to your idea of

1921
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:02,880
like looking back

1922
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,400
but then the challenge of looking

1923
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,400
forward in cognitive sciences sometimes

1924
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,120
yeah it's truly a challenge

1925
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,960
but i think it's per

1926
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:16,640
a big challenge for me because i'm

1927
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,960
eloquent to look forward in cognitive

1928
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,600
science if you probably ask people that

1929
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,120
do

1930
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,880
build cognitive architectures and

1931
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,000
cognitive models for a living

1932
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
i think they would be much more

1933
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,320
forward-looking than me

1934
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,120
i mean um you have something you'd like

1935
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,760
to try is a twist on the architecture

1936
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,159
you'd like to put and that is i think

1937
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,640
forward-looking right

1938
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,320
well what is your

1939
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,840
forward looking like

1940
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,400
over whatever time horizon or

1941
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,960
capacity set that makes sense like what

1942
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,280
kinds of questions or experiments or

1943
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,880
research areas

1944
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,199
are you like excited to build on from

1945
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:00,440
this paper

1946
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,679
i'm not super sure where this paper is

1947
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:07,040
headed

1948
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,159
i mean

1949
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:11,360
i'll continue probably to work on

1950
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,600
extended minds

1951
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:14,600
i

1952
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:17,120
still think i'll be working on

1953
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,159
predictive processing in a sort of very

1954
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:23,199
vapid fashion

1955
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:27,760
probably i'll try to merge d2

1956
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,520
in a more positive way probably

1957
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,239
but i'm not super sure probably in

1958
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:36,080
computational terms

1959
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:39,040
but this is super big it's super what i

1960
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,400
want to do

1961
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,600
with my postdoc if i had one

1962
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,679
nice it's not because

1963
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:49,679
a concrete proposal right now

1964
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,840
hypothetical postdocs are the best

1965
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,159
this is the list of wishes what i wish

1966
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:56,640
to do well i wish to do

1967
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,640
yeah probably that's

1968
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,560
that would be one thing and another

1969
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:05,840
thing i'd like to to do is to try and

1970
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,600
say open up and specify the grip

1971
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,480
metaphor you have andy clark

1972
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,440
and

1973
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,679
those other people telling you

1974
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:18,159
what predictive processing slash dp3

1975
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:20,800
energy principle gives you is a grip on

1976
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,840
the affordances that matter

1977
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,560
is

1978
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,520
not super clear what the grip is

1979
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:28,880
apart from

1980
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,520
not stumbling into things and moving

1981
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,080
around appropriately

1982
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,560
the epistemic sort of contact with the

1983
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,679
war

1984
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:41,760
is left i think unanalyzed

1985
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,640
but i have no big idea on how to analyze

1986
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,640
it

1987
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,360
it makes me think about how um words

1988
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:52,880
related to our physical cognition and

1989
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:55,199
describing our interior landscape like

1990
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,400
get a grip

1991
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,320
um you know can you see what i'm

1992
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,159
thinking about or let me sketch it out

1993
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:02,719
for you comprehension means to grasp

1994
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:04,719
with a hand so like there's so many and

1995
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:07,280
of course the whole optimal grip

1996
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:10,159
active inference as getting grip on

1997
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,800
things from a physical perspective like

1998
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,080
as the hand goes for the cup of coffee

1999
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,640
but then okay now we transpose that into

2000
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,840
the cognitive

2001
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,480
space

2002
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,920
and we

2003
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,000
in a conversational way do talk about

2004
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,040
grip

2005
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,800
and then

2006
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,960
here's all of these formalisms that it

2007
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,120
can be hard to get a grip on

2008
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,760
but are they about grip or like what

2009
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,920
would that actually mean that's very

2010
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,920
interesting question

2011
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,000
yeah i mean

2012
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,360
there is

2013
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,239
a way to impact the grip idea in terms

2014
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:50,360
of beijing in france

2015
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:54,159
but that is a bit too internalized for

2016
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:57,199
my likings the idea that perception is a

2017
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:59,760
form of inference that you are inferring

2018
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,239
every time everything

2019
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:04,719
it works in the model domain the model

2020
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:06,719
is infrared

2021
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,080
whether you think itself is inferential

2022
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:13,840
i'm not super sure and i'm

2023
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:16,960
i'm not sold on ddr that's the

2024
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,000
inferential talk

2025
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:23,520
really captures what goes on in most

2026
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,960
instances of cognition

2027
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,360
i mean

2028
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,800
most of our thought is not described

2029
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,760
inferentially when i let my mind go and

2030
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,159
start mind wondering not inferring

2031
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:40,960
things at random i mind wondering

2032
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,800
when i grow an impress i draw an

2033
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,440
influence typically with

2034
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,199
high concentration to one specific topic

2035
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:52,159
and usually dedicated pen and paper

2036
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:54,239
so the inferential talk might not be

2037
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:57,760
optimal but still

2038
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,560
i

2039
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,840
feel the need to do

2040
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,800
to give some sort of epistemic

2041
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,199
connotation to the grip isn't is not

2042
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:11,280
just not stumbling into things and

2043
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,920
moving around quickly and swiftly there

2044
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,000
is some sort of comprehension and

2045
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,600
intelligence and mindfulness into that

2046
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,960
that going with a pure

2047
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,280
good behavior

2048
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:29,639
good behavior of patterns vocabulary

2049
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,800
might not just miss but

2050
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,159
it might even

2051
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:36,400
let you open to the charge of being a

2052
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,960
behaviorist of being

2053
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,080
a philosophical zombie without any inner

2054
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:42,960
life

2055
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,120
and that sort of things we need some

2056
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,600
mentalistic lexicon some epistemically

2057
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,199
charged lexicon

2058
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:50,320
which is not

2059
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:53,120
full dom d card

2060
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,040
and a major challenge would be to

2061
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,840
develop it

2062
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,320
it makes me think about like an ocean

2063
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,400
and the river and then where they meet

2064
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,719
and it's brackish

2065
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:09,840
cognition and pure cognitive the rest

2066
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,080
cognitive and then there's the

2067
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,520
physicalism

2068
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,290
and um

2069
01:22:14,290 --> 01:22:16,320
[Music]

2070
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,760
we have the ability to like be uncertain

2071
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,440
actually and to evaluate and to

2072
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,239
oscillate between different perspectives

2073
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:28,080
or different regimes of attention on

2074
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,920
these different ideas like

2075
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,120
more highlighting the physical

2076
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,040
boundaries of a system more highlighting

2077
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,239
the cognitive

2078
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:36,719
more highlighting the statistical causal

2079
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:38,320
which is where the markov blanket

2080
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:41,120
concept comes from from pearl

2081
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,040
and bayesian causal graphs and those

2082
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,639
causal graphs

2083
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:46,800
the nodes and the edges

2084
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,400
may or may not link to anything that is

2085
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,520
a physical thing or a cognitive thing

2086
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,610
so it's a very um

2087
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:56,800
[Music]

2088
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,280
open and interesting

2089
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,239
area

2090
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:02,080
um

2091
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,360
is there anything else that you like

2092
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:07,920
wanted to just bring up talk about ask

2093
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:11,040
no i don't think

2094
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,440
so i think it's now time to thank you

2095
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,920
for the space the opportunity and the

2096
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,840
wonderful talk

2097
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,719
to thank the dd audience which i not

2098
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:22,480
seen because i can only see you

2099
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,880
apparently from my screen but hi

2100
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,520
audience i hope you enjoyed it

2101
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,719
i hope you

2102
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:31,360
didn't found me too rambling

2103
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,440
if they're listening this far then i

2104
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,280
don't think either of us are too rambly

2105
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,199
for them

2106
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:39,040
oh maybe they are just

2107
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:42,239
doing exercise driving around and want

2108
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:44,960
some steady background

2109
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,480
without killing friends

2110
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:51,280
