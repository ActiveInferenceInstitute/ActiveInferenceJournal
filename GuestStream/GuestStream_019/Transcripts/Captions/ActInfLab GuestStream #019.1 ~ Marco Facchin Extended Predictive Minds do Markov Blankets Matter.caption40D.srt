00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:07,907
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:12,278
Welcome to act in flat
guest stream number 19.1.

3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,782
It's March 25th 2022.

4
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,785
And we are here with Marco fucken

5
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:22,188
and we are going to be discussing
the recent paper.

6
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,458
Extended predictive minds
do mark up blankets matter

7
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,828
so if you're watching live,
please feel free to put

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,099
comments or questions in the live chat
and hopefully we can address them.

9
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,703
And Marco, really appreciate you joining.

10
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,940
Looking forward to hearing about this
paper and your lines of research show

11
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,777
would be awesome to hear an introduction
and take it away.

12
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,513
Okay. Hi everyone.

13
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,515
So I'm not a.

14
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,484
I actually I'm a PhD candidate initially

15
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,755
and deep deeper basically.

16
00:00:56,222 --> 00:01:00,360
Is an attempt to understand
what was going on

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,164
in the active inference literature
with the external listening

18
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,267
journalism debate
from a philosophical perspective.

19
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,770
So why study philosophy?

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,907
For the most part,
I'm not super mathematical savvy

21
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:19,212
and I have basically a background
in embodied extended cognition

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,649
and I stumbled upon the the papers

23
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:26,753
by who year onset and other
and I wanted to understand

24
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,823
what was going on
with the d-mark of blanket tool.

25
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:35,261
And so I wrote a paper about it
due to understand what was going on

26
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,465
and to try to suggest that maybe

27
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:42,302
that much emphasis on Markov
Blanket is a bit misplaced.

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,704
And yes,

29
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,874
that's it for a general introduction
or any deeper, I think.

30
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:51,845
And then Europe

31
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:55,215
for any question or any doubt anything.

32
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,518
OK, cool.

33
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:04,157
So maybe I'll just ask some questions
and we'll just see where it goes.

34
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,927
For somebody who was unfamiliar

35
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:13,233
with extended cognitive processes
or the state of the art,

36
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,803
maybe outside of active inference,
just what is this area?

37
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,941
How are people looking at it outside
of the active inference, fip, angle

38
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,145
and like what is the contemporary state
of that area?

39
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,650
So OK, so the extended cognition stuff

40
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,187
say your fishery is something that

41
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,891
spawned out of pepper by and Chalmers

42
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,160
in the early 2000 physically

43
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,563
and their original idea was

44
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:48,334
as I understand it
at least is this that sometimes at least

45
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,671
you interact with the environment
in a way

46
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:56,209
such that part of cognition happens
in the environment itself.

47
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:00,180
So my go to example
is using pen and paper to do math.

48
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:05,351
When you use pen and paper to do math,
you write down partial results

49
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,354
and that's from a paper is working

50
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:13,226
as a piece of your working memory is just
that is not inside

51
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:18,831
your brain is around you on your desk
or whenever you are doing math.

52
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,802
And so that was basically
the original idea.

53
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,271
And from that

54
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,174
there has been a rich collaboration
with people

55
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,677
like Richard Minnery suggesting that's

56
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,347
actually good.

57
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,951
We should think of extended
cognitive processes

58
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,854
as processes that transform
our cognitive capacities

59
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,023
is not just

60
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,794
more stuff, more memory, more symbols,

61
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,664
but new stuff,
new capacities, new symbols, new

62
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,401
cognitive processes that take place

63
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,938
in the interaction in between the subject
and the environment.

64
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:03,576
So we have that line of research
and then you have a more see

65
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:08,481
and active line of research
that tends to stress the idea.

66
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:12,151
That's basically
all cognition takes place in the world,

67
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:16,256
interacting with affordances
or interacting with

68
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,926
your surrounding environments.

69
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:24,030
But I'm not super expert
on that line of research,

70
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,033
and you extended
mine are a bit more conservative.

71
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:27,800
Yeah.

72
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:32,171
So did
punch line would be this that sometimes

73
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,176
stuff in the external world
really is mostly process

74
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,146
possible, a cog of the machinery
that does your thinking

75
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,416
that is the

76
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,919
clearest and most forceful way

77
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,057
in which I'm able
to do booted off the extended mind.

78
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,762
And of course, sorry, once
you have these ideas on the table,

79
00:04:55,762 --> 00:05:00,233
the question is OK,
but where, when versus it's stuff

80
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,702
is then in, deeper is in.

81
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:07,140
But I don't know
are our cell phones in our

82
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:12,979
all books in your at my left
you might not be able to see it

83
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,516
but there is the library
with a lot of books I read.

84
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,252
Are all those books part of my memory?

85
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,620
Probably not.

86
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,856
But you need some sort of boundary

87
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,492
and vestigial form of block of course.

88
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,062
So leave it like this.

89
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,066
Well, I like this
how you said it was like a cog

90
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,567
and it's kind of like cognition.

91
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:38,438
So it's right there in word, even though
that's a little bit of a wordplay

92
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,142
and also very interesting
about the more difference.

93
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:47,046
Like we're not just augmenting
the computer with a bigger hard drive

94
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,382
or more ram. It truly can be difference.

95
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,385
And so I think maybe
we could return to this idea of like,

96
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:56,556
what is the space of the adjacent
possible for cognitive systems,

97
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,759
especially if they compose
in these nonlinear ways?

98
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,395
But could you maybe

99
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:06,866
walk us through
some of the pieces of the paper?

100
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,236
Like what
brought you to the introduction?

101
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:14,006
What brought you to writing this paper
on markup?

102
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,977
Like it's and then what did you sort of
weave together in the introduction?

103
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,645
How did you clash them in the middle?

104
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,548
And then
where did you leave us at the end?

105
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,252
So did you walk through to the paper
as something

106
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:30,323
not separate from being able
to do satisfactory at least?

107
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,794
So first step

108
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,064
was to what motivated me.

109
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,868
It was to try and figure out
what was going on between Andy

110
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,203
Clark Yakub, who we Ramstad

111
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:46,773
and Mark of Black.

112
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:51,043
So cause and what I wanted to argue
basically

113
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,080
was something like this

114
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,482
that even if you set aside

115
00:06:56,482 --> 00:07:01,421
you works by remembering a book
and others or men are in the alerts that

116
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,056
tend to give you

117
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:07,960
this sort of message
like we have a perfectly fine

118
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,163
mathematical concept of markup blankets

119
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:15,368
and then a strange concept of reason
blankets that is a big mathematical

120
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,938
and a bit too logical
and you're not really sure what it is,

121
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:23,009
even if you live this sort of war
inside the

122
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:27,246
what I wanted to say is that he way in
which mock of blankets are used

123
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,884
for when it comes
to discussing the extent of mind stuff

124
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,755
that is very limited
to the specific application.

125
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:39,392
But for the extended mind,
the usage of markup blankets

126
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,696
is not really useful,

127
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:48,234
doesn't mean nothing of particular volume

128
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,737
and tends to give a big headache

129
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:55,241
to people that are not into acting.

130
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,110
And so I would recommend not using them

131
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,481
as the main arguments

132
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,252
I think there is no main artifact of

133
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,554
I think I have three arguments

134
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,792
that are well, first

135
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,029
in order to find the markup blankets,

136
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,733
it seems that
you must already know what is inside

137
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,539
if you think about a graph,

138
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,810
there is no way in which
I can give you a graph and,

139
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,747
and just ask you, OK, please show me
where is the mark of blankets

140
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:39,585
that I need to tell you of about
which node

141
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,322
I'm interested in right

142
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,758
so you must already know
what is an aside.

143
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,694
And when it comes to mind,

144
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:52,164
cognitive machinery,
knowing what is inside me is knowing

145
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,700
which are

146
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,104
which presumably to bring,

147
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:01,841
plus maybe stuff and environment,
then be around whatever

148
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,944
and if you already know that,

149
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:09,282
which you must already know in order
to find the relevant mark blankets

150
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,551
that intuitively

151
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,186
you already
know whether the mind extends or not,

152
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,990
and if you already know
whether it mind extends or not,

153
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,726
you know whether it makes sense or not.

154
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,195
Very simple you you piece is

155
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,132
known your piece of information
to be gained

156
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,802
by thinking about whether mind extend
or not in terms of mark or block.

157
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,371
And that is the key force
the first argument,

158
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,174
the second one which is a bit messy.

159
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,810
Can I just pause there
and make a comment on the first one?

160
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,614
OK, awesome. So

161
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,716
though the mark of blanket,

162
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,985
if only it were like
the blankets on our bed

163
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,920
and you could pick it up
and it was a blanket,

164
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,091
whether it was inside the box
or around the box or whatever that's not

165
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,227
really how they are defined.

166
00:09:55,561 --> 00:10:00,066
It's really like a code partitioning
of internal and external states

167
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,970
with respect to a blanket or a blanket
with respect to some other internal

168
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,870
and external states.

169
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,274
So the blanket states
are the ones that make two other sets

170
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,876
of states, internal and external,
conditionally independent.

171
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,982
And so it's not that a node can be
even in a purely statistical sense.

172
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,651
So without getting into the whole,
what do they physically map onto?

173
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,822
A given node is not like a blanket state
or an internal state.

174
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:27,126
It's a blanket state with respect
to some other states because it's part

175
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,129
of this partitioning that's co
instantiated at the same moment.

176
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,299
So it's an excellent point where

177
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,267
if you know what your system of interests

178
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:39,071
internal states are,
then you can talk about

179
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:42,208
what states blanket them
with respect to some other states.

180
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:46,012
But if the question
is about the extended mind

181
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:51,517
and what are the internal states of mind,
then there's kind of this catch 22

182
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:55,388
cat in the hat scenario where if you knew

183
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,624
where to even focus,

184
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,928
you would have already sort
of addressed the question upfront.

185
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,563
Just to sort of unpack that

186
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,599
and connect it to some of the other
ways we've talked about it.

187
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,235
Yeah, that's agreed.

188
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,436
I'm talking

189
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,307
the key word

190
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,210
you said and that I forgot to set

191
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,614
is the system you're interested in

192
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,051
why I wanted you
to focus on this right now

193
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:28,654
because deep extended mind stuff

194
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,691
is supposed to be hyper realistic.

195
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,561
Dude is not that.

196
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,297
I mean we can treat pen and paper as if

197
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,966
they were a form of external memory

198
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,137
that is something you can do

199
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,940
but is not a claim that interests me.

200
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,975
Clark Minnery.

201
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,745
The claim is that that it interests me.

202
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:53,979
Clark, I'm sorry.

203
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:57,116
Is that pen and paper really are

204
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:01,020
with the capital r e on of our

205
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,858
we are a piece of memory
in the external war, right?

206
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,794
They are memory in the same sense
in which

207
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,765
parts of your neural activation or

208
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:14,934
memory system

209
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:19,038
or memory that is your relevant claim.

210
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:23,309
So there is nothing observer dependent

211
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,611
or interest dependent is

212
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,549
really a part of core metaphysics about
how do you ward

213
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,385
actually is independently
about what you know about it.

214
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,455
So that's the point

215
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,724
that I should probably have made sooner.

216
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,128
Well, you made it in the paper
with the direction

217
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,364
of identification
runs from target variables to mark blank.

218
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,466
It's not the other way around.

219
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,236
So yeah. Great. Yeah.

220
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,304
So that's the first argument.

221
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,741
The second one is very modern
and also very

222
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,012
dependent on the how the eaters

223
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:03,549
were on the extended mind
and mark of blanket develop.

224
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:08,521
But the point is basically this

225
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:13,192
that from the very beginning
that would be probably who

226
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:18,297
weighs 2016 people,
the self evidencing brain, the

227
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:20,633
D message.

228
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,203
Look, there are many possible blankets

229
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:28,541
and we have somehow to choose one
that sort of message

230
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:33,245
get got through d d searcher
and doing which Yahoo!

231
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:36,148
Who we and others try to

232
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:42,121
single out these super special blankets
among the many possible ways

233
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,558
to look at south of it
dancing in the long run

234
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,060
about

235
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,462
keeping your

236
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,832
keeping yourself close to your set

237
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,035
point in the long run

238
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,704
and their idea as I understood it

239
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,242
was to say that
while the machinery of the mind

240
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:07,947
is identical to the machinery
that keeps your self

241
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,182
near your set point in the long run

242
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,853
and that sounds persuasive

243
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,021
from a free energy principle perspective,

244
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,892
but is not super earthly.

245
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:24,563
You're not very into the free energy
principle because there is a lot of stuff

246
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:28,801
that keep us alive
and kicking in the long run our liver,

247
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:33,272
our guts, our kidneys
and pretty much function.

248
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:38,510
None of those organs does
thinking in and intelligible sense.

249
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:43,048
And so did you already hear that?

250
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,652
Probably is never actually stated in
the paper

251
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,955
is that we are confusing

252
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,625
cognizant in some broad

253
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:56,462
and fuzzy sense with staying alive

254
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:59,832
I mean, I've nothing

255
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:04,103
against the claim that living things
tend to be organized work

256
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:08,641
tend to behave intelligent plant
do behave intelligently

257
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:12,511
even if there is
nobody says behave intelligently.

258
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:17,549
But I'm not so sure
about equating the two.

259
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,320
And that would be probably
my second point.

260
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,490
OK, let's.

261
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,393
Stay on this
because that's also a great point. So

262
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:32,898
if not one in the same as staying alive,

263
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:37,303
what other perspectives on cognition
might there be like?

264
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,472
What is thinking
other than staying alive?

265
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:44,310
Or what is it that, for example,
the neurons in the glia are doing

266
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,846
that the cartilage
in the knee is not doing

267
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:49,581
well?

268
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:53,319
Pretty much such a processing information
would be a distant dancer.

269
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,921
You take DNA

270
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:59,425
or at least sensory information.

271
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,894
So that

272
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,229
that's the question
I'm struggling with right now.

273
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,867
And my sense would be this,

274
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,704
that we have a big problem because

275
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:16,008
not because we don't have
a definition of cognition,

276
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,211
but because we have to manage
this edition of cognition.

277
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:24,583
We have too many research programs
telling us what cognition is.

278
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,118
So you have

279
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,221
classic cognitive science.

280
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,456
What is the connection?

281
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:35,661
Well, simple manipulation when you go
with the connection is what is cognition?

282
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,830
Well, that transformation,

283
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,700
some symbolic computation,
then you have an act to this.

284
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,702
What is cognition?

285
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,905
MM says meeting

286
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:50,342
autonomy, ERG, ecological psychologist.

287
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,045
What is cognition?
Well, interacting skill

288
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,080
we have affordances
and so on and so forth.

289
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,650
And my big problem is that

290
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,221
no one here is clearly wrong.

291
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,290
No one is obviously dead wrong.

292
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,227
And that thing
clearly cannot be conditioned

293
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,598
and so what I think I would

294
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:16,602
suggest is a sort of pluralism
about cognition.

295
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:21,273
Ignition is not a single thing,
is not like dancing what is dancing?

296
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,741
Well, moving your arms.

297
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,411
Yes, sometimes, but sometimes dancing

298
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:29,281
might even be seen
still in a certain piece of art.

299
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,618
There might be some regimented

300
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:35,888
still as a part of dance,

301
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,990
and that would be the knowledge.

302
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,492
So something that gets done

303
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,862
in a variety of ways,

304
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,664
none of which

305
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:50,035
prima fashion
seems to apply to kidneys, livers, flows,

306
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,305
and that sort of things.

307
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:57,076
If I can layer if I know one more sort of

308
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,813
and or there's the

309
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:06,185
experience and the phenomenology of us
as ourselves and as people.

310
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:10,622
And then there's sort of the behaviorism
or at the very least

311
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,193
animal behavioral sciences
or just behavioral studies in general,

312
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,296
which is like from the outside
looking at a system.

313
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:21,900
And so there's this gap between like us

314
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,771
doing the thinking about cognition

315
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,241
and the experience of that,
thinking about cognition,

316
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:33,512
and then the question about
recognizing cognition in other people,

317
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,281
in children, in non-humans, et cetera.

318
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,384
And so like, I really like that
how you like there's the symbol,

319
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,521
the sub symbolic and active
and then no one disagrees.

320
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,257
No one is saying that bacteria
make bad decisions.

321
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,192
On the whole. They're here, aren't they?

322
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:51,563
And no one's saying like a tree doesn't
have a metabolic coupling with a fungus,

323
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:55,100
and no one's saying that
the fungus doesn't diffuse signals.

324
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:59,037
But then the aspects of these systems

325
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:04,076
that people focus their regime
of attention on and where they choose

326
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,346
to start their talks
and what they decide to talk about

327
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:11,850
and what experiments
they design, that frames the discussion

328
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,887
about cognition.

329
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,056
That's a wonderful way to put it.

330
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,492
And I'm a bit sad

331
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,897
because the paper about cognition
has already been submitted

332
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,933
if I hadn't submitted it already,

333
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:33,005
I would have stolen the framing part
because it's wonderfully set up.

334
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,008
That said, yeah, so

335
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,178
there are two things
I'd like to say about that.

336
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,548
So the first lining is
no one really disagrees.

337
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:47,186
I'm not sure I think that
there is some genuine disagreement.

338
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:51,423
So hard core ecological psychologists,

339
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:53,926
I believe

340
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,229
and feel free to correct me
if there are any

341
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,699
ecological psychologists really think
that clinician is interacting.

342
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,302
We have affordances, full stop

343
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:07,940
and that there is no simple manipulation
going on in the background.

344
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:12,544
And I do classic cognitive ist.

345
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,547
I think redesigning that, recognizing

346
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,817
just these manipulate,
manipulating symbols in the background.

347
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,819
So there are genuine disagreements

348
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,357
if what I'm

349
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,127
not super sure about

350
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,564
is whether those disagreements

351
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,902
are solvable in the sense

352
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,906
that you can provide a master argument
or even master experiments

353
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,911
from which you can just read off
or the ecological psychologist

354
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,981
was wrong all along the Disney
classic community.

355
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,917
This was right

356
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,186
I think that the best we can

357
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:59,157
do is accept some form of pluralism
about what cognition is.

358
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:03,962
And perhaps but I'm not super sure
we might have to accept that

359
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:08,500
there may be things
that are neither determinedly cognitive

360
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,436
or determinately, not cognitive

361
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:13,639
I mean,

362
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:18,210
plants
do behave to cope with their environment.

363
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,311
Well,

364
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:24,816
I'm not entirely comfortable about saying
that there are cooking risers

365
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:28,253
in the exact same sense
in which I am actually nicer.

366
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:33,725
Maybe it's just because their behavior is
or is not always compared to mine.

367
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:37,829
Maybe it's because they have certain
core cultural prejudices,

368
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,566
which I mean, they exist and the

369
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,772
core calling something recognizer.

370
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,274
Yes, influenced by your prejudices.

371
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:53,512
You go back to the early analytic
philosopher,

372
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,848
know what boats
animals think and knowledge.

373
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,985
They know that someone

374
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,321
for someone to have that position. So

375
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:04,890
so there is that.

376
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,993
But it's not super photons

377
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,030
but the big message would probably be
this foot center.

378
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,666
There might be something

379
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,736
something of a gray area

380
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:23,375
between thinking with symbols,
truly cognitive and being a rock earlier,

381
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:27,512
not coming to the sort of degree area
in which you have intelligence,

382
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,881
coping with the environment,
coping with the environment.

383
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:33,552
Well, adaptability, flexibility,

384
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,055
but still

385
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,559
not be really sure about
whether there is some cognition

386
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,495
with the capital C going off

387
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,365
and just the first thing.

388
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,434
Then you also mentioned
folly about consciousness, but

389
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,205
I'm very scared about that stuff.

390
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,042
OK, so

391
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:00,946
another interesting piece
as evidenced by the the

392
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,850
thing about what to say carefully,
don't want to say

393
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,152
that it's a lane
we could veer off into, but.

394
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:12,290
Right, that is a more purely
philosophical discussion, whereas

395
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:17,863
neurobehavioral studies and cognitive
science frames itself as science.

396
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:23,268
And in science usually
we think about like unique explanations,

397
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:28,306
predictions, the ability to design
and control and perturb systems.

398
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:34,045
So is this science?

399
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,547
What kind of science?

400
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:40,719
What are we looking for here
in a cognitive model?

401
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:45,690
And how do we resolve or accommodate
this tension between like unique

402
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,661
explanations and predictions,
which is the bedrock of one type

403
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,764
of science with the call for pluralism

404
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,200
that you just made.

405
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,842
I think that the answer here is

406
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,844
do not

407
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:10,081
in the sense that the call for pluralism

408
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,518
is not a very

409
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,086
not a cool

410
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,089
cognitive science is splintered.

411
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:22,360
You have everyone
doing its own thing in its own lab.

412
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,964
There is cooperation

413
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:26,565
in this sense.

414
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:27,599
That's

415
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:31,236
I mean,

416
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,807
did you various research
groups are not entirely

417
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:39,778
isolated is not the case
that people working on neuro neurons

418
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:43,648
know nothing about connections
or classical

419
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,918
or computational
is more with a very subtle communication.

420
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:52,257
But on the face of it, what I see
as a philosopher looking at science,

421
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,793
it is a splinter room

422
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,096
of cognitive science

423
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,932
enterprise in a variety of groups,

424
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,604
each with its own peculiar research
tradition.

425
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,641
And I think that that is basically fine.

426
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:15,213
But if no one has a strong call

427
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:18,350
or a strong argument
or a strong model, that's

428
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,853
does what Newton did for

429
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:25,724
physics and unifies
everything under a single banner.

430
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,293
Plurality is fine.

431
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,229
So there is

432
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:34,900
no call is more or something like, Well,
that's reality.

433
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,002
Let's try to light.

434
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,739
I'm on board with that.

435
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:45,110
But with this banner,
what shape would it be

436
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,947
or how would we know it when we saw it?

437
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,753
I have no clue.

438
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,255
We probably just

439
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:00,859
would just know it when we saw it
in the sense that we would see

440
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,228
a research tradition start into

441
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,232
absorb

442
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,901
all others

443
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:15,540
we would probably see people
trying to demonstrate us

444
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,977
that there is a real
and significant equivalence

445
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,980
between our

446
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,015
powerful research tradition,

447
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:27,319
uniform research tradition,
and all the others,

448
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:31,623
and probably
the winning research tradition.

449
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,225
The one that really got
cognition, really got thinking,

450
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,095
would be able to make

451
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,832
some novel prediction that

452
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,501
no one else was able to meet.

453
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:46,805
And that would be probably
a strong marker that

454
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:49,841
that's the way to go.

455
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,978
If the implicit question is, do

456
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:57,782
I think that the free energy principle
is that sort of research tradition?

457
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,820
I'm not sure it's a

458
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:07,659
and my answer

459
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:11,396
would probably be qualified. No,

460
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:15,333
because we do not have right now

461
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:19,137
proof that is unifying as it wants to be.

462
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:22,340
It makes big unifying claims

463
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,444
and it might be good in the sense

464
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:30,348
that they may fall circle operation
at the very least.

465
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,985
So you have at least
a pragmatic advantage

466
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,689
whether it succeed in unifying

467
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:42,827
and it wants to
unify is still an open question.

468
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:48,566
And absolutely appropriate thing to do
is to, for me

469
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:52,804
at least, to wait and see for others
perhaps since, to pick up your tools

470
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:56,675
and try to unify it and show it,
I think really is your right thing or

471
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,679
just argue
against even negative arguments.

472
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,647
Are you right?

473
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,617
Non-action is an action

474
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:11,156
that's true in world knowledge traditions
and also in Bayesian statistics.

475
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:14,759
Like it can be useful to wait
to gather more information

476
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,630
I wanted to return to what you said
earlier

477
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,232
about you need some boundaries

478
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,637
and a lot of this discussion, of course,
it's like extended.

479
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:31,576
How extended, what is extending
and what are we looking for

480
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:36,314
with a boundary model
in the FSP and active world?

481
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:40,552
Certainly we talk a lot about different
kinds of blankets and Bayesian graphs

482
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,055
and things like that, but those are not
the only ways to think about boundaries.

483
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,458
So just wanted to learn about

484
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,094
what are some other ways
of thinking about

485
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,931
boundaries,
cognitive boundaries of different kinds

486
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:56,401
and what are you looking
for in a boundary model?

487
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:02,474
Not sure about how to answer. So

488
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:07,846
my understanding is that Markov blankets

489
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,615
enter into debates

490
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:15,019
as a sort of tool to wonder,
finally understand

491
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,422
what the boundaries of demand are

492
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:23,161
but our or no order
big alternative is not.

493
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:27,031
First, something started by Chalmers
about action and perception

494
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,502
in treaties, boundaries of the mind.

495
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:34,072
But what I think he had in mind
when I said that was

496
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,308
something like, No,

497
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:42,447
our intuitive image of your mind
is that of something that is please

498
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,216
between perception and action.

499
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:50,889
Something like we are intuitively

500
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:54,959
predisposed to set that something like

501
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:59,430
the classical cognitive sandwiches
we encounter in work,

502
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:02,100
the reception and action

503
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,002
and so

504
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,605
I'm not really sure whether

505
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:12,477
that sort of boundary would be a boundary
in the sense in which a block gets

506
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,214
would like to be boundaries.

507
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:20,418
Or are you just to play the role
of a boundary in the sense of something

508
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,421
that's individual, it's a single system

509
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,557
and tells it apart from anything else,

510
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:31,863
the problem,
I think for the extended mind

511
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,332
and the need for a boundary

512
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,969
is a need fueled by the strongest ire.

513
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:41,940
Not to say that everything counts
as a cog

514
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,776
in the cognitive machinery.

515
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:49,013
Why? Well, because if everything counts
as a cognitive cognitive machinery,

516
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,150
then we claim
that pen and paper used to do most counts

517
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,053
is not a big play.

518
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,388
It doesn't add much rights

519
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:01,059
in order to or a claim.

520
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:05,430
Well, it is part of the cognitive system
to be meaningful to being.

521
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:10,768
So there must be things that are not part
of the cognitive system.

522
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,439
Otherwise,
I mean, you are just claiming, well,

523
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:18,543
there is this thing which is exactly
identical to any other thing,

524
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,046
not suffering form.

525
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,381
In the paper.

526
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,417
You you were threading together

527
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:30,889
this question of short
and long term features of cognition,

528
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,758
like in the instantaneous action
perception,

529
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,595
cognitive behavioral timescale,
and then the quote in the long run

530
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:41,366
where a lot of the arguments
rest like it reduces

531
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,702
surprise in the long run,
or on average in the long run.

532
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,839
And then you talked about like

533
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,941
jumping into it,

534
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,011
it would force one to carry
an inordinate amount of stuff

535
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:56,414
as a cog in someone's thinking machinery,
jumping into ponds of water

536
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,884
while on fire or shooting at a tiger
to avoid becoming the tiger spinner.

537
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:04,555
Both contribute to one's prolonged
occupation of one's phenotypic states,

538
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:07,725
but neither ponds of water
nor guns and bullets

539
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,428
can be properly counted as cogs
in the thinking machinery.

540
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,831
And I can totally see how one type

541
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,935
of extended
mind perspective would say like,

542
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:20,838
yes, the boundaries
of the cognitive system are just so

543
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,340
and they're so flexible

544
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,344
that whatever it is in the situation
that enables the cognition to happen

545
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,614
is the cognitive system

546
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,452
at which point
the lines are extremely blurred.

547
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,388
With just the system as it is,

548
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,692
it's like a pan.

549
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:46,230
Cognitive is two perspective,
and that ends up,

550
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:50,268
at least from a Bayesian perspective,
not being informative

551
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:54,205
because we no longer reduce our surprise
by learning about anything

552
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,508
and we've sort of deflated
cognition away.

553
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,945
So where does that sit with you?

554
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,380
Is that a goal?

555
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,951
Like what are we looking for
in delineating cognitive systems

556
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,386
from each other?

557
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,989
Do we prefer pain, cognitive ism

558
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:15,994
do we prefer anti pain cognitive ism,
or do we want something

559
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:20,131
in between where like humans are special
or linguistic entities or special.

560
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,568
So I think

561
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:28,039
that cognitive is
and should be avoided in general.

562
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,807
If you have punished something as a

563
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,344
your own bed road,

564
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,414
probably done a better role
because if everything counters X,

565
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:40,718
there is nothing gained
about from calling things X's.

566
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,788
No one is puzzled by things in general.

567
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:44,989
I think.

568
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,492
So that's the first point Corgan found.

569
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,660
Cognitive dissonance should be avoided

570
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,832
what I think is a disease are awesome

571
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:58,302
and it would be nice
to have something balanced

572
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,737
in between

573
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,942
individualism and dignity.

574
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:10,214
I think a feeling, intuition
that sometimes interacting with stuff,

575
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:14,986
at least AIDS cognition
in a very substantial way.

576
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,522
So I think that

577
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,325
go through desiderata
would be to have a bubble around

578
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,630
individual pre theoretically understood

579
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,201
many would disagree,

580
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,971
many would be comfortable
with group voting and with group lines.

581
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,408
I think that is a minority view.

582
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,411
But maybe they're right. I mean the

583
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:44,882
being right or wrong is not a question.

584
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:48,619
It's not a matter of numbers
but still to friendly.

585
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:53,491
I wouldn't follow the minority in
so I would keep that option

586
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:57,462
in the theoretical horizon but not use it

587
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,731
to orient to research right now.

588
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:03,734
So what I would do
is to have sort of a bubble around

589
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:06,771
biological individuals and 40 timescale.

590
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:10,108
I think that

591
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,076
the right thing to do again

592
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:15,246
just to frame things and get them started

593
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,082
is to focus on short timescales.

594
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:24,422
We hyper long evolutionary time scale

595
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,061
is not something

596
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:34,699
that captures our go
to intuitive sense of cognition.

597
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,603
And when you start creating a debate,
you start from more

598
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,372
go to intuitive negative standpoint,

599
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,612
so my sympathy is for short timescale

600
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,981
for here and now.

601
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:51,949
It's very

602
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:55,119
funny like you mentioned, you know, it's
not a vote.

603
00:35:55,686 --> 00:36:00,691
A small group of people could be correct
and a larger group could be incorrect.

604
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,262
Yet people often
think about voting as group cognition,

605
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,665
yet cognition isn't a vote.

606
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,468
So that's kind of an interesting tension
there

607
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,207
let me ask about Section five.

608
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:20,344
So it's is vehicle
external ism conditioned over market

609
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,746
like it's possible

610
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:24,582
and you said, I want to argue that
resorting to Markel blankets

611
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:28,519
to settle the debate over
vehicle external ism leads us to sidestep

612
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,521
the whole debate in a very real sense.

613
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,890
Making vehicle internal ism.

614
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,592
Vacuously true.

615
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:39,964
So just for like a little context,
what is vehicle external ism?

616
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:44,202
An internal ism like what
is the distinguishing features of these

617
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,170
concepts?

618
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,973
Why are people interested in this debate?

619
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,809
And like what does it matter
for talking about cognitive systems?

620
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,613
OK, so externally

621
00:36:55,613 --> 00:37:00,418
ism and journalism are things
that happen everywhere in philosophy

622
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:04,455
and here we go to with vehicle variety,

623
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,227
which is internally the more externally
ism about the cost

624
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,964
and the thinking machinery
about the material stuff that doesn't sit

625
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:18,869
and you
you need to have a boundary in mind

626
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:22,873
to say internal and external
and the go to boundaries

627
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:26,577
just get basically the key
and often need biological

628
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,846
individual folks interested

629
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,984
in journalism would be inside the skin.

630
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:38,256
So cognition journalism or journalism
is that the machinery of thought

631
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,692
which is inside your skin
or more precisely inside your cranium

632
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,031
externally that means at least
some sense of that machinery

633
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:51,135
are outside in pen and paper
or cell phones, whatever you want

634
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,071
but notice

635
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:56,774
here we have an intuitive boundary
which is distinct

636
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:01,812
if you always mark of blankets

637
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,050
I think you end up in a dilemma

638
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:08,886
because

639
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,622
you either

640
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,692
start with some intuitive mark up
blankets, see,

641
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:18,195
and the skin use it
to define internal and external

642
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,333
and then you might disfigured forward
or something external

643
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:25,002
to that blanket counts
as part of the system

644
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,773
or you can do what again

645
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,909
natural power thing did, which is well,

646
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,846
first
I find the mark of a blanket of dots.

647
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:40,151
Then you do your real one,
the mark of blanket with the capital M,

648
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,654
and then use that blanket to define

649
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,690
what is internal and what is external

650
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:49,427
and if you do that, clearly

651
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:53,397
everything that matters is internal
by how you have defined internal

652
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,102
which is do you want more?

653
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,271
On the other hand, you start with the

654
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,841
standard intuitive

655
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,077
distinction
between internal and external,

656
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:12,049
and then try to find a mark of blanket,
which is fine, but then you mark

657
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:15,453
a blanket does no longer distinguish
between internal

658
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,856
and external or

659
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,291
there is a tension.

660
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:24,595
There are two senses of internal
and you need to disentangle the intuitive

661
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:29,066
one and DeMarco blanket
relative to the real mark of microphones.

662
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,437
And that is not what seems to be going on

663
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:36,207
in the literature right

664
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:38,542
so basically

665
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,012
that is my problem,
which is a dual philosophical approach,

666
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:45,816
I think is a purely philosophical,
not still

667
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,452
my concerns were philosophical.

668
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,955
So it got

669
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,058
fair enough.

670
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,527
Is that what you were referring to
when you said,

671
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:00,164
I doubt such a redefinition of internal
ism would

672
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:04,101
by the internal assert something more
than a purely verbal victory?

673
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:07,538
Yes, that's exactly the point.

674
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:08,372
I mean,

675
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:12,042
the internal the vehicle internal is one

676
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:15,079
at the end of the day
to say something like this,

677
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,783
thinking happens in debate

678
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,619
or close to it.

679
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:26,690
If you go on, DeMarco
Blanket Boss is defined

680
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:31,295
internally in terms of a Michael Blanket
and then discover that DeMarco Block

681
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:34,765
contains key brain, but
also the spinal cord, but also my hands,

682
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:38,002
but also Cannon pepper bottles myself
and so on and so forth.

683
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,473
You can say, well, all that stuff is
internal, also internal.

684
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,341
This is true.

685
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:46,811
But I mean,

686
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:49,814
that's a verb for victory.

687
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:54,385
That is not one what you wanted
to see at the beginning, right?

688
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,655
That is a form of external ism
that gets passed,

689
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:01,292
as in journalism, because of how
you have defined your terms

690
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,628
and noticed that

691
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:09,300
even if you go with that definition
of internal ism, then there would be

692
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,370
still the super internal lists
that say No, no, no.

693
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,740
The real internal thing that does
the thinking is just the brain

694
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:22,079
and externally, internally stored lots
internally that say, no, no, no, no,

695
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,850
it's your brain
plus other internal stuff within that

696
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,952
Mark applied

697
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,522
so the problem wouldn't be close.

698
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,657
You would still have a clash about

699
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,627
Sarah Brady there ever was.

700
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:41,131
Did you up people that instead it's
just your brain or your brain

701
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:45,302
and spinal cord and people
that that like external stuff

702
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,272
doing part of the thinking.

703
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,808
It makes me think of

704
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:53,878
like a thought experiment,
kind of like a tracer.

705
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:57,748
So like a radioactive tracer
might be injected in a blood vessel.

706
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,850
Then you can see where it flows or like a

707
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:02,853
a metabolic label
might be given to a cell

708
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,556
and then you can see
how it gets metabolized. So

709
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:10,160
the tracer let's just say we're following
like we're going to pluck

710
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,098
one of the strings and trace the impact
of like shining light on the retina.

711
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:19,703
Initially
it follows like nervous system paths.

712
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:24,942
But then let's say that light pattern
induces the system to pick up that phone

713
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:30,681
and reload a website so now that tracer
is spreading everywhere.

714
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,684
It's calling servers
in different parts of the world.

715
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:34,652
And it's like community.
