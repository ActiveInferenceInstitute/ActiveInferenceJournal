00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,280
hello and welcome everyone this is

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,219
active inference guest stream 28.1 it's

3
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,460
October 14 2022.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,740
today we are going to be hearing and

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,380
discussing reconceiving rationality by

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,439
Giovanni Rolla so Giovanni thank you so

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,480
much for joining very much looking

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,279
forward to this presentation and

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,780
discussion so off to you thank you

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,840
thank you then it was a pleasure to to

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,100
receive your invitation a couple of

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,440
months ago and I am delighted to be here

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,260
to have this opportunity to discuss my

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,820
work

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,040
um I'll spare your request

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,640
um our suggestion I am uh presenting

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,440
this paper I wrote a couple of years ago

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,739
and uh as we were talking the backstage

19
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,500
I have I I've changed my mind a few

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,879
times and I'm going to make this clear

21
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,920
during the presentation since I

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,440
published that paper but it is a

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,180
pleasure nonetheless to have the chance

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,600
to present this video here and uh to to

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,280
share it with the world so I'm very

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,060
happy

27
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,280
uh so we'll be talking about

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,680
reconceiving rationality and this is the

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,920
this is the the

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,060
itinerary I was thinking about

31
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,340
presenting to you so first I'll be

32
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,320
talking about rationality and

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,020
contentless cognition then I'll present

34
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,000
my view which I called radically

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,420
inactive rationality and safety words

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,640
about agency and proficient interaction

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,880
and reasoning and rationality they are

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,400
close with a couple of objections the

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,560
first one being that whatever I'm

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,759
pressing here is uh too liberal in a way

41
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,500
excessively liberal it encompasses too

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,140
much and the second objection which I

43
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,119
think is the one that may interest to

44
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,659
you the most is whether it is in fact

45
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,060
compatible with predictive processing or

46
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,700
predictive coding which is of course in

47
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,239
the facility in the end it's near the

48
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,900
the tour of cars in central to do to

49
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,160
active Infinity so

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,660
here's the

51
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,540
here's the sorry

52
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,360
the my initial thoughts on the matter is

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,840
that traditionally the very

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,340
uh Orthodox have view on rationality

55
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,580
uh assumes to most of my knowledge it's

56
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,340
as an assumption really that rationality

57
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,860
must entail reason

58
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,379
that for instance I believe B in an

59
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,720
action a are rational if and only if

60
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,120
there is the reasoning that underwrites

61
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,660
in the Bure so and of course it's just

62
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,940
not any reasoning the reasoning question

63
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,400
must acquired with certain certain

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,239
formal benchmarks such as classical

65
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,640
logic or probability reasoning or

66
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,459
heuristics so believing and acting

67
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,500
rationally according to this traditional

68
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,580
field

69
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,900
require meeting certain formal standards

70
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,940
and this as I said it seems to me to be

71
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,319
largely an assumption about what it

72
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,420
means to be rational about defining

73
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,319
rationality in terms of reasoning

74
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,280
so if rationality requires reasoning

75
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,560
and if reasoning involves the evaluation

76
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,019
of beliefs against certain formal

77
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,780
benchmarks then rationality implies

78
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,879
content for cognition

79
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,360
where content I take it to be minimally

80
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,700
having accuracy conditions being capable

81
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,739
of being right or wrong or in or in on a

82
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:50,420
more

83
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,000
weightier notion being true or false so

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,620
the idea here is that rationality

85
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,620
necessarily involves content it involves

86
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,000
beliefs reasoning and the comparison or

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,659
sorry

88
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,819
to update right now

89
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,459
one software update I'm sorry there was

90
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,480
a a pop-up in my window over here so

91
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,440
um

92
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,899
that would be I think the the standard

93
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,060
view on rationality

94
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,500
and

95
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,139
if it is so that rationality necessarily

96
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,080
involves content it it is a good fit

97
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,300
with classical cognitivism or

98
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,220
cognitivism in general

99
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,759
which is the view that combination

100
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,199
necessarily involves representational

101
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,919
content at the very least for some

102
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,419
cognitivists of course it might involve

103
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:43,680
also

104
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,720
um

105
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,280
conceptual content but at the very least

106
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,220
representational content which has uh

107
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,759
accuracy conditions

108
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,639
but this classical view is not so good

109
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,820
it does not provide a so good fit with

110
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,860
radically inactive and embodied

111
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,100
cognition which I am here uh thinking

112
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,740
not specifically on radical and activism

113
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,340
by Goodwin Maine in the recent books but

114
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,100
I think it also challenges other views

115
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,620
that are not presented as radically and

116
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,500
active but of course they share some

117
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,139
core tenants with radical and activism

118
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,080
we could call them uh radically embodied

119
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,139
views of cognitions such as

120
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,320
um with the views presented by Ezekiel

121
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,900
Paulo

122
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,759
sensory model life you also have

123
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,979
Gallagher's enact variety variety of

124
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:42,960
inactivism in his 2017 book and also the

125
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,639
I mean the view by by Tony kimero in his

126
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,300
2009 book on ecological psychology and

127
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,160
dynamical systems they all share common

128
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,979
tenancy and here I am I know this is

129
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:57,539
very controversial but I'm treating

130
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:01,560
those views as radically embodied views

131
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,720
of cognition and but I'm specifically

132
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,880
focused on radical and active views of

133
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,880
cooking issue they all say that uh not

134
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,320
the recognition is representational

135
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,500
contentful which is in a way to say that

136
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,520
we can think of basic contentless forms

137
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,780
of cognition

138
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,479
or a contentless level basic level of

139
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:22,620
recognition

140
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,600
which emerges through the active

141
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,660
exploration of one's environment and

142
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,960
Beyond radical and activism by what we

143
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,919
mean

144
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,340
this could be this idea could be cashed

145
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,979
out in terms of mastering sensory motor

146
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,380
engagements a matter of know-how

147
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,319
the knowing how to engage with your

148
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,120
surroundings instead of knowing that

149
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,900
stuff are so and so around you so this

150
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,300
is very clearly what the Paulo and

151
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,460
colleagues and uh kimero for instance do

152
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,340
in their books uh radical and activism

153
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,819
has a certain tendency to skew sensory

154
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,280
model engagement sensory model schemes

155
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,360
Etc

156
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,460
and uh

157
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,919
but recent developments have I think

158
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,120
Incorporated that so the the this is the

159
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,979
use of the the list of this idea right

160
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:19,500
so if we combine radical embodied views

161
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,080
of Illumination or right connectivism

162
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,860
and the classical fuel on rationality

163
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,740
what we have is something that angle has

164
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,720
described as follows

165
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,819
and activism is the view that cognition

166
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,979
is grounded in a prayer rational

167
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,620
understanding of the world that is based

168
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,360
on sensory motor acquisition of real

169
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,180
life situation

170
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:47,039
and he explains these uh this idea of

171
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,280
pre-rational understanding

172
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,819
by

173
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,880
um

174
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,280
by by the the ideas of melopentin

175
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,160
Heidegger according to whom the relation

176
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,500
to the world can be only one written in

177
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,840
practice inactives in acting and

178
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,360
practicing intern is mediated through

179
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,539
the body so what seems to be implicit

180
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,020
here is that unlike acting and practice

181
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,380
rationality is not actually

182
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,440
it is something that is not at a very

183
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,840
basic level of combination so this is

184
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,139
what happened when we we

185
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:27,199
make room for a basic level of cognition

186
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,120
rooted in active and in practice and

187
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,039
divorce it from upper levels of

188
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,260
combination that they are usually the

189
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,240
locus the lucky Clarity of rationality

190
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,740
so

191
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,440
the idea in summation is that

192
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,420
contentious cognition or basic cognition

193
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,880
that which emerges through sensory motor

194
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,519
engagements is not rational

195
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,500
so sensory modern engagements however

196
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,839
virtues in prolific they can be cannot

197
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,360
be evaluated from the standpoint of

198
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,240
rationality only content for cognition

199
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,360
high level combination can be

200
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,620
rationality is expressed for instance in

201
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,680
beliefs and reasoning

202
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,320
and well this is something that I

203
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,019
haven't touched upon on the paper but it

204
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,480
was my implicit motivation to deal with

205
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,040
this subject

206
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,200
as someone that comes from philosophy of

207
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,380
the mind is the idea of the myth of the

208
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,660
given at least a version of it

209
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,500
it seemed to me at the time and uh I was

210
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,420
correctly persuaded by a reviewer not to

211
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,380
touch on the subject it was very

212
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,519
convoluted in my initial presentation

213
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,600
but it seems to me that if we divide

214
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,779
base recognition from a rational thought

215
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,920
and action and we do not Point towards

216
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,760
the

217
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,100
well there is no I mean intersection

218
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,680
between these two levels it seems that

219
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,980
radical and activism and uh similar

220
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,680
views would be committed to the myth of

221
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,160
the given unpopularized by Sellers and

222
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,300
moderations by McDowell as a problem for

223
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,980
imperious fields of my mind

224
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,760
so it seems that this is I think a

225
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,339
[Music]

226
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,380
a philosophically interesting problem

227
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,140
but it's not something that is uh on the

228
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,519
Forefront of the paper it was my

229
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,620
implicit motivation here that to explain

230
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,399
how can we combine the contentless or

231
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,980
basic level of cognition through sensory

232
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,320
modern engagements with rationality if

233
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,040
you cannot it seems that uh there is a

234
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,839
given of some sort that is being uh not

235
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,540
completely explained in our picture of

236
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,760
the mind so this is something I wanted

237
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,720
to I still want to try to explore this

238
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,000
this intuition more clearly but I

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,140
haven't

240
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,600
touched upon this

241
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,760
but I I think there's something in the

242
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,160
direction of what why what I will show

243
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,940
today is I think it's a way to tweeze

244
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,060
this this accusation of being committed

245
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,279
to the myth of the given

246
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,160
so how can we reconceive rationality I

247
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,040
mean I think in order to avoid that

248
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,140
issue and avoid the idea that we have

249
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,540
two levels completely separated from

250
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,440
each other where one The Higher One is

251
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,800
the locus classical rationality and what

252
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,459
else is beneath it is not rational I

253
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,959
think the idea is to rejected

254
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,500
rationality must be defined or it

255
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,959
entails necessarily reasoning

256
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,480
and nationality does not need to be

257
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,519
still conceived but then the challenge

258
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,839
becomes to offer a positive

259
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,000
proposal of what rationality is if not

260
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,120
reasoning and here is Susan Hurley in a

261
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,040
paper that my knowledge is the only one

262
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,240
that it's

263
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,220
upon this subject and I think she was

264
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,839
also concerned about the myth of the

265
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,380
given by the way at the time and he is a

266
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,140
long quote from her phenomide me reading

267
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,839
it is that rationality might emerge from

268
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,940
a complex system of the centralized

269
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,000
hierarchy relations of inhibition

270
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,320
facilitation and coordination among

271
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,660
different horizontal layers Each of

272
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,579
which is dynamic and environmentally

273
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:23,459
situated rationality reconceived in

274
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:26,160
horizontal or modular terms uh I don't

275
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,760
know if she has to use this this

276
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,220
terminology but in any way that's how

277
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,040
she chose to express it is substantively

278
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,320
related to the environment it does not

279
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,540
depend only on internal procedures that

280
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,880
mediate between input and output such as

281
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,399
content either for the organism as a

282
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,959
whole or for a vertically bounded

283
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,779
Central cognitive module rather it

284
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,880
depends on complex relationships between

285
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,220
dedicated World involving layers that

286
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,279
monitor and respond to specific aspects

287
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,839
of the natural and social environment

288
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,480
and of the neural network enriches the

289
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,060
feedback from their responses this to my

290
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,279
knowledge is the earliest case of

291
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,480
someone working on the inactive approach

292
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,060
in a way

293
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,120
is obviously more

294
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,519
usually associated with the work of

295
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,100
avano which is also an activist but

296
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,200
in a different approach from radical and

297
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,120
activism and here is the the earliest

298
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,000
and to my knowledge before I wrote that

299
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,160
paper is that the clearest

300
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,399
uh proposal of rationality reconceived

301
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,860
in the native terms but it's not it's

302
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,139
not something that uh gained traction

303
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,660
after her publication to my knowledge

304
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,839
actually I haven't seen much since then

305
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,519
and to summarize the idea is that we

306
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,320
have to change the explanatory Focus

307
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,440
which is rationality is not exclusively

308
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,260
thought of as a Content involving

309
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,320
capacity in this proposal it is situated

310
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,680
or World involved in increased words and

311
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,380
is it is radically embodied it depends

312
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,680
on bodily morphology and action

313
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,800
and how the the organism is situated and

314
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,660
acts in that environment the idea will

315
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,139
be minimally dead so this is what I call

316
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:20,060
radically inactive rationality

317
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,019
is uh in a very

318
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:27,660
uh lose definition so far is that an

319
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,639
Asian acts rationally in so far as she

320
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,040
maintains a proficient interaction with

321
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,200
her environment coordinating her green

322
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,200
capabilities according to environmental

323
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,300
conditions of constraints and solid

324
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,519
stations and of course this sometimes

325
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,860
requires adapting to unforeseen

326
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,459
circumstances the the the core intuition

327
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:48,420
is this

328
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,940
and it's interesting to compare this

329
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,100
idea of radical and active rationality

330
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,420
with another of Susan Hurley's ideas in

331
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,040
a text from 2003 she's she says

332
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,139
reasons uh for acting she argues that

333
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,060
reasons for acting maybe context bound

334
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,699
where she's having against uh Gareth

335
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,920
Evans generality constraint

336
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,980
and this is the defense of the idea of

337
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,820
islands of practical rationality

338
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,399
so she is still treating rationality as

339
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,380
essentially something that relates to

340
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,600
reasoning here but this kind of

341
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,480
reasoning is uh bounded by practical

342
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,540
context so this is a very Progressive

343
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,519
view if compared with the traditional

344
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,199
view I I talked about at the beginning

345
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,320
but still more conservative than what I

346
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,060
am trying to develop here

347
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,399
so another thing that I think must be uh

348
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,899
the Forefront of this proposal is that

349
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:52,320
rationality implies agency and autonomy

350
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,839
because something or only something that

351
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,779
an organism does can be said to be

352
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,339
rational right

353
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:04,260
so to use these uh the ideas from the

354
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,339
autonomous and activists camp and from

355
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,680
the theory of how to players is

356
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,019
autonomous systems such as a Roomba

357
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,720
cannot be rational because it's not an

358
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,260
agent it is not the author of its own

359
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,380
behavior it is designed by external

360
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,380
agents to work in a certain way so it's

361
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,260
not strictly speaking Nation so that is

362
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,300
where I would draw the line of where

363
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,060
well you cannot it makes no sense to

364
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,100
ascribe rationality to a Roomba for

365
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,000
instance

366
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and

367
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:43,440
for this I I use the the Notions of

368
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,440
autonomy and adaptivity the DiPaolo and

369
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,839
others you have also the the recent book

370
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,579
image the four sensory model life and

371
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:53,279
that famous paper from the bowl from

372
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,880
2005 where he talks about the adaptivity

373
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,000
to to set his very general constraints

374
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,399
on what it means to be Russian

375
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,540
so autonomous systems are thereby

376
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,179
conceived as precarious networks a

377
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,760
precarious network of processes whose

378
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,619
organization and physical boundaries are

379
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:16,439
produced by the system itself the system

380
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,500
is continually maintaining its own uh

381
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,900
viability conditions which is

382
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,359
uh known as sense making where the

383
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,900
system explored uh environmental

384
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,640
environmental conditions that are

385
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,720
favorable to its uh self-maintenance and

386
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,059
avoids the ones that are detrimental to

387
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:36,900
it

388
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,080
so this is how I understand to be the

389
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,799
the very in general that the

390
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:46,320
emotional constraint on a rational being

391
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,039
that it must be an autonomous system

392
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,080
and the interesting thing here is that

393
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,320
the concept of adaptivity that Paulo

394
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,440
puts forth is that the capacity of an

395
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,299
organism to improve its condition of

396
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,520
self-production through internal

397
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,380
structural changes

398
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,600
so it involves the monitoring and

399
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,640
regulation of internal changes in order

400
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,980
to select the best available course of

401
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,679
action it is I think it's another

402
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,460
interesting concept to think in of to to

403
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,000
include in this idea of a radical and

404
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,039
active notion of rationality one that is

405
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,559
not necessarily committed to reasoning

406
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,240
and content

407
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,820
so agency is realized through the

408
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,679
exercise of situated abilities that

409
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,780
promote changes within the organism in

410
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,100
accordance with environmental

411
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,380
constraints and solid stations

412
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,600
which means that how well an organism

413
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,700
adapts in order to deal proficiently

414
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,179
with its environment is a measure of or

415
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:48,000
an indication of its rationality the

416
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,280
more rational an organism is the more

417
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,020
suited it is to deal with its

418
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,820
environment and we have foreseen

419
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,320
circumstances

420
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,860
and in doing so the organism enhances

421
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,100
The Continuous exchanges between itself

422
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,419
and the environment

423
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,299
which is crucial for its survival and it

424
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,000
is very

425
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,020
naturalized way of thinking of

426
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,039
rationality is mostly capacity to to

427
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,280
enhance changes for survival

428
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,020
this is the

429
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,120
the overall idea here

430
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,720
so as I said before what about reasoning

431
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,160
I want to

432
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,220
I don't want to commit rationality

433
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,919
necessarily with reasoning and this is

434
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,559
what radically inactive rationality is

435
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,440
all about but I don't want to exclude

436
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,380
reasoning as a former professional

437
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,820
combination

438
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,620
so what I'm saying is that it's not

439
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,919
defined by reasoning but it's not uh it

440
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,140
does not exclude reasoning reasoning I

441
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,340
think would be thought of as is special

442
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,760
or specific mode of rational agency one

443
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,880
that is exclusive to our knowledge to

444
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,140
human beings

445
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,480
but it's not the defining feature of

446
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,039
rationality

447
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,419
so for this I uh in order to to explain

448
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:13,260
this idea I recall how Hutu and Saturn

449
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,580
in between their people in a most recent

450
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,400
book by what I mean they explain the

451
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,380
emergence of high recognition the idea

452
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,020
is that being able to engage in content

453
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,940
for cognition ultimately depends on

454
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,720
being social culturally embedded

455
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,520
where content full cognition emerge from

456
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,860
social cultural interaction so as an

457
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,440
individual takes part in Social cultural

458
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,520
practices

459
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,400
they accept more ancient cognitive

460
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,480
abilities to deal with symbols and by

461
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,760
doing so they

462
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,179
um in a long process of enculturation of

463
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:56,400
course they become able to engage with a

464
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,500
symbolic coordination which is not

465
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,480
internal representation specific because

466
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,360
it is publicly available it's not mental

467
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,160
representations in the traditional sense

468
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,559
but it has the features of symbolic

469
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,440
cognition without the commitment to

470
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,360
there are no representation or mental

471
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,919
representations

472
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,740
so acting rationally in its most General

473
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,860
sense is the idea that the proficient

474
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,980
behavior of an organism is in is the

475
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,260
proficient behavior of an organism in

476
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,880
its environment it depends on the

477
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,159
coordination of embodied abilities

478
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,919
whereas reasoning if everything goes

479
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,559
well of course is understood as content

480
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,200
for rationality for my specific mode of

481
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,600
rationality reasoning is the proficient

482
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,640
behavior of an organism in a social

483
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,620
cultural environment

484
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,620
which is a more specific aspect of our

485
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,960
environment of course and it depends on

486
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,360
the coordination of such a culturally

487
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,880
based or content involving abilities

488
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,679
which are more recent in the the human

489
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,260
phylogenetic scale

490
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,440
so well this is the the biggest of the

491
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,400
idea this is the the I think uh the the

492
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,740
positive part and here are the

493
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,460
objections I wanted to talk about first

494
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,220
one being that it's a very liberal view

495
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,900
it's very

496
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,940
uh it it is well it decompasses too much

497
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,580
one would say because if rational action

498
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,200
boils down to the coordination of

499
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,080
cognitive abilities then rationality is

500
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,539
something gradual for an organism could

501
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,280
be more or less proficient in its

502
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,500
environmental interactions

503
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,799
and the the rejection goes according to

504
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,539
radically inactive rationality many

505
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:45,299
organisms achieve and maintain an

506
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,159
Adaptive behavior in the niche with

507
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,140
different levels of success

508
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,679
to which I am uh well someone could sing

509
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:56,159
rational and active radical and active

510
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,380
rationality is to Liberal and this is

511
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,659
one objection that I've heard in person

512
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,059
and I I kept it so hard because I think

513
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,980
it's very it's a very good way of

514
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,440
putting it even snails are rational on

515
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,380
this View and uh to which I must say

516
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,980
that I'm willing to to buy the bullet uh

517
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,720
well yes it's more liberal than

518
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,340
traditional views of course it is

519
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,980
intended to be so but I don't think that

520
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,580
this per se problem what I think is the

521
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,940
the positive part here is that it

522
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,460
preserves a difference of degree

523
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,559
humans are way more rational than other

524
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,559
animals simply because we are able to

525
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,220
perform a wide variety of actions in a

526
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,799
wide variety of dynamic circumstances

527
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,320
that are Way Beyond any other animals

528
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,020
that we are aware of

529
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,820
so to come back to the example of this

530
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,580
nail this nail can perform a few complex

531
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,340
actions can move from one point to

532
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,860
another it can search for food and

533
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,039
shelter and so on so forth but they have

534
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,620
a critical limited set of abilities if

535
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,080
you surround this nail with South for

536
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,380
instance it is doomed to to die by the

537
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,960
retortation and humans on the other hand

538
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,640
they are much more adaptive and able to

539
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,919
deal dynamically with many unforeseen

540
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,880
circumstances so uh

541
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,159
in my response that the rejection is

542
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,620
that yes

543
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,840
uh well it is very liberal but that's

544
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,820
not the problem the problem would be if

545
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,580
that it is if it had the room for a

546
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,860
difference of degree between how animals

547
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,620
deal with their environments

548
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,780
so and and this is the other object

549
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,000
objection which I think it may be though

550
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,580
the one that interests you the most then

551
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,940
you know is the 12 predictive processing

552
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,760
seems to imply inferences and content

553
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,159
all the way

554
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:53,580
uh but at first I must uh warn you and

555
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,720
the viewers that

556
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,840
at the time I wrote this uh this paper

557
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,120
was much more optimistic about this

558
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,120
possibility of combining an activism and

559
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,740
predictive coding or predictive

560
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,159
processing and uh I think there are

561
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,020
important points here but there is this

562
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,760
recent paper by Olu and Evan Thompson

563
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,299
and Randy beer where they uh they

564
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,120
provide a critical assessment of uh the

565
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,299
the the the attempts to combine mainly

566
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:28,039
the free energy principle and

567
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,760
um

568
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,740
inactive and

569
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,980
autobiographic theories so I am now

570
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,960
mostly convinced by their arguments but

571
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,059
I think there are some interesting

572
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:42,240
points of comparison here nonetheless

573
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,419
so predictive process in our predictive

574
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,299
code in uh at the time I was writing in

575
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,940
still to this day is all the raged in

576
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,620
the cognitive Sciences I guess you can

577
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,380
say that it sounded sweets become the

578
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,659
one of the main paradigms out there so

579
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:00,720
it is interesting to see if it provides

580
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,700
a good fit with what I'm talking about

581
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,200
and in these viewers you know

582
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,120
competition is understood as a process

583
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,159
of error minimization that occurs in

584
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:14,340
bidirectional narrow hierarchies

585
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,860
so

586
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,840
you have the generation of internal

587
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,000
models for the activity of lower layers

588
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,039
that anticipates the distal causes of

589
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,799
sinisterial stimuli which is a top-down

590
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,440
process and the minimization of

591
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,299
discrepancy between prediction and

592
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:33,419
current stimulus signal by

593
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:36,360
um the operation of priors which is a

594
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,100
bottom-up process

595
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,919
so here's of course active inference

596
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:42,960
which is understood by for instance in

597
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,059
an informal you know formal terms by

598
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:48,659
Clark an organism moves its sensors in

599
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:50,880
ways that amount to actively seek in our

600
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,980
generation generating the sensory

601
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,559
consequences that they are rather their

602
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,360
brains expect

603
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,700
this is one way of understanding active

604
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,880
influencing very among formal terms but

605
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,460
I think it gets the job done

606
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,700
so is the brain infaring the expected

607
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,059
source of received stimuli if it is

608
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:15,120
it seems that there is a there's an

609
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,100
issue with what I'm talking about

610
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,159
so the Hamilton reading of predictive

611
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,580
processing which is uh which uses the

612
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,580
broader bias and inference right says

613
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,860
for instance that the process of

614
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,419
perceptionistas is separable from

615
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:33,299
rational provided by agents process of

616
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,520
prolification and context top-down

617
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,039
effects I felt that every intermediate

618
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,380
level of processities has caught my

619
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,140
attention the way that Clark is also

620
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,700
talking about rationality all the way

621
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,100
but it's an inferential sort of

622
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,220
rationality

623
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,820
and pervasive influencer reasoning seems

624
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,279
to imply impervasive content

625
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,620
and then predictive processing seems to

626
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,740
be incompatible with radically inactive

627
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,440
rationality

628
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,620
well but there is uh the time there was

629
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,140
and I think we can still argue in

630
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,020
several of the there's no

631
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,799
non-hemorrhoids and reading of

632
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,900
predictive processing

633
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,900
which uses for instance a one first step

634
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,059
would be to use a deflationary sense of

635
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:24,000
prediction that understand Camaro in a

636
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,960
short paper from 2013 but fourth where

637
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,000
the values of two or more variables

638
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,080
cover your value reliably so the value

639
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,440
of 1 allows the Observer to infer the

640
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,600
value of another and here the inference

641
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,120
is happening happening at the level of

642
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,860
the observation not at one far

643
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,020
variable is inferring the value of

644
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,799
another so the idea would be I think

645
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,200
that content is in the eye of the

646
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,659
beholder the person who interprets how

647
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,340
the selection of censorial we put

648
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,799
approximates internal predictions he

649
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,200
understood in the deflationary sense can

650
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,600
describe it in inferential and biasing

651
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,179
terms so this is how I see for instance

652
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:15,440
the the idea about fourth house by Bruno

653
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,960
marstein in that paper which if I'm not

654
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,279
mistaken

655
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,320
title is something like the brain is not

656
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,320
a scientist and the argument is in this

657
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,299
General interaction

658
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,620
that we are projecting how

659
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,440
scientists construe brain activity as a

660
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,720
feature of the brain itself as if it

661
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,899
were predicting an inferring this more

662
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:43,100
uh robust or waiter sense

663
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,380
so what I'm trying to say here is that

664
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,820
active inference then I use double I

665
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,919
want to say double forgot the name of

666
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:55,559
this in English sorry

667
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:59,580
um it's not uh the literal sense of

668
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,500
inference here according to radically

669
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,679
inactive

670
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,360
rationalities that unarmed for the

671
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,000
efficiency of co-oriented behavior the

672
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,520
agent has to act in certain ways in

673
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,100
order for his his or her States come to

674
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,860
fruition more efficiently less costly

675
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,200
this does not imply the more contentious

676
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,360
claim that the generative models

677
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,760
themselves display and perform

678
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,860
predictive inferences this is a very

679
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,860
deflationary reading into predictive

680
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,000
processing to to provide this

681
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,279
combination with radical and active

682
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,779
rationality

683
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:42,299
and here is a kickoff in a paper from

684
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,580
2018

685
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,140
by model it doesn't follow that an

686
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,580
organism has an internal

687
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,159
representational model of its niche in

688
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,260
that it is this model that those are the

689
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,840
cognitive work if you like instead an

690
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,020
organism is a model that is the causal

691
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,240
and statistical regularities reflect in

692
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,460
some environmental reflecting some

693
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,100
phenotype there is a model

694
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,620
and well

695
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,559
this relates to something that recently

696
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,820
uh

697
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,820
my colleague notifica and I have been

698
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,059
talking about the idea of how organisms

699
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,460
bring forth a world according to an

700
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,980
activism which is idea that the organism

701
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,720
and environment are historically

702
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,380
historically called determined so

703
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,799
uh artificial genetical scale this could

704
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:34,080
be explained through the idea of Niche

705
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,299
construction the idea that once an

706
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:39,000
organism is active in its environment it

707
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,820
promotes changes then if they are stable

708
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,520
enough that it can be inherited by its

709
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,380
Offspring and these changes provide new

710
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,419
evolutionary press pressure pressures

711
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:54,419
that are uh that lead its evolutionary

712
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,760
path a similar idea has also been

713
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,279
explored by other description this time

714
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,760
relating Niche Construction

715
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,020
and the ecological psychology

716
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:10,559
so my my response to that objection is

717
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,720
that to act rationally means to achieve

718
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,700
a proficient engagement with the

719
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,340
environment through in a way prediction

720
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,159
and urbanization I'm willing to accept

721
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,740
that characterization but

722
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,559
rational and broader biasian processes

723
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:28,440
need not imply content for cognition if

724
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,340
we

725
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,100
if we understand that in the Flash no

726
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,200
sense prediction and narrow minimization

727
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,140
involve the selection of input and the

728
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,059
coordination of an interabilities in

729
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:41,700
World involvement manners which is well

730
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,740
exactly the main claim of radical and

731
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,279
active personality so I think to that

732
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,000
extent that predictive processing is not

733
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,100
uh an enemies would be rather than a lie

734
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,000
of this idea instead of uh

735
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,620
arrival but of course there are other

736
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,559
issues of compatibility that I haven't I

737
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:05,100
haven't touched upon here but that uh

738
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,559
this is all that I have thought of but

739
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:10,340
today thank you

740
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,620
awesome thank you very much

741
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,739
all right

742
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,059
cool very interesting

743
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:25,799
for those who are watching live please

744
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,559
feel free to write any questions I will

745
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,840
gather my notes and let's begin the

746
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,460
discussion

747
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,200
okay

748
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,960
well first just uh thanks again for the

749
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,220
talk

750
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,880
how about a little context on how you

751
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,360
came to be asking these questions in

752
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,880
your current position and how your

753
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,220
interests in this area developed because

754
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,200
there's so many interesting ideas and I

755
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,240
just wanted to learn more about how you

756
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,299
came to this Framing and sharpened your

757
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:59,159
point

758
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:00,960
okay thank you that's that's a good

759
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,059
question because it's not often that you

760
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,899
can explore this background

761
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:10,500
it matters so uh I was at the time I

762
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,080
think I was writing my PhD dissertation

763
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,440
it was maybe 2007 or something

764
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,219
and uh I was arguing for the idea that

765
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:23,219
rationality must be something that is

766
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,739
ultimately World involved in there is a

767
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:29,580
tendency to think of well even among as

768
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,719
I told as I showed you among uh in in

769
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,480
embodied periods with people of certain

770
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,639
it needs to be essentially World

771
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,379
involving such as acting and practice

772
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:41,879
and so forth

773
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,399
and perception of course but rationality

774
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,580
remains something like not realizable

775
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,540
notion something that cannot be brought

776
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,080
down to the level of the the it could

777
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,800
not be scaled down in a way

778
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,540
like perception that could be explained

779
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,960
by a certain Dynamic engagement and so

780
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,240
on and so forth

781
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,880
so at the time I was thinking that well

782
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,859
maybe this is

783
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,380
an issue because

784
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,660
on other

785
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,140
other contexts it is taken to imply that

786
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,839
whatever perception moves if it is not

787
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,240
articulated in a way to provide a

788
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,820
certain fit with

789
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,619
professional combination then perception

790
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:31,200
is a given and this is the myth of the

791
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,780
given I mentioned at the beginning and I

792
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,460
thought that well maybe this is

793
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,400
something of there is something of a

794
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,500
myth of the given working here on an

795
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,440
active cognition but this is not I think

796
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,900
it's not fatal because we couldn't

797
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,720
principle argue that instead of

798
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,140
uh construing step perception and other

799
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,839
basic forms of combinations involving

800
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:57,480
Concepts and the like maybe we could

801
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,859
argue

802
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:01,020
from the other direction try to scale

803
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,800
down rationality in more not naturalized

804
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,839
level of

805
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:08,579
uh

806
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:11,300
the perceptual organization and the like

807
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,700
so that was the motivation and it was

808
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,339
very it was a long review process and I

809
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:20,940
believe that my first the first version

810
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,380
of the paper the the viewer was very I

811
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,400
think they were correct entirely I I

812
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,320
endorsed the suggestion after all but he

813
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,820
was very uh

814
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,700
they were very adamant on taking that

815
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,920
apart and I think it was for the better

816
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,460
because it it is another literature it

817
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,540
is another uh a lot of references that

818
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,200
are not usually in conversation with an

819
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,540
activism and body recognition and it was

820
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,640
very difficult just to put the matter in

821
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,220
the same terms to advance my arguments

822
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,839
so it's something that I scratched out

823
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,820
and I haven't thought too much about

824
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,040
that system but I think it's something I

825
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,640
would like to come back to and maybe uh

826
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,880
even probably someone has done so in the

827
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,780
in this last few years I'm not aware I

828
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,339
can remember but

829
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:17,160
this relation between an activism the

830
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,440
myth that we give and it seemed to be it

831
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,140
seems to be very

832
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:25,560
obvious so it is I think something that

833
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,280
we could we should I mean uh be able to

834
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,200
explore but there's not something that

835
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,820
was in the the Forefront of the paper

836
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,200
but

837
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,940
but I had this idea to talk about

838
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,540
rationality in the flashing every sense

839
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,000
and at the same time I was reading a lot

840
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,180
about uh

841
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,900
recording from a philosophical

842
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,599
perspective of course I'm not as I said

843
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,420
very well versed in the technicalities

844
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,880
and the formalities of the the approach

845
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,520
but I was interested in the the

846
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,320
philosophical consequences there and I

847
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,540
thought well maybe there's something to

848
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,720
compare here because as Clark's

849
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,420
quotation show you can talk about

850
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,540
rationality all the way and uh that's

851
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,619
something I wanted to to develop but not

852
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:17,220
in a cognitivist view but not radically

853
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,619
embodied film so that's the the the

854
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:22,579
background

855
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:25,700
awesome thank you could you maybe

856
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,640
describe just what is the myth of the

857
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,520
given what was the context that that

858
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,660
myth arose in and where do we go after

859
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,640
bringing up the myth of the given

860
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,560
because I I saw it as a concept that you

861
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,740
wove in so what was it about

862
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,500
okay so the middle beginning that well

863
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,680
there are several

864
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,240
Givens depending on your flavor of

865
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,000
philosopher's mind but most classically

866
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,820
in previous fields of the Mind take the

867
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,920
the the content of perception to be

868
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,400
given prayer rationally in a way that we

869
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,920
have certain inputs that are uh just

870
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,480
received by the mind and the mind

871
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,020
interprets it so sellers different

872
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,420
sellers is famous for

873
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:17,160
uh having described his uh this problem

874
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,680
as a problem for not only increases

875
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,119
fields of the mind but also for

876
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,700
rationalists but on the on the other

877
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,700
side rational is usually taken uh

878
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,700
rational intuition as a given which is

879
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,040
to say that there is some some level of

880
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,460
cognition that is uh unarticulated it's

881
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,760
given or as some people talk about being

882
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,079
bred given

883
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,280
but in a way there is this level of

884
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,960
cognition that is given in the mind has

885
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,839
to interpret it but if it is given in

886
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:52,820
this way it has no point of contact no

887
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,300
uh intersection between whatever

888
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,660
whatever mind does and the in this basic

889
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:06,060
level of uh domination so my idea is to

890
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,940
avoid the the charge of being committed

891
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,339
to the myth of the given but again this

892
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,859
is not something that is explicit in the

893
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:16,740
the next literature but it's something

894
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,339
that seems to be possible to to develop

895
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:21,900
in a

896
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,700
I mean uh in this sort of comparison but

897
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,839
it's not

898
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,460
it's not from the

899
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,140
not clearly there but

900
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,660
one way of solving them for the given is

901
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,060
to say that perceptual content is

902
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,300
already conceptual in nature which is

903
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,640
for instance how Joe McDowell does in

904
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,060
mind the more of that in a way

905
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,579
perception uh the the joke is comes with

906
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:54,839
subtitles you interpret the world as as

907
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:57,119
you do but uh

908
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,060
I think that one way or another way is

909
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,180
to demystify you know a rationality and

910
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,880
the upper layers of combination try and

911
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,280
try to think of them uh in less

912
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,660
uh content for analysis

913
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,660
without committing them so it's strictly

914
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,260
speaking with a level of content that is

915
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,940
divorced from basic levels of domination

916
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,820
that's one way I think of doing so and

917
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,700
rationality seems to be the one key

918
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,680
concept to do this because

919
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,300
it's so usually soon to be something

920
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,619
exclusively human and something that is

921
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:42,359
related to reasoning

922
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:45,540
and well if it is so then rationality

923
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,079
cannot inform action and if of course if

924
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:52,680
action is contentless in nature so if

925
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,220
rationality is a sense essentially

926
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,160
contentful and it actually is

927
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,320
essentially uncontent for contentless

928
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,760
then you can you do not have this

929
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,300
uh that's done this uh intersection

930
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,000
between two domains and this is

931
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,220
something I wanted to avoid but as I

932
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,280
told you it became so hard to express

933
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,859
this views in in

934
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:22,320
sufficiently clear and general way is

935
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,079
that by recommendation of a reviewer I

936
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,119
scratched it out and I

937
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,599
I still think about it but not in I

938
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:33,480
haven't developed a proper

939
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,960
line of argumentation that deals with it

940
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,540
more clearly than I can do as I just did

941
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:43,339
in very general terms

942
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,420
cool well some words that you associated

943
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,800
with rationality were adaptivity

944
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,280
and also proficiency so what do you see

945
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,520
as the relationship of rationality and

946
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,880
Fitness

947
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:06,180
as a biological function right yes yeah

948
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,060
okay I um

949
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,780
I think it is it is an intrinsic

950
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,319
Revelation really I think it is uh

951
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,220
probably the most uh

952
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,660
the

953
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,720
um obvious consequence of rational

954
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,960
action at a special scale

955
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,240
and when we talk about whether

956
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,260
rationality is a feature of uh certain

957
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,980
species or instead of uh individuals I

958
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,040
think Fitness is one of the

959
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,280
the key concept here to to think this as

960
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,339
the the outcome of this

961
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:48,619
rational action

962
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:52,440
so although I do not say I do not put

963
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,540
eating those matters in the paper I

964
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,220
think it is possible to think it that

965
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,280
way and don't see it as a

966
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,859
uh as an objection to think think of

967
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:04,500
rationality but again it's very liberal

968
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,140
and I'm willing to to accept this

969
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,000
consequence that well every living

970
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,480
organism in a way if it if it hasn't

971
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,680
gone Instinct yet so it is in a way

972
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,900
fitted to its environment so I'm willing

973
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,700
to say that it may involve a minimal

974
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,920
level of rationality of dealing with uh

975
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,460
the negatively changing environment

976
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,400
but well

977
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,859
it's the price of having a very

978
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:36,240
uh for labor or Progressive notion of

979
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,339
rationalities this is a consequence of

980
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:40,819
it I believe

981
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,400
so you've said that Fitness is is a

982
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,700
consequence of rational Behavior

983
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,480
are there other consequences or how do

984
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,180
we recognize rationality from the

985
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,819
outside other than just saying well the

986
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,700
ant colony is thriving so to the extent

987
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,940
that it is rational it is adaptive an

988
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,579
exhibiting agency and all of that

989
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:07,040
um is this such a deflationary

990
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,099
rationality concept that all extant

991
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:15,000
things humans and otherwise are merely

992
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,339
described by it or are there some

993
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,319
outcomes that we can use to disentangle

994
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:22,619
like for example a rational or

995
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,680
irrational behavior from merely the

996
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,260
consequences reflected by survival and

997
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,819
Fitness

998
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:34,260
right well I I had to to think very

999
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,720
carefully about this because I don't

1000
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,940
want to trivialize this concept in a way

1001
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,300
that well everything is IPS of fact or

1002
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,980
rational by the matter of fact that it's

1003
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,740
living it is acting relationship but I

1004
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,280
think that uh in particular cases one

1005
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,480
could uh identify the nation that I am

1006
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,119
equal to the individuals

1007
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,060
um self-sustainment in that Niche so so

1008
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,619
at the individual level in particular

1009
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:03,420
okay this is one conclusion you see

1010
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,400
certain actions that could classifiers

1011
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,380
irrational to the extent that they uh

1012
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,000
are detrimental to to with survival but

1013
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,800
uh at the species level it's more

1014
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,160
difficult to argue that way because to

1015
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,560
identify this kind of behavior or

1016
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:24,000
consequence but I think that in order

1017
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,520
to not to trivialize the idea of

1018
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,680
rationality and say well everything that

1019
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,920
is living is it's a factorized you'd

1020
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,560
have to to identify this sort of

1021
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,579
particular acts that are detrimented to

1022
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:41,460
to one survival

1023
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,520
so in the case of the the ant colony I

1024
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,180
don't know maybe

1025
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,400
welcoming invasers would be a

1026
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,579
would be the sort of behavior that would

1027
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:56,960
be prejudicial with

1028
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,220
survival as such

1029
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,900
I don't know I don't know if this is uh

1030
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,579
it's one impossible way of thinking

1031
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:04,260
about this I had to think more clearly

1032
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,500
but

1033
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:11,700
cool very interesting and you brought in

1034
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,680
in that answer and in the presentation

1035
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,359
like multiple

1036
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,140
nested time scales just like Eco Evo

1037
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,839
Devo does from a more biological

1038
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,540
perspective looking at how Niche

1039
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:27,180
construction Bridges the gap between

1040
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,359
slower phylogenetic processes and more

1041
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:33,540
rapid developmental processes

1042
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,060
um so how does this

1043
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:41,040
embedded and multi-scale consideration

1044
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,579
relate to the the content

1045
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:47,880
concept like is content going to be

1046
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:54,319
localized in one body or is the content

1047
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,900
distributed across entities or is the

1048
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,079
rationality distributed across entities

1049
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:04,079
how would we even identify the locus

1050
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,359
of rationality and that also kind of

1051
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:09,140
invokes the um horizontal and modular

1052
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,520
conception from the quote that you

1053
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,960
provided so how do we identify a salient

1054
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,660
spatial temporal scales and systems of

1055
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,899
Interest

1056
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,839
oh I I don't know I don't know if I can

1057
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:27,599
answer uh this fully but

1058
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,619
it seems to me that at the level of uh

1059
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:33,900
if we're talking about content for

1060
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,480
instance content as a accuracy

1061
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,780
conditions for symbolic thoughts I think

1062
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,640
fortunately we have to say that it's

1063
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,440
it's not localized in a single

1064
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,859
individual it's publicly shared so you

1065
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:48,300
can say that

1066
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:48,900
um

1067
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,540
one consequence of this is that it's

1068
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,660
possible to think of different uh

1069
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,480
patterns of reasoning that have

1070
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,920
being information

1071
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,500
sites at different times Etc and you can

1072
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,359
see that well they developed different

1073
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:09,119
level different uh rules for Content

1074
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,859
information

1075
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:13,020
and I think this is

1076
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,680
plausible to say that content is

1077
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,420
is localized that the the

1078
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,520
uh how can you say it's share the amount

1079
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,740
you know the specifics of

1080
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,280
just for rationality I think

1081
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,950
one could

1082
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:35,119
[Music]

1083
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,220
identify in particular behaviors

1084
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:42,980
if it if it feeds these uh

1085
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:47,280
this kind of description of uh spin

1086
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,380
professional proficient interaction and

1087
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,720
adaptive interaction between an organism

1088
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:56,040
and its environment its Niche so

1089
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,460
probably we could

1090
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:03,060
we could give different answers here a

1091
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,520
rationality and content I I am willing

1092
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,420
to say that

1093
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,400
content for organization is not

1094
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,619
something that happens in the head

1095
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:13,440
something that is out there in a way

1096
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,140
shared among others and this is

1097
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,300
something that the philosophy of mine

1098
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,780
has at least since the 60s uh the

1099
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,460
philosophers of mine have been argued

1100
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:26,819
for the idea that content is externally

1101
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:29,040
individuated

1102
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,640
and uh I'm I think this is it is one of

1103
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,319
the video by for instance Hillary Putnam

1104
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:40,040
and Tyler Burge and others that

1105
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,560
mental content is individuated at the

1106
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,800
community level or societal level but

1107
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,480
along the on the other hand they think

1108
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,880
rationality could be in principle

1109
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,819
individuated in particular behaviors but

1110
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:56,760
it would depend on the individuals goals

1111
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,359
and the the niche it inhabits and so on

1112
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:01,440
so forth

1113
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,980
uh there are of course the actual

1114
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:07,079
variables here that might be important

1115
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:08,339
too

1116
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:10,700
to identify

1117
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,660
Behavior as rational or not

1118
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,780
thanks um well one phrase that really

1119
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,780
stuck with me was like know how not know

1120
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,339
that

1121
00:51:23,339 --> 00:51:27,059
perhaps uh a basal point in your work

1122
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:29,940
and a focus on that action so I just

1123
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,140
wanted to

1124
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:35,400
hear about how action and practice as

1125
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,099
you wove them here today how are those

1126
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:40,140
terms addressed

1127
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:44,040
and how are things different today with

1128
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,040
the treatment of action and practice and

1129
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,819
know-how not know that than say in the

1130
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:53,400
helmholtzee in days or even in ancient

1131
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,059
or in World Knowledge traditions

1132
00:51:57,059 --> 00:52:00,300
So Okay cool so the idea I think would

1133
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,339
be that

1134
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:03,839
um

1135
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:08,339
there is a tendency from uh it is a

1136
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:11,700
tendency from a very modern philosophy

1137
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,700
but it has been very influential in that

1138
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,859
the first wave of cognitive science to

1139
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:20,359
think of perception as a capacity to

1140
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:24,119
categorize the environment and to offer

1141
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:28,200
a discrete description of environmental

1142
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,260
aspects so for instance perceiving that

1143
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,859
uh the the the the

1144
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:37,400
I don't know the the curve is to my left

1145
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,520
is a matter of knowing that there is a

1146
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,220
thing with searches such properties to

1147
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,339
my left and this is a kind of uh know

1148
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:49,680
that a kind of propositional attitude

1149
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,859
towards the world so

1150
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:54,680
uh I think the the

1151
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,540
interesting thing about an activism and

1152
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:00,720
ecological psychology as well and to the

1153
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,700
extent that they recall American

1154
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,720
pragmatism from the the beginning of the

1155
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,819
centuries to think of

1156
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:11,700
perception as a matter of not

1157
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,099
categorizing these properties in the

1158
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:17,400
world but as uh disclosing possibilities

1159
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,260
for acting

1160
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:22,740
and this is something that if you were

1161
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:27,000
to explain that in terms of uh in

1162
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,460
epistemic terms such as knowledge we

1163
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,440
wouldn't put it as a matter of knowing

1164
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,099
that the the curve is to my left but

1165
00:53:34,099 --> 00:53:37,800
knowing how to grab the cup and and do

1166
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,599
whatever I want to do with it if I want

1167
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,000
to drink a cup of coffee or if I want to

1168
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,460
use it as a paperweight it will have

1169
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:47,280
different silent properties and this is

1170
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,079
something that

1171
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:53,400
although it has been I think

1172
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,160
very I think an activism and ecological

1173
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,839
psychology and other embodied views of

1174
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,599
cognition have been largely successfully

1175
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:03,660
in shifting this discussion to this

1176
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,960
point I think in the uh in more

1177
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,180
traditional cognitive Sciences you still

1178
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,960
have the idea that well organism

1179
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,079
organisms perceived by by describing the

1180
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,480
way the environment the the things this

1181
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,240
is something that I think

1182
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,700
uh more traditional readings of

1183
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:28,339
predictive processing make uh make clear

1184
00:54:28,339 --> 00:54:32,099
as in uh the idea that you're inferring

1185
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:35,339
about the the source of stimuli and not

1186
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:40,319
in uh and not and this is not I mean

1187
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,599
this is more easily amenable to the idea

1188
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:45,059
that the brain or the cognitive system

1189
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:46,520
knows that

1190
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,740
the the world is so and so

1191
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:52,140
the environment is so and so instead of

1192
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:55,200
saying that the cognitive system knows

1193
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,540
how to engage with the world and I

1194
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:58,920
believe the

1195
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,000
the the the point that

1196
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,700
an activists and uh ecological

1197
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,000
psychologists are trying to make is to

1198
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,020
and also working on the the predictive

1199
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,619
coding and the free energy principle

1200
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:20,640
Etc is to show that these Notions these

1201
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,920
Frameworks could be a minimal idea that

1202
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,980
the cognitive system is knowing how to

1203
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,559
engage it knows how to engage the

1204
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,119
environment in a way it doesn't need to

1205
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:33,000
be read in a handboard summary

1206
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,760
that the the Kindle system is inferring

1207
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,240
that the world is so so I think this is

1208
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:42,059
one way of explaining but also uh

1209
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:46,319
philosophically if you have a large at

1210
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,000
the beginning of the the last few

1211
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,540
decades uh a gigantic discussion about

1212
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,359
whether you know how could be reduced to

1213
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:57,660
know that and then again you have a

1214
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,000
background of this and other

1215
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,800
philosophical discussion about the

1216
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,020
rather know how could be treated as an

1217
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,059
independent notion from you know that

1218
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:08,180
and whether you could

1219
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:12,500
reduce one to the other and so forth so

1220
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,140
I think it doesn't stop there you cannot

1221
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:19,700
uh even though I can make a a claim for

1222
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,960
perceptional some other knowing how

1223
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,660
they're still the the background issue

1224
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,819
of whether know-how could be treated as

1225
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:27,960
and all that

1226
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,079
and this is something that I am also

1227
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:34,740
working on recently

1228
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,819
there's a lot to say there it's it's

1229
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:41,819
such an interesting idea especially with

1230
00:56:41,819 --> 00:56:44,220
linguistic communication it's a little

1231
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,800
bit like the finger and the moon and

1232
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,500
talking about the moon but the finger is

1233
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,020
only where it is and we're not talking

1234
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,000
about the pointer we're talking about

1235
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,980
the reference

1236
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:59,700
and so to use

1237
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:03,559
a sociocognitive form of communication

1238
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:07,079
in in cultured language

1239
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:12,900
or in written academic discourse to peer

1240
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,559
through that or to reimagine that and

1241
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,500
see even what seems to be like the

1242
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,960
Pinnacle of know that

1243
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,079
and still see it as know how

1244
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,579
I guess the question there is

1245
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,220
how do we read papers

1246
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:36,240
yes of course yes I think it is uh it is

1247
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,800
a

1248
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,740
uh it's yeah the values it seems to have

1249
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,740
to be a very big problem because if we

1250
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:46,200
try to to treat these negative

1251
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,359
capacities as you mentioned as a matter

1252
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:49,559
of know-how

1253
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:53,700
it seems that we still miss something

1254
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:57,420
about communication for instance and on

1255
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,339
the other hand I think and this is my

1256
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:02,819
Innovation but I think that we could in

1257
00:58:02,819 --> 00:58:05,400
principle talk about

1258
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,400
how

1259
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,180
understanding what you just said and

1260
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,119
trying to respond to it is a matter of

1261
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,359
knowing how to behave linguistically

1262
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:23,099
but I think that even this movement

1263
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:25,440
to treat high levels of

1264
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,119
combinationalists which made it a matter

1265
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,700
of know-how it still leaves something

1266
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:34,920
out I am at I mean personally I am

1267
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,099
and pleased with it I think at some

1268
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,680
level we've got to say that well that is

1269
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,079
another kind of approach that is needed

1270
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:46,500
here to explain how we communicate for

1271
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,780
instance in

1272
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:50,520
periodically not to say that it does not

1273
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:55,559
involve and now but it's not just that I

1274
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:58,859
think that at least more than practical

1275
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:01,280
knowledge is needed

1276
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,380
but maybe the key here is to think of

1277
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:06,839
practical knowledge just basic and

1278
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:10,200
necessary for other sorts of other other

1279
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,359
kinds of knowledge that they are needed

1280
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:16,020
to engage in this sort of Exchange

1281
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:19,319
maybe maybe the maybe this is one layer

1282
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:20,880
I'm sure that

1283
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,700
well

1284
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,740
uh more has to be

1285
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,160
said about this to give them a more

1286
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,740
informative answer but this is a at

1287
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:34,319
least my current position is that

1288
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,720
no how provides the basis of our

1289
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,119
engagement with the world and with

1290
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:42,540
others but that some juncture we have to

1291
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:45,599
to be able to develop other kinds of

1292
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,359
understanding to explain a terrorists to

1293
00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:51,240
explain the complex sorts of uh

1294
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,660
exchanges we have in our daily lives

1295
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:57,960
such as reading papers as you said

1296
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,680
I I agree I think

1297
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,799
framing know that as the basis and then

1298
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:10,740
recovering know how is a challenge and

1299
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,079
it's also a challenge to begin with the

1300
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:15,260
basal cognitive processes as being

1301
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:20,160
enacted no house and to reassemble those

1302
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,040
know-how pieces into know that again

1303
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,680
it's not necessarily even a simple

1304
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,619
challenge but would we rather confront

1305
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:32,900
the challenge of assembling symbolic

1306
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,720
propositional declarative verbal

1307
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,260
Etc cognitive processes from a more

1308
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:41,420
liminal

1309
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:44,700
ecological cognitive approach

1310
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:49,140
or try to recover the ecological from

1311
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,200
the turing machine in a sense so it

1312
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,760
seems like

1313
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,960
um

1314
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,599
you're speaking in support of grounding

1315
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,260
in ecological plausible basal cognitive

1316
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:03,299
processes and then working towards

1317
01:01:03,299 --> 01:01:07,020
assembling the skyscraper

1318
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:09,420
yes yes yeah totally yeah I think it's

1319
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:10,940
well

1320
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:16,220
both are uh those both approaches are

1321
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:18,960
difficult to to

1322
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,260
to assemble as you said to to to provide

1323
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,540
this uh sort of explanation either

1324
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:27,780
bottom left or top down but I am more

1325
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:30,359
favorable of course to the the one web

1326
01:01:30,359 --> 01:01:33,240
approach I think it also for another

1327
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:37,380
reason it it seems to the point of

1328
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:40,920
departure seems to be uh on biological

1329
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,020
description of how we interact with the

1330
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,599
world and the other way around it seems

1331
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,720
to be much more difficult to explain uh

1332
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,319
how we come up with this uh biological

1333
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:54,000
questions such as our body morphology

1334
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,059
and such it seems that we have to first

1335
01:01:57,059 --> 01:02:00,920
account for that and then we we get to

1336
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,839
the the other questions which are also

1337
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:07,260
hard to to answer but at the very least

1338
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:10,140
I I think it's a

1339
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:13,040
the bottom up approach is more

1340
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,780
integrative you know is that the chances

1341
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,079
are it seems to be more

1342
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:21,900
uh in our favor in the sense

1343
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,180
and and the way you just kind of framed

1344
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:26,160
it made me think that if you were to

1345
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,579
program a computer from scratch

1346
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,220
it could be an abstract or a virtual

1347
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,559
computer so it doesn't even need to have

1348
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,780
a specific embodiment

1349
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:40,079
and in that situation one might be

1350
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,319
concerned with assembling

1351
01:02:43,319 --> 01:02:47,040
know that assert that and assembling

1352
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,740
these declarative

1353
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:52,799
statements and logic processes into

1354
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:57,299
something that is more dynamical or in

1355
01:02:57,299 --> 01:02:59,819
interacting with the environment however

1356
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:02,220
that process of like full stack

1357
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,839
engineering

1358
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,839
with logic and silicone at the base

1359
01:03:06,839 --> 01:03:11,040
is quite different from how we got here

1360
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,980
and so it might but it's it's

1361
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,599
complimentary

1362
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:18,059
um well you gave a little visibility

1363
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:21,960
into uh I guess the before during and

1364
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,140
after of peer review so I was just

1365
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:28,319
curious what

1366
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:32,160
changed during and after the paper like

1367
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,200
over the last months or years or however

1368
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,599
long it was how did you evolve on this

1369
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:39,839
and then what do you see as relevant

1370
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,780
next steps whether they're for you or

1371
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:44,640
just general to be done are we looking

1372
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,339
for a brain measurement are we looking

1373
01:03:47,339 --> 01:03:50,099
for a video camera in a forest are we

1374
01:03:50,099 --> 01:03:53,640
looking for a conceptual Advance what is

1375
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,339
going to move forward past your

1376
01:03:56,339 --> 01:03:57,980
developments

1377
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:01,680
that's that's a great question I think

1378
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,579
um

1379
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:06,480
I I'm not completely satisfied with the

1380
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,299
way I always find the people at the

1381
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:12,000
conceptual level I don't know if this

1382
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,240
any of these would be carried out in uh

1383
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,700
I honestly don't know if you could in

1384
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,859
principle carried out in other empirical

1385
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:21,680
terms but

1386
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:27,359
uh I'm not saying that uh well one is I

1387
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:28,980
would write it a bit differently today

1388
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,920
not that it's uh not that I disagree

1389
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,599
with the paper originally but I think I

1390
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:39,059
there's something some points that I

1391
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:41,880
would like to reframe but they do not

1392
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,040
authorize I think he had a new paper

1393
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:49,079
but maybe in the future but this is

1394
01:04:49,079 --> 01:04:50,359
something that

1395
01:04:50,359 --> 01:04:52,920
uh the questions such as the myths of

1396
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,480
the evening which is still the

1397
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,680
philosophical question

1398
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:59,940
and conceptual one they still uh bother

1399
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:02,700
me but I have yet to

1400
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,760
to find opportunity to develop these

1401
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,359
ideas more carefully and the the general

1402
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:12,660
view I put forth there I think I I think

1403
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:14,280
it still stands

1404
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,319
uh but

1405
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:17,099
um

1406
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:20,579
I would like I I still

1407
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:23,760
I'm waiting for this chance to elaborate

1408
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,220
it further and see how far I can get but

1409
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:28,200
I don't know yet I must admit I don't

1410
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,180
know what are the the future

1411
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:33,839
developments of this idea but um I've

1412
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:37,160
been working on several isolated

1413
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,079
issues on this approach

1414
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,299
for the last few years I've worked with

1415
01:05:42,299 --> 01:05:45,480
the notion of information and scientific

1416
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,700
understanding and information for

1417
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,799
ecological and and activists of

1418
01:05:49,799 --> 01:05:52,460
combination and recently I am working

1419
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:56,640
more recently with a few colleges on

1420
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,680
virtual reality and perception

1421
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,799
recognition so uh

1422
01:06:01,799 --> 01:06:05,880
this is how I like to to conduct my

1423
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,680
research to find interesting

1424
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,440
uh questions and see how how can I deal

1425
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,540
with them but not necessarily find

1426
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:16,799
myself

1427
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:20,040
uh tied to one

1428
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,980
one line of reasoning by the way so this

1429
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,480
is what happened at the time I was

1430
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,520
working with rationality if I thought it

1431
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,760
was a very cool subject and uh I still

1432
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,220
think it is but I haven't had the time

1433
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:34,619
to come back and reframe what I wanted

1434
01:06:34,619 --> 01:06:40,440
to but uh maybe maybe sometime in the

1435
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,619
near future I don't know but more the

1436
01:06:43,619 --> 01:06:45,599
most recent thing I've been working on

1437
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:46,980
does not involved in cellular

1438
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:49,500
rationality but I think some products

1439
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,319
could be wrong which is that of uh

1440
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:56,460
virtual reality and how does uh visual

1441
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:58,260
reality actually compares to combination

1442
01:06:58,260 --> 01:06:59,460
because

1443
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,400
well there's obviously something missing

1444
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,940
from a perseverance in a visual

1445
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:08,160
environment right

1446
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:12,059
um there is of course if I someone for

1447
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:14,460
instance if if I'm on a visual

1448
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:17,339
environment where I am under a kind of

1449
01:07:17,339 --> 01:07:20,819
threat I may feel something analogous to

1450
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:23,160
fear but I'm not really fearing for my

1451
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,059
life

1452
01:07:24,059 --> 01:07:27,000
and imagine this that the person on the

1453
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,700
virtual reality so is it rational to to

1454
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,260
run away from

1455
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,839
the the that threat the visual threat

1456
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:36,319
and so on so forth this is this the the

1457
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,240
this is what I'm working on and uh maybe

1458
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:42,180
it's it provides a point of return to

1459
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:43,140
this

1460
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,780
the idea of radical and active

1461
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:49,740
rationality and in fact uh the paper

1462
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:52,740
just got accepted so as I was telling

1463
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:55,140
you before I was so busy these last few

1464
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:57,599
days because we were correcting proofs

1465
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:01,700
my colleagues and I never figured

1466
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:06,140
uh and I I was

1467
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:09,059
with a tight schedule too

1468
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:11,280
to submit the corrected version of the

1469
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,900
paper in the last few weeks and then I

1470
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,680
got the proofs and

1471
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,698
well maybe uh in the future I can come

1472
01:08:20,698 --> 01:08:22,319
back to the issue of rationality I'd

1473
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:24,660
like to but I don't know if I I don't

1474
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,520
know I I really can't foresee the

1475
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,219
developments of that but uh in general I

1476
01:08:29,219 --> 01:08:31,799
still agree with my original idea but

1477
01:08:31,799 --> 01:08:36,060
I'll frame it differently a little bit

1478
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:39,420
so the VR point I'm sure that there's a

1479
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:43,920
lot more to say there but it reminded me

1480
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,698
of just the title virtual reality it's a

1481
01:08:47,698 --> 01:08:50,100
virtualization and so in the same way

1482
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:51,420
that

1483
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,939
cognitive action planning

1484
01:08:53,939 --> 01:08:56,880
allows us to entertain

1485
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,060
policies that our body doesn't take

1486
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:02,160
if only to evaluate them and choose

1487
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,560
against them but we can go on a flight

1488
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,040
of fancy have a Whimsical policy

1489
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,540
selection process

1490
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:11,698
of counterfactuals

1491
01:09:11,698 --> 01:09:13,080
mentally

1492
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,600
but then our morphology is kind of like

1493
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,279
our Lifeline you know if you actually

1494
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,799
fall off a ledge then it's going to hurt

1495
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:23,759
and then in virtual reality

1496
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,399
you're embodied

1497
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,759
perceptual experience is quite literally

1498
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,339
a virtualization of

1499
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:36,000
survival critical situations so you

1500
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,920
might see yourself as being on a ledge

1501
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,500
but you're on a flat floor

1502
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,020
and then in that situation

1503
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,600
if you're kind of

1504
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,000
um a cognitive Observer outside of the

1505
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,460
video game you might say well it's

1506
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,380
rational for me just to fall off to see

1507
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:53,520
what happens

1508
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,620
so that's like but then there's a layer

1509
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:58,920
of rationality within the space yes like

1510
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:02,400
what's a good move in the game

1511
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,920
um and so it's kind of blurring the line

1512
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:05,590
between

1513
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:07,199
[Music]

1514
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:11,219
it's it's blurring the criticality of

1515
01:10:11,219 --> 01:10:13,679
the body and um

1516
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:15,000
well

1517
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,380
I'm sure you've thought about this much

1518
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,060
more so how does this play into our

1519
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:19,500
virtual reality

1520
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,000
um with the ways we think about and use

1521
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,280
and design these systems

1522
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,620
well this is the the the the the the

1523
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:28,380
questions that motivated us to write a

1524
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:31,860
paper and uh not uh give them and I was

1525
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,560
that in the technical literature you see

1526
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,900
that a lot of researchers working with

1527
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,659
the uh treat uh visual perception as

1528
01:10:39,659 --> 01:10:43,860
illusory a kind of Illusion but we were

1529
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,960
a bit bothered by that because on the

1530
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,239
other hand it only works in VR because

1531
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:52,320
we we embodied the devices devices they

1532
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,900
work for us you have the controllers you

1533
01:10:54,900 --> 01:11:00,540
have the the headset and uh it seems so

1534
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:03,840
weird to say that the user the the user

1535
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,600
is under a kind of Illusion

1536
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:10,020
and on the other hand it seems that it's

1537
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:12,659
not actually cognition because as you

1538
01:11:12,659 --> 01:11:16,640
said there is no there is no biological

1539
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,460
relevance to those uh cognitive States

1540
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:23,219
so to speak for instance if I see an

1541
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:26,520
apple in VR it's it does not afford

1542
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,640
nourishing but it makes sense within the

1543
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:33,179
game right but the different uh well

1544
01:11:33,179 --> 01:11:36,540
what I perceive an apple in a in an

1545
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:38,880
actual environment it is it affords

1546
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,400
nourishment it is something I can eat

1547
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,400
but not in VR I can pretend to

1548
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,719
so we coined this concept of allusion to

1549
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:49,739
explain

1550
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:52,800
it is as if we were

1551
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,159
facing an actual animal but it involves

1552
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,620
also this volition of play this idea

1553
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,860
that we are not

1554
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:04,140
being sled because we put on the

1555
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:07,320
equipment we know we are in the game and

1556
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,540
this I think is a hot subject right now

1557
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:12,300
because there's metaphors method and I

1558
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:16,460
am very skeptical of whatever that can

1559
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:20,159
people are very optimistic but about the

1560
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:22,380
possibilities of the metaverse and some

1561
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,480
others really think that we could be in

1562
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,540
a simulation institutely speaking but I

1563
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:29,880
mean the best technology the current

1564
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,000
technology shows us is that it's very

1565
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
limited and you can pretend to be in a

1566
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,159
certain environment and so forth and

1567
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:42,179
this I think may offer a new new ways of

1568
01:12:42,179 --> 01:12:43,739
thinking of

1569
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:45,659
thinking about rationality in this

1570
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:48,060
visual environment in ways that maybe

1571
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:49,860
Russians do something that environment

1572
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,780
has said to jump off the television see

1573
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:55,620
what happens and on the other hand

1574
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,679
behavioral aspects of doing so sometimes

1575
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:01,199
people actually feel fear and people

1576
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:04,140
face the street for phobias with virtual

1577
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:05,219
realities

1578
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:06,540
and

1579
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:09,000
um it's it's a lot of there's a lot of

1580
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,140
interesting questions there that

1581
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:15,900
maybe I mean for future research we can

1582
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,780
yeah back to it it made me think about

1583
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:21,900
how the Apple in real life it could be

1584
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,820
calories for you but also it could be

1585
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:26,699
calories for a fly it could be thrown

1586
01:13:26,699 --> 01:13:28,679
you could use it as a hammer you could

1587
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:30,239
paint it right so

1588
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,860
ecology

1589
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:34,080
and the generative process as we'd say

1590
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,540
an active inference kind of

1591
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:39,780
is always going Beyond

1592
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:42,719
whatever affordances were programmed in

1593
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:46,560
for a given object and then also

1594
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,679
um the current discourse on VR focuses

1595
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,140
heavily on headsets

1596
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:54,300
just speaking totally anecdotally not

1597
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,580
not my expert area

1598
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:58,980
um it seems a little bit interesting

1599
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,719
it's like as if the mobile phone

1600
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,179
discussion was only focused on

1601
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:06,060
rectangles of a certain size

1602
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:10,080
what makes this not virtual reality it's

1603
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,940
like looking through a window and

1604
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:14,940
there's another fellow to speak with so

1605
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:16,380
it's not attached to my head it doesn't

1606
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:19,080
have some of the motion tracking

1607
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:22,320
um capacities that some technologies

1608
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,800
have but it is

1609
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,080
a niche modification in Perry personal

1610
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,100
space

1611
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,380
and we can push

1612
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:35,040
signals and affordances to each other

1613
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:40,140
so having a VR framing or really just a

1614
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:43,500
framing of rationality and perception

1615
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,780
cognition action Cycles

1616
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,159
that

1617
01:14:47,159 --> 01:14:51,060
aren't just constrained to one specific

1618
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:54,540
realization or Hardware type and could

1619
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:58,020
run the gamut from Total offline

1620
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:00,179
person in a field

1621
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:03,360
to somebody who's very

1622
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,699
in The Matrix

1623
01:15:05,699 --> 01:15:07,560
seems pretty relevant otherwise new

1624
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:09,840
technologies even little variants and

1625
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,300
software updates will continue to just

1626
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:16,100
infinitely surprise and confuse

1627
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,679
yeah I think it's a it's a it's hard to

1628
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,520
define the uh

1629
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:27,260
I mean we are here in an exchange which

1630
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:29,580
I think it could in principle be

1631
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,500
classified as a form of virtual reality

1632
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,480
of course I'm seeing your own your C

1633
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,699
mind but

1634
01:15:34,699 --> 01:15:39,360
uh I mean most I think works out they

1635
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,719
nowadays they they find it a doc by

1636
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,239
saying that well must have a headset and

1637
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:48,120
sometimes a controller but but other

1638
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,920
than that it's not spiritual reality but

1639
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,620
yeah it's hard to Define anything uh

1640
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:55,199
it's not it's not a dump and

1641
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:56,760
straightforward as one will think

1642
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:00,960
because on uh talking commercially of

1643
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,300
course virtual reality means headsets

1644
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:07,219
and and other paraphernalia but a phone

1645
01:16:07,219 --> 01:16:09,840
just talking on the phone or a telegraph

1646
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,699
in that time

1647
01:16:11,699 --> 01:16:14,340
it would have been on that interface

1648
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,320
with that sensory modality and with

1649
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,540
those affordances it is the

1650
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,820
virtualization

1651
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:23,340
yeah that we have access to of just a

1652
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:25,739
different chapter today

1653
01:16:25,739 --> 01:16:27,960
yeah I think so yes part of our paper

1654
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,500
was to argue that in a way embodying

1655
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:34,080
technological devices is obviously in

1656
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,080
the need not that's not new it is the

1657
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,580
mark of Being Human

1658
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,560
it's embodying technological devices

1659
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,520
what made us what we are since the

1660
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,179
beginning using analytic technology

1661
01:16:47,179 --> 01:16:51,300
and the fact that we can embody it so

1662
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:54,360
proficiently a device even if it is

1663
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:59,100
programmed to for instance uh in within

1664
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:01,620
virtual reality to have something a

1665
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:04,920
creature you control us richer with new

1666
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,560
morphology another morphology for

1667
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,840
instance even if that's the case it only

1668
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,000
happens so proficiently because we are

1669
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,040
able to embody the device some

1670
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,739
experiments have shown that you can map

1671
01:17:16,739 --> 01:17:20,580
for instance a Twist of your wrist to a

1672
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:22,100
third arm

1673
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:25,620
uh that individual reality goes from was

1674
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:28,679
that from your chest and people can

1675
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:31,260
learn to control this third arm that

1676
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:33,120
doesn't map into our actual morphology

1677
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:37,440
but it can be made so by a Twist of the

1678
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:38,640
wrist so

1679
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,380
this is something we will discussed in

1680
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,780
our paper that well you can

1681
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:45,300
you can only do that because you embody

1682
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,159
the device so you can see it's an

1683
01:17:47,159 --> 01:17:48,300
illusion

1684
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:50,940
it's actually well

1685
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:54,000
part of what means being human is to

1686
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,480
embody technological devices so

1687
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:01,020
I would go that way I mean I know it

1688
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:02,760
blurs the distinction between virtual

1689
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:05,580
and non-virtual but I think that's one

1690
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:08,719
way of dealing with this

1691
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:11,100
cool is there anything else you want to

1692
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:14,760
talk about ask or just kind of Prelude

1693
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,640
ah well I I'd like to thank you for the

1694
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,800
opportunity to discuss this paper it was

1695
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,199
very nice for me I I really enjoyed it

1696
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:25,440
and this is uh very nice and uh

1697
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,659
comfortable environment to discuss these

1698
01:18:27,659 --> 01:18:30,320
issues and think I think once again

1699
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:34,080
thank you yeah awesome discussion and

1700
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,239
important topics and we'll be happy to

1701
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:38,640
talk to you again anytime

1702
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:43,280
okay thank you farewell thank you
