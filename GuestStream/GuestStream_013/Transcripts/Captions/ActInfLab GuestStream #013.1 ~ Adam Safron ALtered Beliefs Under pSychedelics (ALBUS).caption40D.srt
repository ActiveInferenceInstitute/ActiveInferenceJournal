00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,210
Hi. I'm Bleu Knight.

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,911
I'm here with Daniel Friedman.

3
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:15,148
Today is November 8th, 2021

4
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:18,818
for a guest stream with Adam Safron.

5
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:23,156
Adam, please take it away.

6
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,192
Bleu. Daniel Hi, everyone.

7
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,761
It's good to be talking with you today.

8
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:32,732
And I guess we're here to talk
about psychedelics and the five issue

9
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,935
and related systems and active inference.

10
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:41,541
And so I'll describe some recent work
on this

11
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,843
and looking forward
to talking about it with you.

12
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,781
So let me get my screen

13
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:51,818
sharing on

14
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,225
coming to.

15
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,193
Excellent.

16
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:05,298
So, um, I'm using my

17
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:11,371
active inference
workshop slides as a base

18
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:14,941
and I'll go through those
with a little bit slower than I did.

19
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,010
The 10 minutes I had there.

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,414
And then we'll take it from
there and talk it out. So

21
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:23,883
this is

22
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,753
part of an ongoing project to both try

23
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,656
to understand
the mechanisms of psychedelics,

24
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:36,763
but also the impacted neurotransmitter
modulator systems and the roles

25
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:41,701
they would have in an active inference
and their potential significance for

26
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:46,139
their use as machine
learning parameters, potentially.

27
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,608
And so when it comes to psychedelics,

28
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,378
much of the attention has been on the

29
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,280
five to a system

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,151
and that's a lot of evidence indicates
that it mediates the effects.

31
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:03,256
Barely any work has been done in machine
learning on this

32
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,126
and it has been worked on
in active inference.

33
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,997
And I'm going to introduce some
a compatible but slightly different take

34
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:15,902
on the potential significances
of these systems.

35
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,571
So within machine learning,

36
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,774
a good amount of work end
with an act of inference has been done

37
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:25,178
on the potential roles
of dopamine as a parameter

38
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,915
encoding the

39
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,818
confidence one might have with respect
to policy selection,

40
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:37,657
Diane and others have suggested
that serotonin can act with an impotency

41
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:42,061
of dopamine based on a variety of lines
of evidence from neurophysiology.

42
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,965
And so some work has also been done
in introducing a complementary

43
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,735
uncertainty parameter
in the form of serotonin.

44
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,473
This opponent
C can be thought of almost a yin yang,

45
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,976
like with dopamine being more of the yang
and serotonin being more of the yin

46
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,914
dopamine in general,
indicating the neuroscience,

47
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:05,885
literature, literatures,
incentive salience, confidence,

48
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:09,822
and if excessive potentially impulsivity,
serotonin

49
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,494
would be an opponent C
or an or complementarity

50
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:19,532
would indicate the satisfaction,
desires, states of uncertainty

51
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:25,004
and potentially a factor
helping to allow for patience

52
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,874
rather than impulsivity
with respect to policy selection.

53
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:34,614
So very little
work, though, has been done in machine

54
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:38,751
learning on five issue to A
and also in terms of active inference

55
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:42,822
in terms of actually modeling
the five issue to a system as an active

56
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:46,893
inference parameter work is probably
going to begin soon in this direction,

57
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,463
largely informed by the Rebus paradigm,
which we'll talk about soon.

58
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,268
But go back to the fundamentals
of these systems.

59
00:03:56,936 --> 00:04:00,106
The work that's been done
so far with the serotonin system

60
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,543
can be thought of more
as relating to the one system.

61
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:09,082
This would be in contrast
to the higher thresholds.

62
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,985
I believe it's a
5 to 1 ratio of sensitivity

63
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,554
for the receptor of the two system.

64
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,924
So when serotonin, both of these
both of so

65
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,427
five is serotonin and you have some,

66
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:26,599
I think 14, maybe 17 classes of receptors
depending on how you count them.

67
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:31,804
But, you know, so I want to talk about
all of them, maybe eventually, but

68
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,807
it seems that

69
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,877
we might be able to go a fair ways focus

70
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,313
in terms of understanding
their significance,

71
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:44,384
focusing on a few classes
and sort of working our way forward

72
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:48,821
with the additional receptors,
maybe having a common significance

73
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,824
to the other ones,
but just because they're located in

74
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,761
different parts of the brain
is a common and significance.

75
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:55,962
But functionally,

76
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,898
you need them to do different things
if located in different places

77
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,600
into more detail.

78
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,404
So but the one AI system

79
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,573
is shown to in
general have more inhibitory effects on

80
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,378
the signaling of pyramidal neurons,
while the five AC to a system tends

81
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:17,583
to be more excitatory, carhart-harris
and nut have suggested

82
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:22,855
that these both in a face of challenge,
would be responses to challenge.

83
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,793
But the one aim might be something
more like an active or a passive coping

84
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,896
response being more still,

85
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:33,566
patients stop
and think as opposed to the to a system

86
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:38,104
which might be more of an active
coping response in the face of challenge,

87
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:42,675
something more imaginative
and potentially creative. So

88
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,351
let's let's keep going.

89
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:55,788
So going back to dopamine versus
serotonin.

90
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,626
Serotonin in general, not focusing
necessarily on one avers is to say

91
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:05,865
there seems to be some evidence
suggesting that dopamine

92
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,469
will push you or actually a good amount,
that dopamine tends to push

93
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,239
the organism towards
more externally focused attention

94
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,276
in terms of helping
to increase the gain on more exterior

95
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:21,080
supportive and salience networks
for externally focused attention.

96
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,016
So I think she, in contrast,
seems to be up regulating

97
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,553
the default mode
and more internally focused attention.

98
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,189
So that's another interesting

99
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,324
difference.

100
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,727
But to come to the two,
so these receptors, as I mentioned

101
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,163
before, they tend to have

102
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:40,166
high thresholds
for activation by serotonin

103
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:45,905
one, they will be modulating
mood as your sirtuin levels

104
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,775
are going up and down, you might get
this sort of gentle adjustment,

105
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:53,946
but to a it's going to take more
to really get those systems going.

106
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,047
In fact,

107
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,751
some of their activity might be modulated
by things other than serotonin.

108
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:03,122
So there's evidence
that things like carbon dioxide,

109
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:07,760
maybe blood acidity in general
is changing their activity.

110
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:13,232
And maybe the endogenous DMT system,
which we could talk about later. So

111
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,537
psychedelics tend to come in

112
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:23,042
two classes, one
or class of psychedelics.

113
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,310
One would be based

114
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,814
on the structure, structure of trip
to being the precursor of serotonin.

115
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,616
And the other would be based
on the structure of

116
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,753
funnel, ethyl amine
precursor of catch it.

117
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,789
All elements of both of these
seem to be active at the five issue

118
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,826
to a system which

119
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,861
variety of lines of evidence
have been shown to mediate

120
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:46,566
the effects of psychedelics
to a very substantial degree.

121
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,302
So in the

122
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:53,306
machine learning type work,
I've been collaborating with JIRA

123
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:58,411
six by he to try to reverse engineer

124
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,447
these different neuro modulators
as machine learning parameters.

125
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:05,485
And so we've been using an architecture

126
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,855
which has elements of metaphors,

127
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:12,458
world models and dangerous dreamer

128
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:16,429
to interpret of five

129
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,632
signaling as potentially being a

130
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:23,503
as the different classes of receptors,
as parameters for imaginative

131
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,739
planning or an active inference
terms, a sophisticated inference.

132
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,242
So with

133
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,578
respect to all models,
you'll see as it's working, it's working.

134
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,780
So an enhancement.

135
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,416
Hoover's architecture,
they'll use these auto encoders

136
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,784
to take these different frames.

137
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,620
This is in a Doom game.

138
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,523
They'll compress them into a lower
dimensional latent space,

139
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:48,027
and then they will unpack these
and through this

140
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,464
training of the auto encoder
to learn how to reconstitute

141
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:56,802
these frames, you get this low dimension
source of low

142
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:01,541
dimensional vectors and latent space
which can be used for training and

143
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:05,578
with much better computational efficiency
and some learning properties.

144
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,479
When you don't have to go

145
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,914
all the way back to pixel space

146
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,816
where things can get messy
and you don't know what's causing what.

147
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,553
If you work with this latent space,

148
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,357
you can come out
substantially ahead in terms of training.

149
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:19,392
And so

150
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,029
you have this variational on encoder,
which is learning how to compress scenes.

151
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,933
So this is one aspect of or compress
the observations.

152
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,937
You then feed this latent space,
compressed vectors

153
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,673
into this recurrent network

154
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,776
which learns to predict
the state transitions,

155
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,779
shove this into a much lower
dimensional controller,

156
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,783
which they trained
with evolutionary strategies,

157
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,920
and then use this for policy selection,
generating new observation

158
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,824
and the standard
sort of reinforcement learning paradigm.

159
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,260
The interesting

160
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,363
thing about this is
they could also be run offline.

161
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:01,434
So you're able to take these
and take the outputs

162
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,371
and feed it right back in
and you can do imaginative roles.

163
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,173
So you can use this for planning

164
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:11,310
or for having the agent train
in this imagination.

165
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:15,681
And so this would be an example
I believe left would be,

166
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,385
but seen in the left would be

167
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,923
the compressed latent space
and then the right would be the agent.

168
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,125
Actually, I think the left is
what was actually seen.

169
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:30,062
This is pixel space and the right is the
the emergence of latent space.

170
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,568
So it tends to be you're not really
seeing it here, but it tense these

171
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:40,539
imagine trainings like imagination
relative to perception or sensation.

172
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,143
It's less
fidelity, but you can still use it

173
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:49,248
for the sake of planning and learning.

174
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,652
But one issue is that

175
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,220
these agents can do

176
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,190
a kind of self adversarial tack
when they're training their imagination.

177
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,594
So if the temperature of the uncertainty
isn't high enough,

178
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,930
they can basically come up
with these sort of fantasies

179
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,334
of easy environments
where they are just winning,

180
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,037
but then this doesn't
transfer to the real world.

181
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,240
And so then by introducing
a temperature parameter

182
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:18,177
to increase the uncertainty
of your imaginative rollouts,

183
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,380
this allows for better
training back to the real world.

184
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,648
And so this,

185
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,918
I've been suggesting,
is essentially one interpretation

186
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:29,955
of the 541 system.

187
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:34,460
The is increasing the temperature
putting the organism

188
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:38,798
basically instead of dopamine
would be your confidence go forth and act

189
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,068
serotonin acting on the one SS would say

190
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:46,872
we're not so confident, stop and think
or imagine, don't act right away,

191
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,109
but let's let's think this out
or let's imaginatively plan this out.

192
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:54,213
Look a little bit in our mind's eye
before we leave the two.

193
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,750
It seems like it's almost like a hybrid

194
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,954
of the one A and opening
where it's like, okay, imagine more,

195
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:06,358
but it's not necessarily doing
so under a state of uncertainty

196
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:11,130
within these imaginative worlds,
things are appearing more vivid.

197
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:16,502
But where the gap between imagination
and reality seems to be narrowing

198
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:20,039
and the ideas of
if you're thinking back to like

199
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,209
passive versus active coping,
so you're uncertain.

200
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,511
Let's say the one system is in the mix.

201
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,712
Now you're okay.

202
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:31,217
I'm not going to overtly act and I stop
and think I'm to reduce the gain on the

203
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:35,287
expected free energy or the expected
value of pursuing a policy.

204
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:35,855
Right now

205
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,990
patients.

206
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,794
But if the two I gets in the mix,
it's going to tend to be more active.

207
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:45,030
You're going to be imagining,
but you're going to be

208
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,000
more likely to act on these imaginings
because you're

209
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,137
they're more compelling, more vivid.

210
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,975
So now we're coming back to psychedelics.

211
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:59,411
I want to lay out this foundation
because the whole way through the method

212
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:03,249
is basically a kind of Marion
neuro phenomenology,

213
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:08,220
trying to understand the mind
at computational functional algorithmic

214
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,725
and implementation levels of analysis,
and then mapping this on to

215
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:18,297
rich descriptions of experience,
subjective experience of mapping

216
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,834
standard, the cognitive science
multilevel start to phenomenology.

217
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:26,205
And so the machine learning
is part of pulling off this mapping.

218
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:30,142
We can use our active
inference as part of that. So

219
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,878
to rehearse the basics of

220
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:36,782
Rebus, but I might come across a writer
checking in.

221
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,085
Okay, so relax.

222
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,854
Police under psychedelics.

223
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:46,158
This, I'd say, might be
the dominant paradigm for understanding

224
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,461
the significance of the five
C to a system

225
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:54,867
in creating the effects of psychedelics
under a predictive processing paradigm.

226
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:00,206
So according to Rebus, you will get

227
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,743
I don't think I have to rehearse
predictive coding here, but very briefly,

228
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:08,480
the idea is you have a hierarchy
where of predictions,

229
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,984
where you are passing your priors
or your prediction errors

230
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,619
down the hierarchy,

231
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:17,056
back towards primary modalities
where the observations are coming in

232
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:21,026
and then you're passing
prediction errors upwards.

233
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:25,831
And this coding scheme is efficient,
especially if the events that you're

234
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:30,603
tracking or trying to model are clocking
slower to the internal state.

235
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:36,675
So something like telecommunications,
if all you have to do is transmit

236
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:41,580
what's different between the frames
and it's not a 24 hertz seems to be

237
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,684
what TV was back in the day, but most of
the pixels are largely the same frame.

238
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,854
The frame and all you do is you show
what's it's difference.

239
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:52,491
You get this energy savings and you're
dealing with an organ as hungry

240
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:57,363
as a brain, 2 to 3% of your body
mass, 20% of the budgets of that.

241
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,999
That savings could be substantial.

242
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,401
And in a natural world of the quick
and the dead

243
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,404
natural selection
might have picked such a thing.

244
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,007
So within creative coding,

245
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:12,711
the predictions
are thought to be encoded by these.

246
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,848
So if you think of cortex, as

247
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,584
Jeff Hawkins says, it's roughly

248
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,120
a dinner napkin and thickness and extent

249
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,756
that's been crumpled up
and shoved into your head.

250
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:27,459
Cortex
has these different layers, roughly six.

251
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:28,928
And so

252
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,197
and this is distinct from like levels of
a hierarchy, but the cortex, the sheet,

253
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:36,168
if you go like across the napkin,
there's these layers about six

254
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,271
and depending on where you are,
they're more or less distinct.

255
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:44,076
But the L5 or the deep pyramidal neurons,
these are ones that will leave cortex,

256
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,713
do things like form loops with thalamus,
the stratum,

257
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,684
cerebellum, spine and

258
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,721
that's what will is thought
to encode your predictions.

259
00:15:56,055 --> 00:16:00,159
These L5 deep, primal neurons,
not deep in terms of a deep belief

260
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,963
hierarchy, but deep in terms of relative
to the cortical surface.

261
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,097
More in there

262
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,500
and within the napkin,

263
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,337
the prediction errors
are thought to be encoded

264
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,839
by the superficial pyramidal neurons.

265
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,341
Layers two three.

266
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:20,079
So L five is forming these big
synchronous complexes with the thalamus

267
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,682
probably not the only way
it does the predictions, but this will be

268
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,652
aggregating information
from multiple different places,

269
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,723
giving you and because you're able
to get a lot of different

270
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,925
causes brought together, it's
going to be a good source of priors.

271
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,395
It's going to be good source
of your expectation and your modeling.

272
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:42,301
And then you use this to try to suppress
the ascending stream of prediction

273
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,504
errors along this superficial layer
two or three.

274
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,640
You can go into layer later
if that's useful,

275
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,643
but the idea is that

276
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,480
with under psychedelics

277
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,183
you take l five pyramidal
neurons, these excitatory neurons,

278
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,286
and you excite them so much with 5 to 8

279
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,623
stimulation that they fall out of sync
with each other.

280
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:05,858
And it's,

281
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,828
it's a kind of paradoxical effect,
but when they fire too

282
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,232
readily, they don't coordinate any more
in establishing a synchronous rhythm.

283
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:18,570
And because of this,
they're actually paradoxically relaxing.

284
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,672
The priors become less precise.

285
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:25,377
The belief or free energy
landscape becomes flatter.

286
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,414
And so the idea is,
with your expectations being less,

287
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:33,385
more information from the periphery
is capable of penetrating

288
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,389
deeper into the cortical hierarchy,
registering more in consciousness,

289
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:41,527
and impacting learning and updating
to a potentially greater degree.

290
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:45,931
And so this is a model of the much
of the phenomenology of psychedelics,

291
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:50,536
as well as their mechanism of
therapeutic action for helping people to

292
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,572
Pollan would say,
like how to change your mind,

293
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,075
helping you to change
and change your mind to update.

294
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:57,676
And so

295
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:02,281
I think Rebus is largely correct,

296
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:06,418
but I've been introducing
a potential refinement of it

297
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:10,255
in something I call Albus, which includes
in addition to Rebus effects,

298
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,125
something I call service effects
or strengthened beliefs.

299
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,161
And so the idea is that

300
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,797
although you might not get exactly this

301
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:24,970
D synchronization effect
along the whole dose response curve of 5G

302
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:29,808
to a agonism of
or stimulation of the 5st to a receptor,

303
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,911
whether this might be the case
of what you would expect

304
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:37,349
from very high levels of agonism
the really strong excitation.

305
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:41,420
But let's say we increase the gain like
just a little bit or a moderate amount.

306
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,756
I suggest it's not at all
obvious that this would cause

307
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,024
the energy landscape to flatten.

308
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:49,561
This would not cause them necessarily
to fall out of sync with each other.

309
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,498
In fact, they might be able to sync up
even more powerfully

310
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:56,201
if you just increase it
a little bit or moderately.

311
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:57,503
We don't actually know.

312
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,139
This might vary
from organism to organism,

313
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:04,276
but the idea is we might need different
regimes, different accounts,

314
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,513
depending on where we are,
with what level of stimulation before

315
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,215
we would expect to see the kind
of paradoxical synchronization

316
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:14,653
or potentially more straightforward
enhanced synchronous ability

317
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,590
of the.

318
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:23,695
Yeah, so,
so bringing back to predictive coding.

319
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,032
So here, if you're going to try
to illustrate this,

320
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,302
the purple would be your deep
pyramidal neurons

321
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,839
supposedly encoding the erm
that are thought to encode your beliefs.

322
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,875
And then up top
you have the white circles.

323
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,378
This would be your superficial pyramidal
neurons,

324
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,980
the upper part of the layer
and this would be encoding

325
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,782
your prediction areas
that you're passing upwards.

326
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,685
And so you're seeing these I'm
illustrating the synchronous complexes

327
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:50,989
by these red swaths, the predictions
going downwards of these red arrows.

328
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:55,194
And then I'm depicting basically
the prediction errors as these gray swaps

329
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,564
and black arrows.

330
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,767
So within predictive coding,
there's been significance

331
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,737
assigned to different EEG
and frequency bands

332
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,874
as potentially corresponding more or less
to predictions or prediction errors.

333
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:13,912
More specifically, the slower rhythms
like alpha and beta, where alpha is

334
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,349
maybe roughly 8 to 12 times
a second, beta

335
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:21,453
is maybe 13 to 30 times
a second that these slower rhythms

336
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,424
would be the ones encoding
your predictions passed downwards,

337
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,994
but that your prediction errors
might be more likely to be encoded by

338
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:34,399
gamma frequencies,
you know, anywhere from 40 to 120

339
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,703
and even higher oscillations per second.

340
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:42,307
So within this part of the reason
that this might make some intuitive sense

341
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:46,511
is if you're thinking of the formation
of a synchronous

342
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,781
complex of neural activity that

343
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,717
faster would be

344
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:55,254
smaller and slower would be bigger
or more inclusive, more integrative.

345
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,389
This might make some intuitive sense

346
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,891
if you're thinking of, okay,
so you're trying to get this agreement,

347
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:03,362
this negotiation of a common rhythm
of a bunch of signaling units.

348
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:07,032
If you're having more units
spread over a bigger

349
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:10,202
distance, you're trying to get them
to go coming to agreement.

350
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,404
This might necessarily
have to be a slower process,

351
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,607
but if you're, let's say,
like quantifying prediction

352
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:19,511
or generally like a little packet
of like a local agreement that you're

353
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:24,783
passing upwards, well, that you could
potentially clock a lot quicker. So

354
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,452
that's the basic idea there.

355
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,122
So if you were to look at Rebus,

356
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:34,693
it would look something like you see the
the right bottom,

357
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,230
the swath of red

358
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:42,601
is more restricted in scope
and the arrows are a little bit smaller.

359
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,369
And so this is idea of
you've relaxed your beliefs.

360
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,838
This is if you get this paradoxical

361
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,875
D synchronization, but

362
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,012
and so once you have this
you're seeing less of these prediction

363
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:57,316
areas are being inhibited
by this descending stream of predictions

364
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:01,653
and they're able to make their way
in more deeper into the hierarchy.

365
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,090
And this would be showing very obviously,
the brain is not just one

366
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,025
singular hierarchy, but it's a hierarchy.

367
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:10,862
Multiple intersecting hierarchies,
corresponding to each of your modalities,

368
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,533
all brought together,
stitched together into a turkey

369
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:19,271
up top
would be illustrating a seabus effect.

370
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:27,245
And so the swath is bigger and the of
the arrows are also darker and bigger.

371
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,015
And that's and more prediction
errors are being inhibited.

372
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:35,520
There's an additional factor,
which is 542

373
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,459
A receptors are also found
on the inhibitor interneurons of layers.

374
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,794
Two three And so in theory

375
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,931
and there's some evidence,
I believe, that suggests this

376
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:50,435
this would correspond to a default
reduction in the gain on the ascending

377
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:54,272
stream of prediction areas, or
you would say an active inference speak

378
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,311
less precision weighting of the precision
of the prediction errors.

379
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,781
And so they have less of a contribution
of the Bayesian

380
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:05,450
updating that's happening
at each level of this belief hierarchy.

381
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,820
And so that's illustrated by a slightly

382
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,123
if this is

383
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:14,793
yeah, the the ground,
the arrows are a little bit smaller.

384
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,294
So the idea here

385
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:19,698
with a CBC effect would be not only might
you have stronger beliefs,

386
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,568
but these beliefs might be further
shielded from contradiction

387
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,771
by inconsistent sense data.

388
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:29,875
I think this potentially provides
a fairly parsimonious account

389
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:33,545
of some of the conditions under
which you get certain perceptual

390
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,014
alterations of a hallucinatory variety.

391
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:39,751
So for instance, people will
sometimes report hallucinations

392
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,421
in sensory deprivation tanks.

393
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,955
They'll sometimes a

394
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:48,026
I think it's called a Charles
Binney syndrome, where as you search,

395
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:52,664
let's say go blind or deaf, you'll start
to get like auditory or hallucinations

396
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:56,168
within the modality as you lose
input from the external world.

397
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,404
This also
you could think of at a higher level.

398
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,006
I don't know if this works,

399
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,742
but you can think of
potentially delusions in a similar way

400
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:08,880
a belief which is overly strong
and resistant to updating

401
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,351
from potentially contradictory
and potentially correct sense data.

402
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,786
So in theory,

403
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,056
for talking about serious effects,
you might have a single parsimonious

404
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:21,893
account
for both hallucinations and delusions.

405
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:23,195
That's

406
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,530
incorporating a little bit
more of the neuroanatomy.

407
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,734
That being said, I'm not saying at all
the rebus is incorrect.

408
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,971
I actually think it's
probably very correct and

409
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:38,543
maybe crucially important for explaining
some of the really powerful changes

410
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:42,180
that people observe of psychedelics
as a therapeutic intervention.

411
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,650
So again, to little more details here.

412
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,054
And so here you are with me
still the cash call.

413
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:53,825
So I mentioned a header of your earlier.

414
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,761
So I've taken these predictive
coding hierarchies here

415
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,397
and I'm just illustrating them
as these triangles.

416
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,501
And so here would be, let's say your

417
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,371
so I think in this

418
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,374
framework of Albus, I'm suggesting

419
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:13,411
we need to even in addition
to including things like seabus effects,

420
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:17,249
I think we're going to
need to take on things like

421
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,486
basically consciousness and

422
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:26,491
higher order consciousness to actually
really adequately explain what we mean

423
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:30,028
by relaxed or strengthened beliefs
and what actually is happening

424
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:34,599
with these different door modulators
and maybe attempts at creating analogs.

425
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,836
So here, you know, up top

426
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:41,072
would be similar sensation

427
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,276
to the right would be in your vision
and then you're hearing

428
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,611
and we're going to try
to bring all these things together.

429
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,047
And so if you're thinking
of some sort of hierarchy

430
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,516
here,
you might have a small beta complexes.

431
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:55,053
You can think of each of these
as like a small modeling effort

432
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:59,190
and a small belief over whatever's
in the scope of this synchronous complex,

433
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:03,328
where the idea being that
when you synchronize neurons,

434
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,065
this allows them to be aligned
in their activity in time such that

435
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,635
their signals can sum and be integrated
rather than decay.

436
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,973
And so this would allow you
to have potentially a joint belief over

437
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,542
whatever is in the scope
of a synchronous complex.

438
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,612
Pascal Freeze calls this communication
through coherence.

439
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:25,750
And for reference for this idea of like
an inverse hierarchy of size and speed,

440
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,320
but sharky would be a good reference
for that, I'd say.

441
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,589
So here we are on the left.

442
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,824
The beginnings of modeling of

443
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,061
increased hierarchical depth

444
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:39,698
with small fast
beta complexes, the extraction of things

445
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:44,102
like line segments, and maybe
basic contours and vision, basic

446
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,772
patterns within sound, within touch.

447
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,476
But then let's say we nest these within
maybe,

448
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,646
maybe slower, broad
or more encompassing data.

449
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,284
We can have more hierarchical structure
for our modeling effort.

450
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,554
And so here
you might start to get the beginnings

451
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,422
of things like objects
as you bring together

452
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:08,093
these different features,
the beginnings of things like objects

453
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:11,863
with respect to touch your rather
your own body in relation to those

454
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,300
the beginnings of things
like meaningful sounds.

455
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:20,472
And so then let's say
we bring all the modalities together.

456
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,775
Now we let them cross talking
about multimodal representation

457
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:29,447
that you've organized according to
a coherent perspectival reference frame.

458
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:30,215
Well, now

459
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:34,152
you might get the beginning of something
like phenomenology or experience.

460
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:39,190
And so here there's a blue swath
corresponding to alpha frequencies.

461
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,491
Here,

462
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,661
where I'm at alpha

463
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,665
frequencies that would roughly be it
looks like the size that you would need.

464
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:49,934
So 8 to 12 times
a second of a frequency of updating or

465
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,606
or sampling or estimation
that this would be big enough

466
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,744
to get you the entire sensorium
all brought together, bringing together

467
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:04,249
that the different hierarchies
into a hierarchy.

468
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:08,987
Alpha has some additional significance
in that it has particularly concentrated

469
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:12,991
sources of alpha power
from midline structures.

470
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,660
And I take this as being important,

471
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,065
because if you look at something
like the posterior midline,

472
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:23,702
we look at, let's say the posterior
single cortex, which is heavily

473
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,839
implicated in the psychedelic and also
the meditation research literatures.

474
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,275
When alpha goes down,

475
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:33,445
there seems to be some associated
with phenomena such as ego dissolution.

476
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,347
But the idea that

477
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:41,653
Alpha might be important for coherent,
egocentric perspective in addition

478
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,956
to bringing together your consortium
for this mutual information,

479
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,926
these midline structures, in particular
the posterior cingulate,

480
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,796
there's this whole idea
of the pipette circuit where it's this

481
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:56,167
core circuit for emotional memory

482
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,370
that would roughly go, Mama,
Natalie bodies around the brainstem.

483
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,841
It goes up through the mammalia
for an track.

484
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:07,712
I think anterior lateral flank nucleus
goes through the signaling bundle poster

485
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,549
singular into the the campus up
through the fawning specs memo about it.

486
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,251
Don't worry about those details.

487
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,420
The important thing about this is

488
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:19,824
this was interpreted
by actually I said papers.

489
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:20,759
I think it's paper.

490
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,629
But it was interpreted by tapes
when he was etching out these sources

491
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:28,366
of epilepsy from discharge
as his core circuit for emotional memory.

492
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:32,904
And part of the reason
that and so the importance of this

493
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:37,075
is the memory bodies are receiving
stretch

494
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,377
receptor information from the neck

495
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:42,680
and so this is going to be
potentially important

496
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,383
for knowing where your head's pointing,
especially for talking about like

497
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,585
this will be important for us
and maybe even more

498
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:51,656
so if we're talking about
like our inner road or or whatever that,

499
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,459
you know, where your head's pointing
is going to really help

500
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:58,229
for bringing coherence
to explaining your sensorium.

501
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,533
Also at the Islamic relay,
you're also getting

502
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,369
inputs from the vestibular
apparatus of the inner ear.

503
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,871
And so this is giving you
to your pitch and role.

504
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:07,939
And so not only do you have

505
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:11,676
your entire system, all the information
at these posterior midline structures

506
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,979
before they funnel into the hippocampus
as a source of new memory.

507
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,881
Not only do you have the entire sensory

508
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,683
and brought together,
you're on top of it all.

509
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,018
In network terms.

510
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:23,021
But you have the information
you would need to organize it

511
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:25,890
by your egocentric perspective.

512
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,526
And so this yeah.

513
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,461
So we've got
predictive coding. We covered

514
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,631
sea bass effects, readings effects.

515
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,601
And now I'm introducing like

516
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:41,372
a basic model of perceptual synthesis
where we have something

517
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:44,509
of a Cartesian theater here, enabled by

518
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,714
the ability of slow
rhythms of a large enough extent

519
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:53,551
to bring together the right
kinds of information you would need to

520
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,821
basically create a coherent

521
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:00,191
world model.

522
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,061
So we all would be similar. Okay.

523
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:09,334
So in this preprint,

524
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:14,372
I describe how we can maybe
think of with respect to either sensation

525
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,942
or imagination, different combinations

526
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,778
of rebus and seabus effects happening

527
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:24,849
potentially corresponding
to different levels of stimulation

528
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,920
of these receptor classes of the phobias

529
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,422
you two are in particular, by the way,

530
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,327
I think 5ht to five t

531
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:40,331
to see that's going to
that's one to watch for.

532
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:43,868
It might even be like
almost more strictly rebus in its nature,

533
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,470
but that's something to talk about later.

534
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,741
So for sensation on the left here,

535
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,211
this would be there's a person of nature

536
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,647
and they're having an interaction
with a tree.

537
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,715
And then on the right here
would be a similar thing.

538
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,651
But this is imagination.

539
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,552
Maybe with your eyes closed, maybe not.

540
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,721
But this is in here.

541
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,924
You're imagining yourself

542
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:07,659
interacting with the tree.

543
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,159
Now, you know,

544
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,161
imagination doesn't
need to be in a third person,

545
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,330
but I'm just taking advantage of the fact
that we're talking.

546
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:16,000
Like if you are to think of yourself
in a third person,

547
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,870
if you're going to move from this,
was it the,

548
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:22,140
as James called it,
like from the eye to the me

549
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:26,210
to this objectified selfhood,
that part is going to require

550
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,178
imagination.

551
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:30,581
You can imagine yourself in the first person, but the third person point of view,

552
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,085
you're going to require imagination.

553
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,755
I guess that or a mirror
or a good set up of mirrors.

554
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,057
Maybe you could do it that way.

555
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,425
Some actually might not.

556
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,760
That might be non-trivial,
but on the left here,

557
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:46,064
so the top we have, let's say, unaltered,

558
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,100
if such a thing ever exists,
we're always altered in some ways.

559
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,668
We're always on some

560
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:51,869
you know, our brain

561
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,839
stems from a cookie is always dripping
some combination of drugs to us.

562
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:58,009
It's just sometimes
it's a very different regime.

563
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,679
And, you know, we say it's altered,
but there is no like singular baseline.

564
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,280
You know, we

565
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,717
who knows how much we both very
as individuals and across individuals

566
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:08,619
along these lines.

567
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,656
But so as we move down,

568
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,992
let's say we were talking about

569
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,395
a reader's effect

570
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,964
and let's say
you were getting a rebus effect

571
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,800
with sensation.

572
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,839
So in theory, if your perception
is entailed by the predictions,

573
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:32,610
then it could be the case
that things might seem less vivid to you.

574
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,547
It may not be the case
that your perception is more vivid.

575
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:41,152
I know I don't know if I would say this
is strictly entailed by the Rebus model,

576
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:45,690
but that's one thing you might think
potentially if these slow rhythms,

577
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,860
if some of these are actually entail
your conscious experience,

578
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,864
if these are reduced in their coherence
and their power, in theory, you might get

579
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,833
a diminution of perceptual vividness.

580
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:01,172
However, in a of US interpretation,
things might appear more vivid,

581
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:05,209
not necessarily more vertical,
but more vivid.

582
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,813
And so it seems like
a Rebus interpretation

583
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,450
would say that things might be
more detailed, more accurate,

584
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,953
more richly textured, with

585
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:19,057
more faithful correspondences
to the external world.

586
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,193
When you're perceiving
but potentially less vivid,

587
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,495
that causes a strict entitlement.

588
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:27,799
But that seems like one suggestion
under a sea misinterpretation.

589
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,902
This would be

590
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,138
more vivid,
but not necessarily more precise.

591
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:37,275
It actually might be a little bit
smoothed over like like an auto

592
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:42,413
tuning or a filtering, but also though
more compelling potentially.

593
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,451
And so this in theory,
though, would be the phenomenology

594
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,653
of microdosing in theory.

595
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:50,555
And so

596
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,291
when I get into
and so I try to illustrate this

597
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:57,161
with a brain or, you know, bigger
or smaller synchronous complexes here.

598
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,898
So Albus there as well,
we could have an admixture.

599
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:02,133
It's not just one set of beliefs,

600
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,802
but we have a hierarchy of beliefs
and in fact a hierarchy.

601
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:10,374
So maybe the alpha starts to get
pulled back and that loses coherence.

602
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:13,611
That seems to be one of the strongest
associations in the psychedelic

603
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:17,181
meditation literature
is this alpha is what people emphasizes

604
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,551
some of these ego d centering
or dissolving effects,

605
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:25,022
but maybe beta stays the same
or even increases in power.

606
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,859
And so under a rebus model, for instance,

607
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,462
the idea would be that, you know, things
like Alpha

608
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:35,666
go down in power, but things like
the particular smaller beliefs,

609
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,034
they can come together

610
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,537
in different ways, in different sort
of creative combinations.

611
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:42,773
And so you might get something
like synesthesia with psychedelics

612
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:47,645
as like a creative recombination
of things under this more anarchic state.

613
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:51,582
Once you took the alpha self ruler
and you reduced its

614
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:55,820
tyrannical grip over your perception
and so this more free flowing perception,

615
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:59,624
you get all sorts of different creative
combinations in consciousness.

616
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:04,462
And so yeah, so that's
one thing is trying to basically map

617
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,464
different combinations of

618
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,701
Rebus
or C base effects that you might expect

619
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:16,240
under different doses with respect
to either sensation or imagination.

620
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:20,711
So really digging into the phenomenology
and using psychedelics as an opportunity

621
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:24,882
actually in a way to indirectly test
models of consciousness.

622
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:29,654
But also if we're going to explain
what these substances,

623
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,590
powerful substances, are doing,
we really actually need to take

624
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,159
some of these questions head
on, maybe even the heart problem.

625
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:40,097
So some of the more so in this preprint

626
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,600
I also

627
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:44,101
are getting into.

628
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:46,037
Okay, well, what do we mean by beliefs?

629
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,905
What kind of beliefs
are we talking about?

630
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:51,576
And so so
one kind of beliefs would be so here

631
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,711
you might have the beliefs

632
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,746
with active inference in the free energy
principles, beliefs

633
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,481
the whole way through which beliefs.

634
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:58,349
And so

635
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,852
Rebus is saying what's specifically
being is being relaxed

636
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,056
is your deeper beliefs,
your internal working

637
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,960
models, the higher level beliefs
corresponding to things like selfhood

638
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,531
and its relation to the world, things
like autobiographical and narrative self.

639
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,400
And these are the things
that are losing their grip and,

640
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,638
and within Rebus I don't want to like
there is room for specifics

641
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:22,673
some of the ways it's discussed

642
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:25,509
where it's not just across the board,
all the slow rhythms are going down.

643
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:26,210
The idea of my maybe

644
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,045
I've heard

645
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:31,249
it discussed differently
and so you might get,

646
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,685
you know, an indirect strengthening
as you remove

647
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,489
these slower, integrative
and potentially suppressive processes.

648
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,859
But in terms of types of beliefs,

649
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:45,463
if we're going to be
talking about cognition or

650
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,933
if we're talking about something
as highfalutin as the self

651
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,503
now we might want to see like
what kind of self are we talking about?

652
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,304
Like we're talking about

653
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:56,807
like a minimal embodied self,
or are we talking about an extended self?

654
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:59,577
And even those
like there's all sorts of big questions

655
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,280
like what goes into the minimal
embodied self in

656
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:04,949
house relating to the extended self
and how many

657
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,218
if there's different kinds of votes.

658
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:10,388
And so if we're talking
about the construction of self

659
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:14,458
in its relation
to the world and objectified self or the

660
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:18,829
that the ego, the the self as construed
over time and across

661
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:22,066
circumstances, we're going to need
a fairly rich account of cognition.

662
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,635
And so here I'm basically

663
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,739
providing an account
of sophisticated affective of inference

664
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:32,743
or imaginative
planning and policy selection

665
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:36,781
as orchestrated by the hippocampus
and into renal system.

666
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:40,651
And so this is drawing on
some of the work I'm doing with Tim

667
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,719
verbally and others.

668
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,721
I'm trying to decipher that system.

669
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:47,491
But basically, you know, you seem to have

670
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:50,828
so here,

671
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,097
you know, hippocampus can be thought of

672
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,833
in a way
as the top of the cortical rhetoric

673
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,003
when the prediction
errors are not proved.

674
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,207
So you as the pictures are percolating
upwards, being contradicted

675
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,508
or stopped by predictions,

676
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:08,546
you stop them as low as you can,
as close to the modalities as you can.

677
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,582
That's the maximum savings,
and that's what you would expect with

678
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,018
the maximally efficient
prediction and learning.

679
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:21,192
But if you can't predict a pattern,
if nothing, that the genuinely novel

680
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:25,296
that makes its way all the way up
the hierarchy into the hippocampus

681
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:28,532
is this prediction error
storage place of last resort.

682
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,504
And you this
then can be stitched together

683
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:37,842
to create memory
and specifically with hippocampal

684
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:42,313
and then to run a system seems to do
is it encodes this sequence memory

685
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,616
it has multiple
functions but one of the ways in which

686
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:49,053
one of its core functions
seems to be the encoding

687
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:53,057
of trajectories of the overall
organismic system through time and space.

688
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,994
And so if you look at the work of people
like Redish, you'll actually see,

689
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,964
for instance, as this
rodent is in a maze,

690
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,233
figure out where it's going to go.

691
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:06,537
You'll see these sweeps of activity
within the hippocampus can play out

692
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:11,075
in different directions across these
place fields or this mapping of space.

693
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,645
And then the organism will take
like one branch for another of these

694
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,782
potential sweeps of predictive activity.

695
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,851
And so probably don't
want to get in descriptively.

696
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,953
I have an account of like the anterior
versus the post.

697
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,755
Your hippocampus
can be qualitatively different

698
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,691
where the answer hippocampus seems to be
the one that's more predictive.

699
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,961
Giving you these sweeps, giving you
things like counterfactual processing,

700
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:36,133
the anterior seems to be more closely
coupling with the posterior sensorium

701
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,837
and would be more important
for more specific episodic encoding

702
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,239
and maybe more faithful
episodic remembering.

703
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,509
And so the idea is
you have these little hexagons

704
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,446
which corresponds to mapping of space,
these hippocampal place fields,

705
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,182
where is the organism
within some sort of space?

706
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,518
And then they're playing out
in some trajectory.

707
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:58,456
And so now along this trajectory,
it is you're having the prediction errors

708
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:03,227
from the cortical generative model,
which can basically by pointing back

709
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:07,665
to cortex can unpacked unpack
at every point in space

710
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:09,667
the experience you

711
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:12,870
would expect for that
particular temporal spatial trajectory.

712
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,007
And this would be an account of
episodic memory and episodic imagination

713
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,276
or the stream of consciousness,
if you will.

714
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:20,544
Okay, so here we are.

715
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:23,247
And I think this is the last thing
I'll look.

716
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:23,781
Yeah.

717
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,950
So here we are.

718
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:29,186
These trajectories being played out
and different experiences being entailed

719
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,090
at each point as it plays out
and they have a given length,

720
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:38,062
it seems that there's a extent of this.

721
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,731
I think James called it
the species present

722
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:45,369
or the idea there's like a thickness
of the moment we find ourselves in or

723
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:50,140
this might be a somewhat different idea
but there's there seems to be 3 seconds

724
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:54,411
is seems to be roughly
the upper bound of what we would call

725
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:58,616
a given extended
moment of experience element,

726
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,618
I think called like
the remembered present.

727
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:03,420
Or there's a little bit of like
a prediction in a post section and you're

728
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:08,058
moving back and forth in this sliding
window frame of experience.

729
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:10,261
And so one interpretation.

730
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,796
And so we don't hear as you're doing
these different episodic

731
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,933
rememberings and imaginings,

732
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:20,471
that one thing
that the 552 system might do is

733
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:25,142
both increase the vividness of what
you're imagining or perceiving as you go,

734
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:29,046
but also allowing you
to have more extended

735
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:32,182
rollouts before you have to reset

736
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,719
where it seems like a roughly 3 seconds
might be the upper upper bound.

737
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,887
And so

738
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:41,926
basically have within the pre-print this

739
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:45,663
this comic description is neuro
phenomenological comic

740
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,832
where as you're increasing
the dose, imagination

741
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:52,069
is getting closer to perception
and you're

742
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:56,040
getting a longer one way to work with
for this extended present moment

743
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,910
within which you are planning
and learning and making sense of things.

744
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,713
And so it gets a little bit bigger
with the micro dose,

745
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:05,149
a little bit bigger
with this threshold dose,

746
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,018
and even more over the years,
you know, when you started out,

747
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,688
you're just like kind of moving
through the world.

748
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,724
I'm kind of awake and kind of conscious,
I guess.

749
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:16,493
And then it's like I am like

750
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,295
the things are crisper

751
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:21,999
and a little bit more creative, like,
and not that much.

752
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,535
Here is, but more crisper.

753
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,272
This would be
something like kind of like a some dose,

754
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:31,308
like a programmer in Silicon Valley,
like Microdosing is very popular.

755
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,677
It doesn't seem that
they're trying to like trip, but they're,

756
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:37,548
they're almost using it like like
like a little bit of a, a stimulant

757
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:40,217
trying to like increase absorption
with whatever they're doing.

758
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:45,589
And so then, so as we move through,
you increase the dose more.

759
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:49,560
And now it's even more vivid
and more creative, more different.

760
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,763
Imaginings are having access to more
and more is manifesting in mind.

761
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:56,934
But then after a certain dose, it seemed
what an illustrating is that

762
00:43:56,934 --> 00:44:02,006
basically the the coherence starts to go
and you start to get smaller rollouts.

763
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:06,810
There are even more of it and they're
more creative, but they're becoming less

764
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:10,314
clear in terms of the sequencing.

765
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,817
They make less sense with respect
to achieving particular goals.

766
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:15,653
And so I think something

767
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,755
that I should explain
and we might have to talk it out, but

768
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,691
the underlying this is so, so

769
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:25,562
these hippocampal resetting events
are occasioned by different things.

770
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,766
One is if I go from one room to a next,

771
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:33,237
if some sort of like really surprising
thing happens, that's going to trigger

772
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:37,741
this sharply of ripple activity
and a retailing of space

773
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,711
within which you're doing
your sophisticated inference.

774
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,447
This so something either

775
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:46,083
so there's there's some evidence that
reward prediction errors and something

776
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:50,020
really really good happens
that might cause you to basically ramp up

777
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,591
the hippocampal activity, encode that,
you know, generate like aphasia, help

778
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:59,196
you generate a physic burst of dopamine,
learn it and then keep going.

779
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,132
Or if something really bad happens,
this might be an opportunity to pivot.

780
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,734
What you're doing is not working.

781
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:08,072
Let's retail, let's try again.

782
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,006
And so

783
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:13,010
this will be a function of both things,
like what's the normal modulatory tone,

784
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,347
what are those like the circuit
level conditions like maybe directly,

785
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:20,851
what's your level of five to a simulation
that might influence

786
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:23,954
how long you get before
you have to reset?

787
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:28,225
But it could also be explained
at the level of experience itself,

788
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:32,229
at the level of the expected free energy
changing as a submersion clause.

789
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:36,266
So as I'm getting creative,
if I get so creative that I'm no longer

790
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:37,735
making sense of things,

791
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:41,004
my expected free energy,
if that goes up like that, spikes up.

792
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,140
Because what I just said
is really surprising.

793
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,344
It's novel is experience vividly,
and it's not making a lot of sense.

794
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,581
That might be something
that would occasion this resetting.

795
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:52,282
And so

796
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,585
idea is a model of basically a

797
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,722
stream of consciousness
or episodic memory,

798
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:00,758
episodic remembering and imagining,

799
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:04,328
which becomes a more

800
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,132
coherent, more rich,

801
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:12,603
more absorbed within this first regime,
and then a second regime

802
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:17,441
that's more properly psychedelic,
where it's very becomes

803
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:20,577
extremely creative, so much so that it's

804
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:24,148
become qualitatively different
to normal experience

805
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,784
and even so much so that like,
for instance, at a certain point

806
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:29,553
you're not going to be using this
to enhance your job as a programmer.

807
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:33,924
You'll be doing this on vacation with
trusted others or something like this.

808
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:36,293
Hopefully
this is not something to take to work at,

809
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:36,827
you know,

810
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,529
if not megadoses at work hopefully,

811
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:40,864
or they will not be working there
for very long.

812
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,767
At most workplaces.

813
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:44,334
And so

814
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,206
yeah, that's basically

815
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,308
and so then coming
looping back around to the beginning,

816
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:55,245
that is with a deeper understanding
of these systems

817
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:59,616
that includes some Rebus aspects
and some CBS type aspects.

818
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:03,086
We might be able to use these
as inspiration

819
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:06,423
for novel active inference machine
learning parameters.

820
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,960
So potentially you can think of like

821
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,063
getting stuck at like people.

822
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:15,566
They're living like a life
of quiet aspiration or something.

823
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,935
They've gotten stuck
at some kind of local maxima

824
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,904
and they're looking to change and
they're looking to get a kick out of it.

825
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:23,607
They're they're not finding
an elegant path

826
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,176
to minimize their expected free energy.

827
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:31,782
And so if you've found yourself trapped
at this local free energy minima,

828
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,785
you can use psychedelics to turbocharge

829
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:39,122
your sophisticated affect of inference
enough to maybe find a novel

830
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:44,928
solution, see
something that you wouldn't otherwise.

831
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:47,130
And then I guess the final thing
I would like to point to is

832
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,333
in terms of

833
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:53,937
using psychedelics as a probe on mind,

834
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:57,207
you might have different interpretations
of what they reveal.

835
00:47:57,441 --> 00:48:01,378
If you're thinking of either a strictly
see the story, a strictly

836
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:05,515
read a story, or some kind of combination
of the both of them.

837
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:09,219
And so I'd suggest that, for instance,
you can think of a good amount

838
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,723
of psychedelic phenomenology
as corresponding

839
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,193
to the unmasking of your core priors.

840
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:19,263
And so things like, let's say fractal,

841
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,432
fractal phenomenology,

842
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:25,702
that maybe would be
a core perceptual prior

843
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,305
maybe of a partially evolutionary,
partially as a

844
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,942
reliably learnable posterior

845
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:35,245
or empirical prior
for making sense of the world.

846
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:39,750
And this would make some sense in that
if you use fractals as you're generating

847
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,920
your predictions, that's a very efficient
basis set because you can

848
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,590
you can do a lot with different
combinations of fractals.

849
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:49,860
And this is especially going to
be efficient if that's what nature itself

850
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:50,527
doing.

851
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:54,464
You're using different combinations
of fractal processes to model the world,

852
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:55,832
which is largely structured

853
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:58,368
by different combinations of fractal type
generative processes.

854
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:03,240
Further things like entity perceptions
is associated

855
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,742
with different psychedelic experiences,

856
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,846
archetypical type experiences.

857
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:14,651
Those also could be thought of
as the unmasking of core priors.

858
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:17,821
Essentially strengthened. Core priors

859
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:20,757
lets you know because would expect
from active inference

860
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:24,094
that entities is something
the kind of thing you would expect

861
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:28,732
as a very powerful empirical prior
because that's

862
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:31,935
how we survive, especially agents
such as us who think

863
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:35,272
through other minds and we're our primary
niches, largely each other.

864
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:36,373
And so

865
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,309
whether we're you know,

866
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:44,214
the details of psychedelics
might actually reveal these foundational,

867
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:50,387
inductive biases or foundational lessons
in the learning curriculum,

868
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:53,790
the structure learning, whereby we come
to be the kinds of beings we are,

869
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:59,162
and that is it for now.

870
00:49:59,162 --> 00:49:59,863
Okay.

871
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:01,198
Thank you, Adam.

872
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,467
That was super awesome.

873
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:07,070
I am like particularly overloaded
right now, unlike

874
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:11,208
my one A receptors, which is like

875
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,643
I just want to imagine and step back

876
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,680
before I ask some questions.

877
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,181
I know Daniel asked a lot.

878
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:21,685
So I'm going to let him like ground me
a little bit in reality

879
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,954
and have the first job.

880
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,225
I was just writing a bunch of stuff
in the live chat,

881
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,293
so definitely anyone can ask because

882
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:34,998
you've jumped through many areas.

883
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,402
So if anybody has a question,
they can type it.

884
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,973
But let's take a quick breath, collect
our thoughts and then Bleu

885
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,641
you can ask the first question.

886
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,412
Which I just passed to you to,
like, ground me.

887
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,881
All right. So, so

888
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,784
I guess I'm already here.

889
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:54,785
All right?

890
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,987
Since I'm already here, I'm going to like

891
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,723
and clearly asked
a whole lot of questions at once

892
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:00,424
and also like

893
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:04,261
try not to fangirl out too much
because this line of work is really super

894
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:08,198
awesome and unifies
the whole lot of my particular interests.

895
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:15,138
So just really quickly,
what do you think the relationship is,

896
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:19,743
if any, between inference and memory?

897
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:24,481
And can we quantify that
through the brain, the brain system,

898
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:27,284
dopamine, serotonin, like

899
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,621
do you have thoughts on that?

900
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:32,823
I'm sure you do.

901
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,559
Or do you have thoughts
that you can summarize in, you know,

902
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:38,228
10 minutes or less?

903
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:40,730
Yeah. Hmm.

904
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:46,002
So in terms of memory,
there's a sense in which

905
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:52,275
it's all like there's a sense in which
within the free energy principle,

906
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,912
max of inference know all like wasn't

907
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,782
all effective causation is inference

908
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,885
and it's all inference

909
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:04,554
based on different kinds of memory.

910
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:07,757
So so your belief
every belief is a memory and everything

911
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:10,327
that happens is a kind of action
as a kind of inference.

912
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:14,798
But there's another sense, though,
of like memory of the time and the kind

913
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,367
I'm trying to get to
with like the focus on the hippocampal

914
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:21,705
and to renal system,
this orchestration of the overall

915
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:25,609
memory system and this encoding
of the general genuinely novel

916
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:29,546
and these episodes
and these frames of sense making that

917
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,750
this would be

918
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:39,589
of a more complex
kind of inference and a sophisticated one

919
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,659
specifically where you are

920
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,961
inferring the most plausible

921
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:48,198
a a rather than so.

922
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:51,334
So there could be a sense
for, for instance, in which

923
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,504
you might get a fairly

924
00:52:55,372 --> 00:53:01,745
under some circumstances maybe for
like recent things that the aren't like

925
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,881
I don't know what the shelf
life would be, but like the

926
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:09,219
so some of the
the literature that a couple of weeks

927
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:13,256
couple months I don't know but like that
actually hippocampal system through

928
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:16,159
just this chaining of attracting states
lines trajectories

929
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:20,130
could point back to cortex
and play out something

930
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:25,835
that's actually like a fair, a decently
faithful but still very biased account,

931
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:29,239
a reconstruction,
a remembering of what occurred.

932
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,743
But for things that are older, that's
probably not the case.

933
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:36,947
Even for things that are newer,
there's this constructive.

934
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:40,417
So it's always constructive
and that it's always a kind of at

935
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,485
every moment
perception is inference. At every moment.

936
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:47,290
There's a creative aspect of filling in,
but actually like situating yourself

937
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:53,063
within some sort of causal unfolding
that's going to involve a lot of value

938
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:57,567
catalyzed policy selection
that's can involve you using constraints

939
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:01,504
like, well, what kind of being do
I think I am and what's plausible.

940
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,040
And that's going to determine
when you're going down this like

941
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:08,612
this branching, forking
paths of different possibilities, like

942
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:11,982
you'll be moving between like or what
might I have done to do this or that?

943
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:16,486
And you'll be picking plausible accounts
of you partially as you go.

944
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:20,190
And so some remembering
might be a little bit

945
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:22,425
like the

946
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:25,795
naive, like playback one of you playback,
the trajectory.

947
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:29,266
It's got pointers back to cortex
and then you have this belief hierarchy

948
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,935
and so you give the practioners
back to where things are new

949
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:35,772
and then it just unpacks itself as a
a good enough

950
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:39,643
account of what happened to each point
as you went through some trajectory.

951
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:42,445
And it's a decent semi
faithful player, but

952
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:45,682
there's also going to be
this other kind of memory, though,

953
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:49,252
that's that's not faithful at all
and can really deviate

954
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:53,523
a substantial amount of all where

955
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:56,993
in hard to distinguish from imagination
and continuous with it.

956
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:58,995
So like how do you know
if you're remembering something

957
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:01,197
or imagining
you use these different cues?

958
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:04,501
One cue
you might use is perceptual vividness.

959
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:07,504
So you would assume,
like if I remember something going to be

960
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:10,440
a little bit crisper
and if I just like totally made it up,

961
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,109
the other one might be like
just the plausibility.

962
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:16,479
Like, yeah, that's like the kind of thing
someone like me would do.

963
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,983
And, but you can get a confused,
maybe a source monitoring error.

964
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:25,255
And I think that's actually in a way
for psychedelics, both in terms of

965
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,425
if this core process of figuring out

966
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,961
who you are, where you've been,
where you're likely to go

967
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:36,099
and where you ought to go,
thinking of these pathways as potentially

968
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:38,335
what it is to

969
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,905
be an agent as revealing ways
that agency and

970
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:45,575
and different self-consciousness
and selfhood can vary.

971
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:49,579
But also in terms of this,
I think needs to be broadened in terms

972
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:54,851
of what we might expect to be impacted
and what we might want to prepare

973
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,722
for in heart and harness
with things like psychedelics.

974
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,056
So for instance,

975
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:03,493
there might be a very real risk
for phenomena such as false memory.

976
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:08,231
So if the gap between perceptual
perception and image and imagination

977
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:11,401
starts to narrow, if your imagination
starts to seem more vivid,

978
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:16,740
it might become more difficult
to distinguish between a remembering

979
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,742
and an imagining or

980
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,878
yeah, so things of that nature.

981
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:26,015
So that I think the issue of
what is memory

982
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:29,052
and its relation to inference

983
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,021
is going to be key for what it is like.

984
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:35,759
We want to alter and what it is
we maybe don't want to alter

985
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:40,230
but might accidentally alter when we do
different types of interventions.

986
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,400
So like you played
so perfectly into my follow up

987
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,871
question was like,
how does creativity play into that?

988
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:48,638
Right?

989
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:51,674
And like what is maybe

990
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:54,944
the function of creativity
like I mean, personally,

991
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:57,647
my autobiographical memory is awful,

992
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:00,450
but like I have a really strong holds,

993
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,754
like good factual memory
for like all kinds of ridiculous things.

994
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:09,692
So, so where does creativity play
into that?

995
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:13,363
Like, memory, perception,

996
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:16,933
inference like paradigm
and are like the people

997
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:20,036
that are more creative
or that take more psychedelics?

998
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:22,572
Like,
do they have a less like accurate memory

999
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:24,641
or are they more likely to remember

1000
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:28,812
remember things inaccurately
or even like what is inaccuracy?

1001
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:30,847
Sorry, let me just get super meta

1002
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:33,416
because I really fundamentally believe
that perception is different

1003
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:34,350
for all of us.

1004
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,786
But like what is written in my bio
textbook?

1005
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,054
Less so.

1006
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:41,624
So maybe that's why like I put less
priority on my autobiographical memory

1007
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:45,728
because it's I believe it's functionally
inaccurate, but like whatever.

1008
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:48,631
How many angstroms are between
each subunit of DNA?

1009
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,767
That's way more, you know, important.

1010
00:57:51,501 --> 00:58:00,877
Right?

1011
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:01,511
I mean, that's

1012
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:04,547
one of
the hardest questions I can think of.

1013
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:07,684
And so then I want to know
what's important, too.

1014
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:11,754
So there's this I'm trying to
I forget the name of the paper.

1015
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:16,793
It's dual constraints model of creativity
that does address like head

1016
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:22,232
on the issue of kinds of creativity
and psychedelics some of that later.

1017
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:24,567
But the

1018
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:28,771
it does seem like, for instance,
there are

1019
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:34,878
I necessary tradeoffs

1020
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:38,414
with respect to different processes

1021
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:42,752
as to whether they allow
for realizing different types of value.

1022
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:46,856
So let's say so with memory
or with creativity,

1023
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:50,627
you might distinguish between divergent
and convergent creativity,

1024
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:55,231
like convergent creativity,
where like you want to hit a particular

1025
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,268
target and generate a novel solution

1026
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,870
for a particular challenge

1027
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:05,341
or divergent,
where let's say you just want to think

1028
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:08,845
of something new, maybe just

1029
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:11,781
a novelty generator

1030
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:15,184
from which you then might select later
convergence solutions

1031
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:19,289
and a longer process or just as part of
an open ended exploration.

1032
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:20,857
And so

1033
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,494
in those different ways,
like, for instance, like you could

1034
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,097
get if you just turn up

1035
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,634
the heat, the temperature

1036
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,170
and you make things more

1037
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:38,308
imprecise and unconstrained,

1038
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:41,911
you might be able to get all sorts
of different combinations.

1039
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:45,648
And this might be a good
like fountain of divergent creativity.

1040
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:48,785
Some of the evidence suggests,
I believe, that

1041
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:50,753
even with the micro dose regime.

1042
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,188
So I think

1043
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:54,591
people who are doing like Microdosing,

1044
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:59,596
usually they're looking for things
like enhance conversion, creativity.

1045
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:03,166
I don't think the evidence is great
that that's actually being achieved, but

1046
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,103
diversion, creativity might be more
likely to be associated with

1047
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,272
psychedelic experience,

1048
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:13,109
proper combinations of things
that just you never would have imagined.

1049
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:13,776
It's not clear.

1050
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:17,447
It's not necessarily even useful
for any particular thing.

1051
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,449
It's not hitting
any particular target necessarily.

1052
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:20,783
It might be after the fact.

1053
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,352
It might reveal something to you

1054
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:24,420
that you never imagined
that have made all the difference.

1055
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:27,156
Maybe it's like a
just your defense mechanisms in terms

1056
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:29,926
of like your policy selection
as leading into garden paths.

1057
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:31,661
You're seeing some things and not others.

1058
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:34,163
And then it took the blinders off
to reveal something

1059
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,099
that you might have missed.

1060
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,535
But I'd say that people definitely vary

1061
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:43,640
partially, maybe due to things
like low level parameter tunings,

1062
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:48,878
like different people will vary in terms
of like the natural level of the gain

1063
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:53,249
on these systems, the natural tendencies
for occupying these different regimes.

1064
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:56,319
And so you'd expect that to vary either

1065
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,655
through some combination of things best

1066
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:02,291
explained at low levels like, you know,
different levels of neuro modulators.

1067
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:06,062
And some of it would be not well
explained at that level.

1068
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:09,599
It's more just that's the way
the structure learning happened.

1069
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,068
That's the way the system bootstrap
itself, different kind of agent

1070
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:14,671
and everything in between.

1071
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,306
So one thing that I find to be like

1072
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,878
I want to go into is

1073
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:25,281
that humanness in general, us
as a creative species,

1074
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:29,052
that these pathways
might have been important

1075
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:35,224
for allowing us to have be more creative
and being able to combine things

1076
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:39,929
in a broader range of ways
and that this potentially,

1077
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:43,666
you know, unlocked a more flexible type
of cognition,

1078
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:47,670
maybe a greater capacity
for analogical reasoning,

1079
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:50,707
the kinds of things
that might have potentially precipitated

1080
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:54,811
this great leap forward in the birth
of cognitive modernity, where we became

1081
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:58,381
a symbolic species and cultural evolution
came off the ground.

1082
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:00,450
There's an

1083
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:03,286
older idea of mechanical,
the stone ape theory that like there

1084
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:06,456
was actually like a period
where we were in this symbiosis

1085
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:09,459
with mushrooms and we're eating
psilocybin containing mushrooms.

1086
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:12,595
And this actually helped
to get that going.

1087
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:15,398
And I don't think we can rule that out,

1088
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:18,301
but you could also get something
very similar with,

1089
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:22,004
you know, a couple of high
impactful mutations along these pathways

1090
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,408
that doesn't involve
a mushroom eating phase.

1091
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:29,045
And so there still might be
really interesting account of actually

1092
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:33,249
the secret of our success
as a species, as a particularly creative

1093
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:36,552
kind of hominid who's able
to bring things together in more

1094
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,856
novel, imaginative ways

1095
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:44,127
that could be involved
and being continuous

1096
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:47,463
with the story of psychedelics
and how they work and in the present day.

1097
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:50,633
So that obviously,
you know, I'm extremely interested in

1098
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,269
and also though as a source,
you're saying individual difference like,

1099
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:56,739
you know, are there more like to this day
more shamanic

1100
01:02:56,739 --> 01:03:00,176
personalities are there, you know,
are there more?

1101
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:06,382
And to what degree can this account
be told at the level of genes

1102
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:10,720
is or epigenetics
or is not well told there one.

1103
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:12,188
Yeah.

1104
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,657
So let's share some thoughts on that.

1105
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:14,857
Okay.

1106
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:18,561
So wait, now you just like walked
into this trap that I laid for you, so

1107
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:22,498
I've now got to ask this next question.

1108
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:24,500
So you talked a lot about

1109
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:28,404
psychedelics and sensory deprivation

1110
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:32,008
and now you want to talk about like
our symbiotic relationship with fungi.

1111
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:35,511
And I'm a huge Terence McKenna fan.

1112
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:38,347
So if you've read that cake revival,
which I'm sure you have,

1113
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:41,551
so where do sensory deprivation

1114
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:44,320
in conjunction with psychedelic use,

1115
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:48,357
like where does that fall on this like

1116
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:52,628
perceptual perception
action, mental action,

1117
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:58,234
alpha beta, brainwave,
serotonin, dopamine spectrum.

1118
01:03:58,234 --> 01:03:59,769
Like, I just want to know your thoughts.

1119
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:05,107
Sorry, not sorry, but I'm sorry.

1120
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:11,447
So I don't know

1121
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:14,417
if this exactly gets at it,
but it's possible that

1122
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:26,529
this would be rather different.

1123
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,531
But like, okay, this is this.

1124
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:32,034
We're really going to go into conjecture
land here, but

1125
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:36,639
so what the book is, it's a recent one

1126
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,810
about us is
so that there's like two domestication

1127
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,480
books recently about humanness

1128
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:48,150
the so one of them is the goodness
paradox

1129
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,986
and us is a self domesticated species.

1130
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:52,855
And there's this other more recent one,
but there is that this

1131
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:55,625
serotonin

1132
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:58,261
pathways,

1133
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:01,697
if depends on which ones you're
talking about to be quite different.

1134
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:08,771
But if they're upregulated, let's say
have a one variety, you could think of

1135
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:12,808
that as being more conducive to something
like a domesticated phenotype.

1136
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:17,980
So if your dopamine is higher and you're

1137
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:20,216
you're having

1138
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:23,052
your spec, you're more confident
in your policy

1139
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:26,222
selection, then

1140
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:29,659
that might also cause you
to be somewhat impulsive

1141
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:33,396
and that might make you not necessarily
be able to

1142
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,999
discount utility enough, hold back,

1143
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,336
think things through a bit more, and

1144
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:45,541
if the dopamine is too high,
you might get less cooperatively

1145
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:48,144
if it's
and so you can think of the serotonin

1146
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:52,048
to the patients
that it's the one in particular as being

1147
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:54,817
of a domesticated variety.

1148
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:58,287
And things might appear, for instance,
less vivid, perceptually

1149
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:01,324
and imaginatively, in theory alone,

1150
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:04,327
if we're just talking
about those pathways.

1151
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:07,063
And the two way, you know, is

1152
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:12,034
by the for all this, there's so much
we don't know.

1153
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:14,070
So so much of this is conjecture.

1154
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:16,706
But the two, A, does
seem to have a little bit

1155
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:19,775
more of a dopaminergic
character to it. And

1156
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:22,878
the and

1157
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:26,716
actually, it seems like that
pathway evolved roughly

1158
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:29,352
around the time of the Cambrian Explosion

1159
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:35,091
around with the advent of Jaws in
the context of predator prey arms races.

1160
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:39,328
And so that might be consistent
with like a dopaminergic significance.

1161
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:42,331
So this like temporarily increasing

1162
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:46,535
your confidence in your past selection,
like turbocharging your action selection

1163
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:49,705
a bit so you can go out and get the goal
of either

1164
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,575
getting your lunch
or avoiding becoming lunch.

1165
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:54,744
And so

1166
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,583
let's say you're moving into

1167
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:04,186
greater gain on imagination.

1168
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:07,189
Let's say we're thinking serotonin
either of the one or two is doing this.

1169
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:12,261
This then might compete with more
externally focused perception sensation.

1170
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:16,265
And so you're imagining more,
but because your mind's eyes occupied

1171
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,034
more with your imaginings,

1172
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,736
you might be attending to the details
of the environment a little bit less.

1173
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:21,804
And so

1174
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:25,007
a species or an individual

1175
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:29,245
who might have the gain for whatever
reason, higher on these pathways,

1176
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:31,614
you might call this
a little bit more shamanic

1177
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:34,417
or maybe a little bit further on,
like a schizophrenia type spectrum

1178
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:39,321
might be perceiving the world
slightly less faithfully, but

1179
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:44,760
their imagination is now freed up to be
more freewheeling and more creative.

1180
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,730
And this is allowing for

1181
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,199
different things
to come into being so very speculative.

1182
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:53,469
We might think of like Neanderthals
as like less than domesticated

1183
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:57,073
humans, maybe even a little bit
more like autism spectrum,

1184
01:07:57,273 --> 01:08:00,843
but like better able
of perceiving the world precisely

1185
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:02,812
and us.

1186
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:05,214
We might have been a little bit
more shamanic, a little bit more,

1187
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:08,350
although we are the Neanderthals
also because we all interbred

1188
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:12,421
and the variant know
the variance within is probably bigger.

1189
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:16,392
It's definitely bigger
than the variance between but of

1190
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:19,562
us and the our ancestors and

1191
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:28,971
us. We might be somewhat somewhat less.

1192
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:31,440
I don't know.
I don't know if I'd say less dopamine.

1193
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:32,441
I know if I say that.

1194
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:35,444
So that's what I got for now.

1195
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,812
Thanks, Adam.

1196
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,782
Great presentation.

1197
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:43,619
Just want to make two quick notes,
ask some questions from the chat.

1198
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:46,622
So the first is
there's no free lunch with strategy.

1199
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:49,391
So there's dishes
that are just unwinnable

1200
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:53,062
where the phenotype cannot win.

1201
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:54,930
And then there's other niches
where potentially

1202
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:58,200
a broad range of phenotypes
all can proliferate.

1203
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:02,972
So whether or not a given strategy
is successful or under what cases

1204
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:06,142
are a given kind of neuro
modulatory state

1205
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:09,278
is good or bad, by what metric?

1206
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:13,149
There's just no single
free lunch or preference for lunch food.

1207
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:16,018
Then the second point was the complex
gene.

1208
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:18,654
Family Point was very interesting.

1209
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:24,326
And you mentioned some other receptors
in the serotonin receptor family

1210
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:29,031
and there are many receptors,
including ones that don't have nice

1211
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:32,601
clean names like number one
and number two and number three.

1212
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:35,037
So how these 14.

1213
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:37,206
Yeah so how to interpret. These protein.

1214
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:42,144
Investigating function in these massively
interacting and often redundant

1215
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:46,649
like F seven does something that only
when eight is gone, what's the actual

1216
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:48,751
mechanism there?

1217
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:50,786
So here's some questions from the chat.

1218
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:53,589
So first question from a chat
Steven asked

1219
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:59,228
interested in the approximately 3/2
window of conscious awareness

1220
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:03,132
and I mentioned does that trace back
to William James stream of consciousness

1221
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:08,237
awareness and the temporal scale
scales of experience?

1222
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:09,738
I believe so.

1223
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:14,109
So it's kind of like a 3/2
echo is our experience

1224
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:17,580
or what does the 3 seconds represent?

1225
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:22,318
So so the empirically established

1226
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,487
phenomenon is there seems to be

1227
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:28,624
stitching things together
into one continuous unfolding.

1228
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:33,395
There seems to be a 3/2 upper bound
within this continuous unfolding.

1229
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:36,198
I believe there is relevance to James.

1230
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:40,402
The species present and Edelman's
remembered present this idea of a kind of

1231
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:45,474
anticipatory prediction
and looking ahead and a post fictive

1232
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:50,546
going back to you're moving back
and forth of your self in this unfolding.

1233
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:54,250
And the speculative part is

1234
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:56,552
I am suggesting that

1235
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:59,955
this might correspond to the, uh,

1236
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:05,194
a hippocampal
and two renal tiling of space, either

1237
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:09,865
a physical space or a conceptual space
within which you're doing this and that.

1238
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:14,570
The, the reason that this upper bound
would be the length of time

1239
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:19,441
you have before you need to refresh
the attractor is in retail speculative.

1240
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:22,811
And the idea would be that
this would correspond to something like

1241
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:26,649
these sharply of ripples
that you observe.

1242
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:27,850
We don't know for sure.

1243
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,918
It's a perfect lead into this
second question

1244
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:32,888
and then have another comment
from Cambridge breaths.

1245
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:36,659
So what you just said about ripples,
so they wrote,

1246
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:40,562
Wonder if investigating
cortical traveling waves

1247
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:44,533
via neural mass biophysical modeling
approaches, in particular,

1248
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:48,337
the work of Wilson
can contribute to this work.

1249
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:51,807
If yes,
how many? Thanks for elaborations.

1250
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,110
Timmerman

1251
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:59,448
in collaboration with Robin Card,
Harris has done

1252
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,884
some really interesting work
along those lines.

1253
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:06,689
I believe it was with Dante
looking at traveling waves.

1254
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:08,924
I believe,
I believe in the alpha frequency

1255
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:11,427
as evidence for the previous models.

1256
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:15,631
And so the idea would be
that if you are actually relaxing

1257
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,834
your belief landscape,
you might get a reduction

1258
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:22,705
of like traveling waves of predictions
going down towards the periphery

1259
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:27,576
and maybe greater inward going prediction
air waves.

1260
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:31,580
And and so

1261
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,315
some work

1262
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:35,451
has been done along those lines already

1263
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:37,953
by Timmerman and others.

1264
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:39,655
That's really interesting.

1265
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:42,157
And as I said before,
so although I'm like introducing

1266
01:12:42,157 --> 01:12:45,394
additional factors,
I do not think Rebus is wrong.

1267
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:48,597
Just want to add
a couple additional details of like

1268
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:52,768
some of the contributions

1269
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:55,771
from modulations of cortical micro
circuitry be different.

1270
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:56,672
You might be able to get

1271
01:12:56,672 --> 01:13:00,843
rebus effects from a variety of ways,
not just from this D synchronization,

1272
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,980
but before I forget
earlier, you're some of free lunches.

1273
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:06,248
Absolutely.

1274
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:09,151
And I think this is part of like a is
let's say

1275
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:13,255
I have a history
of crank it all to the max.

1276
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:15,157
If each one is like has its own function,
you know,

1277
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:19,261
it'll be depending on the nature
and both generally and locally.

1278
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:21,864
So we've talked about dopamine too much.

1279
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:24,767
Dopamine,
you might be impulsive too little.

1280
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,468
You might not strike
while the iron is hot

1281
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:28,837
and you might miss opportunities
too much.

1282
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:33,308
One day or two little ones,
you might irritable and impulsive

1283
01:13:33,308 --> 01:13:37,780
too much
the opposite problems to a too much.

1284
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:42,251
It could generate over time
a kind of psychotic

1285
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,820
predisposition
that would be a loss of a free lunch.

1286
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:47,156
The one more thing that you're mentioning
is, okay,

1287
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:49,825
yeah, it's not just these two receptor
classes.

1288
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:52,127
There's actually you a 14.

1289
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,694
And so

1290
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:55,964
one thing

1291
01:13:55,964 --> 01:13:59,668
I'm wondering though
is whether you get kind of like

1292
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:06,241
this is potentially wishful thinking,
but potentially not.

1293
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:10,446
You get the lion's
share by considering a couple in that

1294
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:15,851
there might be like an order
in which they evolve and a ubiquity

1295
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:19,588
where the ubiquity

1296
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:23,158
would be one sign for like how important
it is to figure these things out.

1297
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:26,995
So the just the broader
the distribution in theory,

1298
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:31,300
the more you get from explaining the ones
with the broadest distribution

1299
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,267
and so the one

1300
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:36,572
and to have this extremely extensive
cortical and subcortical distribution.

1301
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:39,842
But that's not necessarily
the case like you could have,

1302
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:41,944
for instance,
a pivotal areas of the brainstem.

1303
01:14:41,944 --> 01:14:44,446
You're right on top of the core value
signals.

1304
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,949
You know, one class of receptor there.

1305
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:48,817
That could be the difference.
That makes all the difference.

1306
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:54,356
Another aspect of

1307
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:56,291
the hope that you can,

1308
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,894
you know, make progress incrementally

1309
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:02,130
with the goal ultimately,
you know, we're going to want

1310
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:06,401
to get every single last one of these
receptor classes is that the other

1311
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:10,205
the additional ones
might have a common organismic

1312
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:12,574
cybernetic significance,

1313
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:17,346
but they're different
because of their different locations.

1314
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:21,383
And so that their functional account
might still correspond to, let's say,

1315
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:25,254
overall levels of serotonin
overall levels

1316
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:29,691
of some neural hormone or blood acidity

1317
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:33,061
or some other homeostatic state
or state of challenge.

1318
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:37,165
And so that the active inference
significance might be the same,

1319
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:40,602
but you're tweaking differently
in different neural systems

1320
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:44,072
so that the overall coordinate effect
is coherent

1321
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:48,343
with respect to your expected for energy,
with respect

1322
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:52,481
to realizing organismic value or
minimizing prediction error, with respect

1323
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:55,884
to the prediction of you doing things
you need to do as a successful being.

1324
01:15:57,786 --> 01:15:58,320
And so one

1325
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,157
more thing, though, is I'll throw off
the two key idea is

1326
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:07,563
the potentially with these genes,
I don't know how far we can go with this,

1327
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:11,266
but with this idea of like
so with a gene duplication event,

1328
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:15,437
once you have two copies of the gene,

1329
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:18,607
this allows you to basically
take one of the copies

1330
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:21,009
because you've got a spare
and still do the same thing.

1331
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:24,813
And now the other one can mutate
and can separately be optimized

1332
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:27,482
by evolution
to take on a different function.

1333
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:30,452
And so the idea is that
there might have been a common ancestor

1334
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:33,956
that looks a little bit more one
like that at the extreme levels of it.

1335
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:38,093
During this gene duplication event,
this became the two way receptor.

1336
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:41,430
And maybe this goes
one step further to the to see.

1337
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:44,633
I'm not sure,
but maybe we go a couple of steps further

1338
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,769
with this kind of gene duplication story.

1339
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:51,206
And what we're corresponding to
is peeling out

1340
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:54,142
and separately module
in a modular fashion,

1341
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:58,380
optimizing for particular regimes
of organismic significance

1342
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:02,117
are going to be 14 to 17.

1343
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:04,920
I've got to I don't think as I suspect
it's like maybe three

1344
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:09,791
or four top stories of this kind
and that the other receptors, it's

1345
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:14,262
these core 2 to 4 stories, probably three

1346
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:17,265
maybe

1347
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:21,937
being achieved
by having different functions locally,

1348
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:25,841
but in a coordinated activity,
the same story globally

1349
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:27,643
based.

1350
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:33,215
There could be lower dimensional
manifolds that gives a lot of resilience

1351
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:36,351
and also of of ability
for the system learning.

1352
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:41,289
And one thing we've talked about before,
but it's interesting to think about

1353
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:44,626
is in your presentation,
you did a really awesome

1354
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:47,829
job of connecting
the general kind of dynamical systems

1355
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:51,933
and inference questions
to specific human regions.

1356
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,704
And then it's interesting to ask, okay,
well, insects

1357
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:57,572
have a different brain layout.

1358
01:17:57,572 --> 01:17:59,341
They don't have the mental rhino.

1359
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:02,177
So we can juxtapose

1360
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:05,714
cognitive systems and learn a lot

1361
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:10,118
about which attributes of the computation
are necessary and sufficient.

1362
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:13,388
So I wanted to ask
which cognitive systems

1363
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:20,295
you thought were interesting to study
in that sense.

1364
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:22,731
I have an intuition in a hope

1365
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,867
that may or may not pan out,

1366
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:29,771
that the extent of convergence
is fairly substantial.

1367
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:33,375
Now, things can,
I think, flip in all sorts of ways.

1368
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:37,379
I wouldn't just assume this is correct,
but let's say

1369
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:41,116
we're talking about an insect.

1370
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:44,086
We would potentially
look to the central complex

1371
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:48,523
and which has a lot of hippocampal
and to renal functions.

1372
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:52,728
And so and it might actually be
an even better system to study

1373
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:56,064
in terms of
you would have complete access

1374
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:59,034
theoretically to the in

1375
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:03,238
you would have a much richer access
to something like calcium imaging.

1376
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:05,841
And so

1377
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,645
that could be looking at something like

1378
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:15,350
the attractor dynamics of like
and so there's, there's experiments

1379
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:17,552
like let's say they take fruit flies,
they put them on

1380
01:19:17,552 --> 01:19:20,222
top of like a little Styrofoam ball
and hooked up to virtuality

1381
01:19:20,555 --> 01:19:22,791
and they have them
like doing different things.

1382
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:26,261
You look at the central context
whilst doing that under different states

1383
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:32,300
of Neuromodulation and we might see
common organismic significances

1384
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:34,836
and a common computational account

1385
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:39,241
in terms of the map
mapping space and policy selection.

1386
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:41,910
Now, how far back does this go?

1387
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:44,412
Some of this logic might even play out
at the level

1388
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:48,283
of individual cells
and like either like for instance, like

1389
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:50,051
one versus

1390
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:56,291
2a1a0.

1391
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:58,426
So low levels of serotonin

1392
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:01,763
seem to have an effect of strengthening
cytoskeleton dynamics.

1393
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:05,801
And so that would promote like an orgasm
kind of staying in place,

1394
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:09,571
but high levels actually
destabilize the cytoskeleton.

1395
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:13,275
And so they'll actually like
literally create plasticity and fluidity

1396
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:17,045
of the morphology and allow the organism
to move around more.

1397
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:21,149
And so some of these accounts
might go all the way back to the

1398
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:24,986
like near the origins of life
and individual cells and metabolism.

1399
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:26,588
How far we can go, I don't know.

1400
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:28,924
And so some of these
might have even been repurposed for the

1401
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:32,460
different social insects communicating,

1402
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:35,463
although you could see these things
flipping because you know what goes on.

1403
01:20:35,463 --> 01:20:36,798
The individual
doesn't have to be the same.

1404
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:41,203
In fact, because you have things in
one significance on the individual level,

1405
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,605
that might mean
that has the opposite significance

1406
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:45,407
at the group interactive level. So

1407
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:50,045
but I think it'll be extremely rich to I

1408
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:55,083
my kingdom for that science to be done.

1409
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:57,419
Lou, do you want to ask a question?

1410
01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:58,520
I will jump in here.

1411
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,788
Actually,

1412
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:02,924
you know,
when we talk about the origin of life,

1413
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:09,598
you mentioned earlier in your talk
that the third person perspective

1414
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:13,668
is related to imagination and creativity.

1415
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:16,171
And this goes back
to kind of what I was asking earlier,

1416
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:21,309
but is it so much
that the third person perspective

1417
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:25,847
is related to
this kind of like coming outside of ego

1418
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:31,019
and looking at yourself, you know,
from this kind of meta perspective?

1419
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:34,856
Or is it fundamentally
the dissolution of the self?

1420
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:38,760
Like how much does an ant
think about themselves

1421
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:42,564
or like a bacterial
that's part of a micro or a biofilm?

1422
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:46,134
Like how much of, of that is imagination?

1423
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:51,139
Like looking at themselves as part of
a whole or that's just like myself.

1424
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:52,507
Doesn't matter.

1425
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:55,877
I'm part of this bigger unit. Hmm. Hmm.

1426
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,281
So, like, if you're

1427
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:03,985
part of a well coordinated collective,
there's a sense with that,

1428
01:22:03,985 --> 01:22:09,958
within active of inference,
you will have converged on a shared

1429
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:14,262
generative model for your coherence
and action that you're taking part in.

1430
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:19,668
And so your role of what's being enacted,
there's a sense in which

1431
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:23,805
it's not exactly like on some level,

1432
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:27,943
in some way
there is information of some kind,

1433
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:30,445
which is not necessarily egocentric.

1434
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:34,482
In fact, it's like your role Alice
centric within the thing

1435
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:37,485
that like even if

1436
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:42,090
on some level it's like what you are
you as generative model

1437
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,960
if you were to give the generative model

1438
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:49,264
generative modeling process
as a whole perspective, it's not egoic,

1439
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:52,634
it's not from the necessary
from a first person point of view either.

1440
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:56,738
It's, it's from the coordination
manifold of,

1441
01:22:57,539 --> 01:23:00,742
of the group
that's doing this, this common thing.

1442
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:01,776
Am I kind of getting it?

1443
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:04,980
Yeah.

1444
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:05,714
Yeah, that's

1445
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:09,484
it's interesting.

1446
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:13,321
Like developmentally,
if we were to kind of take when these

1447
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:16,524
different perspectives of different kinds

1448
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:20,996
come online, like for instance,
right out the gate, it's

1449
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:24,232
not clear to me that we have like,
for instance, coherent egos.

1450
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:28,103
Like it's not clear we attend to this
like right out the gate when we're born.

1451
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:30,905
And so there's like a sense
like by default the,

1452
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:34,009
you know, the infant might be ego this.

1453
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:34,209
Right.

1454
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:37,712
It's and by default
it's doing this more like an act

1455
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:40,882
of coupling with its caregivers
and this sort of thing.

1456
01:23:40,882 --> 01:23:47,255
And it's not yet actually being enslaved
to an egocentric point of view.

1457
01:23:47,255 --> 01:23:48,123
There's kind of an interesting thing

1458
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:51,359
with language for it's
actually like the ego itself seems like

1459
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:55,030
when we use like in like psychodynamic
terms is actually

1460
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:58,533
so when we say egocentric perspective,
it's like the eye is the first person.

1461
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:02,404
But when you say like ego
as like a kind of like

1462
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,573
extended unfolding of you
that's in the world

1463
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:08,343
and all like your possessions
and your sense of yourself

1464
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:11,312
within a social context
that actually is more third person.

1465
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:14,582
So it's like ego introduced,
much perspectives more first person,

1466
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:18,253
but ego as like psychodynamic concept
and the kind of thing

1467
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:20,422
you might want to modify with
the psychedelic

1468
01:24:20,422 --> 01:24:22,357
is actually more of a third,

1469
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:24,893
seems like a little bit more like a third
person fun kind of thing. But

1470
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:26,461
and so then the

1471
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:28,830
question would be the like
maybe there's like an implicit

1472
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:32,400
alos centricity or non ego ignis

1473
01:24:34,469 --> 01:24:36,471
being enacted by any coupling.

1474
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:39,174
And maybe that's like the primal,
like the primal, the primordial state

1475
01:24:40,442 --> 01:24:43,411
and then you, you attain
to an egocentric perspective,

1476
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:45,914
but there seems like
there's like another kind of

1477
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:52,320
more psychodynamic ego
or objectification of self.

1478
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:57,992
The third person
of taking an explicit perspective,

1479
01:24:57,992 --> 01:25:00,528
they think it's, it's actually
first person

1480
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:03,364
and that you're perceiving it from
a point of view, but it's fictitious.

1481
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:07,802
You're taking the view on yourself
as if from without.

1482
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:11,306
And that might come later in development
at some point, maybe through like

1483
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:14,342
enactments of mirroring between

1484
01:25:15,143 --> 01:25:17,612
infants and caregivers
or between kind specifics.

1485
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:21,716
But like if you're mirroring with others,
then you might establish

1486
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:24,719
these cross mappings between what you do
and what someone else's does.

1487
01:25:25,086 --> 01:25:28,590
And this could potentially help you
to create representations that you can

1488
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:31,392
then harness for viewing you
as if from the outside.

1489
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:36,564
But when we're talking about
so when we say self and we say ego, like

1490
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:38,766
what kind of ego? What kind of self?

1491
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:40,735
But it seems like

1492
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:46,074
there's a

1493
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:50,278
primordial like minimal self
egocentricity of just seeing from,

1494
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:52,013
from behind your eyes.

1495
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:56,384
But then there's
more like a psychodynamic ego slash me,

1496
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:59,621
which is involving the objectification
of you

1497
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:03,458
adopting a perspective on you
imaginatively,

1498
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:06,561
as if you were viewing yourself
from without,

1499
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:09,531
and then contextualizing yourself
across space

1500
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:12,700
and time and in different contexts,
different unfolding

1501
01:26:13,067 --> 01:26:16,604
as what you would need for something
like an autobiographical self,

1502
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:19,574
something of that nature.

1503
01:26:19,574 --> 01:26:22,477
But so how does an app see it though?

1504
01:26:22,477 --> 01:26:25,780
Does an ant have like
is the first person gone?

1505
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:30,552
Or like does is an ant entirely meta
all the time or a bacterium?

1506
01:26:30,785 --> 01:26:32,787
Is that like a total meta perspective?

1507
01:26:32,787 --> 01:26:36,658
And they don't have to go through this
like ridiculous, like self, like

1508
01:26:37,325 --> 01:26:40,461
whatever, creating a dissolving loop or.

1509
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:43,598
Danniella no better than I would.

1510
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:45,266
You have to ask the ants.

1511
01:26:45,266 --> 01:26:46,634
That's kind of the hard part,

1512
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:50,338
but we can make one comment with
the difference between the egocentric

1513
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:53,274
and then the more impartial
or autobiographical.

1514
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:57,412
Reminded me a lot of the projective
consciousness model, projective

1515
01:26:57,412 --> 01:27:01,216
geometry model, which was also integrated
with higher order theories

1516
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:05,286
and global workspace,
and a lot of those other topics with

1517
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:08,423
Ryan Smith and Christopher White

1518
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:12,760
and also the more geometrical work
with Woodruff and others,

1519
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:15,997
because it's like we do need
both those modes.

1520
01:27:15,997 --> 01:27:18,967
We need the one where the hands are
bigger when they're closer to your face.

1521
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:22,470
And we need the one where it's like
you're playing

1522
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:25,406
the video game with a third person view.

1523
01:27:25,873 --> 01:27:28,710
And then it was really interesting
when you point to a lot of the

1524
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:31,713
seen as deficits of memory

1525
01:27:31,713 --> 01:27:35,850
or cognition like false memory,
but just seeing them

1526
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:40,421
as computational outcomes
of stochastic intercept

1527
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:45,059
of lossy compression
and generalization, semantic encoding.

1528
01:27:45,627 --> 01:27:49,163
What's more likely,
who kind of person are you that's going

1529
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:52,467
to, you know, scale whether you think
you did something or not?

1530
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:55,803
So that's just such a interesting area

1531
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:58,906
that you kind of took it down.

1532
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:01,943
Thank you.

1533
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:03,044
It's interesting bringing up like

1534
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:06,347
Rudolph because like,
there's some things like I wonder, like,

1535
01:28:06,347 --> 01:28:10,451
you know, when you first
get the capacity for projective geometric

1536
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:13,855
modeling of, all kinds and so like this.

1537
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:18,393
So with and what's the nature
of the conjecture geometric model like,

1538
01:28:18,726 --> 01:28:21,663
is this something
that might show to establish or

1539
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:26,634
is this something that you would expect

1540
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:29,937
at the level
of like cortical micro circuitry,

1541
01:28:29,937 --> 01:28:32,974
like some interpretation of like
what cortical macro columns are doing?

1542
01:28:33,508 --> 01:28:36,477
Or is this something
that's actually more complex?

1543
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:40,515
And it's like a distributed algorithm
like Hinton has like ideas, like Glom

1544
01:28:40,515 --> 01:28:42,884
the kind of get it
something like this like they

1545
01:28:43,284 --> 01:28:46,054
because what you have with this projected
geometric models the ability

1546
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:50,992
to flexibly move between egocentric Alice
centric perspectives.

1547
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:53,161
I can take your point of view or mine.

1548
01:28:53,294 --> 01:28:56,698
Once they raise everything
or boost it up into this,

1549
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,067
I forget to do

1550
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:03,338
that hyperbolic or for whatever
the space, as he puts it in from within.

1551
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:06,174
There you can embed either
either want to move between them.

1552
01:29:07,075 --> 01:29:09,410
The thing I'm wondering
is like the nature of these, like

1553
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:13,614
I just mentioned this like ability to

1554
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,952
take fictitious points of view on you.

1555
01:29:17,952 --> 01:29:23,024
I'm wondering whether like the way in
which which is a lot more derived

1556
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:27,195
and a kind of skill of moving between

1557
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:31,899
things like the representations
you might have acquired through mirroring

1558
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:36,270
with others and, and like to to take
another perspective rather than it being

1559
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:39,807
something
that, that the visual system can just do

1560
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:44,178
of moving between of automatically
translating from points of view

1561
01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:46,981
within this higher space,
like what is the nature of that model?

1562
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:51,152
Like I've even wondered like,
for instance, is perception actually

1563
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:56,491
always 2D and kind of like
holographic was always a 2D projection.

1564
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:58,326
And when we talk about something
like depth,

1565
01:29:58,326 --> 01:30:00,728
it's actually either some sort of like

1566
01:30:02,096 --> 01:30:02,663
sense of

1567
01:30:02,663 --> 01:30:06,134
affordances or intercept of cross mapping

1568
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:09,837
or the likely transitions between 2D
or even like 3D.

1569
01:30:09,837 --> 01:30:13,141
Like we, like we never like
Marcello's like 2.5 D vision.

1570
01:30:13,374 --> 01:30:17,078
Like, is that just the ability
to make sure that what's on the screen

1571
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:20,281
that's 2D is always coherent

1572
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:22,950
or that that you move between
as if you can move around a thing.

1573
01:30:23,317 --> 01:30:27,054
But we actually never perceive
anything in 3D in terms of our visual

1574
01:30:27,054 --> 01:30:30,425
spatial awareness of it
to loop around to the art,

1575
01:30:31,492 --> 01:30:32,360
I don't know.

1576
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:35,563
But like you might distinguish,
for instance if you consider

1577
01:30:35,563 --> 01:30:39,434
the perspective of the art itself
as generative model,

1578
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:45,473
then that might be by default,
more Alice centric,

1579
01:30:45,473 --> 01:30:49,210
especially because of its
like what it's specifically

1580
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:52,280
doing to the its extent even makes sense

1581
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:56,250
if it's it's fundamentally
part of the superorganism

1582
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:59,120
the organism is it's
not even superorganism like like

1583
01:30:59,687 --> 01:31:02,757
like Daniel says,
like it is the unit that makes sense.

1584
01:31:02,757 --> 01:31:04,892
That's things.
This is the shared enactment.

1585
01:31:05,693 --> 01:31:06,661
But then if you go

1586
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:10,431
maybe like the attractor dynamics
of like the central complex, this like

1587
01:31:10,731 --> 01:31:15,369
quasi hippocampal, quasi syllabic thing
that might be more egocentric.

1588
01:31:16,437 --> 01:31:19,474
And I don't think you're going to get.

1589
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:21,943
Just totally agree with that.

1590
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:25,513
I think it's a established fact
that the compass heading

1591
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:29,550
or the polarization of light is processed
within one aspect head.

1592
01:31:29,884 --> 01:31:35,056
And then there are collective decisions
like the sex ratio of the larva

1593
01:31:35,056 --> 01:31:38,493
that they're going to keep or
the overall regulation of foraging that

1594
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:44,732
wouldn't be expected
to have even a correlate necessarily

1595
01:31:44,932 --> 01:31:49,170
in the head
capsule of any single nest mate.

1596
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:52,173
And so I think that's where
the discussion comes to like Multi-Scale

1597
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:57,812
Systems, which is kind of a fun topic
because in Multiscale systems

1598
01:31:58,045 --> 01:32:03,050
we see sometimes a clean mechanistic
difference between the lateral

1599
01:32:03,317 --> 01:32:06,354
and the kind of vertical
or the nesting of systems.

1600
01:32:06,554 --> 01:32:09,957
So like communication,
we can see the interface

1601
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:13,861
where you have
the lateral layer of individuals

1602
01:32:14,128 --> 01:32:18,432
and then where you have the layers
that are inside of the individual

1603
01:32:21,469 --> 01:32:23,271
it's a little harder to disentangle

1604
01:32:23,271 --> 01:32:26,440
if they're all like
kind of crossfire, but

1605
01:32:29,477 --> 01:32:32,113
what you want to discussion are the ones.

1606
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:36,317
Yeah, I mean, it just makes me think of
how like, are we fundamentally broken

1607
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:41,255
with our, like, self little egocentric
loop, right?

1608
01:32:41,255 --> 01:32:42,690
Like that.

1609
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:45,493
Are we maybe like measuring forever

1610
01:32:45,493 --> 01:32:48,596
the incorrect scale of stuff?

1611
01:32:48,896 --> 01:32:52,867
Like, should we maybe be more concerned
about like the scale

1612
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:57,872
of all of us together or the scale
of all of the parts that make up us?

1613
01:32:57,872 --> 01:33:03,578
Instead, we like kind of falsify and
create like our ego and our relationship.

1614
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:06,614
We like project a lot
about how we think we should be

1615
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:09,884
within the world
or how we think things are within us.

1616
01:33:10,217 --> 01:33:12,486
But like we don't
actually know anything about

1617
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:15,289
I don't know, just related to that.

1618
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:17,491
I'm in

1619
01:33:18,993 --> 01:33:20,194
stuff way beyond neuroscience,

1620
01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:23,264
but like I'd say

1621
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:25,566
yes, but also

1622
01:33:27,368 --> 01:33:29,971
like I both think
this is one of the most valuable

1623
01:33:29,971 --> 01:33:34,408
and fraught parts of the psychedelic
and the

1624
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:38,980
discourse around psychedelics
and meditation, where it's like

1625
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:41,849
if you get this
myopic, egocentric perspective,

1626
01:33:42,183 --> 01:33:45,419
that's going to be a real problem
for multiple reasons.

1627
01:33:45,519 --> 01:33:47,254
It's even for you
it's going to be a problem

1628
01:33:47,254 --> 01:33:49,824
because you see things from one way
you're going to get

1629
01:33:49,824 --> 01:33:53,027
owned by yourself as a kind of like
you'll get trapped in all sorts of local.

1630
01:33:53,361 --> 01:33:56,998
You see things in one way
you really barely see in any anyway.

1631
01:33:56,998 --> 01:34:00,434
But I do worry a little bit though about

1632
01:34:02,236 --> 01:34:05,039
overly well,
you know, egos get themselves in trouble,

1633
01:34:05,339 --> 01:34:08,042
but like the ability to stitch together,
for instance,

1634
01:34:08,743 --> 01:34:13,681
you know, there is like a unit over which
you have potentially maximal purchase

1635
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:17,852
and then like in terms of influence,
there's a sense in which

1636
01:34:17,852 --> 01:34:21,822
like you're the steward of that because
like the cause of closure is densest.

1637
01:34:22,456 --> 01:34:24,291
And there's also a sense
in which like, let's say

1638
01:34:25,626 --> 01:34:26,727
I want to coordinate

1639
01:34:26,727 --> 01:34:31,032
with others,
including myself, across time,

1640
01:34:31,365 --> 01:34:36,370
like the ability to like
have a narrative structure of the ability

1641
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:40,541
that's going to be helpful
for not like just jumping at whatever

1642
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:44,378
source of utility or,
or expected free energy comes along.

1643
01:34:44,879 --> 01:34:47,948
And so like to basically avoid being

1644
01:34:49,884 --> 01:34:51,619
functionally psychopathic,

1645
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:57,525
like you kind of need the ego,
but you also need to have the ego

1646
01:34:57,525 --> 01:35:00,194
not be too tight
to avoid being functionally psychopathic

1647
01:35:00,895 --> 01:35:03,964
so as not to tighten that too loose.

1648
01:35:03,964 --> 01:35:06,300
Otherwise the whole thing's right.

1649
01:35:07,568 --> 01:35:12,373
That sounds narrative stick merging
like agent environment feedback loops

1650
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:15,976
and also of the scripts research

1651
01:35:16,944 --> 01:35:18,979
that we've talked previously

1652
01:35:19,814 --> 01:35:23,818
with all the Russian and others
where that's sort of the top down prior.

1653
01:35:24,085 --> 01:35:27,688
So it's related to what you said
about the hard problem as to

1654
01:35:27,688 --> 01:35:29,523
if or why or why not.

1655
01:35:29,523 --> 01:35:33,294
There would be aware
ness of experience at,

1656
01:35:33,661 --> 01:35:38,966
for example, the bodily level versus the,
you know, tripartite zoom chat level.

1657
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:42,036
But at the very least,

1658
01:35:42,036 --> 01:35:47,541
instrumentally, those top level scripts
are the narratives that decide like,

1659
01:35:47,808 --> 01:35:50,277
are we going to put everybody,
you know, through a tunnel

1660
01:35:50,277 --> 01:35:52,980
where only this exact width
is going to make it through?

1661
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:58,219
Or is that a phenotype
that we have a lot of ambiguity

1662
01:35:58,219 --> 01:36:01,589
around using the Bayesian prior term? So

1663
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:06,961
it is interesting
how and I almost want to ask you whether

1664
01:36:06,961 --> 01:36:11,799
you started with the more neurosis side
and found it broaching to these questions

1665
01:36:11,799 --> 01:36:15,603
or whether you started
maybe focused on other areas

1666
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:39,059
and then saw the brains of specifics
as increasingly important.

1667
01:36:39,059 --> 01:36:41,428
Like there's so little separation for me
between like

1668
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:44,598
the neuroscience obsession

1669
01:36:44,598 --> 01:36:48,068
and the existential,
like I'm constantly doing.

1670
01:36:48,102 --> 01:36:51,338
I'm constantly in a state of existential
freak out and neuroscience obsession

1671
01:36:51,338 --> 01:36:52,339
that I don't know which side,

1672
01:36:52,339 --> 01:36:55,643
which I don't know who's the dog,
who's the tail and who's wagging whom.

1673
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:58,579
It's just constant existential crisis and

1674
01:36:59,046 --> 01:37:01,982
obsession.

1675
01:37:01,982 --> 01:37:02,550
So I don't know

1676
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:04,185
what.

1677
01:37:07,154 --> 01:37:09,623
What would be

1678
01:37:09,623 --> 01:37:12,593
advice to somebody
who's curious about the field

1679
01:37:12,593 --> 01:37:18,599
or they want to be working
in an interesting area of neuroscience

1680
01:37:18,599 --> 01:37:21,936
and embodiment
and everything that you kind of mentioned

1681
01:37:21,936 --> 01:37:27,341
today.

1682
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:30,444
It seems like if someone
wants to focus on psychedelics,

1683
01:37:31,011 --> 01:37:35,049
the best route is to cut your teeth

1684
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:38,652
or to like basically get
a home outside of psychedelics,

1685
01:37:39,153 --> 01:37:43,057
establish a competency there,
and then try to bring that

1686
01:37:43,057 --> 01:37:44,325
within the psychedelic domain.

1687
01:37:44,325 --> 01:37:47,027
That seems like the best path that

1688
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:52,366
most people who succeed
in this space take.

1689
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:56,770
And yes, it's, you know, the standard,

1690
01:37:57,605 --> 01:38:00,808
fraught thing of academia
where it's like you're trying to

1691
01:38:01,442 --> 01:38:03,711
not be an inch wide and a mile deep

1692
01:38:03,844 --> 01:38:07,648
and you're trying to not be a jack
of all trades, master of none.

1693
01:38:08,182 --> 01:38:11,552
And where the perverse
incentives abound and

1694
01:38:13,487 --> 01:38:17,191
good luck, like

1695
01:38:18,492 --> 01:38:21,061
some combination of like

1696
01:38:21,362 --> 01:38:27,601
the both paying your dues
and not optimizing yourself

1697
01:38:27,601 --> 01:38:32,172
into a brittle straitjacket
where you can't see anything

1698
01:38:32,172 --> 01:38:36,310
past the next grant.

1699
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:39,113
Yikes.

1700
01:38:39,113 --> 01:38:41,649
I feel you.

1701
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:42,383
Okay.

1702
01:38:44,285 --> 01:38:45,252
Thanks for the answer.

1703
01:38:45,252 --> 01:38:49,089
So one small question from the chat
and then if anyone else has

1704
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:50,357
any final questions.

1705
01:38:50,357 --> 01:38:54,662
So, Adam, thanks for your time
and the great presentation and cool work

1706
01:38:54,662 --> 01:38:55,829
and hanging out with us.

1707
01:38:55,829 --> 01:38:58,699
So Adam mentioned the DMT paper

1708
01:38:58,699 --> 01:39:01,735
with respect to the cortical traveling
waves.

1709
01:39:01,735 --> 01:39:04,872
The question was wonder
if there's any other work on non

1710
01:39:04,872 --> 01:39:08,409
alpha waves
and then just if you know about that

1711
01:39:08,409 --> 01:39:12,012
and then just a little more generally,
why do these traveling waves matter

1712
01:39:12,012 --> 01:39:17,418
or what matters
if they are important or not?

1713
01:39:17,418 --> 01:39:19,920
So there's a sense in which

1714
01:39:21,322 --> 01:39:22,022
like I

1715
01:39:22,022 --> 01:39:24,725
drew like those swaths,
those like synchronous complexes,

1716
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:27,928
but those are necessarily
course screening.

1717
01:39:28,228 --> 01:39:31,532
You zoom in on them and it's like,
so what's the ontological status?

1718
01:39:31,765 --> 01:39:35,970
It has a certain relational realism
and that the extent it makes sense, like

1719
01:39:36,003 --> 01:39:40,007
draw that out, like the act of inference
in general with Markoff blankets,

1720
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:43,410
it's like you can it's relative to what

1721
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:47,548
other system that's engaging
and what types of inference they'll just

1722
01:39:48,082 --> 01:39:50,050
decide, like the scope of relevance.

1723
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:52,853
I mean, there's additional like auto
poetics, self organizing moments of like

1724
01:39:52,886 --> 01:39:54,188
and then the internal.

1725
01:39:54,188 --> 01:39:58,859
But so like if you look though,
it's like a synchronous, like an alpha,

1726
01:39:59,226 --> 01:40:01,528
beta, alpha, you zoom
in, it's actually comprised

1727
01:40:01,528 --> 01:40:04,298
of these traveling waves
as more of a fine grained description,

1728
01:40:04,598 --> 01:40:07,134
although you zoom in on that,
that's actually prescreening

1729
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:08,969
of population level activity.

1730
01:40:10,037 --> 01:40:12,072
And so it'll depend.

1731
01:40:12,072 --> 01:40:13,707
So there's going to be

1732
01:40:14,641 --> 01:40:17,311
potentially, if you're looking at
traveling cortical waves,

1733
01:40:17,945 --> 01:40:20,214
that might be useful.

1734
01:40:20,214 --> 01:40:22,716
So I focus a lot on like
the standing wave description

1735
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:26,286
as like a joint belief over
whatever is in its scope.

1736
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:29,156
But if you're talking about something
like predictive processing

1737
01:40:31,258 --> 01:40:33,694
within the model,
you might want to zoom in

1738
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:34,828
on the standing wave

1739
01:40:34,828 --> 01:40:38,532
or the setting of description
for like the business end of passing

1740
01:40:38,532 --> 01:40:41,101
on your predictions,
then kicking up your prediction errors.

1741
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:43,404
But depends like

1742
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:48,108
it depends on the the, the,
the within the multi scale account.

1743
01:40:48,275 --> 01:40:51,879
What's of interest for the modeler?

1744
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:54,815
One quick thing
from the side of the end of.

1745
01:40:55,182 --> 01:40:59,787
The wave question whether there's
any non alpha wave traveling wave papers.

1746
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:02,056
I don't think so.

1747
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:05,392
I think the one I think the terminal one
was focusing on Alpha.

1748
01:41:05,392 --> 01:41:07,561
If I'm remembering,
I could be misremembering I think.

1749
01:41:08,128 --> 01:41:11,365
But there are four psychedelics.

1750
01:41:11,365 --> 01:41:12,633
Uh, I think

1751
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,568
Terry

1752
01:41:14,568 --> 01:41:17,671
Sinofsky I
think would be the person to look at for

1753
01:41:17,671 --> 01:41:21,642
some really good general
bio physics of traveling in the brain.

1754
01:41:22,142 --> 01:41:23,710
Uh, yeah.

1755
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:25,646
Sinofsky,
I think, would be the place to look.

1756
01:41:25,646 --> 01:41:29,583
A quick aside on DMT, like I mentioned,
like there might be endogenous

1757
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:33,353
EMT, there's debate over
how significant it is.

1758
01:41:33,353 --> 01:41:36,056
So some people say
it's not significant at all.

1759
01:41:36,056 --> 01:41:37,958
Some people say it's very significant.

1760
01:41:37,958 --> 01:41:41,395
So that's one place we know that it's
produced, is in the body,

1761
01:41:41,695 --> 01:41:43,130
the seat of the soul.

1762
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:45,532
And it's

1763
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:47,935
another place.

1764
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:51,271
And there's some evidence,
but some people have questioned it

1765
01:41:51,271 --> 01:41:56,310
that it might be almost akin to like a
neurotransmitter system in its own right.

1766
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:58,712
We just didn't know how to look at before
General

1767
01:42:00,547 --> 01:42:02,616
Organ at University of Michigan,

1768
01:42:02,616 --> 01:42:05,586
if you're interested
in that issue, in that debate.

1769
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:07,688
But it's possible that like

1770
01:42:09,056 --> 01:42:09,423
one of

1771
01:42:09,423 --> 01:42:12,126
the main endogenous ligands,
we don't know

1772
01:42:13,427 --> 01:42:15,596
of the five actually to a system.

1773
01:42:15,596 --> 01:42:19,967
One of the main stimulus might not
actually be serotonin, but might be DMT.

1774
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:23,470
So under like,
let's say like a limited experience like

1775
01:42:24,872 --> 01:42:27,674
so one, like I mentioned, like carbon
dioxide can do it

1776
01:42:27,674 --> 01:42:30,777
or maybe lactic acid
like you're, you're running for life or

1777
01:42:30,777 --> 01:42:34,148
for your lunch and it's super
high levels of blood acidity

1778
01:42:34,481 --> 01:42:37,651
and that might be activating
these proto psychedelic pathways.

1779
01:42:38,418 --> 01:42:41,088
But another one could be like
potentially DMT

1780
01:42:41,255 --> 01:42:43,857
used and things like

1781
01:42:44,191 --> 01:42:47,294
sex birthing and near-death experiences.

1782
01:42:47,528 --> 01:42:50,564
So like you almost bled out.

1783
01:42:50,564 --> 01:42:52,533
Maybe it's time to relax your beliefs.

1784
01:42:52,533 --> 01:42:56,803
You're about to bond
with another creature for years.

1785
01:42:57,204 --> 01:42:59,973
Maybe this is part of how you do it.

1786
01:42:59,973 --> 01:43:06,113
Whether bonding with a mate
or your offspring.

1787
01:43:06,113 --> 01:43:08,949
Very. SPECKHARD
These are early days in testing.

1788
01:43:08,949 --> 01:43:13,220
And also when we think about brain
and body, dopamine and serotonin,

1789
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:17,424
other neurotransmitters
in, the blood in the blood vessels,

1790
01:43:17,424 --> 01:43:20,494
the immune system and then neuropeptides,

1791
01:43:20,494 --> 01:43:23,330
the whole continuum of short acting

1792
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:28,068
neurotransmitters, slower
acting phenomena.

1793
01:43:28,068 --> 01:43:33,073
And then, oh, we're thinking about it
from a nested multi-scale systems

1794
01:43:33,073 --> 01:43:38,312
perspective with this kind of more local,
faster and then slower,

1795
01:43:39,313 --> 01:43:40,147
broader spatial

1796
01:43:40,147 --> 01:43:44,284
scales, which just has a lot of analogy
with everything

1797
01:43:44,284 --> 01:43:48,589
from governance
to the regulation of tissue.

1798
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:53,527
So it's kind of an interesting idea
how a lot comes together there.

1799
01:43:54,728 --> 01:43:59,099
Also made me think of how
staring into someone else's eyes

1800
01:43:59,399 --> 01:44:02,402
for like a prolonged period of time
induces

1801
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:06,073
like violent, disturbing hallucination,
which is like a put it in,

1802
01:44:06,573 --> 01:44:09,910
I don't know, some paper
I can't remember, but I'll look it up and

1803
01:44:09,943 --> 01:44:12,779
see if I can posted in the chat.
But it's interesting.

1804
01:44:12,779 --> 01:44:14,982
How like thinking through other's or

1805
01:44:14,982 --> 01:44:17,751
like looking through other's eyes

1806
01:44:18,752 --> 01:44:21,855
is, is so violently incorrect to us

1807
01:44:21,855 --> 01:44:26,627
that it's perceived
as like an altered perception.

1808
01:44:26,627 --> 01:44:33,900
I wonder if this is speaking to
like the way in which we bootstrap, like

1809
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:37,838
objectified selfhood and me and like,
but because like, we do it so much,

1810
01:44:37,838 --> 01:44:41,408
this is like a core axis of imagination
and perception

1811
01:44:41,875 --> 01:44:45,812
that you can create
these weird feedback loops.

1812
01:44:46,246 --> 01:44:48,749
And I also wonder like how much
it varies across people like,

1813
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:51,118
like, like if you were

1814
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:54,121
like really far
on the autism spectrum like

1815
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:58,292
or a far in a schizophrenia spectrum,
like would you like in a moment, like you

1816
01:44:58,292 --> 01:44:59,059
look at someone's eyes

1817
01:44:59,059 --> 01:45:02,262
and it's like it takes you
2 seconds to enter, like the psychedelic

1818
01:45:03,196 --> 01:45:07,067
or might it take like, you know, you
got to sit there for like an hour like.

1819
01:45:08,335 --> 01:45:10,570
This has this like, I think 10 minutes.

1820
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:13,974
So I'll find it right now posted in the.

1821
01:45:13,974 --> 01:45:16,843
Chat happening to me right now. Yeah.

livestream, not your last.
