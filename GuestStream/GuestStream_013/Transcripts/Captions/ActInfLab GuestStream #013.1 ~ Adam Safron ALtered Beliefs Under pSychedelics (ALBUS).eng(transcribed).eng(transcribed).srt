1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,440
hi i'm Bleu knight i'm here with daniel

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,679
friedman today is november 8th 2021

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,880
for a guest stream with adam Safron

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,359
adam please take it away

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,880
um

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,080
hi Bleu hi daniel hi everyone

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,840
it's good to be talking with you today

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,960
and

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,160
um i guess we're here to talk about

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,000
psychedelics and

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,120
the 5ht2a and related systems and

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,640
active inference

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,239
and so

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,800
i'll describe some recent

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,320
work on this and

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,600
looking forward to talking about it with

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,440
you

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,920
so let me get my screen

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,320
sharing

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,879
on

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,640
okay

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,280
coming through

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,440
excellent

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,879
so

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,400
um

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,159
i'm using my uh uh

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,040
active inference workshop slides as a

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,600
base and i'll go over those with a

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,439
little bit slower than i did uh in the

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,040
10 minutes i had there

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,759
and

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,080
then we'll take it from there and talk

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,040
it out

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,560
so

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,439
this is

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,320
you know part of an ongoing project to

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,240
both try to understand the

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,600
mechanisms of psychedelics but also the

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,400
impacted neurotransmitter

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,720
neuromodulator systems and the roles

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,799
they would have in active inference and

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,720
their potential significances for

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
their use as machine learning parameters

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,079
potentially

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,200
and so

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,600
when it comes to psychedelics um much of

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,399
the attention has been on the

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,600
5ht2a system and that's

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,040
a lot of evidence indicates that it

50
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,280
mediates the effects um

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,320
barely any work has been done

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,600
in machine learning on this and there

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,399
has been work done in active inference

54
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,399
and i'm going to introduce some a

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,440
compatible but slightly different take

56
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,319
on

57
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,840
the potential significances of these

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,920
systems

59
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,599
so

60
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,680
within machine learning a good amount of

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,280
work and with an active inference has

62
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,120
been done on the potential roles of

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,400
dopamine as a parameter

64
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,840
encoding

65
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,040
the

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,560
confidence one might have with respect

67
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,879
to policy selection

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
diane and others have suggested that

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,680
serotonin can act with an impotency to

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,239
dopamine based on a variety of lines of

71
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,640
evidence from neurophysiology and so

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,560
some work has also been done

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,000
in introducing a complementary

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,840
uncertainty parameter in the form of

75
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,519
serotonin this opponency can be thought

76
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,239
of um almost yin yang like with uh

77
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,599
dopamine being more of the yang and

78
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,440
serotonin being more of the yin

79
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,319
dopamine in general uh indicating in the

80
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,400
neuroscience literature's

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,200
incentive salience uh

82
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,519
confidence and if excessive potentially

83
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,480
impulsivity uh serotonin

84
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,840
would be

85
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,879
an opponency or an or complementarity i

86
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,800
would indicate the satisfaction of

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,159
desires states of uncertainty and

88
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,840
potentially a factor helping to

89
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,680
allow for patience rather than

90
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,360
impulsivity with respect to policy

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
selection

92
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,440
so

93
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,239
very little work though has been done in

94
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,519
machine learning uh on 5ht2a and also in

95
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,200
terms of active inference in terms of

96
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,400
actually uh modeling the 5hd2a system as

97
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,480
an active inference parameter

98
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,159
work is probably going to begin soon in

99
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,280
this direction

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,040
largely informed by the rebus paradigm

101
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,440
which we'll talk about soon

102
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,480
but

103
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,720
go back to uh the fundamentals of these

104
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,879
systems uh

105
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,040
the work that's been done so far with

106
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,120
the serotonin system can be thought of

107
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,400
more as relating to the 1a system

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,159
this would be

109
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,280
in contrast to the higher threshold i

110
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,360
believe it's a 5 to 1 ratio of

111
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,959
sensitivity uh

112
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,560
for the receptor of the two-way system

113
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,000
so when serotonin uh both of these by so

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,918
5ht is serotonin and you have some

115
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,280
i think 14 maybe 17 classes of receptors

116
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,120
depending on how you count them

117
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,960
but you know so how are we going to talk

118
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,520
about all of them well maybe eventually

119
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,960
but

120
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,800
it seems that

121
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,360
we might be able to go a fair ways uh

122
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,440
focus in terms of understanding their

123
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
significance

124
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,040
focusing on a few classes and sort of

125
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,960
working our way forward

126
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,360
with the additional receptors maybe

127
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,040
having a common significance to the

128
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,800
other ones but just

129
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,080
because they're located at different

130
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,280
parts of the brain it's a common

131
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,919
organism significance but functionally

132
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,440
you need them to do different things if

133
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,840
located in different places

134
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,479
into more detail soon but the 1a system

135
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,000
is shown to in general have more

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,080
inhibitory effects on

137
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,639
the signaling of pyramidal neurons while

138
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,800
the 5 hd2a system tends to be more

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,440
excitatory

140
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,000
carhart harris and nut have suggested

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,960
that

142
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,280
these both in a face of challenge

143
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,600
would be responses to challenge but the

144
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,120
1a might be something more like an

145
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,000
active or a passive coping response

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,199
being more

147
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,320
still

148
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,720
patient stop and think as opposed to the

149
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,039
2a system which might be more of an

150
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:35,919
active

151
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,400
coping response in the face of challenge

152
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
something more imaginative and

153
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,320
potentially creative

154
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,479
so

155
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,919
let's

156
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,360
yeah let's keep going

157
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,680
so

158
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,840
going back to dopamine versus serotonin

159
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,000
though um serotonin in general not

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,039
focusing necessarily on 1a versus 2a

161
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,639
there seems to be

162
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,280
some evidence suggesting that

163
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
dopamine will push you or actually a

164
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,319
good amount that dopamine tends to push

165
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,080
the organism towards more externally

166
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,199
focused attention in terms of uh helping

167
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,720
to increase the gain on more

168
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,680
exteroceptive and salience networks for

169
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
externally focused attention

170
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,360
5ht in contrast seems to be up

171
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
regulating the default mode and more

172
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,240
internally focused attention so that's

173
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
another interesting

174
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,360
difference

175
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,520
but to come to the 2a

176
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,039
so these receptors as i mentioned before

177
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,199
they tend to have

178
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,440
high thresholds for activation by

179
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
serotonin

180
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,199
1a will be modulating mood as their

181
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,039
serotonin levels are going up and down

182
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,240
you might get this sort of gentle

183
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,000
adjustment but 2a it's going to take

184
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,160
more to really get those systems going

185
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,599
in fact

186
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,039
some of their activity might be

187
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,800
modulated by things other than serotonin

188
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,560
so there's evidence that things like

189
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,120
carbon dioxide um

190
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,440
maybe blood acidity in general is

191
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,199
changing their

192
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,240
activity and uh maybe the endogenous dmt

193
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,160
system which we could talk about later

194
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,039
uh so

195
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,000
psychedelics tend to come in about two

196
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,199
classes uh

197
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,680
one or classic psychedelics now one

198
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,039
would be based on the structure

199
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,199
structure of tryptamine the precursor of

200
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,199
serotonin and the other would be based

201
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,240
on the structure of phenylethylamine uh

202
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,120
precursor of cachetolamines uh both of

203
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,440
these seem to be active at the five hd2a

204
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,400
system

205
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,680
which

206
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,039
a variety of lines of evidence have been

207
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,240
shown to mediate the effects of

208
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,919
psychedelics to a very substantial

209
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,240
degree

210
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,599
so

211
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,720
in the

212
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,639
uh machine learning

213
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,479
type work i've been collaborating with

214
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,840
um jara

215
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,599
shikhspahi

216
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,360
to try to

217
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,039
reverse engineer these different

218
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,800
neuromodulators as machine learning

219
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,599
parameters and so we've been

220
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,039
using an architecture which has elements

221
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,360
of hans nettuber's

222
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,720
world models

223
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,199
and uh danajar is a dreamer

224
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,639
to

225
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,599
interpret uh 5ht signaling as

226
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,680
potentially being a pr

227
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,199
as the different classes receptors as

228
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,400
parameters for imaginative planning or

229
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,520
an active inference terms a

230
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,599
sophisticated entrance

231
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,960
uh so

232
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
with respect to world models you'll see

233
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,039
is this working yeah it's working

234
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,039
so and in han schmidt hoover's

235
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,880
architecture they'll use these auto

236
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,719
encoders to take these different frames

237
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,360
this is in a doom game they'll compress

238
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,039
them into a lower dimensional latent

239
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,560
space and then they will unpack these

240
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,279
and

241
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,640
through this

242
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,399
training of the autoencoder to learn how

243
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,320
to reconstitute

244
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,680
these frames

245
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,959
you get this

246
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,640
low dimension source of

247
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,880
low dimensional vectors in latent space

248
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,000
which can be used for training and with

249
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,760
much better computational efficiency and

250
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,839
some learning properties um when you

251
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,200
don't have to go all the way back to

252
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,360
pixel space where things can get messy

253
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
and you don't know what's causing what

254
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,399
if you work with this latent space

255
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,600
you can

256
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,920
come out substantially ahead in terms of

257
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,760
training and so you have this

258
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,120
variational auto encoder which is

259
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,279
learning how to compress scenes so this

260
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,200
is one aspect

261
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,920
or compress the observations you then

262
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
feed this latent space

263
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,640
compressed vectors into this

264
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
recurrent network which learns to

265
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,480
predict the state transitions

266
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,640
you know shove this into a much lower uh

267
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,880
dimensional controller which uh they

268
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,120
trained uh with uh evolutionary

269
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,440
strategies and then used this for policy

270
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,640
selection

271
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,320
generating new observation and the

272
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,800
standard sort of um reinforcement

273
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,560
learning uh paradigm

274
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,600
uh

275
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
the interesting thing about these is

276
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,760
they could also be run offline so they

277
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,560
you're able to take these and uh take

278
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,959
the outputs and feed it right back in

279
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,839
and you can do imaginative rollouts so

280
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,320
you can use this for planning or for

281
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,519
having the

282
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,000
agent train in its imagination

283
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,920
and so this would be an example i

284
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,959
believe the left would be

285
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,760
but scene and or the left would be uh

286
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,600
the the compressed latent space and then

287
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,560
the right

288
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,720
would be the agent actually

289
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,920
i think the left is what was actually

290
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,000
seen this is pixel space and the right

291
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,800
is the the imaginative latent space

292
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,519
so

293
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,600
it tends to be you're not really seeing

294
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,120
it here but it tends to

295
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,240
these

296
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,160
imagine trainings like like imagination

297
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,519
relative to perception or sensation

298
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,920
it's less fidelity but you can still use

299
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,719
it for the sake of planning and learning

300
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,640
but one issue is that

301
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,040
these agents can do a kind of um

302
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,640
self-adversarial attack when they're

303
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,240
training their imagination

304
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
so if the the temperature the

305
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,720
uncertainty isn't high enough they can

306
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,160
uh basically come up with these sort of

307
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,880
fantasies of uh easy environments where

308
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,720
they you know are just winning but then

309
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,040
this doesn't transfer to the real world

310
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,600
and so then by introducing a temperature

311
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,399
parameter

312
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,880
to increase the uncertainty of your

313
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,920
imaginative rollouts um this allows for

314
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,360
better training back to the real world

315
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,320
and so this

316
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,880
um i've been suggesting is potentially

317
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,560
one interpretation

318
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,079
of the 5-ht-1a system um

319
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,200
the

320
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,920
as increasing the temperature um putting

321
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,000
the organism basically instead of

322
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,079
dopamine would be you're confident go

323
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,720
forth and act uh serotonin acting on the

324
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,640
1a system would say we're not so

325
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,519
confident stop and think or imagine

326
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,600
uh don't act right away but let's let's

327
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,440
think this out or let's imaginatively

328
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,720
plan this out

329
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,920
look a little bit in our mind's eye

330
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,760
before we leap

331
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,440
the two way though

332
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,560
seems like

333
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,120
it's almost like a hybrid of the 1a and

334
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
dopamine where it's like okay

335
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,560
imagine more

336
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,040
but it's not necessarily doing so under

337
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,399
a state of uncertainty within these um

338
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,000
imaginative rollouts things are

339
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,079
appearing more vivid where the gap

340
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,959
between imagination and reality uh seems

341
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,200
to be uh narrowing

342
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,680
and the idea is of if you're thinking

343
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
back like passive versus active coping

344
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,639
so you're uncertain let's say the 1a

345
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,800
system is in the mix now you're okay i'm

346
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,160
not going to overtly act i'm going to

347
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,600
stop and think i'm going to reduce the

348
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,639
gain on the um expected free energy or

349
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,360
the expected value of pursuing a policy

350
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,880
right now

351
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,480
patience but if the 2a gets in the mix

352
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
it's going to tend to be more active

353
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
you're going to be imagining

354
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,480
but

355
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,920
you're going to be more likely to act on

356
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,040
these imaginings because you're uh

357
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,560
they're more compelling uh more vivid

358
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,279
so

359
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,680
now we're coming back to uh psychedelics

360
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,440
but i want to lay out this foundation

361
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,560
because the whole

362
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,800
way through the method is basically

363
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,519
a kind of marian neurophenomenology

364
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,320
trying to understand the mind at

365
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
computational functional algorithmic and

366
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,480
implementational levels of analysis

367
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,360
and then mapping this on to

368
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,000
rich descriptions of experience of

369
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,760
subjective experience so

370
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,000
mapping standard the cognitive science

371
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,399
multi-level stack to phenomenology

372
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,680
and

373
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,120
so the machine learning is part of

374
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
pulling off this mapping we could also

375
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,760
or active inference is part of that

376
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,959
so

377
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,160
uh to rehearse um the basics of rebus uh

378
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,079
other am i coming across all right or

379
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,079
just checking in okay

380
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,519
so the

381
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,160
relax beliefs under psychedelics this

382
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,800
i'd say might be the dominant paradigm

383
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,839
for understanding the significance of

384
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,240
the five hd 2a system

385
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,120
in creating the effects of psychedelics

386
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,519
under a predictive processing paradigm

387
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,680
so

388
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,519
according to rebus

389
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,720
you'll get

390
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,000
i don't think i have to rehearse

391
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,240
predictive coding here but very briefly

392
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,560
uh the idea is you have a hierarchy

393
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,519
where

394
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,079
of predictions where you are passing

395
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,320
your priors or your prediction errors

396
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,760
down the hierarchy

397
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,600
back towards the primary modalities

398
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,680
where the observations are coming in and

399
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,480
then you're passing prediction errors

400
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,680
upwards

401
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,320
and this coding scheme is efficient

402
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,480
especially if the events that you're

403
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,199
tracking or trying to model are clocking

404
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,519
slower to the internal states so

405
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,839
with something like telecommunications

406
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,160
if all you have to do is uh

407
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,320
transmit what's different between the

408
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,360
frames and uh i don't know 24 hertz used

409
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,519
to be what tv was back in the day but if

410
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,440
most of the pixels are largely the same

411
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,000
frame to frame and all you do is you

412
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,120
show what's different you get this

413
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,880
energy savings and when you're dealing

414
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,600
with an organ as hungry as a brain two

415
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
to three percent of your body mass 20 of

416
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,040
the budget

417
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,079
that the savings could be substantial uh

418
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:00,959
and

419
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,720
nature world of the quick and the dead

420
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,240
natural selection might have picked such

421
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,440
a thing

422
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,720
so

423
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,199
within creative coding

424
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,320
the

425
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,920
predictions are thought to be encoded by

426
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,839
these uh so if you think of cortex as um

427
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,720
jeff hawkins says it's roughly uh a

428
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,279
dinner napkin and thickness an extent

429
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,279
that's been crumpled up and shoved into

430
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,279
your head cortex has these different

431
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,839
layers um roughly six

432
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:28,880
and so

433
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,240
and this is distinct from like levels of

434
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
a hierarchy but the cortex the sheet if

435
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,639
you go like across the napkin

436
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,720
there's these layers about six

437
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,399
and depending on where you are they're

438
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,720
more or less distinct but the l5 or the

439
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,399
deep pyramidal neurons these are the

440
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,800
ones that will leave cortex do things

441
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,040
like form loops with thalamus the

442
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,079
striatum uh cerebellum

443
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,360
spine

444
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,880
and

445
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,959
that's what will is thought to encourage

446
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,839
your predictions these l5 deep pyramidal

447
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,759
neurons not deep in terms of a deep

448
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,560
police hierarchy but deep in terms of uh

449
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
relative to the coracle surface

450
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,920
more in there um and within the napkin

451
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,160
uh the prediction errors are thought to

452
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,360
be encoded by the superficial pyramidal

453
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,880
neurons on layers two three so l5 is

454
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,800
forming these big um synchronous

455
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,880
complexes with the thalamus

456
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,160
probably not the only way it does the

457
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,320
predictions but this will be um

458
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,839
aggregating information from multiple

459
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,079
different places giving you

460
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,320
and because you're able to get a a lot

461
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,680
of different causes brought together

462
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,880
it's going to be a good source of priors

463
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,800
it's going to be a good source of your

464
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,519
expectation and your modeling

465
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,720
and then you use this to try to suppress

466
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,320
the ascending stream of prediction

467
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,240
errors along this superficial layer 2 3.

468
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,160
you can go into layer later if that's

469
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,360
useful

470
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,680
but the idea is that

471
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,959
with under psychedelics

472
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,199
you take l5 pyramidal neurons these

473
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,600
excitatory neurons and you excite them

474
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,560
so much with 5ht 2a stimulation that

475
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,640
they fall out of sync with each other

476
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,959
and it's um

477
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,119
it's a kind of paradoxical effect when

478
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,880
they fire too readily they don't

479
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,400
coordinate anymore in establishing a

480
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,959
synchronous rhythm and because of this

481
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,319
they're actually

482
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,520
paradoxically relaxing the priors become

483
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,880
less precise the uh belief or free

484
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,839
energy landscape becomes flatter

485
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,119
and so now the idea is with your

486
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,880
expectations being less

487
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,360
more information from the periphery is

488
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,240
capable of penetrating deeper into the

489
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,720
cortical hierarchy registering more in

490
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,480
consciousness and

491
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,600
impacting

492
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,880
learning and updating to a potentially

493
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,600
greater degree and so this is a model of

494
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,200
the much of the phenomenology of

495
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,760
psychedelics as well as their mechanism

496
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,320
of therapeutic action for helping people

497
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,440
to um

498
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,200
as pollen would say like how to change

499
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,039
your mind helping you to change and

500
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,120
change your mind to update

501
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,480
and so

502
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,679
um

503
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,799
i think rebus is uh largely correct but

504
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,520
i've been introducing a potential

505
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,760
refinement of it um in something i call

506
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,440
albus which includes in addition to

507
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,600
rebus effects uh something i call sevis

508
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,799
effects or strengthening beliefs and so

509
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,720
uh the idea is that

510
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,360
you might not get exactly this

511
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,160
desynchronization effect along the whole

512
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,080
dose response curve

513
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,640
of 5ht2a agonism

514
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,160
or stimulation of the 582 t2a receptor

515
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,080
rather this might be the case of what

516
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,240
you would expect from very high levels

517
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,720
of agonism um that's really strong

518
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,880
excitation but let's say we increase the

519
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,799
gain like just a little bit or a

520
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,039
moderate amount i suggest it's not at

521
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,799
all obvious that this would cause the

522
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,320
energy landscape to flatten this would

523
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,799
not cause them necessarily to fall out

524
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,320
of sync with each other in fact they

525
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,919
might be able to sync up even more

526
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,240
powerfully if you just increase it a

527
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,280
little bit

528
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,440
or moderately we don't actually know

529
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,360
this might vary from you know organism

530
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,520
to organism uh but the idea is we might

531
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,840
need um different regimes different

532
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,520
accounts depending on where we are with

533
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,600
what level of stimulation before we

534
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,559
would expect to see the kind of

535
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,559
paradoxical desynchronization

536
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,799
or potentially more straightforward

537
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,080
enhanced synchronous ability

538
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,240
the

539
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,520
yeah

540
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,679
so

541
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,720
to bring it back to predictive coding so

542
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,240
here if you're going to try to

543
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,799
illustrate this uh the purple would be

544
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,480
your deep pyramidal neurons uh

545
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,160
supposedly encoding

546
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,360
or that are thought to encode your

547
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,840
beliefs and then up top you have

548
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,760
the white circles this would be your

549
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,000
superficial pyramidal neurons the upper

550
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,520
part of the layer and this would be

551
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,640
encoding your prediction areas that

552
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,160
you're passing upwards and so you're

553
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,679
seeing these i'm illustrating the

554
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,280
synchronous complexes by these red

555
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,520
swaths the predictions going downwards

556
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,480
are these red arrows and then um i'm

557
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,000
depicting basically the prediction areas

558
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,720
as these gray swabs some

559
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,679
and black arrows so within predictive

560
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,000
coding there's been significance

561
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,520
assigned to different

562
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,159
eeg and meg frequency bounds as

563
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,520
potentially corresponding more or less

564
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,960
to predictions or prediction errors more

565
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,080
specifically the slower rhythms like uh

566
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,320
alpha and beta where alpha is maybe

567
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,440
roughly 8 to 12 times a second betas

568
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,480
maybe 13 to 30 times a second that these

569
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,640
slower rhythms would be the ones

570
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,320
encoding your predictions

571
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,919
uh pass downwards

572
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,520
but that your prediction errors might be

573
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,440
more likely to be encoded by

574
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,320
gamma frequencies you know anywhere from

575
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,480
40 to 120 even even higher uh

576
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,240
oscillations per second

577
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
uh so within this part of the reason

578
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,000
that this might make some intuitive

579
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,799
sense

580
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,039
is if you're thinking of

581
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,360
the formation of a synchronous complex

582
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,880
of neural activity

583
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,480
uh that

584
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,960
uh faster would be smaller and slower

585
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,799
would be bigger or more inclusive more

586
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,400
integrative this might make some

587
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,919
intuitive sense if you're thinking of

588
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,360
okay so you're trying to get this

589
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,360
agreement this negotiation of a common

590
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,000
rhythm of a bunch of signaling units

591
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,640
if you're having more units spread over

592
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,840
a bigger distance you're trying to get

593
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,320
them to go come into agreement this

594
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,840
might necessarily have to be a slower

595
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,799
process

596
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,200
but if you're let's say like quantizing

597
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,720
prediction error generally like a little

598
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,360
packet of like a local agreement that

599
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,960
you're passing upwards

600
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,200
well that you can potentially clock a

601
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,840
lot quicker um so

602
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,480
that's the basic idea there so

603
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
if we were to look at rebus it would

604
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,600
look something like you see uh the the

605
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,280
right bottom uh the

606
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,240
swath of red is more restricted in scope

607
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,559
and the arrows are a little bit smaller

608
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,919
and so this is idea of you've relaxed

609
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,000
your beliefs this is um if you get this

610
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,600
paradoxical um

611
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,520
desynchronization

612
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,120
but uh

613
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
and so once you have this you're seeing

614
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,559
less of these prediction areas are being

615
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,720
inhibited by this descending stream of

616
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,480
predictions and they're able to make

617
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,320
their way in more

618
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,559
deeper into the hierarchy and this would

619
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,840
be showing you know one modality

620
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,120
obviously the brain is not just one

621
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,120
singular hierarchy but it's a hierarchy

622
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,960
multiple intersecting hierarchies

623
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,360
corresponding to each of your modalities

624
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,440
all brought together stitched together

625
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,760
into a hierarchy

626
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,039
up top

627
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,360
would be illustrating a sebis effect and

628
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,679
so the swath is bigger

629
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,400
and the

630
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,679
arrows are also uh darker and bigger and

631
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,520
that's and more prediction errors are

632
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,640
being inhibited

633
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,919
there's an additional factor uh which is

634
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,760
five

635
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,480
ht2a

636
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,400
receptors are also found on the

637
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,720
inhibitory interneurons of layers two

638
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,600
three

639
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,320
and so in theory uh and there's some

640
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,799
evidence i believe that suggests this uh

641
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,559
this would correspond to a default

642
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,480
reduction in the gain on the ascending

643
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,640
stream of prediction errors or you would

644
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,120
say an active inference speak um

645
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,559
less precision weighting of the

646
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,600
precision

647
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,080
of the prediction errors and so they

648
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,320
have less of a contribution of the

649
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,840
bayesian updating that's happening at

650
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,919
each level of this belief hierarchy and

651
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,360
so that's illustrated by um slightly uh

652
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,840
uh i don't know if this is

653
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,080
yeah the on their own the arrows are a

654
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,679
little bit smaller so

655
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,120
the idea here with the cebus effect

656
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,640
would be not only might you have

657
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,240
stronger beliefs

658
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,919
but these beliefs might be further

659
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,760
shielded from contradiction by

660
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
inconsistent sense data

661
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,559
i think this potentially provides a

662
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,400
fairly parsimonious account of some of

663
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,240
the conditions under which you get

664
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,880
certain perceptual alterations of a

665
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,520
hallucinatory variety so for instance

666
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,720
people will sometimes report

667
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,080
hallucinations

668
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,400
in sensory deprivation tanks

669
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,919
they'll sometimes

670
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,360
i think it's called a charles bonnet

671
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,320
syndrome where as you start to let's say

672
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,720
go blind or deaf you'll start to get

673
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,880
like auditory or hallucinations within

674
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,360
the modality as you lose input from the

675
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,720
external world

676
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
uh this also you could think of at a

677
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,960
higher level i don't know if this works

678
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,000
but you could think of potentially

679
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,880
delusions in a similar way a belief

680
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,320
which is overly strong and resistant to

681
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,200
updating from uh potentially uh

682
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,799
contradictory and potentially correct

683
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,120
sense data so in theory for talking

684
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,400
about sebis effects you might have a

685
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,120
single parsimonious account

686
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,880
for both hallucinations and delusions

687
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,640
that's incorporating a little bit more

688
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,320
of the neuroanatomy

689
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,640
that being said i'm not saying at all

690
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,240
that rebus is incorrect i actually think

691
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,039
it's

692
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,480
probably very correct

693
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,240
and uh maybe crucially important for uh

694
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,919
explaining some of the really powerful

695
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,840
changes that people observe with

696
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,600
psychedelics as a therapeutic

697
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,279
intervention

698
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,320
so

699
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,679
get into a little more details here and

700
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,320
it's okay uh y'all with me still there

701
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,600
okay cool

702
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,840
so

703
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,919
i mentioned a header here earlier so

704
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,919
i've taken these um predictive coding

705
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,279
hierarchies here

706
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,799
and i'm just illustrating them as these

707
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,760
triangles and so here would be let's say

708
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,320
uh you're uh

709
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,360
so

710
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,520
i think in this framework of albus i'm

711
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,440
suggesting uh

712
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,919
we need to even uh in addition to

713
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,320
including things like sebis effects i

714
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,400
think we're going to need to take on

715
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,640
things like

716
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,679
basically

717
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,960
consciousness

718
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,919
and

719
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,159
higher order consciousness to actually

720
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,480
really adequately explain what we mean

721
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,960
by relaxed or strengthened beliefs and

722
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,120
what actually is happening with these uh

723
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,200
different neuromodulators and maybe

724
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,120
attempts at creating analogs

725
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,240
so

726
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,200
uh here you know up top would be somatic

727
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,120
sensation

728
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,440
to the right would be your vision and

729
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
then your hearing and we're going to try

730
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,120
to bring all these things together and

731
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,480
so if you're thinking of some sort of

732
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,240
hierarchy like here you might have like

733
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,919
small beta complexes you can think of

734
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,559
each of these as like a small modeling

735
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,120
effort and a small belief over whatever

736
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,559
is in the scope of this synchronous

737
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,679
complex

738
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,679
where the idea being that when you

739
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,919
synchronize neurons

740
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,440
this allows them to be aligned in their

741
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,200
activity and time such that their

742
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,480
signals can

743
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,039
sum and be integrated rather than decay

744
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,360
and so uh this would allow you to have

745
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,279
potentially a joint belief over whatever

746
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,760
is in the scope of a synchronous complex

747
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,279
uh pascal freeze calls this

748
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,279
communication through coherence

749
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,039
and uh for a reference for this idea of

750
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,279
like an inverse hierarchy of size and

751
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,520
speed butsaki would be a good reference

752
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,880
for that i'd say

753
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,720
so here we are on the left the

754
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,520
beginnings of modeling of

755
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,080
increased hierarchical depth

756
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,960
with

757
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,279
small fast beta complexes the extraction

758
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,520
of things like line segments and maybe

759
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,520
basic contours and vision uh basic uh

760
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,320
patterns within sound within touch

761
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,039
but then let's say we nest these within

762
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,760
maybe maybe slower broader more

763
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,840
encompassing beta

764
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,960
we could have

765
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,559
more hierarchical structure for our

766
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,159
modeling effort

767
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,080
and so here you might start to get the

768
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,840
beginnings of things like objects as you

769
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,600
bring together these different features

770
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,000
the beginnings of things like objects

771
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,679
with respect to touch your your or

772
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,440
rather your own body in relation to

773
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,320
those um the beginnings of things like

774
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,919
meaningful sounds

775
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,360
and so then

776
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,000
let's say we bring all the modalities

777
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,159
together now we let them cross talking

778
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,480
about multi-modal representation

779
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,200
that you've organized according to a

780
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,840
coherent perspectival reference frame

781
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,120
well now you might get the beginning of

782
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,880
something like phenomenality or

783
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,000
experience and so here there's a blue

784
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,640
swath corresponding to alpha

785
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,720
frequencies here um

786
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,080
where

787
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,919
at alpha frequencies that would roughly

788
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,320
be it looks like the size that you would

789
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,720
need so 8 to 12 times a second of a

790
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,480
frequency of updating or

791
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,440
or sampling or estimation that this

792
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,000
would be big enough to get you the

793
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,880
entire sensorium all brought together

794
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,960
bringing together that the

795
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,240
different hierarchies into a hierarchy

796
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,799
alpha has some additional significance

797
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,120
in that it has particularly concentrated

798
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,840
sources of alpha power from midline

799
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,039
structures

800
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:13,760
and

801
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,279
i take this as being important

802
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,799
because if you look at something like

803
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,880
the posterior midline we look at let's

804
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,760
say

805
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,360
the posterior cingulate cortex which is

806
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,279
heavily implicated in the psychedelic

807
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,799
and also the meditation

808
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,840
research literatures as when alpha goes

809
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,440
down there seems to be some associated

810
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,840
with phenomena such as ego dissolution

811
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,640
uh

812
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,679
but

813
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,360
the idea that alpha might be important

814
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,080
for

815
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,279
coherent

816
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,120
egocentric perspective

817
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
in addition to bringing together your

818
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,679
sensorium for this mutual information

819
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:46,880
these midline structures in particular

820
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,880
the posterior cingulate um there's this

821
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,440
old idea of the papez circuit where it's

822
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,440
this uh

823
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,159
core circuit for emotional memory um

824
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,760
that would roughly go

825
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,840
manulary bodies around the brainstem it

826
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,480
goes up through the mammolothalamic

827
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,559
tract i think anterior lateral thalamic

828
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,919
nucleus

829
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,279
goes through the cingulum bundle

830
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,520
posterior cingulate into the hippocampus

831
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,200
out through the foreign inks back to

832
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
bodies don't worry about those details

833
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,120
the important thing about this

834
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,480
is uh

835
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,960
this was interpreted um by um

836
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,640
actually i said papas i think it's papes

837
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,559
but it was interpreted by papes when he

838
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,799
was etching out these elect sources of

839
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,039
epilepsy form discharge as this core

840
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,919
circuit for emotional memory and

841
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,279
part of the reason

842
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,919
that and so the importance of this

843
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:34,720
is

844
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,559
uh the mammary bodies are receiving

845
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,320
stretch receptor information from the

846
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,440
neck

847
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,240
and so this is going to be potentially

848
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,440
important for knowing where your head's

849
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,880
pointing especially if you're talking

850
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,919
about like

851
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,200
which will be important for us and maybe

852
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,640
even more so if we're talking about like

853
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,399
our inner rodent or

854
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,559
or whatever that you know where your

855
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,799
head's pointing is going to really help

856
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,039
for bringing coherence to

857
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,840
explaining your sensorium uh also at

858
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,520
this islamic relay you're also getting

859
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,520
inputs from the vestibular apparatus of

860
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,200
the inner ear and so this is giving you

861
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,360
like the yaw pitch and roll and so not

862
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,880
only do you have your entire sensor in

863
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,720
all the information at these posterior

864
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,640
midline structures before they funnel

865
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,720
into the hippocampus as a source of new

866
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,480
memory not only do you have the entire

867
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,840
sensorium brought together you're on top

868
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,080
of it all in network terms

869
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,840
but you have the information you would

870
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,600
need to organize it

871
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,640
by your egocentric perspective

872
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,520
and so

873
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,360
this yeah so here we go predictive

874
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,120
coding we covered

875
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,480
uh sebisfx redus effects

876
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,600
and now

877
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,720
i'm introducing like a basic model of uh

878
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,039
perceptual synthesis where we have

879
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,120
something of a cartesian theater here

880
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,720
enabled by

881
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,240
um uh

882
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,960
the ability of slow rhythms of a large

883
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,799
enough extent to bring together the

884
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,159
right kinds of information you would

885
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,039
need

886
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:53,840
to

887
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,720
uh

888
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,440
basically create a coherent

889
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,240
uh world model

890
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,720
so y'all with me stellar

891
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,600
okay

892
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,960
so

893
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,240
uh in this preprint

894
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,279
um

895
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,640
i describe how we can maybe think of

896
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,799
with respect to either sensation

897
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,559
or imagination a different combinations

898
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,120
of rebus and sebas effects happening

899
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,600
potentially corresponding to different

900
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,279
levels of stimulation

901
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,320
of these receptor classes of

902
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,960
the 582ar in particular

903
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,120
by the way um

904
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,360
i think 5h

905
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,080
5 ht uh 2c

906
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,640
that's gonna that's one to watch well it

907
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,880
might even be like almost more strictly

908
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,640
rebus in its nature but that's something

909
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,960
to talk about later um

910
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,440
so for sensation on the left here

911
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,240
you know this would be there's a person

912
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,000
out in nature and they're having an

913
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,600
interaction with a tree

914
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,120
and then on the right here would be a

915
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,600
similar thing but this is imagination uh

916
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,960
maybe you know with your eyes closed

917
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,679
maybe not but this is you know um here

918
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,279
you're imagining yourself

919
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,559
uh and

920
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,080
interacting with the tree now you know

921
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,519
imagination it doesn't need to be in a

922
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,880
third person but i'm just taking

923
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,399
advantage of the fact that we're talking

924
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,360
like if you are to think of yourself in

925
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,640
a third person if you're going to move

926
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,320
from this um

927
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,760
was it the

928
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,600
as james called it like from the eye to

929
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,559
the me

930
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,279
uh to this objectified selfhood that

931
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,200
part is going to require imagination you

932
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,480
can imagine yourself from the first

933
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,320
person but the third person point of

934
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,360
view um you're gonna require um

935
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,720
imagination

936
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,360
i guess that or a mirror or a good setup

937
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,320
of mirrors maybe you could do it that

938
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,120
way

939
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,799
so that actually might not that might be

940
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,679
non-trivial but on the left here

941
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,240
so the top we have let's say unaltered

942
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
if such a thing ever exists we're always

943
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,600
altered in some ways we're always on

944
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,360
some

945
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,039
our brain stems pharmacopoeia is always

946
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,120
dripping some combination of drugs to us

947
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,440
it's just uh sometimes it's a very

948
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,799
different regime and you know we say

949
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,720
it's altered but there is no like

950
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,640
singular baseline you know we who knows

951
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,720
how much we both vary as individuals and

952
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,200
across individuals

953
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,640
along these lines

954
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,440
but

955
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,679
so as we move down

956
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:12,799
let's say

957
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,600
we were talking about

958
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,760
a revis effect

959
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,519
and let's say you were getting a rebus

960
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,440
effect

961
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,240
with sensation so in theory if your

962
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,320
perception is

963
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,559
entailed by the predictions

964
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,799
then it could be the case that

965
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,200
things might seem less vivid to you

966
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
it may not be the case that your

967
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,600
perception is more vivid

968
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,880
i don't know if i would say this is

969
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,120
strictly um entailed by the rebus model

970
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,559
but that's one thing

971
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,880
you might think potentially if these

972
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,399
slow rhythms if some of these are

973
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,440
actually

974
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,120
entailing your conscious experience if

975
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,880
these are reduced in their coherence and

976
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,600
their power in theory you might get a

977
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,200
diminution of perceptual vividness

978
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,440
however in a cebus interpretation things

979
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,600
might uh appear more vivid not

980
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,200
necessarily more vertical but more vivid

981
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,480
and so

982
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,040
it seems like a rebus interpretation

983
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,119
would say that things might be more

984
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,239
detailed more accurate um more richly

985
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,000
textured with

986
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,320
more faithful correspondences to the

987
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,560
external world when you're perceiving

988
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,119
but potentially less vivid

989
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,480
not because this is a strict entailment

990
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,399
but that seems like one suggestion

991
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,639
under a cebus interpretation

992
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,040
this would be

993
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,159
more

994
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,079
vivid but not necessarily more precise

995
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,599
it actually might be a little bit

996
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,599
smoothed over like like an auto tuning

997
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,199
or a filtering but um also though uh

998
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,599
more compelling potentially and so this

999
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,760
in theory though would be the

1000
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,599
phenomenology of micro dosing in theory

1001
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,440
and so

1002
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,639
when i get into and so i try to

1003
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,320
illustrate this with the brain you know

1004
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,879
bigger or smaller synchronous complexes

1005
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,599
here um so albus the idea is well we

1006
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,359
could have an admixture it's not just

1007
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,720
one set of beliefs but we have a

1008
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,240
hierarchy of beliefs and in fact a

1009
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,400
heterarchy so maybe the alpha starts to

1010
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,320
get pulled back and that loses coherence

1011
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,280
and that seems to be one of the

1012
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,040
strongest associations in the

1013
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,440
psychedelic meditation literatures is

1014
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,200
alphas what people will emphasize is

1015
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,599
some of these uh ego decentering or

1016
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,200
dissolving effects

1017
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,079
but maybe beta stays the same or even

1018
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,880
increases in power and so under a rebus

1019
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,880
model for instance uh

1020
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,720
the idea would be that you know things

1021
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,079
like alpha

1022
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,240
go down in power but things like those

1023
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,320
particular smaller beliefs they can come

1024
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,320
together in different ways and different

1025
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,839
sort of creative combinations and so you

1026
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,000
might get something like synesthesia

1027
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,920
with psychedelics as like a creative

1028
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,240
recombination of things um under this

1029
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,560
more anarchic state once you took the

1030
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,280
the alpha self ruler and you reduced its

1031
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,839
its tyrannical grip over your perception

1032
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,920
and so this more free-flowing perception

1033
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,280
you get all sorts of different creative

1034
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,800
combinations uh and consciousness

1035
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,040
and so yeah so that's one thing is

1036
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,800
trying to basically map different

1037
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,079
combinations

1038
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:06,880
of

1039
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,760
uh

1040
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,079
rebus or sebis effects that you might

1041
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,359
expect

1042
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,000
under different doses with respect to

1043
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,960
either sensation or imagination so

1044
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
really digging into the phenomenology

1045
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,800
and using psychedelics as an opportunity

1046
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,200
actually in a way to

1047
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,880
indirectly test models of consciousness

1048
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,240
but also if we're going to explain what

1049
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,560
these substances powerful substances are

1050
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,560
doing we really actually need to take

1051
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,400
some of these questions head on maybe

1052
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,320
even the hard problem

1053
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,119
so

1054
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,800
some of the more

1055
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,359
so in this pre-print um

1056
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,560
i also

1057
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,599
uh

1058
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,720
are getting into okay well what do we

1059
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,800
mean by beliefs what kind of beliefs are

1060
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,920
we talking about

1061
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,160
and so uh so one kind of beliefs would

1062
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,160
be so you know here you might have the

1063
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,680
beliefs

1064
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,800
with active inference and the free

1065
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,079
energy principles beliefs the whole way

1066
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,240
through oh which belief swimming and so

1067
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,000
um you know and rebus is saying what's

1068
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,160
specifically being is being relaxed is

1069
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,320
your deeper beliefs your

1070
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,480
internal working models the higher level

1071
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,320
beliefs corresponding to things like

1072
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,800
selfhood and its relation to the world

1073
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,880
um things like autobiographical and

1074
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,560
narrative selfhood these are the things

1075
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,079
that are losing their grip

1076
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,200
and

1077
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,560
and within rebus you know i don't wanna

1078
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,960
like there is room for sebas effects and

1079
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,720
and some of the ways it's discussed

1080
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,400
where it's not just across the board all

1081
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,920
the slow rhythms are going down the idea

1082
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,440
might be that you know

1083
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,520
i've heard it discussed differently and

1084
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,560
so

1085
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,760
you might get

1086
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,920
you know an indirect strengthening as

1087
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,280
you remove

1088
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,440
these slower integrative and potentially

1089
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,119
suppressive processes

1090
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,839
but in terms of types of beliefs

1091
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,320
if we're going to be talking about

1092
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,920
cognition or

1093
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,040
if we're talking about something as like

1094
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,760
highfalutin as the self

1095
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,040
now we might want to say like well what

1096
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,880
kind of self are we talking about like

1097
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,320
we're talking about like a minimal

1098
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,839
embodied self are we talking about an

1099
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,160
extended self and even those like

1100
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,079
there's all sorts of bad questions like

1101
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,079
what goes into the minimal embodied self

1102
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:02,800
and

1103
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,480
how it's relating to the extended self

1104
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,760
and how many maybe there's different

1105
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,200
kinds of those

1106
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,720
and so if we're talking about the

1107
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,200
construction of self in its relation to

1108
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,160
the world um and objectified selfhood

1109
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,800
the

1110
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,079
the ego the the self as construed over

1111
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,160
time and across circumstances we're

1112
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,520
going to need a fairly rich account of

1113
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,920
cognition and so here i'm

1114
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,119
basically

1115
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,680
providing an account of sophisticated

1116
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,200
affect of inference

1117
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,920
or

1118
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,240
imaginative planning and policy

1119
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,040
selection as orchestrated by the

1120
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,440
hippocampal and entorhinal system and so

1121
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,359
this is uh drawing on some of the work

1122
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,680
um doing with tim verbellen and others

1123
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,240
i'm trying to decipher that system but

1124
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,640
basically uh you know

1125
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,400
you seem to have

1126
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,520
uh so here

1127
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,040
you know hippocampus can be thought of

1128
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,200
in a way as at the top of the cortical

1129
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,400
heterokey

1130
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
when the prediction errors

1131
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,880
are not so you as the frictioners are

1132
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,320
percolating upwards

1133
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,760
being contradicted or stopped by

1134
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,839
predictions you stop them as low as you

1135
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,240
can as close to the modalities as you

1136
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,480
can that's the maximum savings and

1137
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,760
that's what you would expect with the

1138
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,680
maximally efficient prediction and

1139
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,720
learning

1140
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,320
um or

1141
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,280
but

1142
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,280
if you can't predict a pattern if

1143
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,760
nothing the genuinely novel that makes

1144
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,400
its way all the way up the hierarchy

1145
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,160
into the hippocampus as this prediction

1146
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,359
error storage place of last resort

1147
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,680
and you this

1148
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,079
then can be stitched together

1149
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,599
to create memory

1150
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,920
and specifically what hippocampal and

1151
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,920
enter rhino system seems to do is it

1152
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,200
encodes this sequence memory

1153
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,560
it has multiple functions but one of the

1154
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,800
ways in which one of its core functions

1155
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,920
seems to be the encoding of trajectories

1156
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,160
of the overall organismic system through

1157
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,599
time and space

1158
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,119
and so if you look at the work of people

1159
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,119
like reddish you'll actually see for

1160
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,359
instance as this rodent is like in a

1161
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,040
maze um

1162
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,160
figuring out where it's going to go

1163
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,800
you'll see these sweeps of activity

1164
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,800
within the hippocampus kind of play out

1165
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,720
in different directions across these

1166
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,400
place fields or this mapping

1167
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,319
of space and then the organism will take

1168
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,280
like one branch or another of these uh

1169
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,160
potential sweeps of predictive activity

1170
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,319
and so uh i probably don't want to get

1171
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,680
this here but i have an account of like

1172
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,960
the anterior versus the posterior

1173
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,480
hippocampus and be qualitatively

1174
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,160
different where the anterior hippocampus

1175
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,119
seems to be the one that's more

1176
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,040
predictive giving you these sweeps

1177
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,319
giving you things like counterfactual

1178
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,720
processing the anterior seems to be more

1179
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,520
closely coupling with the the posterior

1180
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,839
censorium and will be more important for

1181
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,920
more specific episodic encodings and

1182
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,680
maybe more faithful episodic

1183
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,960
rememberings

1184
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,839
and so

1185
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:44,720
the idea is you have these little

1186
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,319
hexagons which corresponding to the

1187
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,079
mapping of space these hippocampal place

1188
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,480
fields where is the organism within some

1189
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,760
sort of space

1190
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,960
and then

1191
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
they're playing out in some trajectory

1192
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,200
and so now along this trajectory it is

1193
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,880
you're having the prediction errors from

1194
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,560
the cortical generator model which can

1195
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,760
basically

1196
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,480
by

1197
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,599
pointing back to cortex can unpacked

1198
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,160
unpack at every point in space

1199
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,800
um the experience you would expect for

1200
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,240
that particular temporospatial

1201
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,000
trajectory and this would be an account

1202
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,319
of episodic memory and episodic

1203
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:17,920
imagination or the stream of

1204
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,680
consciousness if you will okay so here

1205
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,560
we are

1206
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,079
and i think yeah this is the last thing

1207
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,920
i'll

1208
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,680
so here we are

1209
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,040
with these trajectories being played out

1210
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,520
and different experiences being entailed

1211
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,200
at each point

1212
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,800
as it plays out and they have a given

1213
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,560
length it seems that there's um a

1214
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,680
extent of this um i think james calls

1215
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,599
the specious present or the idea is

1216
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,680
there's like a thickness of the moment

1217
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,319
we find ourselves in or

1218
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,599
this might be a somewhat different idea

1219
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,480
but there's

1220
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,800
there seems to be three seconds

1221
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,960
is seems to be roughly the upper bound

1222
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,520
of what we would call a given

1223
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,640
extended moment of experience um edelman

1224
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,920
i think called like the remembered

1225
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,280
present where there's a little bit of

1226
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,280
like a prediction and a post-diction and

1227
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,040
you're moving back and forth in this

1228
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,640
sliding window

1229
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,880
frame of experience

1230
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,640
and so one interpretation and so within

1231
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,079
here as you're doing these different

1232
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,520
episodic

1233
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,119
rememberings and imaginings that

1234
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,280
one thing that the 580 2a system might

1235
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,079
do

1236
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,040
is

1237
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,359
both increase the vividness of what

1238
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,119
you're imagining or perceiving as you go

1239
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,760
but also allowing you to have

1240
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,359
more extended uh rollouts before you

1241
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,800
have to reset

1242
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,240
where it seems like a roughly three

1243
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,319
seconds might be the upper bound

1244
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,720
and so

1245
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,119
basically i'm i have uh within the

1246
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,000
preprint this uh this comic description

1247
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,560
this neurophenomological comic where as

1248
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,800
you're increasing the dose imagination

1249
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,280
is getting closer to perception

1250
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,839
and you're getting a longer runway to

1251
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,680
work with for this extended present

1252
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,920
moment with within which you are

1253
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,440
planning and learning and making sense

1254
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,599
of things and so it gets a little bit

1255
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,680
bigger with the micro dose a little bit

1256
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,839
bigger with this threshold dose you know

1257
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,359
things are even more vivid you know when

1258
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,440
you started out you're just like

1259
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,440
kind of moving through the world i'm

1260
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,880
kind of awake and kind of conscious i

1261
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,680
guess

1262
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,880
and then it's like i am like

1263
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,760
things are

1264
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,240
crisper and a little bit more creative

1265
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,440
like

1266
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,280
not that much here

1267
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,200
but a little crisper

1268
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,480
um this would be something like i don't

1269
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,520
know like uh

1270
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,040
someone does like a programmer in

1271
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,800
silicon valley like micro dosing is very

1272
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,240
popular it doesn't seem like they're

1273
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,079
trying to like trip but they're they're

1274
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,760
almost using it like like like a little

1275
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,800
bit of a

1276
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,400
a stimulant trying to like increase

1277
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,440
absorption

1278
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,440
whatever they're doing

1279
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,880
and so then

1280
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,880
so as we move through you increase the

1281
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,200
dose some more and now it's even more

1282
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,520
vivid and more creative more different

1283
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,960
imaginings you're having access to more

1284
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,040
more is manifesting in mind but then

1285
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,400
after a certain dose

1286
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,520
it seemed

1287
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,359
what i'm illustrating is that basically

1288
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,839
the the coherence starts to go

1289
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,000
and you start to get smaller rollouts

1290
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,280
they're even more of it than they're

1291
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,400
more creative but they're becoming uh

1292
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,640
less uh

1293
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,400
clear in terms of the sequencing they

1294
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
make less sense with respect to

1295
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,880
achieving particular goals and so i

1296
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,480
think something that i should explain

1297
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,400
and we might have to talk it out but the

1298
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,599
the underlying this is it's okay so

1299
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,079
uh these hippocampal resetting events

1300
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,160
are occasioned by different things

1301
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,040
one is if i go from one room to a next

1302
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,640
um if some sort of like really

1303
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,640
surprising thing happens that's gonna

1304
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,200
trigger this um sharp wave ripple

1305
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,160
activity and a re-tiling of space within

1306
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,359
which you're doing your sophisticated

1307
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,920
inference um this can so something

1308
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,880
either

1309
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,720
uh so there's there's some evidence that

1310
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,400
reward prediction errors if something

1311
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,160
really really good happens that might

1312
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,000
cause you to basically ramp up the

1313
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,640
hippocampal activity encode that you

1314
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,359
know generate like the phasic bur help

1315
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,800
generate a phasic burst of dopamine

1316
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,359
learn it and then uh keep going or if

1317
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,040
something really bad happens this might

1318
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,400
be an opportunity to pivot what you're

1319
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,040
doing is not working let's retile let's

1320
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,319
try again

1321
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,079
um

1322
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,119
and so

1323
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,640
this will be a function of both things

1324
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,440
like what's the neuram modulatory tone

1325
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,720
what are those like the circuit level

1326
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,160
conditions like

1327
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,359
maybe directly what's your level of 52a

1328
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,920
simulation that might influence uh how

1329
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,920
long you get before you have to reset

1330
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,680
but it could also be explained at the

1331
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,800
level of experience itself at the level

1332
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,280
of the expected free energy changing as

1333
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,359
this emerging cause so as i'm getting

1334
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,400
creative

1335
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,240
if i get so creative that i'm no longer

1336
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,480
making sense of things my expected free

1337
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,880
energy if that goes up like that spikes

1338
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,240
up because what i just said is really

1339
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,480
surprising it's it's it's novel it's

1340
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,079
experience vividly and it's not making a

1341
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,440
lot of sense

1342
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,800
that might be something that would

1343
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,520
occasion this resetting

1344
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,599
and so the idea is a model of basically

1345
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,359
the stream of consciousness or episodic

1346
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:58,720
memory and

1347
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,359
episodic remembering and imagining

1348
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,760
which becomes

1349
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,440
more

1350
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,119
uh coherent

1351
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,319
more rich more absorbed within this

1352
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,960
first regime and then a second regime

1353
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,440
that's more properly psychedelic where

1354
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,240
it's

1355
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,920
very un it becomes

1356
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,800
extremely creative so much so that it's

1357
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,200
um becomes qualitatively different than

1358
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,440
normal experience and even so much so

1359
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,560
that like for instance at a certain

1360
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,000
point you're not going to be using this

1361
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
to enhance your job as a programmer you

1362
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,319
will be doing this on vacation with

1363
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:33,839
trusted others or something like this

1364
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,599
hopefully and this is not something to

1365
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,040
take to work that you know people are

1366
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,640
not mega dosing at work hopefully or

1367
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,920
they will not be working there for very

1368
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,800
long

1369
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,480
at most workplaces

1370
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,760
um

1371
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,119
and so

1372
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,400
uh

1373
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,119
yeah that's basically

1374
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,720
and so then coming looping back around

1375
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,280
to the beginning the ideas

1376
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,640
with a deeper understanding of these

1377
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,599
systems that includes some rebus aspects

1378
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,079
and some sebis type aspects

1379
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,240
we might be able to use these as

1380
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,960
inspiration for novel active inference

1381
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,960
and machine learning parameters

1382
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,180
so

1383
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,800
[Music]

1384
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,079
potentially you can think of like

1385
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,640
getting stuck at a little like people

1386
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,920
you know if they're living like a life

1387
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,760
of quiet desperation or something

1388
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,040
they've gotten stuck at some kind of

1389
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,800
local maxima and they're looking to

1390
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,240
change things they're looking to get to

1391
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,000
kick out of it they're they're not

1392
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,720
finding an elegant path to minimize

1393
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,280
their expected free energy and so if

1394
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,480
you've

1395
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,559
found yourself trapped at this

1396
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,400
local free energy minima you can use

1397
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,920
psychedelics to turbo charge your

1398
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,839
sophisticated affect of inference enough

1399
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,760
to maybe find a novel solution see

1400
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,880
something that you would otherwise

1401
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,240
and then i guess the final thing i would

1402
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,720
like to point to is

1403
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,720
in terms of using psychedelics as a

1404
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,839
probe on mind

1405
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,760
you might have different interpretations

1406
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,079
of what they reveal if you're thinking

1407
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,960
of either a strictly sebas story a

1408
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,599
strictly rebus story or some kind of

1409
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,960
combination of the both of them and so

1410
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,400
i'd suggest that for instance you can

1411
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,839
think of a good amount of psychedelic

1412
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,280
phenomenology

1413
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,520
as corresponding to

1414
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,559
uh the unmasking of your core priors

1415
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,160
and so things like let's say fractal um

1416
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,480
fractal phenomenology

1417
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,200
that maybe would be a core perceptual

1418
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,359
prior maybe even partially evolutionary

1419
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,359
partially as a

1420
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:32,160
reliably learnable posterior or

1421
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,880
empirical prior for making sense of the

1422
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,480
world and this would make some sense in

1423
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,040
that if you use fractals as you're

1424
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,800
as generating your predictions that's a

1425
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,480
very efficient basis set because you can

1426
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,520
you can do a lot of different

1427
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,280
combinations of fractals and this is

1428
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,800
especially going to be efficient if

1429
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,480
that's what nature itself is doing

1430
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,400
you're using different combinations of

1431
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,640
fractal processes to model a world which

1432
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,160
is largely structured by different

1433
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,760
combinations of fractal type generative

1434
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,200
processes

1435
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,040
further things like

1436
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,240
entity perceptions uh associated with uh

1437
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,640
different psychedelic experiences um

1438
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,720
archetypal type

1439
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,920
experiences

1440
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,440
those also

1441
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,839
could be thought of as the unmasking of

1442
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,520
core priors potentially strengthened

1443
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,079
core priors

1444
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,000
let's you know because you'd expect from

1445
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,400
active inference that you know entities

1446
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,599
is something the kind of thing you would

1447
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:24,559
expect

1448
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:25,359
as

1449
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:26,160
a

1450
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,400
a very powerful empirical prior because

1451
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,480
that's how we survive especially agents

1452
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,119
such as us who think through other minds

1453
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,800
and where our primary niche is largely

1454
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,839
each other

1455
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,760
and so

1456
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,000
whether we're you know so the details of

1457
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,559
psychedelics might actually reveal

1458
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,800
these foundational

1459
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,119
inductive biases or

1460
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,880
foundational lessons

1461
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,559
in the learning curriculum and the

1462
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,720
structure learning whereby we come to be

1463
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,480
the kinds of beings we are

1464
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,839
and that

1465
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,200
is it for now

1466
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,559
okay

1467
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,440
thank you adam that was super awesome um

1468
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,160
i am like particularly overloaded right

1469
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,079
now on like

1470
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,480
my 1a receptors

1471
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,800
which is like i just want to imagine and

1472
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,000
step back

1473
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,040
um before i ask some questions i know

1474
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,359
daniel asked a lot so i'm gonna let him

1475
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,760
like ground me a little bit in reality

1476
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,440
and have the first jab

1477
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,200
i was just writing a bunch of stuff in

1478
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,680
the live chat so definitely anyone can

1479
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,880
ask because

1480
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,140
um

1481
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,640
[Music]

1482
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,839
you jumped through many areas so if

1483
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,880
anybody has a question they can type it

1484
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,200
but let's take a quick breath collect

1485
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,839
our thoughts and then Bleu you can ask

1486
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,079
the first question

1487
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,079
wait i just passed to you to like ground

1488
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,680
me all right so so um

1489
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,400
i guess i'm already here um

1490
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,760
all right since i'm already here i'm

1491
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,040
gonna like

1492
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,200
unclearly ask a whole lot of questions

1493
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,440
at once and also like try not to fangirl

1494
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,359
out too much because this line of work

1495
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,359
is really super awesome and unifies a

1496
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,400
whole lot of

1497
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,040
my particular interests um

1498
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,720
so just

1499
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,400
really quickly

1500
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,119
what um do you think the relationship is

1501
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,599
if any between

1502
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,040
inference and memory and can we quantify

1503
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,480
that through

1504
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,960
the brain the brain system

1505
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,200
dopamine serotonin like

1506
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,599
do you have thoughts on that

1507
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,680
i'm sure you do or do you have thoughts

1508
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,400
that you can summarize in you know 10

1509
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,119
minutes or less

1510
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,520
so in terms of memory um

1511
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,800
there's

1512
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,400
a sense in which

1513
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,640
uh

1514
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,800
it's all like there's a sense in which

1515
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,319
within the free energy principle and

1516
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:53,760
active inference

1517
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,200
you know all

1518
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,480
like was it

1519
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,599
all effective causation is inference

1520
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,000
and it's all inference

1521
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,680
based on

1522
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,040
different kinds of memories so your

1523
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,119
belief every belief is a memory and

1524
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,040
everything that happens is a kind of

1525
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,280
action as a kind of inference

1526
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,040
but there's another sense though of like

1527
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,880
memory of the time i'm the kind i'm

1528
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,559
trying to get to like the focus on the

1529
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:17,760
hippocampal

1530
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,559
enter rhino system this orchestration of

1531
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,079
the overall

1532
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,160
memory system and this encoding of the

1533
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,240
general genuinely novel in these

1534
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,760
episodes and these frames of

1535
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,200
sense-making

1536
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,280
that

1537
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,119
this

1538
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,319
would be

1539
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,119
um

1540
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,720
a more complex

1541
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,240
kind of inference

1542
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,559
and a sophisticated one specifically

1543
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,720
where you are

1544
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,359
inferring the most plausible

1545
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:46,800
a conce

1546
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,920
rather than

1547
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,000
so so there could be a sense for ins for

1548
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,880
instance

1549
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,480
in which

1550
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,359
you might get a fairly

1551
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,160
under some circumstances maybe for like

1552
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,680
recent things that that that aren't like

1553
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,200
uh i don't know what the shelf life

1554
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,480
would be but like

1555
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,000
uh

1556
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,839
so some of the literature

1557
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,920
and a couple weeks couple months i don't

1558
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,680
know but like that actually the

1559
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,760
hippocampal system through just this

1560
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,359
chaining of attracting states along

1561
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,640
these trajectories

1562
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,680
could point back to cortex and play out

1563
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,240
something that's actually like a fair

1564
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,160
a decently faithful but still very

1565
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,200
biased

1566
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,119
account or a reconstruction a

1567
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,400
remembering

1568
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,839
of what occurred

1569
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,800
um but for things that are older that's

1570
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,319
probably not the case even for things

1571
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:35,520
that are newer

1572
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,359
there's this constructive

1573
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,960
so it's always constructive and that

1574
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,400
it's always a kind of

1575
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,920
every moment perception is inference at

1576
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,680
every moment there's a creative aspect

1577
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,200
of filling in

1578
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,520
but actually like situating yourself

1579
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,920
within some sort of causal unfolding

1580
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,400
that's going to involve a lot of

1581
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,440
value

1582
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,160
cannalized policy selection that's going

1583
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,920
to involve you using constraints like

1584
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,400
well what kind of being do i think i am

1585
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,240
and what's plausible and that's going to

1586
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,839
determine when you're going down this

1587
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,720
like bran this branching forking pass

1588
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,640
of different possibilities like you'll

1589
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,880
be moving between like well what might i

1590
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,160
have done under this or that and you'll

1591
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,280
be picking

1592
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,359
plausible accounts of you

1593
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,359
partially as you go and so

1594
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:20,640
some remembering might be a little bit

1595
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,680
um

1596
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,640
like the naive like playback one if you

1597
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,240
play back the trajectory it's got

1598
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,920
pointers back to cortex

1599
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,280
and then you have this belief hierarchy

1600
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,800
and so you give the prediction errors

1601
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,559
back to where things were new and then

1602
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,280
it just unpacks itself as a

1603
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,720
good enough account of what happened at

1604
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,040
each point as he went through some

1605
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,119
trajectory and it's a decent

1606
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,440
semi-faithful playoff but

1607
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,880
there's also going to be this other kind

1608
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,160
of memory though

1609
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,599
that's that's not faithful at all and

1610
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,680
can really deviate

1611
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,920
a substantial amount of well we're we're

1612
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,920
in hard to distinguish from imagination

1613
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,760
and continuous with it it's like how do

1614
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,960
you know if you're remembering something

1615
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,200
or imagine you use these different cues

1616
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,040
one cue you might use

1617
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,440
is perceptual vividness so you would

1618
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,200
assume like if i remember something it's

1619
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,119
gonna be a little bit crisper than if i

1620
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,359
just like totally made it up uh the

1621
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,400
other one might be like just the

1622
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,799
plausibility like yeah that's like the

1623
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,960
kind of thing someone like me would do

1624
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,640
and but you can get it confused and that

1625
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,559
would be a source monitoring error and i

1626
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,079
think that's actually in a way for

1627
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,839
psychedelics

1628
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:27,920
um both in terms of this core process of

1629
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,359
figuring out

1630
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,200
who you are where you've been where

1631
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,559
you're likely to go and where you ought

1632
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:33,680
to go

1633
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,280
thinking of these pathways as

1634
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,839
potentially

1635
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,640
what it is to be an agent as revealing

1636
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,559
ways that agency and

1637
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,480
different self-consciousness and

1638
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,160
self-hood can vary

1639
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,559
but also in terms of this i think needs

1640
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,119
to be brought in in terms of what we

1641
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,000
might expect to be impacted and what we

1642
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,680
might want to prepare for and heart and

1643
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,400
and

1644
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,280
harness with things like psychedelics so

1645
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,040
for instance there might be a very real

1646
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,440
risk for phenomena such as false memory

1647
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,280
so if the gap between perception

1648
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,160
perception and imagi and imagination

1649
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,160
starts to narrow if your imagination

1650
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,240
starts to seem more vivid it might

1651
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,640
become more difficult to distinguish

1652
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,760
between

1653
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,240
a remembering and an imagining

1654
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,720
or um

1655
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,720
yeah so things of that nature so

1656
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,680
that

1657
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,440
i think the issue of what is

1658
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,559
memory

1659
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,040
um in its relation to inference

1660
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,079
is going to be key for what it is like

1661
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,720
we want to alter and what it is we maybe

1662
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,319
don't want to alter but might

1663
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,720
accidentally alter um when we do

1664
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,720
different types of interventions so like

1665
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,960
you played so perfectly into my

1666
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,440
follow-up question was

1667
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,319
like how does creativity play into that

1668
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:51,359
right and like what is um

1669
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:54,079
maybe the function of creativity like i

1670
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,319
mean personally my autobiographical

1671
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:59,520
memory is awful but like i have a really

1672
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,880
stronghold like good factual memory for

1673
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,200
like all kinds of ridiculous things

1674
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,160
so

1675
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,760
so where does creativity play into that

1676
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,720
like

1677
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,520
memory perception

1678
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,640
inference like paradigm and are like the

1679
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,799
people that are more creative or that

1680
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,559
take more psychedelics like do they have

1681
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,440
a less like accurate memory or are they

1682
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,359
more likely to remember remember things

1683
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,839
inaccurately or even like what is

1684
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,839
inaccuracy sorry like let me just get

1685
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:31,520
super meta because i really

1686
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,119
fundamentally believe that perception is

1687
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,200
different for all of us but like what is

1688
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,760
written in my biochem textbook less so

1689
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,359
right so maybe that's why like i put

1690
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,280
less priority on my autobiographical

1691
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,359
memory because it's i believe it's

1692
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,280
functionally inaccurate but like

1693
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,119
whatever how many angstroms are between

1694
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,839
each subunit of dna like that's way more

1695
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,520
you know important

1696
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,520
right

1697
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,559
i mean that's

1698
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,000
one of the hardest questions i can think

1699
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:04,640
of

1700
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,240
and sorry

1701
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,880
one of the most important too um

1702
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,040
so there's this i'm trying to forget the

1703
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,319
name of the paper it's this dual

1704
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:15,119
constraints model of creativity

1705
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,040
um that does address like head on the

1706
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,880
issue of kinds of creativity and

1707
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,240
psychedelics um i'll post that uh later

1708
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,040
but

1709
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,119
the

1710
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,760
it does seem like for instance

1711
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,839
there are

1712
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,400
i wouldn't say

1713
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,079
necessary

1714
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,720
trade-offs with respect to

1715
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,280
uh different processes

1716
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,680
as to whether they allow for realizing

1717
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:45,119
different types of value so let's say so

1718
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,520
with memory or with creativity you might

1719
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,520
distinguish between divergent and

1720
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,680
convergent creativity so like conversion

1721
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,400
creativity where like you want to hit a

1722
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,000
particular

1723
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,400
target and generate a novel solution for

1724
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,240
a particular

1725
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,240
challenge

1726
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,160
or divergent where let's say you just

1727
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,559
want to think of something

1728
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,559
new um maybe

1729
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,000
just a

1730
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,760
novelty generator

1731
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,160
from which you then might select later

1732
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,000
convergent solutions in a longer process

1733
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,640
or just uh as part of an open-ended

1734
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,920
exploration

1735
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,359
and so

1736
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:22,799
you know there's different ways like you

1737
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:24,000
for instance like

1738
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
you could

1739
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,040
get

1740
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,960
if you just turn up

1741
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,680
uh the heat the temperature

1742
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,720
and you make things more

1743
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,040
imprecise

1744
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,799
and unconstrained

1745
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:40,400
you might be able to get

1746
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,920
all sorts of different combinations and

1747
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,440
this might be a good like fountain of

1748
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,599
diversion creativity

1749
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,200
some of the evidence suggests i believe

1750
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,799
that uh

1751
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:51,200
even with the micro dose regime so i

1752
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,280
think

1753
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,720
people who are doing like micro dosing

1754
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,920
usually

1755
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,480
they're looking for things like enhanced

1756
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,400
conversion creativity i don't think the

1757
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,760
evidence is great that that's actually

1758
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,880
being achieved

1759
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,599
but uh divergent creativity might be

1760
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:08,079
more likely to be associated with

1761
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,559
psychedelic experience proper of

1762
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,000
combinations of things that just you

1763
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,760
never would have imagined it's not clear

1764
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,240
it's not necessarily even useful

1765
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,599
for any particular thing it's not

1766
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:18,880
hitting any particular target

1767
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,720
necessarily it might be after the fact

1768
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,400
it might reveal something to you that

1769
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,000
you never imagined that made all the

1770
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,839
difference maybe like it juked your

1771
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,839
defense mechanisms in terms of like your

1772
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:29,440
policy selection was leading into garden

1773
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,359
paths you're seeing some things and not

1774
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,119
others and then it took the blinders off

1775
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,720
it revealed something to you that you

1776
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,119
might have missed

1777
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,920
but i'd say that people definitely vary

1778
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,240
partially maybe due to things like

1779
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,160
low-level parameter tunings like

1780
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,559
different people will vary in terms of

1781
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,960
like the natural level of the gain on

1782
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,599
these systems the natural tendencies for

1783
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,920
occupying these different regimes

1784
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,319
and so you'd expect that to vary either

1785
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,640
through some combination of things best

1786
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,559
explained at low levels like you know

1787
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,799
different alleles of neuromodulators

1788
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:05,119
um and some of it would be not well

1789
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:07,200
explained at that level it's more just

1790
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,200
that's the way the structure learning

1791
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,319
happen that's the way the system

1792
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,799
bootstrap itself different kind of agent

1793
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,720
and and everything in between

1794
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:15,680
so

1795
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,359
one thing that i find to be like uh

1796
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:21,920
i want to go into is

1797
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,160
that humanness in general us as a

1798
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,839
creative species

1799
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:28,640
that these pathways might have been

1800
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,680
important for allowing us to

1801
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,880
have

1802
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,319
be more creative and being able to

1803
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,559
combine things in

1804
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,400
a broader range of ways

1805
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,720
and that this potentially uh you know

1806
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,960
unlocked a more flexible type of

1807
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,319
cognition maybe a greater capacity for

1808
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,640
analogical reasoning the kinds of things

1809
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,960
that might have potentially precipitated

1810
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,880
this great leap forward and the birth of

1811
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,880
cognitive modernity where we became a

1812
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:57,039
symbolic species and cultural

1813
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,119
evolution came off the ground

1814
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,039
there there's an uh older idea by

1815
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:02,799
mckenna called the stoned ape theory

1816
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:04,160
that like there was actually like a

1817
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,400
period where we were in this symbiosis

1818
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,160
with mushrooms and we're eating

1819
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,760
psilocybin containing mushrooms and this

1820
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,799
actually

1821
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:14,000
helped to get that going

1822
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,920
i don't think we could rule that out

1823
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,200
but you could also get something very

1824
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,760
similar with a you know a couple high

1825
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,480
impactful mutations along these pathways

1826
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,280
uh

1827
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,720
that doesn't involve a mushroom eating

1828
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,440
phase and so there still might be a

1829
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,280
really interesting account of actually

1830
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,599
the secret of our success as a species

1831
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:33,520
as a particularly creative kind of

1832
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,520
hominid who's able to bring things

1833
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,760
together in more um

1834
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,920
novel imaginative ways

1835
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,119
that um

1836
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:42,880
could be involved

1837
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,640
in being continuous with the story of

1838
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,480
psychedelics and how they work

1839
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,720
and in the present day so that obviously

1840
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,119
you know i'm extremely interested in and

1841
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,160
also as a source you're saying

1842
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,480
individual difference like you know

1843
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,000
you know are there more like to this day

1844
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,480
more shamanic personalities are there

1845
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,839
you know are there more

1846
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,559
and to what degree can this account be

1847
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:07,359
told at the level of genes or is it or

1848
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:10,000
epigenetics or is it not well told there

1849
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,760
uh one

1850
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,839
yeah so that's those are some thoughts

1851
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,319
on that okay so wait now you just like

1852
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:18,160
walked into this trap that i laid for

1853
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,319
you so

1854
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,559
i've now got to ask this next question

1855
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:25,599
so you talked a lot about um

1856
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:28,480
psychedelics and sensory deprivation and

1857
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,240
now you want to talk about like our

1858
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,559
symbiotic relationship with fungi

1859
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,520
and i'm a huge like terence mckenna fan

1860
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,960
so if you've read the archaic revival

1861
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,720
which i'm sure you have

1862
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,920
so where do sensory deprivation

1863
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,880
in conjunction with psychedelic use like

1864
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,720
where does that fall

1865
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:50,000
on this like perceptual

1866
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,599
perception action

1867
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:52,880
mental action

1868
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,000
alpha

1869
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,680
beta brain wave serotonin dopamine

1870
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,440
spectrum like i just want to know your

1871
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,119
thoughts

1872
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:04,559
sorry not sorry but i'm sorry

1873
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,439
so

1874
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:13,119
i don't know if this exactly gets at it

1875
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:16,640
but it's possible that um

1876
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,720
this would be rather different but like

1877
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,640
okay like this is this

1878
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,000
we're really going to go into conjecture

1879
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,119
land here

1880
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:33,359
um but

1881
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,839
so i think what the book is uh it's a

1882
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,079
recent one um

1883
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,920
about us is so that there's like two

1884
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,000
domestication books recently about

1885
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,359
humanness

1886
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:43,610
um

1887
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:45,440
[Music]

1888
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,440
so one of them is uh the goodness

1889
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,599
paradox and us is a self-domesticated

1890
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:50,880
species then there's this other more

1891
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,000
recent one but the idea is that this um

1892
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,640
serotonin

1893
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,480
pathways

1894
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,599
if

1895
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:00,559
it depends which ones we're talking

1896
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:02,640
about will be quite different but

1897
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,640
if

1898
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,559
they are up regulated unless they have a

1899
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,200
1a variety you could think of that as

1900
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,599
being more conducive to something like a

1901
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:13,440
domesticated phenotype

1902
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,319
so

1903
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:15,359
if your

1904
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,440
dopamine is higher and

1905
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,960
you're

1906
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,119
you're having uh

1907
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:22,400
you're expecting you're more confident

1908
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,240
in your policy selection

1909
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,400
then

1910
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,039
that might also cause you to be somewhat

1911
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:30,079
impulsive

1912
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:32,720
and that might make you not necessarily

1913
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,559
be able to

1914
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:37,520
discount utility enough hold back think

1915
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,640
things through a bit more and you um if

1916
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,240
the dopamine is too high

1917
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,440
you might get

1918
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,160
less uh cooperativity

1919
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,680
if it's and so you can think of the

1920
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,680
serotonin to the patients that it's the

1921
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:53,440
1a in particular as being um

1922
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,119
of a domesticated variety make and

1923
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,039
things might appear for instance less

1924
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:00,240
vivid perceptually um and imaginatively

1925
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,920
in theory along

1926
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:02,880
if we're just talking about those

1927
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,039
pathways

1928
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,319
the 2a

1929
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,240
you know

1930
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,359
for all this

1931
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:12,000
um there's so much we don't know

1932
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,880
so so much of this is conjecture but the

1933
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,799
2a does seem to have a little bit more

1934
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:19,440
of a dopaminergic character to it

1935
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,880
and

1936
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,400
the

1937
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,200
and actually it seems like that pathway

1938
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,319
evolved

1939
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:28,559
roughly around the time of the cambrian

1940
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:29,839
explosion

1941
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:32,880
um around with the advent of jaws in the

1942
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,520
context of predator prey arms races and

1943
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,920
so that might be consistent with like

1944
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,839
a dopaminergic significance so this like

1945
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:43,440
temporarily like increasing um your

1946
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,960
confidence your policy selection like

1947
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,559
turbo charging your action selection a

1948
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:48,640
bit so you can go out and get the goal

1949
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,400
of either

1950
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,160
getting your lunch or avoiding becoming

1951
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,680
lunch

1952
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,078
and so

1953
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:01,839
let's say you're moving into

1954
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:04,480
greater gain on imagination let's say

1955
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,920
we're thinking serotonin either of the

1956
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,240
one air 2a is doing this this then might

1957
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,960
compete with more externally focused

1958
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,760
perception sensation and so you're

1959
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,280
imagining more but because your mind's

1960
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,039
eye is occupied more with your

1961
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:18,960
imaginings you might be attending to the

1962
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,400
details of the environment a little bit

1963
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,280
less

1964
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:25,359
and so uh a species or an individual

1965
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,119
who might have to gain for whatever

1966
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:30,079
reason higher on these pathways um you

1967
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,039
might call this a little bit more

1968
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:32,799
shamanic or maybe a little bit further

1969
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:35,440
on like a schizophrenia type spectrum um

1970
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,440
might be perceiving the world slightly

1971
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,960
less faithfully

1972
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:39,760
but

1973
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,319
their imagination is now freed up to be

1974
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:44,720
more freewheeling and more creative

1975
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,680
and this is allowing for

1976
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,359
different things to come into being so

1977
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:50,799
very speculatively we might think of

1978
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,720
like neanderthals as like less

1979
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,640
domesticated humans

1980
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,480
maybe even a little bit more like autism

1981
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,720
spectrum but like better able of

1982
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,359
perceiving the world precisely

1983
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:03,440
um and us we might have been a little

1984
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,599
bit more shamanic a little bit more uh

1985
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,440
although we are the dander cells also

1986
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,680
because we all interbred and the very

1987
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,160
you know the variance within is probably

1988
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,599
bigger it's definitely bigger than the

1989
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:14,880
variance between

1990
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,080
um but

1991
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:16,880
uh

1992
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,158
us and my

1993
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:21,439
the our ancestors and

1994
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,640
us um

1995
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,279
we we might be somewhat somewhat less i

1996
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,880
don't know i don't know if i'd say less

1997
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,719
dopamine i don't know if i'd say that so

1998
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,439
that's what i got for now

1999
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:37,759
thanks adam um

2000
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,759
great presentation

2001
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:41,920
just wanted to make two quick notes and

2002
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,759
then ask some questions from the chat so

2003
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:46,000
the first is there's no free lunch with

2004
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,719
strategy so there's niches that are just

2005
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:49,920
unwinnable

2006
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,040
where the phenotype cannot win

2007
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,319
and then there's other niches where

2008
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,479
potentially a broad range of phenotypes

2009
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,719
all can proliferate

2010
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,880
so whether or not a given strategy is

2011
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,319
successful or under what cases a given

2012
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:06,640
kind of neuromodulatory state

2013
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,279
is good or bad by what metric

2014
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,719
there's just no

2015
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:12,640
single free lunch or preference for

2016
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,198
lunch food then the second point was the

2017
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:17,920
complex gene family point was very

2018
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,120
interesting

2019
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,198
and you mentioned some other

2020
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,839
receptors in the serotonin receptor

2021
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,880
family

2022
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,679
and

2023
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:27,759
there are many receptors including ones

2024
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:29,439
that don't have nice

2025
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,439
clean names like number one and number

2026
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:33,920
two and number three so

2027
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,640
at least 14. yeah so how it's exactly

2028
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,920
14

2029
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,759
investigating function in these

2030
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,359
massively interacting and often

2031
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:43,679
redundant like if seven does something

2032
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,920
but only when eight is gone what's the

2033
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,600
actual

2034
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,238
mechanism there so here's some questions

2035
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:51,839
from the chat so first question from a

2036
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:52,799
chat

2037
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:54,880
stephen asked

2038
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,880
interested in the approximately three

2039
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,280
second window of conscious awareness

2040
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,199
adam mentioned does that trace back to

2041
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,120
william james stream of consciousness

2042
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,280
awareness and the temporal scale scales

2043
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,000
of experience

2044
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:10,719
i believe so

2045
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:12,960
so it's kind of like a three second echo

2046
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,040
is our experience or what does the three

2047
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,840
seconds represent

2048
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,360
so um so the empirically

2049
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,040
established

2050
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,520
phenomenon is there seems to be

2051
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,280
stitching things together into one

2052
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,679
continuous unfolding there seems to be a

2053
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,679
three second upper bound

2054
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,520
within this continuous unfolding i

2055
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,840
believe there is relevance to

2056
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,080
james's species present and edelman's

2057
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,000
remembered president of this idea of a

2058
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:40,880
kind of

2059
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,960
anticipatory prediction and looking

2060
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,120
ahead and a postdictive going back to

2061
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,520
you're moving back and forth of yourself

2062
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,199
in this unfolding

2063
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:54,719
and the speculative part is

2064
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,880
um i am suggesting that this might

2065
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,719
correspond to

2066
01:10:58,719 --> 01:10:59,679
the

2067
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:00,560
uh

2068
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:01,440
a

2069
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,880
hippocampal endorinal tiling of space

2070
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,719
either a physical space or a conceptual

2071
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:07,679
space

2072
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:10,480
within which you're doing this and that

2073
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,280
the

2074
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,000
the reason this upper bound would be the

2075
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,440
length of time you have before you need

2076
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,719
to refresh the attractors and re-tile

2077
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:20,880
speculative and then and the idea would

2078
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,080
be that this would correspond to

2079
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,920
something like a these sharp wave

2080
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,520
ripples that you'll observe

2081
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,560
um

2082
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,239
we don't know for sure it's a perfect

2083
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,159
lead into this second question and then

2084
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,480
i have another comment from cambridge

2085
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,920
breaths so

2086
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,320
what you just said about ripples so they

2087
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,520
wrote wonder if investigating cortical

2088
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,600
traveling waves via neural mass

2089
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,679
biophysical modeling approaches

2090
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:44,960
in particular

2091
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,600
the work of wilson cowan can contribute

2092
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,880
to this work if yes how many thanks for

2093
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,679
elaborations

2094
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:56,560
timmerman um in collaboration with robin

2095
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,199
uh card harris has

2096
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:01,360
done some really interesting work along

2097
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,199
those lines i believe

2098
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:04,800
it was with dmt

2099
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,199
looking at traveling waves um i believe

2100
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,199
i believe in the alpha frequency as

2101
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,920
evidence for the rebus models

2102
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,640
and so the idea would be that if you are

2103
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,880
actually relaxing your belief landscape

2104
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,080
you might get

2105
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,080
a reduction of like traveling waves of

2106
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,080
predictions going down towards the

2107
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:26,480
periphery and maybe greater inward going

2108
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,159
prediction error waves

2109
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,679
and uh

2110
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,600
and so

2111
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,360
some work

2112
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,679
has been done along those lines already

2113
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:36,800
uh

2114
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,560
by timmerman and others that's really

2115
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,600
interesting

2116
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,360
and as i was saying before so although

2117
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,679
i'm like introducing additional factors

2118
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:46,000
i do not think rebus is wrong i just

2119
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,920
want to add a couple additional details

2120
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,840
of

2121
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,560
like

2122
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,080
some of the

2123
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,920
contributions from modulations of

2124
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,440
cortical microcircuitry might be

2125
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,040
different you might be able to get rebus

2126
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,120
effects from a variety of ways not just

2127
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,000
from this desynchronization

2128
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,920
but before i forget earlier you're

2129
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,679
saying about free lunches

2130
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,280
absolutely and i think this is part of

2131
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,800
like you know for instance like let's

2132
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,360
say you know if i would just crank it

2133
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,199
all to the max um

2134
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:14,719
if each one is like has its own function

2135
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:16,560
well you know it'll be depending on the

2136
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,080
nature in

2137
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,400
both generally and locally so

2138
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,760
we're talking about dopamine too much

2139
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,400
dopamine you might be impulsive too

2140
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,400
little you might not strike iron's hot

2141
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,320
and you might miss opportunities

2142
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,520
too much 1a or too little 1a you might

2143
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,719
be irritable and impulsive too much

2144
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,199
this is opposite problems 2a

2145
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,640
too much um

2146
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,760
it could generate over time a kind of

2147
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,840
psychotic predisposition that would be a

2148
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,440
loss of a free launch

2149
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,320
the one more thing that you're

2150
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,679
mentioning is okay yeah it's not just

2151
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:50,000
these two receptor classes uh there's

2152
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,320
actually you know 14 conservatively and

2153
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,000
so

2154
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
one thing

2155
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,600
i'm wondering though

2156
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,520
is whether you get kind of like

2157
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,440
this is potentially wishful thinking but

2158
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,239
potentially not um

2159
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:08,800
you get the lie and share by considering

2160
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,920
a couple

2161
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,320
and that there might be like an order in

2162
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,280
which

2163
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:17,360
they evolved and a ubiquity

2164
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,640
where the ubiquity um would be one sign

2165
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,640
for like how important it is to figure

2166
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,800
these things out so you know the just

2167
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,960
the broader the distribution in theory

2168
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,520
the more you get from

2169
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,719
explaining the ones with the broadest

2170
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:32,880
distribution and so the 1a and 2a have

2171
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,280
this extremely extensive cortical and

2172
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,920
subcortical distribution um but that's

2173
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,600
not necessarily the case like you could

2174
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,120
have for instance at pivotal areas of

2175
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,560
the brainstem you know you're right on

2176
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,040
top of the core value signals

2177
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,880
you know one class of receptor there

2178
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,080
that could be the difference that makes

2179
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,360
all the difference

2180
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,560
um

2181
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,080
another aspect

2182
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,400
of

2183
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,440
the hope that you can you know make

2184
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,440
progress incrementally

2185
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,120
you know with the goal ultimately you

2186
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,640
know we're going to want to get every

2187
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,000
single last one of these receptor

2188
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,960
classes

2189
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:05,840
is that

2190
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,760
the other the additional ones might have

2191
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,360
a common

2192
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:13,360
organismic cybernetic significance

2193
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,080
but

2194
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,000
they're different because

2195
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,760
of their different locations

2196
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,920
and so that their functional account

2197
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,440
might still correspond to let's say

2198
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,719
overall levels of serotonin overall

2199
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:25,760
levels

2200
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:26,880
of

2201
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,239
some neural hormone or blood acidity or

2202
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:32,560
some other homeostatic state or state of

2203
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,520
challenge

2204
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,600
and so that the active inference

2205
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,920
significance might be the same but

2206
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,679
you're tweaking differently in different

2207
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:41,840
neural systems so that the overall

2208
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:44,640
coordinate effect is coherent

2209
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,719
with respect to um

2210
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:48,320
you're expected for energy with respect

2211
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,719
to realizing organismic value or

2212
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,480
minimizing prediction error with respect

2213
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,920
to the prediction of you doing the

2214
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,520
things you need to do as a successful

2215
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,640
being

2216
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,760
um

2217
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,920
and so one more thing though is i'll

2218
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,679
just throw off the 2c idea is

2219
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:05,040
potentially

2220
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,880
with these gene i don't know how far we

2221
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,360
can go with this but with this idea of

2222
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,000
like so with a gene duplication event

2223
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,520
once you

2224
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,400
have two copies of the gene this allows

2225
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,640
you to basically take one of the copies

2226
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:19,840
because you've got a spare that's still

2227
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,760
doing the same thing and now this other

2228
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,239
one can mutate and can separately be

2229
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:26,719
optimized by evolution to take on a

2230
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:28,640
different function and so the idea is

2231
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:29,679
that there might have been a common

2232
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,360
ancestor that looked a little bit more

2233
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,600
1a-like but that at the extreme levels

2234
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,320
of it during this gene duplication event

2235
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,800
this became the 2a receptor and maybe

2236
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,520
this goes one step further to the 2c i'm

2237
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,159
not sure but maybe we go a couple steps

2238
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,239
further with this kind of

2239
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:49,199
gene duplication story and what we're

2240
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:51,440
corresponding to is peeling out and

2241
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,480
separately

2242
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:55,040
module in a modular fashion optimizing

2243
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,679
for particular regimes of organismic

2244
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,040
significance

2245
01:16:59,040 --> 01:16:59,840
um

2246
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,239
are there gonna be 14 to 17 i'm

2247
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:03,360
skeptical i don't think is that i

2248
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,440
suspect it's like maybe three

2249
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:08,000
or four top stories of this kind

2250
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,960
and that the other receptors it's these

2251
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,000
core

2252
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,679
two to four stories

2253
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:16,560
probably three um

2254
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,840
maybe

2255
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,120
being

2256
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,360
achieved by having different functions

2257
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,360
locally but in their coordinated

2258
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,560
activity

2259
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,280
the same story globally

2260
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,080
nice there could be a lower dimensional

2261
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,760
manifold that

2262
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,840
gives a lot of resilience and also

2263
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,880
evolvability for the system and learning

2264
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,360
and one thing we've talked about before

2265
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,840
but it's interesting to think about

2266
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,239
is in your presentation you did a really

2267
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,400
awesome job of connecting the general

2268
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,560
kind of dynamical systems and inference

2269
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,480
questions to specific human regions

2270
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,159
and then it's interesting to ask okay

2271
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:55,040
well

2272
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,520
insects have a different brain layout

2273
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,040
they don't have the entorhinal so we

2274
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,159
can juxtapose cognitive systems

2275
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:07,280
and learn a lot about which attributes

2276
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,600
of the computation are necessary and

2277
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,320
sufficient so i wanted to ask which

2278
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,560
cognitive systems you thought were

2279
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:19,120
interesting to study in that sense

2280
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,760
i i have an intuition and a hope

2281
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,239
that may or may not pan out that the

2282
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:29,040
extent of convergence um is fairly

2283
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,239
substantial

2284
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,640
now things can i think flip in all sorts

2285
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,719
of ways you know i wouldn't just assume

2286
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:36,320
this is correct

2287
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,400
but let's say you know we're talking

2288
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,800
about within an insect um

2289
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,800
you know we would potentially look to

2290
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,719
the central complex

2291
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,560
and you know which which has a lot of

2292
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,719
hippocampal and to rhino functions and

2293
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:51,280
so and it might actually be a an even

2294
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,760
better system to study in terms of you

2295
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,080
would have you know complete access

2296
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,760
theoretically

2297
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,280
to the whole

2298
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,600
you know you'd have a much richer access

2299
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,800
to via something like calcium imaging um

2300
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,480
and so

2301
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,159
it

2302
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:09,679
that could be

2303
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:11,280
looking at something like

2304
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,199
the attractor dynamics

2305
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,800
of like you know so there's there's

2306
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,159
experiments like let's say like take

2307
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:17,920
fruit flies they put them on top of like

2308
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,360
a little styrofoam bowl and hook them up

2309
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,120
to virtual reality and they have them

2310
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,280
like doing different things you look at

2311
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,560
the central complex while it's doing

2312
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,640
that under different states

2313
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,239
of neuromodulation and we might see

2314
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,960
common organism significances and a

2315
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,280
common computational account

2316
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,800
in terms of

2317
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,719
the map mapping space and policy

2318
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:42,000
selection now how far back does this go

2319
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,920
some of this logic might even play out

2320
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,080
at the level of individual cells

2321
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:49,360
and like either like for instance like

2322
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:52,480
1a versus 2a

2323
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,440
1a

2324
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,960
so low levels of serotonin seem to have

2325
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,120
an effect of strengthening cytoskeleton

2326
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,600
dynamics and so that would promote like

2327
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,760
an organism kind of staying in place

2328
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,560
but

2329
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,800
high levels actually destabilize the

2330
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,280
cytoskeleton and so they'll actually

2331
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,800
like literally create plasticity and

2332
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,520
fluidity of the morphology and allow the

2333
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,840
the organism to move around more and so

2334
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,199
some of these accounts

2335
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:21,440
might go all the way back to the like

2336
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,040
near the origins of life and individual

2337
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,719
cells and metabolism

2338
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,040
uh how far we can go i don't know and so

2339
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:27,920
some of these might have even been

2340
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,600
repurposed for the

2341
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,560
different

2342
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,960
social ill insects communicating

2343
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,159
although you could see these things

2344
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:35,440
flipping because you know what goes in

2345
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,560
the individual doesn't have to be the

2346
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,639
same in fact it can because you have

2347
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:40,400
things and one significance on the

2348
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,239
individual level that might mean that

2349
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,159
has the opposite significance at the

2350
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:47,440
group interactive level so um but

2351
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,800
i think it'd be extremely rich to like i

2352
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,400
my kingdom for that science to be done

2353
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,360
Bleu do you want to ask a question

2354
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:00,480
i will jump in here actually um

2355
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,239
you know when we talk about the origin

2356
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:04,800
of life you mentioned

2357
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,639
earlier in your talk that

2358
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:07,760
the

2359
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,080
third person perspective

2360
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,000
is related to

2361
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,080
imagination and creativity and this goes

2362
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,679
back to kind of what i was asking

2363
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:16,639
earlier

2364
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:17,760
um

2365
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:18,800
but

2366
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,719
is it so much that the third person

2367
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:22,960
perspective is related to

2368
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,920
this kind of like coming outside of ego

2369
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,639
and looking at yourself you know

2370
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:31,920
from this kind of meta perspective or

2371
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,159
is it just fundamentally the dissolution

2372
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:37,199
of the self like how much does an ant

2373
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:39,360
think about themselves or like a

2374
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,600
bacterial that's part of a micro like or

2375
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,199
a biofilm like how much of of that is

2376
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:47,679
imagination like looking at themselves

2377
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:50,320
as part of a whole or that's just like

2378
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,560
myself doesn't matter

2379
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:57,280
i'm part of this bigger unit um

2380
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,280
so like if you're

2381
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,560
part of a well-coordinated collective

2382
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,639
there's a sense with that within active

2383
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:05,679
inference

2384
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:08,480
you will have converged

2385
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,440
on

2386
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,199
a shared generative model for your

2387
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:13,760
coherent inaction that you're taking

2388
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,719
part in and so your role

2389
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:18,480
of what's being enacted

2390
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,800
there's a sense in which um

2391
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,639
it's not exactly like on some level

2392
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:27,440
in some way there is information of some

2393
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,400
kind which is not necessarily egocentric

2394
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,560
in fact it's like your role aloe

2395
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,120
centrically within the thing

2396
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,440
that like even if

2397
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,679
on some level it's like what what

2398
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:40,639
you are

2399
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:42,800
you as generative model

2400
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,120
if you were to give the generative model

2401
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,719
generative modeling process as a whole

2402
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:47,920
of perspective

2403
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,239
it's not egoic it's not from necessarily

2404
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:52,480
from a first person point of view even

2405
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,960
though the it it's it's from the the

2406
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,520
coordination manifold of the of

2407
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,880
of the group that's doing this this

2408
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,719
common thing

2409
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:02,800
am i kind of getting it yeah

2410
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,040
um

2411
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:08,159
yeah that's and

2412
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:11,440
it's interesting like developmentally if

2413
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:13,360
we were to kind of take when these

2414
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,719
different perspectives of different

2415
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:16,639
kinds

2416
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:18,159
come online

2417
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,800
like for instance right out the gate

2418
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,159
it's not clear to me that we have like

2419
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:24,880
for instance coherent egos like it's not

2420
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,480
clear we attain to this like right out

2421
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,080
the gate when we're born

2422
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,360
and so there's like a sense like by

2423
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,280
default the

2424
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,080
um

2425
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,000
you know the infant might be egoless

2426
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,560
right it's it's and by default it's

2427
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,159
doing this more like inactive coupling

2428
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:40,320
with its caregivers and

2429
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,080
this sort of thing and as not yet

2430
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,760
actually being um

2431
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,080
enslaved to an egocentric point of view

2432
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,120
um

2433
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,080
there's kind of an interesting thing

2434
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,280
with language where it's actually like

2435
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,840
the ego itself seems like when we use it

2436
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,480
like in like psychodynamic terms is

2437
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,320
actually so we say ego central

2438
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:57,840
perspective it's like the i and it's the

2439
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,440
first person but when you say like ego

2440
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,120
as like a kind of like

2441
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,280
extended unfolding of you that's in the

2442
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,120
world and all like your possessions and

2443
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,880
your sense of yourself within a social

2444
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,960
context that actually is more third

2445
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,280
persony so it's like ego and from a such

2446
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,800
perspective is more first person even

2447
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:15,679
ego

2448
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:17,760
as like psychodynamic concept and the

2449
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,040
kind of thing you might want to modify

2450
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,480
with a psychedelic

2451
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,520
is actually

2452
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,960
more of a third seems like a little bit

2453
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,320
more like a third-person point kind of

2454
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,440
thing but

2455
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,880
um and so now the question would be

2456
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,239
though like maybe there's like an

2457
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:29,440
implicit

2458
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,960
um aloe centricity or non-egoic-ness

2459
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,480
um

2460
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,719
being enacted by any coupling and maybe

2461
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:38,159
that's like the primal like the primal

2462
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:39,760
the primordial state

2463
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,960
um and then you attain to an ego central

2464
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,080
perspective but there seems like there's

2465
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,520
like another kind

2466
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,480
of um

2467
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,800
more psychodynamic ego or

2468
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,679
objectification of self the third person

2469
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:55,280
um of taking

2470
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:56,840
an explicit

2471
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,880
perspective they think

2472
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,960
it's it's actually first person and that

2473
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,239
you're perceiving it from a point of

2474
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:04,000
view but it's fictitious and you're

2475
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
taking the view on yourself

2476
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,840
as if from without

2477
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,760
and that might come later in development

2478
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,840
at some point maybe through like

2479
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:14,639
enactments of um mirroring between

2480
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:17,120
uh infant and caregivers or between con

2481
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,440
specifics but like if you're mirroring

2482
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,280
with others then you might be able to

2483
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,040
establish these cross mappings between

2484
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,040
what you do and what someone else's does

2485
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,880
and this could potentially help you

2486
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,480
to create representations that you can

2487
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,719
then harness for viewing you as if from

2488
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:32,080
the outside

2489
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,199
but

2490
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:35,120
when we're talking about so when we say

2491
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,040
self when we say ego like what kind of

2492
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,800
ego what kind of self

2493
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,760
but

2494
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,639
it seems like

2495
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,320
there's a

2496
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,080
primordial like minimal self

2497
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,719
egocentricity of just seeing from from

2498
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:52,560
behind your eyes but then there's more

2499
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:56,800
like a psychodynamic ego uh slash me

2500
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,320
uh which is involving the

2501
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,480
objectification of you adopting a

2502
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,360
perspective on you

2503
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,239
imaginatively

2504
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:05,760
as if you were viewing yourself from

2505
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,840
without and then contextualizing

2506
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,639
yourself across space and time and in

2507
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:12,080
different contexts different social

2508
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,080
unfoldings as

2509
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,280
what you would need for something like

2510
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,920
an autobiographical self

2511
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,760
something of that nature

2512
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:20,960
well so

2513
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,880
how does an ant see it though does an

2514
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,320
ant have like is the first person gone

2515
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:29,120
or like does is an ant entirely meta all

2516
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,600
the time or a bacterium is that like a

2517
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,120
total meta perspective and they don't

2518
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,199
have to go through this like ridiculous

2519
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:37,360
like self like

2520
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:41,360
whatever creating a dissolving loop or

2521
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,000
danny would know better than i would

2522
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,440
you actually have to ask the ants that's

2523
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,760
kind of the hard part but we can make

2524
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,600
one comment the difference between the

2525
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,159
egocentric and then the more impartial

2526
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:54,480
or autobiographical reminded me a lot of

2527
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,880
the projective consciousness model

2528
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,520
projective geometry model which was also

2529
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,120
integrated with higher order theories

2530
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,360
and global workspace and a lot of those

2531
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,400
other

2532
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:05,760
topics with

2533
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,480
um ryan smith and christopher white

2534
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,360
and also the more geometrical work um

2535
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,239
with rudraf and others because it's like

2536
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:16,400
we do need both those modes we need the

2537
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,679
one where the hands are bigger when

2538
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:19,840
they're closer to your face and we need

2539
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,679
the one where it's like

2540
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,080
you're playing the video game with the

2541
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,920
third person view

2542
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,600
and then it was really interesting when

2543
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,679
you point to a lot of the um

2544
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:33,040
seen as deficits of memory or cognition

2545
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,840
like false memory but just seeing them

2546
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,480
as computational outcomes of

2547
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,520
stochastic interoceptive

2548
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,679
lossy compression and generalization

2549
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:45,600
semantic encoding

2550
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,159
what's more likely who kind of person

2551
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:49,840
are you that's gonna

2552
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,520
you know scale whether you think you did

2553
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:52,880
something or not

2554
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,840
so that's just such a interesting area

2555
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,800
that you kind of took it down

2556
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,840
thank you

2557
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,560
it's interesting bringing up like

2558
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:05,600
rudolph cause like there's some things

2559
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,960
like i wonder like you know when do you

2560
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,560
first get

2561
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,400
the capacity for projected geometric

2562
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,159
modeling of what kinds

2563
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:13,280
and so like

2564
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:16,400
this so with and what's the nature of

2565
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,960
the projective geometric model like is

2566
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,960
this something that should i still i can

2567
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,159
stop the sharing

2568
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:24,480
there we go um is this something that

2569
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:25,840
you would expect

2570
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:26,639
uh

2571
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,480
at the level of like

2572
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,320
cortical micro circuitry like some

2573
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,000
interpretation of like what cortical

2574
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,880
macro columns are doing or is this

2575
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,480
something that's actually more complex

2576
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,320
and it's like a distributed algorithm

2577
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,480
like hinton has like ideas like glom

2578
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,239
that kind of get it something like this

2579
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:44,480
like the because what you have with this

2580
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:45,760
projective geometric model is the

2581
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,400
ability to flexibly move

2582
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,400
between egocentric and allocentric

2583
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:51,760
perspectives i can take your point of

2584
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:55,120
view or mine once i um raise everything

2585
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:58,159
or boost it up into this um

2586
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:00,080
i forget that is it hyperbolic or if

2587
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,840
it's whatever this the space is that he

2588
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:02,880
puts it in

2589
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,960
from within there you can embed either

2590
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,199
either one and move between them um the

2591
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:08,880
thing i'm wondering is like the nature

2592
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,320
of these like you know i just mentioned

2593
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,400
this uh like

2594
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,920
ability to

2595
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,920
um

2596
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,920
take fictitious points of view on you

2597
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,920
i'm wondering whether like the way in

2598
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,360
which we do it is a lot more

2599
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:25,840
derived and a kind of skill

2600
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,520
of moving between

2601
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:28,880
um

2602
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,560
things like the representations you

2603
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,840
might have acquired through mirroring

2604
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,280
with others

2605
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,040
and it's and like to to take another

2606
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,639
perspective rather than it being

2607
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:38,400
something that that the visual

2608
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:41,920
system can just do of moving between of

2609
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,760
automatically translating from points of

2610
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,840
view within this higher space like what

2611
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,159
is the nature of that model like i've

2612
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:50,000
even wondered like for instance is

2613
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,520
perception actually

2614
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,520
always 2d

2615
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,280
and in a kind of like holographic way

2616
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,719
it's always a 2d projection and when we

2617
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:58,320
talk about something like depth

2618
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:01,440
it's actually either some sort of like

2619
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:02,239
uh

2620
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:04,400
sense of affordance or

2621
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:07,120
intercept of cross mapping or the likely

2622
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,760
transitions between 2d or even like 3d

2623
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,679
like we like you know we never like mars

2624
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:13,920
said it was like 2.5 division like is

2625
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,000
that just the ability to make sure that

2626
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,520
what's on the screen

2627
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,679
that's 2d is always

2628
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:21,840
coherent or that you move between as if

2629
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,520
you can move around a thing but we

2630
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,920
actually never perceive anything in 3d

2631
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,440
um in terms of our visual spatial

2632
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,400
awareness

2633
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,960
but to loop around to the ant

2634
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:33,120
um i don't know but like you might

2635
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,719
distinguish for instance

2636
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:36,719
if you consider the perspective of the

2637
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:40,320
ant itself as generative model

2638
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,280
then

2639
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,880
that might be

2640
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,400
by default

2641
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,880
more allocentric especially because of

2642
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:50,239
its like what it's specifically doing

2643
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:51,840
to the you know it takes something even

2644
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,320
makes sense to pick it it's

2645
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,840
it's fundamentally part of the super

2646
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,080
organism the organism is it's not even

2647
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,840
super organism like like what like

2648
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:02,159
daniel says like it's it is the unit

2649
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:03,920
that makes sense it's being selected is

2650
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,679
the shared enactment

2651
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:07,120
but then if you go maybe like the

2652
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,679
attractor dynamics of like the central

2653
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:12,080
complex it's like quasi hippocampal

2654
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,920
quasi-thalamic thing

2655
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,400
that might be more egocentric

2656
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:19,839
and i don't think you're going to get

2657
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:22,239
just totally agree with that i think

2658
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:24,159
it's an established fact that

2659
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:25,679
um the compass heading or the

2660
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:27,679
polarization of light is processed

2661
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:31,040
within one nest mate head and then there

2662
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,760
are collective decisions like the sex

2663
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,520
ratio of the larva that they're going to

2664
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,199
keep or the overall regulation of

2665
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:39,280
foraging that

2666
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,520
wouldn't be expected to have

2667
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,040
even

2668
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:46,320
a correlate necessarily in the

2669
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,120
head capsule of any single nest mate

2670
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,320
and so i think that's where the

2671
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,400
discussion comes to like multi-scale

2672
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,760
systems which

2673
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,639
is kind of a fun topic because in

2674
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:59,679
multi-scale systems we see sometimes a

2675
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:02,400
clean mechanistic difference between the

2676
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:05,040
lateral and the kind of vertical or the

2677
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:08,320
nesting of systems so like communication

2678
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,719
we can see the interface where you have

2679
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:13,120
the lateral layer of

2680
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,199
individuals and then where you have the

2681
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:17,199
layers that are

2682
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:20,400
inside of the individual

2683
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,360
it's a little harder to disentangle it

2684
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,360
if they're all like kind of

2685
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,120
wire but

2686
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:29,360
um

2687
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,199
what are you or Bleu do you want to ask

2688
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:32,960
a question otherwise yeah i mean it just

2689
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,960
makes me think of how like are we

2690
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,920
fundamentally broken with our like

2691
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,440
self little egocentric loop right like

2692
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,639
that

2693
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:45,679
are we maybe like measuring forever the

2694
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:48,080
incorrect scale of

2695
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,080
stuff like should we

2696
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,480
maybe be more concerned about like the

2697
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,480
scale of all of us together

2698
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,960
or the scale of all of the parts that

2699
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,520
make up us instead we like kind of

2700
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,800
falsify and create like our ego and our

2701
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,600
relationship we like project a lot about

2702
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:06,960
how we think we should be within the

2703
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,040
world or how we think we things are

2704
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,360
within us that like we don't actually

2705
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,040
know anything about

2706
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:16,560
i don't know just related to that

2707
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,880
i mean

2708
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,400
it's definitely beyond neuroscience but

2709
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,600
like i'd say uh

2710
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:24,800
yes

2711
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,360
but also um

2712
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,880
like i both think this is one of the

2713
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:32,639
most valuable and fraught parts of uh

2714
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:34,960
psychedelic and

2715
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,080
discourse around psychedelics and

2716
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,760
meditation also

2717
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:40,400
where it's like if you get this myopic

2718
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,719
egocentric perspective that's gonna be a

2719
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:43,920
real problem

2720
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:46,080
um for multiple reasons it's even for

2721
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,760
you it's gonna be a problem because you

2722
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,840
see things from one way you're gonna get

2723
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,440
owned by yourself as a kind of like

2724
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:53,280
you'll get trapped in all sorts of local

2725
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,480
you see things in one way you really

2726
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:57,120
barely see it anyway um

2727
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,920
but

2728
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:02,239
i do worry a little bit though about um

2729
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:03,440
overly

2730
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,360
you know egos get themselves in trouble

2731
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,280
but like the ability to stitch together

2732
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:08,719
for instance

2733
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:11,440
you know there is like a unit over which

2734
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:14,159
you have potentially maximum purchase

2735
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:17,120
and then and like in terms of influence

2736
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,320
there's a sense in which like you're the

2737
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,639
steward of that because like the causal

2738
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:22,400
closure is densest

2739
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,679
and there's also a sense in which like

2740
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:25,679
let's say um

2741
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:28,400
i want to coordinate with others

2742
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,440
um

2743
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,840
including myself across time like the

2744
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,760
ability to like have a narrative

2745
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:34,960
structure

2746
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,120
of the ability that's going to be

2747
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,679
helpful for not like just jumping at

2748
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:40,880
whatever

2749
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:43,520
source of utility or or expected free

2750
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:46,560
energy comes along and so like to

2751
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:49,920
basically avoid being um

2752
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,480
functionally psychopathic like you kind

2753
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:56,880
of need um the ego but you also need to

2754
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,960
have the ego not be too tight to avoid

2755
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,880
being functionally psychopathic

2756
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:04,000
so it's like not too tight not too loose

2757
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,440
otherwise

2758
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,520
the whole thing's wrecked

2759
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,080
that sounds like narrative stigmergy

2760
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,480
like agent environment feedback loops

2761
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:13,360
and

2762
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,360
also of the script

2763
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:16,880
research

2764
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:19,760
that we've talked about previously

2765
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,840
with alder russen and others where

2766
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:25,040
that's sort of the top down prior so

2767
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:26,400
it's related to what you said about the

2768
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:29,520
hard problem as to if or why or why not

2769
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:30,679
there would be

2770
01:35:30,679 --> 01:35:32,960
awareness of experience

2771
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:36,000
at for example the bodily level versus

2772
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,600
the you know tripartite zoom chat level

2773
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,119
um but at the very least instrumentally

2774
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:45,520
those top level scripts

2775
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,840
are the narratives that decide like are

2776
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,199
we going to put everybody you know

2777
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:51,600
through a a tunnel where only this exact

2778
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,760
width is going to make it through or

2779
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,400
is that a phenotype that we have a lot

2780
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:57,520
of

2781
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,360
ambiguity around

2782
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:02,880
using the bayesian prior term so um

2783
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,800
it is interesting how

2784
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:07,119
and i almost want to ask you whether you

2785
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:09,520
started with the more neuroside

2786
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,119
and found it broaching to these

2787
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:13,840
questions or whether you started maybe

2788
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,159
focus on other areas and then saw the

2789
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:18,800
brain's specifics as increasingly

2790
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,800
important

2791
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,719
like there's so little separation for me

2792
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:43,040
between like

2793
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,360
the neuroscience obsession and the

2794
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:48,080
existential like i'm constantly doing

2795
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,760
i'm constantly in a state of existential

2796
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,440
freakout and neuroscience obsession that

2797
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,360
i don't know which led which i don't

2798
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,719
know who's the dog who's the tail and

2799
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:56,800
who's wagging whom it's just constant

2800
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,040
existential crisis and

2801
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,600
obsession

2802
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:05,400
wait so i don't believe

2803
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:09,679
what would be

2804
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:11,920
advice to somebody who's curious about

2805
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,320
the field or they want to be

2806
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:17,119
working in an interesting area

2807
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:19,760
of neuroscience and embodiment and

2808
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:20,719
everything

2809
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:24,239
that you kind of mentioned today

2810
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:29,360
it seems like if someone wants to focus

2811
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,040
on psychedelics

2812
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,159
the best

2813
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:34,320
route is to uh

2814
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,480
cut your teeth or to like basically

2815
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:39,119
get a home outside of psychedelics

2816
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:42,080
establish a competency there and then

2817
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:43,920
try to bring that within the psychedelic

2818
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:45,600
domain that seems like the best path

2819
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,119
that um

2820
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:48,960
most people who succeed in the space

2821
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,000
take

2822
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,320
um

2823
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,400
and

2824
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:57,679
yeah so it's and you know the standard

2825
01:37:57,679 --> 01:37:59,920
fraud thing of academia where it's like

2826
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,520
you're trying to

2827
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,000
not be an inch wide and a mile deep and

2828
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,600
you're trying to

2829
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,360
not be a jack of all trades master of

2830
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:08,159
none

2831
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:09,199
and where

2832
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:12,159
the perverse incentives abound and

2833
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:13,440
uh

2834
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:14,840
good luck

2835
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:18,480
um uh like

2836
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:21,678
some combination of like

2837
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:26,960
both paying your dues and not optimizing

2838
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,880
yourself into

2839
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,280
a brittle straight jacket where you

2840
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:35,199
can't see anything past the next grant

2841
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,719
yikes

2842
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:42,519
i feel you

2843
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:46,320
thanks for the answer so one small

2844
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,239
question from the chat and then if

2845
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:50,560
anyone else has any final questions so

2846
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,199
adam thanks for your time and the great

2847
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:54,960
presentation and cool work and hanging

2848
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,639
out with us so

2849
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:58,800
adam mentioned the dmt paper with

2850
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,679
respect to the cortical traveling waves

2851
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:03,360
the question was wonder if there's any

2852
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,480
other work on non-alpha waves and then

2853
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:07,600
just

2854
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:08,880
if you know about that and then just a

2855
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,480
little more generally why do these

2856
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:13,199
traveling waves matter or what

2857
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:17,440
matters if they are important or not

2858
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:18,400
so

2859
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,280
there's a sense in which um

2860
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,679
like i drew like those swaths those like

2861
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:26,080
synchronous complexes but those are

2862
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,880
necessarily a core screening you zoom in

2863
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,400
on them and it's like so what's the

2864
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,639
ontological status it has a certain

2865
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:35,360
relational realism and that the extent

2866
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:36,960
that makes sense like draw that out it's

2867
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:37,840
like

2868
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,360
active inference in general with markov

2869
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:42,719
blankets it's like you can it's relative

2870
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:46,159
to what other system that's engaging in

2871
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:48,000
what types of inference they'll just

2872
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,080
decide like the scope of relevance i

2873
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,520
mean there's additional like autopoetic

2874
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,520
self-organizing elements of like in

2875
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:54,960
the internal but

2876
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,280
uh so if you look though with like

2877
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,679
a synchronous like an alpha like beta

2878
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:00,880
alpha you zoom in it's actually

2879
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:02,480
comprised of these traveling waves as

2880
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,560
more of a fine-grained description

2881
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,000
although you zoom in on that that's

2882
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,159
actually corresponding of population

2883
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:11,119
level activity um and so

2884
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:14,639
it'll depend so there's going to be

2885
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:16,000
potentially if you're looking at

2886
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,080
traveling in cortical waves

2887
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,239
that might be useful

2888
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:22,080
so i focus on like the standing wave

2889
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,000
description as like

2890
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,840
um a joint belief over whatever is in

2891
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,360
its scope but if you're talking about

2892
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,440
something like predictive processing

2893
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,440
um

2894
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,360
within the model you you might want to

2895
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,679
zoom in on this standing wave or

2896
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:37,040
the standing of description for like the

2897
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,719
business end of passing on your

2898
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:40,080
predictions and then kicking up your

2899
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:44,159
prediction errors but depends like

2900
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,719
it depends on the the the

2901
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:48,719
within the multiscale account what's of

2902
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:50,800
interest for the modeler

2903
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,000
uh

2904
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,480
one quick thing from this in the side uh

2905
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,719
handle the alpha wave question whether

2906
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:58,960
there's any non-alpha wave traveling

2907
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,719
wave papers

2908
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:03,600
i don't think so i think the one

2909
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,040
i think the terminal one was focusing on

2910
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,400
alpha if i'm remembering i could be

2911
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,159
misremembering i think

2912
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:12,400
but there are four psychedelics um uh i

2913
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,679
think

2914
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:14,719
terry

2915
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:16,960
sanowski i think would be the person to

2916
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,760
look at for some really good general

2917
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,280
biophysics of traveling waves in the

2918
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,159
brain

2919
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:23,440
uh

2920
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,119
yeah sanowsky i think would be the place

2921
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:27,920
to look a quick aside on on dmt

2922
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:29,040
like i mentioned like there might be

2923
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,600
endogenous cmt um there's

2924
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,520
debate over how significant it is so

2925
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:34,719
some people say

2926
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:36,480
it's not significant at all some people

2927
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:38,480
say it's very significant so it's one

2928
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,480
place we know that it's produced is in

2929
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,199
the pineal body the seed of the soul

2930
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:44,840
and it's

2931
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,719
uh

2932
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:49,280
another place and there's some

2933
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:51,119
evidence but some people have questioned

2934
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:53,679
it that it might be um almost akin to

2935
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:55,920
like a neurotransmitter system in its

2936
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:56,960
own right we just didn't know how to

2937
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:00,560
look at it before um jimoh

2938
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,800
borgen at university of michigan if

2939
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,719
you're interested in that issue

2940
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:07,280
and that debate uh but it's possible

2941
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:08,639
though like

2942
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:11,520
um one of the main endogenous ligands we

2943
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,760
don't know

2944
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:16,159
of the five hd2a system one of the main

2945
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:18,000
stimulus might not actually be

2946
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,960
serotonin but might be dmt so like under

2947
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:23,199
like let's say like a limit experience

2948
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:24,719
like uh

2949
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:26,400
you know so one like i mentioned like

2950
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,480
carbon dioxide can do it or maybe lactic

2951
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:30,239
acid like you're you're running for your

2952
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:32,719
life or for your lunch and it's super

2953
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:34,960
high levels of blood acidity and that

2954
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,239
might be activating these

2955
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:38,560
proto-psychedelic pathways um but

2956
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,719
another one could be like potentially

2957
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:44,239
dmt mediated and things like um

2958
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:45,199
sex

2959
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:47,679
earthing and near-death experiences so

2960
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:50,000
like you almost bled out

2961
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,639
um maybe it's time to relax your beliefs

2962
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:53,679
you're

2963
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:56,239
about to bond with another creature for

2964
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:58,320
years maybe this is how part of how you

2965
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,080
do it um

2966
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,000
whether bonding with a

2967
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,520
mate or your offspring

2968
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,239
very expected these are early days

2969
01:43:08,239 --> 01:43:11,040
interesting and also made me think about

2970
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,199
brain and body dopamine and serotonin

2971
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:16,239
other neurotransmitters in the blood

2972
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:18,719
in the blood vessels the immune system

2973
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:20,880
and then neuropeptides the whole

2974
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,840
continuum of short

2975
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:26,000
acting neurotransmitters to slower

2976
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,360
acting

2977
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,280
phenomena and then

2978
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,760
oh we're thinking about it from a nested

2979
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:34,159
multi-scale systems perspective with

2980
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:36,960
this kind of more local faster

2981
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,280
and then slower

2982
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:42,159
broader spatial scales which just has

2983
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:44,639
a lot of analogy with everything from

2984
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:47,119
regional governance to

2985
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:49,760
the regulation of tissue so it's kind of

2986
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,400
an interesting idea how

2987
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,719
a lot comes together there

2988
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:57,119
it also made me think of how

2989
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:59,679
staring into someone else's eyes for

2990
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:02,320
like a prolonged period of time induces

2991
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,719
like violent disturbing hallucinations

2992
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:06,560
which is like reported in

2993
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,400
i don't know some paper i can't remember

2994
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,159
but i'll i'll look it up and and see if

2995
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:11,520
i can post it in the chat but i'm really

2996
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,800
interested

2997
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,719
how like thinking through others minds

2998
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:18,159
or like looking through others eyes

2999
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:21,840
um is is so violently incorrect to us

3000
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,920
that it's perceived as like an altered

3001
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:26,400
perception

3002
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:28,400
i i wonder if this is speaking to like

3003
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,400
the way in which we

3004
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:33,600
bootstrap um

3005
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,760
like objectified selfhood and and me and

3006
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,520
like but but because like we do it so

3007
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:39,920
much this is like a core axis of

3008
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,840
imagination and perception

3009
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:44,080
that you can create like these

3010
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:46,960
weird feedback loops and i also wonder

3011
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:48,400
like how much it varies across people

3012
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:49,199
like

3013
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:50,080
um

3014
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:51,760
like like if you're like really far on

3015
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:54,080
the autism spectrum like

3016
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,000
or or far in a schizophrenia spectrum

3017
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,239
like would you like in a moment like you

3018
01:44:58,239 --> 01:44:59,360
look in someone's eyes and it's like it

3019
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,679
