00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:07,874
Hello and

2
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:10,510
welcome everyone to the Active
Inference Lab.

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:16,549
Today is January 10th, 2022,
and we're here in active

4
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:22,022
cash stream number 14
with a whole host of awesome guests.

5
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:26,659
We're going to be discussing
osteopathy and mental health,

6
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:30,597
and we're going to have the authors
say hello and introduce themselves.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,901
Then Lucas will give a presentation,
and during the presentation

8
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,538
please feel free to add your comments
and questions in the live chat,

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,473
and then we'll have a bunch of time

10
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:44,544
after the presentation
to ask those questions to the authors.

11
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,646
Here. Any authors remarks?

12
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:51,151
So really excited to hear from you all
and learn from your perspective.

13
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,922
Let's hear the introductions
from the authors and then go to Lucas.

14
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,992
So please Robert,
and then we'll kick it off from there.

15
00:00:58,992 --> 00:00:59,426
Thank you.

16
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,162
Robert Shaw.

17
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,798
I'm based in Sweden

18
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,500
and a psychotherapist.

19
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,970
My research interest
is particularly within embodiment,

20
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,506
and that was what my Ph.D.

21
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,576
was on embodiment
within the therapeutic relationship

22
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:21,815
Hi, everyone.

23
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:25,351
I'm Francesco, totally from Italy.

24
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,088
I'm a neuroscientist and osteopath

25
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,557
mainly

26
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,660
interested in discovering the

27
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:38,465
how the brain works in relation
to touch a relation

28
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,867
to the effect of touch

29
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:46,573
based on the different type of stimuli

30
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,643
that the body received

31
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:54,647
I am sure it just means I'm an octopus.

32
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:58,651
Currently based in Malta and Italy.

33
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,324
I'm also cognitive scientist
and my main interest is on predictive

34
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:08,328
processing, activating friends,
touch and chronic pain

35
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,162
in general.

36
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:12,031
Yeah.

37
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:13,833
Hi, my name is Lucas.

38
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,137
I think I'm the last of the authors,
so I'm an osteopath as well,

39
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:21,708
based in Hamburg in Germany,
and I'm currently working part time

40
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:26,546
at the Osteopathic Research Institute,
and I'm working on education, education

41
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:30,450
and research, and I'm also part time
studying psychology and in science

42
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,753
that's meant to have at King's
College in London.

43
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,122
And I think I. Can.

44
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,724
Kick off the presentation now.

45
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:38,825
That's OK with you on

46
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,728
perfect.

47
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,997
Thanks so

48
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,067
yeah, we have the opportunity.

49
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,503
Thanks again for the Active Endurance Lab
for the invitation.

50
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,206
It's it's a pleasure to be here.

51
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:57,143
We have the opportunity
to present a paper that you have recently

52
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,947
published on Frontiers in Psychology
in the section of Psychology

53
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:05,084
Research Topic, Journal, Content
Activism and Active Opinions

54
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:09,055
in the Therapeutic Alliance,
and the papers entitled Osteopathy

55
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:12,725
A Mental Health and Body Productive
and Introspective Framework

56
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:16,029
and without further ado, I think

57
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,631
let's let's dove right into it.

58
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,667
A little introduction on on

59
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,370
why these things might be interesting

60
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,607
we have a globally

61
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,511
a very high prevalence and a burden,
but also comorbidity

62
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:35,949
between most skeletal
and mental health disorders.

63
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:40,353
So to put this in perspective,
about 1 billion prevalent cases of mental

64
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,923
disorders have been reported in 2017

65
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,594
about 1.3 billion
prevalence cases have been reported.

66
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,597
Most of it is autism and 17.

67
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:54,701
So together these two broad spectrum

68
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:58,638
disorders are very prevalent
but also burdensome.

69
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,809
So together
those health conditions contribute

70
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,711
to what

71
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,380
are the main contributors
to work by disability.

72
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,318
But system of demented is disorders
also highly co-morbid

73
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,888
which means for example,
a anxiety depression not frequently

74
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:20,260
to our core common in depression,
most pain conditions and vice versa.

75
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,463
So for example depressive

76
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:28,434
symptoms are quite prevalent
and pain sufferers and pain symptoms

77
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,337
are also quite prevalent
in individuals with depression

78
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,041
so these

79
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:39,746
this data kind of outlines
a need to integrate physical and mental

80
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,448
health care services in our opinion,
but also in the opinion of

81
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,019
many research papers in the literature.

82
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:51,057
So especially multidisciplinary
collaborations between most skeletal

83
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,927
and psychology of health care
specialists have been called for.

84
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,865
But on the other hand
there have also been some disease

85
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:03,469
classifications that have been proposed
to combine physical and mental health

86
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,706
and proposed classifications

87
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,842
that are made actually somatic,
purely mental.

88
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,279
So we believe that there is this need

89
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,115
to integrate these kind of approaches,

90
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,152
and we like to propose osteopathy

91
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,454
to be to be one of these approaches

92
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,925
and osteopathy,
for those who don't notice, is generally

93
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,762
used primarily to treat most facility
disorders like back pain.

94
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,765
But it is also

95
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:37,503
has recently been proposed to benefit
psychosocial factors in particular,

96
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:42,175
and in patient populations
with persistent pain.

97
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,878
And there have also

98
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,180
there was also some research

99
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,016
that has been conducted from Hillary,
ABN and colleagues

100
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:54,320
showing some positive outcomes
of combined treatment

101
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,291
as well as the combined osteopathy
and combined psychological

102
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,961
informed strategies
showing positive results.

103
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,264
So now a few attempts to investigate

104
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,401
the effectiveness of osteopathy
in the field of mental health.

105
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,804
And there are only a few approaches
being developed

106
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,108
to treat
how to engage with mental health.

107
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:19,212
So based on this background, we propose

108
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:23,383
we try to propose
a framework on how to move forward

109
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,053
and how to research the status of such
supposed to be in this field.

110
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,790
And we do so by drawing together

111
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,427
from the research
fields and body position,

112
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,830
predictive coding,
but also interception and sympathy.

113
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,467
And we like to propose in the end
our framework,

114
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,303
which is an embodied predictive
and intrusive performance.

115
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,607
And if you look on the right hand side,
see the one,

116
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:53,246
this is kind of our background
I put together a simplified body position

117
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:57,183
kind of highlights the role of the body
in population and in mental health.

118
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:01,387
And these process processes
are likely underpinned

119
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,890
by predictive coding processes.

120
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:10,163
So for them, our access point,
we discuss intercepts

121
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,201
as an access point, point of access point
to affect these processes.

122
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:20,573
And we argue that osteopathy might be
an approach to to realize this. And

123
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,877
so let's have a look at the background.

124
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:28,548
We start with the first research field,
which is embodied tradition

125
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,453
and generally embodied and body medicine,

126
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,722
interdisciplinary field of research
which spans disciplines

127
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:41,360
including philosophy, but also
psychology, psychiatry and neuroscience.

128
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:46,365
And in general, these theories
of embodiment argue that cognition

129
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:50,970
and emotion are both dependent
on embedded body simulations.

130
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:56,509
So they argue that body and mind
are inseparable in producing cognition

131
00:07:56,542 --> 00:08:01,614
and that the non neural body might both
constrain and enable cognition,

132
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:06,385
but not until they are stronger
and which are versions of embodiment.

133
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,822
Some idea that the body might contributes

134
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:14,760
to cognitive processes,
while other versions argue

135
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,663
that it might constitutes
cognitive processes

136
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,502
so to get a little bit

137
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,771
more detail
involved theories of embodiment

138
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:30,243
of that condition of emotional based upon
reinstatement of perception.

139
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,546
So this is relating
to both external extra receptors

140
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,048
and entering
into receptive sensory states,

141
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:40,353
but also to actually which relates
to proprioceptive motor states.

142
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,457
And these perceptions produce embodied

143
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:49,095
sensory model simulations
which previous experiences in one's self.

144
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:50,096
So this is

145
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,433
kind of the explanation of embodiment.

146
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:58,738
And this perspective is quite interesting
because it might revise our brain

147
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:03,643
centered view of cognition
by acknowledging that these processes

148
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:08,648
are not simply limited to neural events
in the brain, but also concepts across

149
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:13,019
the brain, body and blood divisions
and should be also studied accordingly.

150
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,691
And there are different kinds
of commitment to the embodied theories

151
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:24,230
and an active isn't this interesting
aspect, linked concept that I want you

152
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:29,769
to go into a little bit further
and connected in propose that cognition

153
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:35,408
emerges from the dynamic interaction
of brain, body and also environment.

154
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,611
So most of you

155
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,180
might have heard
about the faulty cognition,

156
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:46,586
which is that cognition is all together
embodied, embedded

157
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,689
connected, extended,
but also psychological.

158
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:55,194
And we are it is argued
that cognition is an important

159
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,631
but it's an extended
and ecological process

160
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:02,535
of sense
making through a body in an environment.

161
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,003
So this is an evaluative

162
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,773
evaluate is interaction of an organism
and its environment.

163
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:13,679
So in each of these four
or five used to mean that body cognition

164
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,017
is an average tool and also constrained
by the non-euro body.

165
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,353
Embedded means

166
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,222
that cognition depends
on the environment, the context

167
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,059
as the organism is situated
within the environment

168
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:33,065
and connected means that provision
for action depends on the interaction

169
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,368
of the embodied organisms
with the environment.

170
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,872
And extended means that cognition extends
beyond the brain and body

171
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,173
into the environment.

172
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:44,043
The most notable example
might be your smartphone.

173
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,313
And lastly,
ecological means that cognition

174
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,282
depends on the environmental affordances
for for action.

175
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,053
And all together this might constitute

176
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,523
an activism with a five perspective.

177
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,961
So combining these perspectives
of embodied and connective

178
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,097
and activism, both mental

179
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:08,134
and physical health conditions,
for example, pain and depression

180
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,937
are associated with altered interaction

181
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,940
with an eye
toward interaction of the organism with

182
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,477
and with with the environment
through its embodiment.

183
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,682
So it's the three part
engagement, brain, body and environment.

184
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:24,483
So to

185
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:29,188
sum this up, embodiment and activism
emphasize the interaction of brain, body

186
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:33,826
and environment in understanding
the mind and permission and

187
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,030
to understand the processes of the brain.

188
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,134
In a little bit more detail, we have to
turn to another bit of research,

189
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,438
which is the next part of the deadline
because this predictive, Tony,

190
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,642
and I believe that predictive coding,
this is a topic

191
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,812
most of the listeners
are more familiar with than us.

192
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,880
But I try to summarize them anyway.

193
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,718
So predictive
processing is a theoretical framework

194
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:04,256
with growing influence and the field
of cognitive science, and it is closely

195
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:08,561
related but also distant, distinct
from the free energy principle.

196
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:12,732
I usually bring hypotheses into action
in theory, and so I would summarize all

197
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,566
of them closely.

198
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,335
So the

199
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,438
free energy principle proposes
that living systems

200
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:22,742
resist the tendency to disorder,
or in other words,

201
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,378
remain in thermodynamic non
equilibrium state and states,

202
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:31,016
and they do so by restricting themselves
to a limited number of states

203
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,953
through the minimization of production.

204
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,123
And in this instance,
free energy is defined as the difference

205
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,226
between the systems
predicted and actual states,

206
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,998
and this can be minimized using
both perception and action in perception.

207
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:49,535
It is minimized
by updating the prediction that is

208
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,372
made from the generated model
based on the sensation

209
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,776
and action in turn

210
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,679
changing this information
to actually to match with the prediction.

211
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,883
So it's like a simple thing prophecy

212
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,619
and the eye usually brain hypothesis

213
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,291
proposes that brains making predictions
about the causes of extra

214
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:16,896
receptive and receptive, but also
proprioceptive sensations using both

215
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:21,400
the sensory input but also prior beliefs
based on the generated model

216
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,571
and in
general the confidence of precision.

217
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,472
One has

218
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,675
in the belief by the player

219
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,945
and the sensory input or the likelihood

220
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,980
will determine how much the perception

221
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,516
would then
and shift towards the expectation.

222
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:42,721
So in general,
the gap between play on likelihood

223
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,825
this kind of prediction, error,
free energy,

224
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,261
and while the system is minimizing
prediction, error,

225
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,933
free energy or surprise or entropy,
that is also maximizing

226
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,936
the evidence
for its own model of the world.

227
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,675
And this is the by using brain hypothesis
this is related to behavior.

228
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,846
So predictive coding is putting this
into a neural perspective and proposing

229
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:11,550
sets down descending top down predictions
that are conveyed.

230
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,286
Biological levels don't look like levels

231
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,991
where they are compared to us
and what our sensory information

232
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,827
so from this

233
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:25,965
perspective information
only goes up the cortical hierarchy.

234
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:30,035
And if a mismatch between the predicted
natural information occurs

235
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:34,473
which is a prediction error
and otherwise top down predictions

236
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:39,078
constantly explain away
what sensory information. Is.

237
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:43,182
So then there is active inference
which proposes

238
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:47,953
that the brain actively modifies
its input to confirm prior expectations

239
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:52,958
and this is an active and also selective
sampling sensory information

240
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:57,596
in the world who actually so prediction
errors can be minimized.

241
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,467
Talked about it a little bit
through perceptual insurance and active

242
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,334
inference.

243
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,804
Perceptive inference,
meaning revising the generated model

244
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,340
based on the prediction
was an active influence

245
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,877
acting on the words to generate a state

246
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,213
that is predicted by the general judgment

247
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:19,151
and to bring all of this together
with the physical and mental health

248
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:23,022
condition and to understand the physical
and mental health conditions,

249
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:24,823
it might be an

250
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,027
ultimate weighting of prior beliefs
and sensory information

251
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,896
which gives rise to physical
or mental health conditions.

252
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,966
So, for example, physical health
conditions,

253
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,504
prior beliefs are likely overweighted
relative to sensory information,

254
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,340
which means a far too much prediction
precision,

255
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:45,411
which then predicts symptoms
consequently experienced

256
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,348
and this might also lead to heightened

257
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,352
prediction of pain
even towards the sensations

258
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,555
so that harmless sensations
might be perceived as painful

259
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,526
and on the other hand,
mental health conditions,

260
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,364
both prior
beliefs might be overly precise

261
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,500
in comparison to sensory information
or vice versa.

262
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,771
So the first one is depression
and the second one in psychosis.

263
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:16,342
And yes,

264
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,978
so one point that was quite

265
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:23,048
interesting
is that chronic pain of depression,

266
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,585
which we are quite interested
in, are particularly linked to thoughts

267
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,521
and chances of interception
that some in literature involve this.

268
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,491
So this is our next research topic

269
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,661
that we want you to
combine with the other ones

270
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,965
so what is interception

271
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,401
I have defined interception

272
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:46,038
as the process
by which the nervous system senses,

273
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,142
interprets and integrates segments
originating from within the body.

274
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,745
So it's all information
from within our body.

275
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,982
And this provides
some kind of embodied sensory experience

276
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,019
which is absolutely necessary

277
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,254
for the adaptive interaction
with the environment.

278
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:07,760
So an interesting aspect
is that the active inference

279
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,031
model was also applied to intercept,
which is termed intercepted endurance,

280
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,201
and it proposes
that intercept experiences result

281
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:20,406
from inferences about the hidden costs
of this sensory information.

282
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,643
So to put this into the neuro
perspective,

283
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,546
our top down intercept of predictions

284
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,884
compared with bottom up
intercept intercept information

285
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:35,220
most likely on the insula
and the mismatch between

286
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,856
those then results and prediction error,

287
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:42,861
which is minimized
depending on the the precision

288
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,365
by either perceptual inference
are active inference.

289
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:50,769
So perceptual experience means revising
the top down deceptive predictions

290
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,571
and active appearance means

291
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:56,575
then modifying the bottom up intercept
of information to convey the prediction.

292
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,814
And interestingly, Andy has proposed that

293
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:05,317
an emotion can also be viewed
as intercepted in sequence

294
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,520
because intercept of predictive
errors are used

295
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,990
to an emotional space.

296
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,326
So to connect this to physical

297
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:18,997
and mental health conditions and deficits
and intercept of processing

298
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:22,101
for example,
the lower intercept of accuracy

299
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,405
might be associated
with both physical and mental health

300
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,174
conditions
led to payment and commodity oppression.

301
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,446
However, there is

302
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,182
it is not clear how

303
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:41,587
that every disorder in every individual
might behave the same in this way.

304
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:45,757
I think the difference is so

305
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,628
so some disorder, some individuals

306
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:54,166
would likely benefit from reducing overly
precise intercepted predictions,

307
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,204
for example, growing beliefs about real
but indeed harmless sensations,

308
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,842
while other patients might might reduce
overly precise perceptive information,

309
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:07,880
which is, for example,
illusory sensations that are maintained

310
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:12,251
that maintain warring beliefs
so that both possibilities.

311
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,554
So let's talk about our approach on

312
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,824
how to influence up to its information.

313
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,961
And this is osteopathy,
the osteopath, the office on this paper.

314
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,297
So a few words about osteopathy.

315
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,933
Osteopathy, combines

316
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:33,005
hands on manual approaches with hands off
patient management approaches.

317
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,573
So we use touch and manipulation

318
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,943
as hands on, which is informed
by synthetic models of care.

319
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:42,047
So our clinical reasoning
and hands of patient manage approaches

320
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:46,151
involve patient education, psychological
support, lifestyle advice, but also

321
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,420
self-management management solutions.

322
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,790
And these are informed,
of course, by most geographic principles.

323
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:56,295
But notably,
both might utilize a top down

324
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,431
and bottom up dynamics
between personal tissues and the brain.

325
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,701
Yes. So in

326
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:07,406
general, osteopathy is applied
to treat a range of clinical conditions,

327
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,210
but an emphasis is given on chronic pain
conditions

328
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,879
in particular,
most particularly dissatisfied segment

329
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:18,684
and philosophically,
Osteopathy has emphasized

330
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:23,255
the unity and interaction of body,
mind and soul for quite some time.

331
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:27,059
And it has also been proposed
that it might

332
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,295
benefit psychological outcomes,
especially in chronic pain patients.

333
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:33,632
But this needs some further research and

334
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,803
Francesco and colleagues also proposed

335
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:42,107
that osteopathic treatment
might influence intercepted processing.

336
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,344
And in the concept paper
they published in I think 2060

337
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,948
and went on to conduct
some primary research showing

338
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:54,152
that osteopathy indeed increases
contraceptive accuracy.

339
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,823
But also decreases the bench
response of brain correlates

340
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,893
of interception
in patients with chronic back pain.

341
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,030
So they do so probably

342
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,634
by the stimulation, often
see tactile fibers

343
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:12,537
which communicate intercepted
and affective dimensions of touch.

344
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,707
So this could be relevant to both

345
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:19,411
physical and mental health conditions
that involve intercept of deficits,

346
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,114
which are, for example,
chronic pain and also depression

347
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,050
so this is all background.

348
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,820
And I think that really up
to the framework we like to present

349
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:33,925
and the framework
which all of these fields of research

350
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:38,430
and it is an embodied, introspective
but also predictive framework.

351
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:44,002
And the basic basis
is that both physical and mental

352
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,139
health symptoms
may result from outright precision

353
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,043
weighting between intercepts, predictions
and intercept input.

354
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:55,914
So we argued that on the literature,
I guess that I've had too much precision,

355
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:57,516
which is an

356
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:01,520
overly precise prediction
on automated precision.

357
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,289
It's a follow up to the likelihood
which is an imprecise prediction.

358
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:10,128
So arguably from any depression

359
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,932
mainly linked to the operating of trials.

360
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:19,237
So these beliefs likely predict
painful and depressive states,

361
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:22,207
even if the actual intercepted
information is harmless.

362
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,410
And they do so due to past experiences,

363
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:30,282
and they likely make these states
come true through active experiences.

364
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:34,486
So the expected symptoms
might be generated through action

365
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,388
to confirm the prediction

366
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,091
and in order to update
these prior beliefs

367
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:43,729
and reduce the influence of pain
and depressive states,

368
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:48,133
it is likely that surprising intercept
input needs to be provided

369
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:53,071
to increase, first of all, the rate
of the likelihood, but also to generate

370
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:56,975
prediction errors that can revise
the belief system with the predictions

371
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:01,213
and thus steps likely to foster
perception influence.

372
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,883
So actual information
is used in perceptual insurance

373
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,019
to propagate the prediction and also
the perception of these symptoms.

374
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,922
And we have to look at 52 in a moment.

375
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,359
So this

376
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:19,197
a paper by far from 2015
which which has argued

377
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,834
that contemplative practices
may alter intercept of processing,

378
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:26,338
shifting regulatory habits
from active to positive influence.

379
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,241
And we believe that it osteopathy

380
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,676
does the same so

381
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:36,581
if we have to look at our main

382
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,617
we propose that

383
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,553
we see a patient in red
lying on the treatment table.

384
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:45,023
Imagine this patient has

385
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:49,728
chronic pain with comorbid depression
and he's lying there and the osteopath

386
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:53,565
provides some touch based interventions
that to the symptomatic area in this

387
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,369
this image of the upturn

388
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,371
and we argue that

389
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,675
the belief or the plight of the patient
is likely to predict

390
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,912
physical and mental states
that are associated with pain depression

391
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:10,582
because to be the likely
because of uncertain information

392
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:13,852
and this is the overweighting
of the problem

393
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,990
but if we provide some treatment
interventions to the patients,

394
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:23,662
the sensory input is not linked
to these physical and mental states,

395
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,031
which is surprising

396
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:29,100
but osteopathic treatment
often does not involve

397
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,736
pain, but is quite pleasant
if you if you touch a patient.

398
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:36,808
So this is a surprising mismatch of calls
to the patients, to the patient,

399
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,978
because the expected
and reaction information do not match

400
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:43,815
and thus generate
an intercept prediction.

401
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:44,182
Right.

402
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:49,821
So these prediction errors need
to be minimized and it can be minimized

403
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:54,993
using actuarial perception insurance
and in chronic pain.

404
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:00,599
We argue that high precision is a product
to the belief to the prior, and low

405
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,101
precision is flooded with the sensory
information and the likelihood.

406
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:06,571
So the first process that needs to engage
is active appearance,

407
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,141
which likely produces the symptoms

408
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,411
that are resembling the predicted states

409
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:19,551
so likely the autonomic nervous system
is engaged to produce sensations that

410
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,522
resemble the expected

411
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,157
painful and depressive

412
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:31,196
so however, we are in the health care
context and osteopathic treatments,

413
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,432
so the patient might also be the client
that declined to

414
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,502
to think that this is to help
promote intervention.

415
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:40,539
So this is not

416
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,608
not and this is contradicted

417
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,578
with the map with the prediction.

418
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:50,415
So this activity might not
be sufficiently

419
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:55,053
to to reduce and explain
the intercept of prediction errors.

420
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,558
So consequently, we added that perceptual
appearances processes might be engaged

421
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:04,162
to update the belief and employer
based on the likelihood.

422
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,297
So the sensory information

423
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:08,833
provided by the osteopath
might objectively by the patient

424
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,636
and thereby
revising the generative model,

425
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,439
holding the belief
and issuing the prediction.

426
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:18,910
So we agree that these are the processes
that underpin osteopathic treatment

427
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:23,214
in these kinds of patients,
and especially when an emotional

428
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,416
reaction and treatment

429
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:28,386
develops. So

430
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,656
yeah, and in essence,
we argued that belief

431
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,559
and the prediction
of physical and mental states

432
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,329
that are associated
with pain of depression are updated

433
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,398
through these interventions.

434
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:43,568
So the the persistent and noisy
deceptive predictions errors

435
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:48,306
which maintain these symptoms through
active interference might be replaced

436
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:52,744
with surprising imprecise interceptor
patient errors to alleviate the symptoms.

437
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,646
Septuagint.

438
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,917
So this is in a nutshell, our framework

439
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,621
and we also of course
need to discuss this framework

440
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,624
and have looked at some implications
also of limitations.

441
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,895
So in general, I like to emphasize
that this theoretical framework

442
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:14,966
is a theoretical framework and therefore
requires experimental scrutiny

443
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,637
for verification of quantification
so future research

444
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:23,041
particularly needs to explore
osteopathic treatment, immediate

445
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,111
physical and mental symptoms.

446
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:29,447
And this patient population also,
if it actually

447
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:33,918
increases intercept accuracy
in this population and likely also

448
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:37,555
decreases allostatic load and modulates
autonomic nervous system activity.

449
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:40,058
So there are two measurement tools
we can use for that,

450
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,028
and other limitations

451
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:47,298
include the disregard of complexity.

452
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:50,502
Both of we have conditions
but also of the therapeutic approaches.

453
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:55,106
So osteopathy and dementia and depression
and and chronic pain

454
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:59,177
are all very complex conditions
and we have simplified them extremely.

455
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,247
So we overlooked environmental
factors and we didn't

456
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,649
go into

457
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:08,219
explaining the patient
therapist relationship in detail as well.

458
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,256
But this framework
should be understood in this context.

459
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,591
So it should be understood
in the person centered context

460
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,762
and the future studies might

461
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,499
also have a look

462
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:25,503
at why monolithic
treatment of peripheral tissues

463
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,507
sometimes leads to autonomic
and emotional responses.

464
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:33,511
And I think this is the basically
why I was so interested in this research

465
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:38,349
and these theories, because in practice
I frequently engage patients

466
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,755
which responded quite emotional
to touch and felt better after.

467
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:46,891
So I wanted to to understand
how this might happen.

468
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:51,362
So based on our hypothesis,
you can see in figure three

469
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,933
that the therapeutic input

470
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:00,772
that is provided during treatment
may contradict the predicted state

471
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:04,409
of pain and depression and produce
an interesting prediction error

472
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:09,180
which is used to in emotional states
and minimalize minimize

473
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:11,750
risk perception insurance.

474
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,884
And what you can see

475
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,955
is that the initial active inference
is quite correct and chart

476
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:21,926
and we have seen or I've seen
and my colleagues as well from experience

477
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:26,064
that often these patients
display emotional responses to treatment.

478
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,634
They firstly experience
some sympathetic activity

479
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,003
like sweating and muscle tightness

480
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:36,207
combined with emotional distress
for example, starting to cry.

481
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:40,044
But these initial reactions frequently

482
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,482
are replaced with very

483
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,418
positive, sympathetic activity.

484
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:50,588
So the breathing goes down
and the patient starts

485
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:54,125
to relax and emotional calmness
starts to set in.

486
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:58,129
And I believe this is quite
well explainable with the framework

487
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,063
that we have provided to you

488
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:02,500
because an active inference
might be the first way to engage

489
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,571
in minimizing these prediction errors
and perceptive influence

490
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:09,541
might be the second more sustainable way

491
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:13,144
of minimizing these predictions. So

492
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,014
lastly, you can see

493
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:20,118
another idea
which might come from this framework,

494
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,621
and this is the grant
for multidisciplinary collaborations

495
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:26,958
in the treatment of mental and physical

496
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,026
disorders.

497
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,495
So we propose a kind of

498
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,831
integrative intercept of exposure therapy

499
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:36,000
in which both

500
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,004
physical but also mental health care
specialists can come together and

501
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,342
work in a multidisciplinary
but also person centered care approach.

502
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,646
And the idea is that you can see
on the left hand side here is that

503
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,817
mindfulness
practice is likely work top down

504
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:57,422
in the patient to attend to the sensation
that she is experiencing,

505
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:02,260
but also affecting the sensory
information like osteopathic work

506
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,930
and bottom up,
also affecting the sensory information by

507
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,033
producing a scent sensation itself.

508
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:14,439
And psychotherapy
is likely to top down to help identify

509
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:19,010
and also reflect on the sensation
and like it works and

510
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,914
works on the client at least

511
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,783
directly,
not through the sensory information.

512
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:31,189
So these are a few few future
research ideas

513
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,958
and now we can complete

514
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,763
this presentation
and to put on all together

515
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,699
this hypothesis and the reality to

516
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,969
propose the embodied predictive
and intrusive framework.

517
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,672
And it does so to reason and research.

518
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,508
The effect of osteopathic treatment

519
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:53,011
has putatively
come out of psychological factors

520
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,880
in patients
with persistent and physical conditions.

521
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:01,386
And one of the basic ideas
is that persistent

522
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,988
physical and mental conditions
like chronic pain and depression

523
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:07,392
may be underlined

524
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:10,194
by first overly precise
intercept of predictions,

525
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:14,732
meaning that a symptom controlled
inflammation is expected

526
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,937
and second, imprecise intercept
is prediction errors, meaning that

527
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:22,173
symptom
incomplete information is not sensed.

528
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:26,277
So osteopathic treatment may provide

529
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:30,248
uncertain and surprising intercept
of information to the bodily area

530
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:34,585
that is associated with a physical
and also comorbid mental symptoms

531
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,855
resulting in intercepted
prediction errors that first engage

532
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,857
a disappearance processes

533
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:44,595
which lead to initial autonomic activity
resembling the predicted symptoms

534
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,031
and this is

535
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,534
because it is the most likely cause
of uncertain

536
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,870
intercept information due to the past
experiences of the patient

537
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:56,674
and afterwards
due to the contextual factors,

538
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:00,078
the information likely engages
perceptual inference processes

539
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:04,449
that then appear to be maladaptive
and just such predictions based on

540
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:10,288
the actual intercept of information
and osteopathy, might also actually

541
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:14,258
improve the ability to attention
to actual intercept of information

542
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,863
so in a nutshell, persistent and noisy
intercept of predict knows

543
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:23,001
that maintain the symptoms
are likely replaced with surprising,

544
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:27,472
precise and perceptive predictions
that arguably alleviate the symptoms.

545
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:33,511
And in this way treatment might reduce
the beliefs about and also the prediction

546
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:37,248
of physical states that are associated
with chronic depression.

547
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,019
And we are currently also
at the Osteopathic Research

548
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,922
Institute conducting research
into these approaches.

549
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:48,993
So Tulsi has also joined us
today, has developed

550
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,065
an approach on psychosomatic osteopathy
and we're currently having a look

551
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:57,268
on how these techniques might influence
stress levels in healthy participants,

552
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:58,136
but also with patients

553
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:01,139
with chronic tension type
headaches or chronic muscles.

554
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,507
Can I take this one?

555
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,643
So maybe there's some things
to follow on in the future.

556
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,345
So that's it.

557
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,947
Thank you very much for your attention.

558
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,750
I'm really looking forward
to the discussion and to engaging

559
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,019
Robert, George and Francesco

560
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:16,921
and you,

561
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:20,224
I mean, references,
and I think that's one of them shortly.

562
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:24,929
And if someone's interested
I think they can get the presentation.

563
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:28,332
So I've done it yes.

564
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:38,042
But no, that's it.

565
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:40,278
Thanks, Lucas.

566
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,180
That was an awesome presentation.

567
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,882
Really a lot to think and talk about.

568
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:49,020
So perhaps we'll first just open it

569
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,156
up to any of the authors and colleagues
here.

570
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,060
Please just jump in wherever you'd like.

571
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,463
I think it'd be awesome to hear about

572
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:02,300
just your overview or what
brought you to this area of research,

573
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,604
as well as anything that you picked up on
from this last presentation.

574
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:16,848
I think maybe I can say a few words
because I forgot something

575
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:20,985
in the beginning, so it all started
with with George and Francesco

576
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:27,658
inviting Robert and me
to join our research group that tries to

577
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,062
to reconceptualize osteopathic care
and the active adherence framework.

578
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:36,601
So we have a group of osteopath
from Europe working

579
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:41,839
with the Edge of Influence Framework,
and now also other papers coming in.

580
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,509
A special topic, which is also

581
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:49,814
has been edited
by edited by George and Francesco.

582
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:53,818
So there are other ideas
coming forward in the near future.

583
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,624
I think 11 thing that's

584
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,361
I guess brought us into this area

585
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:06,864
is a sort of a way

586
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:09,867
of looking into how we can best

587
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,869
help our patients, and particularly those

588
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,539
with present with complexity

589
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,309
including chronic pain, but not just by,

590
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:23,447
you know, the broad sort of area,
persistent physical symptoms,

591
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:26,050
you know, those that tend to sort of

592
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,553
go around, see different practitioners,

593
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:34,592
look for a solution to that problem,
try to know what's going on and,

594
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:37,862
you know, we tend to sort of see them in
practice and struggle at times.

595
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,664
If we use

596
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,799
a very reductionist approach

597
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:44,802
to practice,
which is do a manual intervention

598
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:48,472
and hope for the best, you know,
that's that's far from, you know,

599
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,743
from what is best practice
these days, what these patients get.

600
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:53,611
And also.

601
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,192
Can you say here, I.

602
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,561
Just lost George for an audio.

603
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,030
I was just going to ask. Me to. OK,

604
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:17,702
I can pick up a bit from

605
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:19,070
there.

606
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,540
There's been a kind of a problem
with osteopathic theory

607
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,809
over the years, which George is

608
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:30,248
hinting at around the reductionistic bio

609
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,951
biomechanical model.

610
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:37,822
And when it comes to complexity,
those sorts of traditional ways

611
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:41,759
of looking at people's chronic symptoms

612
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,795
leave something to be

613
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,432
well, they they're not

614
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:51,669
really, really things missing.

615
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,038
We we're realizing using

616
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,509
if we draw from other disciplines
we can see that

617
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:01,579
there's potentially a much better way
to describe

618
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,050
why people have these kind
of chronic type symptoms.

619
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:10,288
And I I came into this
a bit like Lucas with some

620
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,492
been quite surprised in practice
about how people react to treatment.

621
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,762
And I think we have a

622
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:20,898
it's almost a kind

623
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:24,001
of a tacit sort of thing
within the profession.

624
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:27,271
We we treat people
with emotional disturbance

625
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:29,807
but we don't actually confront it.

626
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,843
And so this conceptual framework

627
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:35,446
is actually starting
to redress the balance

628
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,816
which I think is really, really cool

629
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,819
and try to understand
why is it people react?

630
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,423
I think me this notion of prediction

631
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,992
areas is kind of an interesting one.

632
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,962
I, I came into it a long time ago
looking at it

633
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:55,533
from a psychodynamic point of view
and things could have reactions

634
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,736
but I think what we're moving
towards is trying to come up

635
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,638
with a bit more of a unified theory.

636
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:04,442
And that's why
I think the concepts of active

637
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:07,011
inference and activism
are actually starting to help.

638
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:10,281
But also at the
participatory sense, making

639
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:14,285
movement also adds a lot to

640
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:17,188
how we can start to understand it.

641
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,958
I know Luke has mentioned
we haven't talked about the therapeutic

642
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:24,562
relationship, but we are
there are other papers in the pipeline.

643
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,598
What about raising my voice

644
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,504
would so the summary for you, George

645
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,711
very interesting.

646
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,713
Yes, yes. Thank you, George.

647
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:44,281
No, no, no.

648
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:48,686
I think, Robert, these are brilliant
children summarizing everything.

649
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:54,258
So you all the challenges
and the reasons why we got interested

650
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,927
into exploring a different kind of way

651
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,764
of looking at things.

652
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,801
Francesco or Torsten,
would you like to add anything?

653
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:05,703
Otherwise, anyone in the live chat

654
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,072
is welcome to add a question
and I have some questions to

655
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:14,712
yes. Daniel so one other viewpoint
that I cannot at this point.

656
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:18,315
You stated from previous research
that actually we published looking at the

657
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:21,485
and using ephemera but also other

658
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,721
neuroscience, you know,

659
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,457
scientific tools like for example,
Time Will Comes.

660
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:31,729
We ended up understanding
or exploring the fact that actually

661
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:36,767
the brain is starting
to react to specific or general touch

662
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:41,272
in a kind of similar but different way.

663
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:44,375
So and these actually creates

664
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,578
a kind of a question,
a research question around.
