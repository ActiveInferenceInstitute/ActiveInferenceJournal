with embodiment

28
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,400
and that was what my phd was on

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,000
embodiment within the therapeutic

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,560
relationship

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,200
uh mainly um

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,240
interest in uh discovering the uh how

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,439
the brain

38
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,000
works uh in relation to touch in

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,759
relation to the

40
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,320
effect of touch

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,240
based on the different

42
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,840
type of

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,280
stimuli

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,960
that the the body received

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,759
hi uh i'm george ester jestervilles i'm

main interest is on predictive

50
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,600
processing active entrance touch and

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,720

um yeah we have uh the opportunity

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,440
thanks again for the active appearance

70
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,040
lab for the invitation it's it's a

71
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,280
pleasure to be here

72
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,680
we have the opportunity to present a

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,920
paper that we have recently published in

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,920
frontiers in psychology in the section

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,519
health psychology

76
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,440
the research topic

77
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,040
called an activism and active appearance

78
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,879
in the therapeutic alliance

79
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,120
and the paper is entitled osteopathy and

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,440
mental health and embodied predictive

81
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
and introspective framework

82
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,000
and um yeah without further ado i think

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,720
let's let's dive right into it

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,200
um a little introduction on on why these

85
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
things might be interesting

86
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,360
um

87
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,120
we have a

88
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,840
globally a very high prevalence and a

89
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,000
burden but also comorbidity between

90
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,519
musculoskeletal

91
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,720
and uh mental health disorders so to put

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,200
this in perspective about uh one billion

93
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,959
prevalent cases of mental disorders have

94
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,840
been reported in

95
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,560
2017 while about 1.3 billion prevalent

96
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,080
cases have been reported of

97
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,360
musculoskeletal disorders in 2017. so

98
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,959
together these uh two broad spectrum of

99
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,000
disorders are um very prevalent but also

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,920
burdensome so

101
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,280
together both both conditions contribute

102
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,720
um to

103
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,720
other main contributors to to work by

104
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,560
disability

105
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
but um musculoskeletal mental disorders

106
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,280
also highly co-morbid which means for

107
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,360
example that anxiety depression are

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,519
frequently core core with chronic and

109
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,358
often musculoskeletal pain conditions

110
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,798
and vice versa

111
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,079
so

112
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,080
for example depressive symptoms are

113
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,320
quite prevalent and

114
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,040
pain suffers and pain symptoms are also

115
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,800
quite prevalent in individuals with

116
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
depression

117
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
um so

118
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,680
these uh this data kind of outlines in a

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
need to to integrate physical and mental

120
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,360
health care services in our opinion but

121
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,199
also in the opinion of

122
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,479
many research papers in the literature

123
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,360
so um especially multidisciplinary

124
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,280
collaborations between most skeleton and

125
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,759
psychological healthcare specialists

126
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,759
have been called for

127
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,600
but on the other hand there have also

128
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,919
been some disease classifications that

129
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,400
have been proposed to to combine

130
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,160
physical and mental health

131
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,280
um

132
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,120
and propose classifications that are

133
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,560
neither purely somatic nor julian mental

134
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,680
so

135
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,360
we believe that there is this need to

136
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,600
integrate these kind of

137
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
approaches

138
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,520
and we like to propose osteopathy to be

139
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,400
to be one of these approaches

140
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,199
and

141
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,360
osteopathy for those who don't know is

142
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,680
generally used primarily to treat

143
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,560
musculoskeletal disorders like back pain

144
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,360
but

145
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,199
um it is also

146
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,199
uh has recently been proposed to benefit

147
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,360
psychosocial factors in particular in

148
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,840
in patient populations with persistent

149
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,520
pain

150
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,960
and

151
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,800
there have also there was also some

152
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,639
research that has been conducted from

153
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,120
hillary abbey and colleagues showing

154
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,960
some positive outcomes

155
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,199
of combined treatment as a

156
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,440
combined osteopathy and combined

157
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,000
psychological informed strategies

158
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,479
uh showing positive results

159
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,639
so there are only a few attempts to to

160
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,000
investigate the effectiveness of

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,479
osteopathy in the field of mental health

162
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,720
and there are only a few approaches

163
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,639
being developed

164
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,680
to treat or to engage with mental health

165
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,400
so

166
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,240
based on this background we proposed um

167
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,400
we tried to propose a framework on how

168
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,960
to move forward and how to research the

169
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,720
putative effects of osteopathy in this

170
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,840
field

171
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,759
and we do so by drawing together um

172
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,840
from the research fields of embodied

173
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,400
cognition predictive coding but also

174
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,479
interception and osteopathy

175
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,960
and we like to propose in the end our

176
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,720
framework which is an embodied

177
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,960
predictive and introspective remote

178
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
and if you look on the right hand side

179
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,440
figure one this is kind of our

180
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,240
background put together and to simplify

181
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,800
body cognition kind of highlights the

182
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,560
role of the body and cognition and the

183
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,840
mental health

184
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,800
and these process processes are likely

185
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,280
underpinned by predictive coding

186
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,479
processes

187
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,479
so

188
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,800
furthermore our access point

189
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,960
we discuss interception as an access

190
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,000
point and therapeutic access point to to

191
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,479
affect these processes and we argue that

192
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,960
osteopathy might might be an approach to

193
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,080
to realize this aim

194
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,319
so let's have a look at the

195
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,840
background we start with the first

196
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,520
research field which is

197
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
embodied cognition

198
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,880
and

199
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,440
generally embodied embodiment is an

200
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,199
interdisciplinary field of research

201
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,280
which spans disciplines

202
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,520
including philosophy but also psychology

203
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,080
psychiatry and neuroscience

204
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,319
and in general these theories of

205
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,479
embodiment argue that the cognition and

206
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,599
emotion are both dependent on embedded

207
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,680
embodied simulations

208
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,639
so

209
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,479
they argue that body and mind are

210
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,720
inseparable in producing cognition and

211
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,199
that the non-neural body

212
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,039
might both constrain and enable

213
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,560
cognition

214
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,319
but notably there are stronger and

215
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,280
weaker versions of embodiment

216
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,120
some argue that the body might

217
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,879
contribute to

218
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,120
cognitive processes while

219
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,919
other

220
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,720
versions argue that it might constitute

221
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,680
cognitive processes

222
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,520
so to

223
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,560
get a little bit more detail involved

224
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,240
theories of embodiment argue that

225
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,400
cognition and emotion are based upon

226
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,800
reinstatements of perception so this is

227
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,039
relating to both external extra

228
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,279
receptive and inter meaning interceptive

229
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,640
sensory states

230
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,958
but also to action which relates to

231
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,200
proprioceptive motor states

232
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,000
and these perceptions produce

233
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,480
embodied or sensory motor simulations

234
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,800
which of previous experiences in one's

235
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,600
self so this is a

236
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,480
kind of explanation of embodiment

237
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,360
and

238
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,880
this perspective is quite interesting

239
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,399
because it might revise our

240
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,200
brain-centered view of cognition by

241
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,240
acknowledging that these processes are

242
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,959
not simply limited to neural events in

243
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,279
the brain but also cut across the brain

244
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,760
body and world divisions and should be

245
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,399
also studied accordingly

246
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,839
and there are different kinds of

247
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,160
commitment to the embodied

248
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,200
theories

249
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,320
and and activism is an interesting

250
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
aspect or linked concept that i want to

251
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,200
to go into detail a little bit further

252
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,160
and an activism proposes that cognition

253
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,600
emerges from the dynamic interaction of

254
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,080
brain body and also environment so um

255
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,839
most of you might have heard about the

256
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,959
4e cognition um which is

257
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,000
that cognition is all together embodied

258
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,880
embedded and acted extended but also

259
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
ecological

260
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,279
and um we are or at this argument that

261
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,640
cognition is an

262
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,560
embodied embedded enacted extended and

263
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,080
ecological

264
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,120
process

265
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,560
of sense making

266
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,959
through a body in an environment so this

267
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,680
is an evaluate evaluative interaction of

268
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,399
an organism and its environment

269
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,000
so in detail these four or five e's mean

270
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,880
that

271
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,200
body cognition is enabled through and

272
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,519
also constrained by the non-neural body

273
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,760
embedded means that cognition depends on

274
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,160
the environmental context

275
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,560
as the organism is situated within the

276
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,920
environment

277
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,959
and enacted means that cognition is for

278
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,200
action and depends on the interaction of

279
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,880
the embodied organism with the

280
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,079
environment

281
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,079
and extended means that cognition

282
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,160
extends beyond the brain and body into

283
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,480
the environment the most notable example

284
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,959
might be your smartphone

285
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,800
and lastly ecological means that

286
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,560
cognition depends on the environmental

287
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,120
affordances for for action

288
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,440
and all together this might

289
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,640
constitute

290
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,000
an activism

291
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,160
with a 5e perspective

292
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,399
so combining these perspectives

293
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,640
of embodied and active

294
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,000
inactivism

295
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,160
both mental and physical health

296
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,600
conditions for example pain and

297
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,800
depression

298
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,279
um are associated with alterate

299
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,760
interaction with an altered interaction

300
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,399
of the organism within with with the

301
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,200
environment through its embodiment

302
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,440
so it's the three-part interaction of

303
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,079
brain body and environment

304
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,720
so to sum this up embodiment and

305
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,560
activism emphasized the interaction of

306
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,399
brain body and environment in

307
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,360
understanding the mind and cognition

308
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,600
and

309
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,680
to understand the the processes of the

310
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,920
brain in a little bit more detail we

311
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,680
have to turn to another field of

312
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
research which is the next part of the

313
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,320
background this is predictive coding

314
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,640
and i believe that predictive coding is

315
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,279
a

316
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,200
topic most of the listeners are more

317
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,360
familiar with than us but i try to

318
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,880
summarize them anyway

319
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,800
so predictive processing

320
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,600
is a theoretical framework with growing

321
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,200
influence in the field of cognitive

322
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,160
science

323
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,839
and it is

324
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,480
closely related but also distant uh

325
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,560
distinct from the free energy principle

326
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,959
asian brain hypothesis and active

327
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,800
inference so i will summarize all of

328
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,079
them closely

329
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,360
shortly

330
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,079
so

331
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,399
the free energy principle proposes that

332
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,480
living systems resist the tendency to

333
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,360
disorder or another words

334
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,760
remain in thermodynamic non-equilibrium

335
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,959
steady states

336
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,200
and they do so by restricting themselves

337
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,680
to a limited number of states

338
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,920
through the minimization of free energy

339
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,000
and in in this instance free energy is

340
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,079
defined as the difference between a

341
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,040
system's predicted and actual states

342
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,200
and this can be minimized using both

343
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,120
perception and action

344
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,360
and perception it is minimized by

345
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,120
updating the prediction

346
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,079
that is made from the generated model

347
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,240
based on the sensation

348
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,560
and action in turn

349
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,279
is changing the sensation through action

350
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,959
to match with the prediction so it's

351
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,920
like a self-fulfilling prophecy

352
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,920
and the bayesian brain hypothesis

353
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,240
proposes that brains make predictions

354
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,959
about the causes of extra receptive

355
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,880
interceptive but also proprioceptive

356
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,079
sensations

357
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,560
um using both the current sensory input

358
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,480
but also prior beliefs based on the

359
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
generated model

360
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,920
and in general

361
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,639
the confidence or precision one has

362
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,120
uh in the belief or the prior

363
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,000
um

364
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,880
and the sensory input or the likelihood

365
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,959
will determine how much the perception

366
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,880
will in the end shift towards the

367
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,240
expectation

368
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,959
so

369
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,560
um

370
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,240
in general a gap between prior and

371
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,079
likelihood is called a prediction error

372
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,839
or free energy

373
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,639
and

374
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,880
while a system is minimizing prediction

375
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,279
error or free energy or surprise or

376
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,199
entropy that is also maximizing the

377
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,240
evidence for its own model of the world

378
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,079
and this is the bargaining brain

379
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,880
hypothesis is relating to behavior so

380
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,720
predictive coding is putting this into a

381
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,360
neural perspective and proposes that

382
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,959
there are descending top-down

383
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,040
predictions that are

384
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,120
conveyed from higher cortical levels

385
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,959
down to lower cortical levels

386
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,199
where they are compared to

387
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,920
us and bottom-up sensory information

388
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,279
so

389
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,920
from this perspective information only

390
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,959
goes up the cortical hierarchy and if a

391
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,800
mismatch between the predicted and

392
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,560
actual information occurs which is terms

393
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,079
of prediction error

394
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,480
and otherwise top-down predictions

395
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,079
constantly explain away

396
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,519
bottom sensory information

397
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:40,800
so

398
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,639
then there's active imperance which

399
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,480
proposes that the brain

400
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,040
actively modifies its input to confirm

401
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,560
prior expectations

402
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,800
and this is an inactive and also

403
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,399
selective sampling of sensory

404
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,040
information in the world through action

405
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,920
so

406
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
prediction errors can be minimized we've

407
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,920
talked about it a little bit through

408
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,440
perceptual influence and active

409
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,519
endurance uh perceptive appearance

410
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,760
meaning revising the generated model

411
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,519
based on the prediction errors and

412
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,959
active inference

413
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,440
acting on the world to to generate a

414
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
state that is predicted by the

415
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,600
generative one

416
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,920
and to bring all of this together within

417
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,399
the physical mental health condition

418
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,079
to understand the physical and mental

419
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,079
health conditions

420
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,160
it might be an altered weighting of

421
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,000
prior beliefs and sensory information

422
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,240
which gives rise to physical mental

423
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,519
health conditions

424
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,360
so for example physical health

425
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,800
conditions

426
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,040
prior beliefs are likely overweighted

427
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,880
relative to sensory information which

428
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,800
means i follow too much prediction uh

429
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,240
precision

430
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,240
which then predicts symptoms

431
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,639
consequently experienced

432
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,600
and

433
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,160
this might also lead to heightened

434
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,639
prediction of pain even towards harmless

435
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,959
sensations so that harmless sensations

436
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,440
might be perceived as painful

437
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,000
and on the other hand mental health

438
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
conditions

439
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,040
um both

440
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,519
prior beliefs might be overly precise

441
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,959
compare in comparison to sensory

442
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,120
information or vice versa

443
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,040
and so the first one is depression and

444
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,519
the second one in psychosis

445
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,959
and

446
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,320
yes

447
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,279
so

448
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,480
one point that was quite

449
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
interesting is that chronic pain and

450
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,240
depression which we are quite interested

451
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,560
in are particularly linked to false

452
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,240
experiences of interception there's a

453
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,480
little literature about this so that's

454
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,720
this is our next research topic that we

455
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,360
want to uh to combine with the other

456
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,720
ones

457
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,440
um so what is interception

458
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,199
um kaiser and i

459
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,120
have defined interception as

460
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,519
the process by which the nervous system

461
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,480
senses

462
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,639
interprets and integrates signals

463
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,720
originating from within the body so it's

464
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,279
all information from within our own body

465
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,440
and this provides uh some kind of

466
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,920
embodied sensory experience

467
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,480
um which is absolutely necessary for the

468
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,839
adaptive interaction with the

469
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,120
environment

470
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,959
so

471
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,280
an interesting aspect is that the active

472
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,880
interference model was also applied to

473
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,959
interception which is termed

474
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,720
interceptive appearance

475
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,799
and it proposes that interceptive

476
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,199
experiences result from interferences

477
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,919
about the hidden causes of this sensory

478
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,839
information

479
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,280
so to put this

480
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,199
into the neural perspective

481
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,000
uh top-down interceptive predictions are

482
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,720
compared with bottom-up intercept

483
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,799
interceptive information most likely in

484
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,919
the insula

485
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,919
and the mismatch between both then

486
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,320
results in a prediction error

487
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,520
which is minimized depending on the

488
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,679
on the precision

489
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,840
by either perceptual inference or active

490
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,120
interference so

491
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
receptor inference means revising the

492
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,440
top-down interceptive predictions and

493
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,360
active impedance means then modifying

494
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,280
the bottom-up interceptive information

495
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,400
to convey with a prediction

496
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,880
and interestingly uh annual seth has

497
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,280
proposed that an emotion can also be

498
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,840
reviewed as interceptive influence

499
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,000
because interceptive prediction errors

500
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
are used to and fear emotional states

501
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,120
so to

502
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,640
connect this to physical and mental

503
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,880
health conditions um

504
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,280
deficits in interceptive processing for

505
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,640
example uh low interceptive accuracy

506
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,720
um might be associated with both

507
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
physical and mental health conditions

508
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,640
like chronic pain and comorbid

509
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,840
depression

510
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,240
um however there

511
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,600
is

512
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,799
um

513
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,400
it is not clear

514
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,200
how

515
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,000
that every disorder in every individual

516
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,679
might behave the same in this way i

517
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,240
think there are

518
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
differences so

519
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,919
um

520
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,919
so some disorders in individuals would

521
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,240
likely benefit from reducing overly

522
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,880
precise interceptive predictions

523
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,360
for example roaring beliefs about real

524
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,919
but indeed harmless sensations

525
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,000
while other patients might might reduce

526
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,840
overly precise and receptive information

527
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,799
which is

528
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,960
for example utilizary sensations that

529
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,039
are maintained that maintain roaring

530
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,520
beliefs so um there are both

531
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,200
possibilities

532
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,840
so let's talk about our approach on uh

533
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,320
how to influence to interceptive

534
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,840
information and this is osteopathy we

535
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,320
are all osteopaths uh the authors on

536
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,440
this paper

537
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,320
so a few words about osteopathy

538
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,039
osteopathy combines hands-on manual

539
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,120
approaches with

540
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,960
hands-off patient management approaches

541
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,880
so we use touch and manipulation as

542
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,720
hands-on which is informed of

543
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
sympathetic models of care so our

544
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,080
clinical reasoning

545
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,080
and hands-off patient-managed approaches

546
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,240
involve patient education psychological

547
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,799
support lifestyle advice but also

548
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,440
self-management solutions and these are

549
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,280
informed of course by osteopathic

550
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,720
principles

551
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,240
but notably both might utilize top-down

552
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,080
and bottom-up dynamics between

553
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,000
peripheral tissues and the brain

554
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,960
um

555
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,760
yes

556
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,559
so

557
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,720
in general osteopathy is applied to

558
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,640
treat a range of clinical conditions but

559
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,720
an emphasis is given on chronic pain

560
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,799
conditions in particular musculoskeletal

561
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,880
disorders like back pain

562
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,080
and

563
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
philosophically osteopathy has

564
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,480
emphasized the unity and interaction of

565
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
body mind and soul for

566
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,840
quite some time

567
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,559
and it has also been proposed that

568
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,880
it might benefit psychological outcomes

569
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,480
especially in chronic pain patients but

570
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,280
this needs some further research

571
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,840
and um

572
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
francesco and colleagues also proposed

573
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,400
that uh osteopathic treatment might

574
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,720
influence interceptive processing in a

575
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,400
concept paper they published in i think

576
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,080
2016

577
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,120
and i went on to to conduct some primary

578
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,039
research showing that um

579
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,600
osteopathy indeed increases intraceptive

580
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,080
accuracy but also decreases uh the bulge

581
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,320
response of brain correlates of

582
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,120
interception in patients with chronic

583
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,720
low back pain

584
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,440
so

585
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,919
um they do so probably by the

586
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,960
stimulation of afferent c tactile fibers

587
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,120
which communicate interceptive and

588
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,280
effective dimensions of touch

589
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,679
so this could be relevant to both

590
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,520
physical and mental health conditions

591
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
that involve interceptive difficulties

592
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,440
which are for example chronic pain and

593
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,760
also depression

594
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,320
so this is our background and i think it

595
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,400
leads up to to the framework we like to

596
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,679
present

597
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,880
and the framework bridges all of these

598
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,120
fields of research and

599
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,440
it is an embodied interceptive but also

600
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,360
predictive framework

601
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,799
and

602
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,520
the basic basis is that both physical

603
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,400
and mental

604
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,720
health symptoms may result from altered

605
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
precision waiting between interceptive

606
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,840
predictions

607
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,120
and intercepted input so we argue that

608
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,440
literature argus that um either too much

609
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,120
precision is further to the prior which

610
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,440
is an overly precise prediction

611
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,600
on um or too little precision is

612
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,360
referred to the likelihood which is an

613
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,000
imprecise prediction error

614
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,919
so

615
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,720
arguably chronic pain and depression

616
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,880
are mainly linked to the overweighting

617
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,640
of priors

618
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,679
so um these beliefs likely predict

619
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,760
painful and depressive states even if

620
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
the actual interceptive information is

621
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,200
harmless

622
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,840
and they do so due to past experiences

623
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,480
and they likely make these states come

624
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,799
true through active interference

625
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,200
so the expected symptoms might be

626
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
generated through action to confirm the

627
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,400
prediction

628
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,559
and in order to update these prior

629
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,120
release and reduce the active influence

630
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,240
of pain and and depressed states

631
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,760
it is likely that surprising

632
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,480
interceptive input needs to be provided

633
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,720
and to increase first of all the weight

634
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,039
of the likelihood but also to generate

635
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,039
prediction errors that can revise the

636
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:55,919
belief

637
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,919
issuing the predictions and thus

638
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,200
osteopaths

639
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,799
likely need to foster perceptual

640
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,760
inference so actual information is used

641
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,600
in perceptual inference to update the

642
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,360
prediction and also the perception of

643
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,720
these symptoms

644
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,559
and we have a look at figure two in a

645
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,000
moment

646
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
so um

647
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,640
this uh there's a paper by far

648
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,760
from 2015 which which has argued that

649
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,679
contemplative practices may alter

650
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,520
interceptive processing by shifting

651
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,440
regulatory habits from active to

652
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,000
perceptual inference and i will we

653
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,240
believe that that osteopathy does the

654
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,360
same

655
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,559
so

656
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,960
if we have a look at our main figure

657
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,559
here um we propose that

658
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,880
we see a patient in red lying on the

659
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,159
treatment table

660
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,960
imagine this patient has um

661
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,520
chronic pain with comorbid depression

662
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,760
and he's lying there and the osteopath

663
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,600
provides some touch-based interventions

664
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,799
to the symptomatic area in this

665
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,360
this image the abdomen

666
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,320
and

667
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,159
we argue that

668
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,480
the belief or the prayer of the patient

669
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,640
is likely to predict physical and mental

670
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,480
states that are associated with pain and

671
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,960
depression because uh to be the likely

672
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,799
likely cause for uncertain information

673
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:11,600
and

674
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,440
this is the the overweighting of the

675
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,799
prior

676
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,919
but

677
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,679
if we provide some treatment

678
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,440
interventions to the patient

679
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,200
the sensory input

680
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,279
is not linked to these physically mental

681
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,559
states

682
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,799
which is surprising but osteopathic

683
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,000
treatment

684
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,080
often does not involve pain but is quite

685
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,240
pleasant if you if you touch a patient

686
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,799
so this is a surprising mismatch of

687
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,799
course to the patients to the patient

688
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,559
because the expected and the actual

689
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,640
information do not match

690
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,360
and

691
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,240
thus

692
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,760
generate an interceptive prediction

693
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,120
error

694
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,840
so these addiction errors need to be

695
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,840
minimized and they can be minimized

696
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,679
using active or perceptual inference and

697
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,799
in chronic pain we argue that

698
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,039
high precision is afforded to the belief

699
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,120
to the prior and low precision is

700
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,559
further to the sensory information and

701
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,960
the likelihood so the first process that

702
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,159
needs to be engaged is active

703
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,600
interference

704
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,720
um which likely produces the symptoms

705
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,039
uh that are resembling the predicted

706
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,799
states so

707
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,400
likely the autonomic nervous system is

708
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,520
engaged

709
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,640
to produce sensations that

710
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,520
resemble the expected

711
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,840
painful and depressive feeling

712
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,600
so uh however we are in a healthcare

713
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,360
context in osteopathic treatment so the

714
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,600
patient might also be declining uh

715
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,799
declined to

716
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,159
uh to think that this is a health

717
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,360
promoting intervention so um this is not

718
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,840
um

719
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,720
not uh

720
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,760
this is contradictory with the uh

721
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,120
with a prediction

722
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,760
so um it's active influence might not be

723
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,840
sufficiently to to

724
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,320
reduce and explain the interceptive

725
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,799
prediction errors so consequently we

726
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,400
argue that perceptual appearances

727
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,159
processes might be engaged

728
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,559
um to update then the belief and the

729
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,480
prior based on the likelihood so the

730
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,159
sensory information provided posted by

731
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,320
the osteopath might update the belief by

732
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,440
the patient

733
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,360
and thereby revising the generative

734
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,120
model holding the belief and issuing the

735
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,480
prediction

736
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,279
so

737
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,039
um we argue that these are the processes

738
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,919
that underpin osteopathic treatment um

739
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,400
in these kind of patients and especially

740
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,360
when an emotional reaction and treatment

741
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,480
develops

742
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,200
so um

743
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,279
yeah and in essence we argue that uh

744
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,200
belief and the prediction of physical

745
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,159
and mental

746
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,840
states that are associated with pain and

747
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,320
depression are updated

748
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,360
through

749
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,360
these interventions so the the

750
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,720
persistent and noisy interceptive

751
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,880
additions errors which maintain these

752
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,039
symptoms through active interference

753
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,200
might be replaced with surprising and

754
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,440
precise interceptive prediction errors

755
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,039
to alleviate the symptoms through

756
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,520
receptor computers

757
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,880
so this is

758
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,520
in a nutshell our framework

759
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,919
and we also of course need to discuss

760
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,919
this framework and have a look at some

761
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,480
implications also limitations

762
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,600
so in general i like to emphasize that

763
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,520
this theoretical framework is a

764
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,440
theoretical framework and therefore

765
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,520
requires experimental scrutiny for

766
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,080
verification or falsification so future

767
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,360
research

768
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,200
particularly needs to explore if

769
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,240
osteopathic treatment indeed

770
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,080
alleviates physical and mental symptoms

771
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,799
in this patient population also if it

772
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,120
actually increases interceptive accuracy

773
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,640
in this population

774
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,960
and likely also decreases allostatic

775
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,720
load and modulates autonomic nervous

776
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,480
system activity so there are a few

777
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,039
measurement tools we can use for that

778
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,440
and um other limitations

779
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,039
include

780
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:45,840
the

781
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,000
disregard of complexity both of the

782
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,440
health conditions but also of the

783
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,159
therapeutic approaches so osteopathy and

784
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,480
mental and depression and

785
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,159
chronic pain are all very complex

786
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,240
conditions and we have simplified them

787
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,919
like extremely so we overlooked

788
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,440
environmental factors

789
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,520
and we didn't

790
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,799
go into

791
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,159
explaining the patient therapist

792
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,440
relationship in detail as well but this

793
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,720
framework should be understood in this

794
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,399
context so it should be understood in a

795
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,200
person-centered context

796
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,200
and future studies might

797
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,960
also

798
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,320
have a look at

799
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,039
why manual treatment of peripheral

800
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,679
tissues sometimes leads to autonomic and

801
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:28,960
emotional

802
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,960
responses and i think this is the basic

803
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,120
of why i was so interested in this

804
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
research and these theories because in

805
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,840
practice that all frequently engaged

806
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,039
patients

807
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,799
which responded quite emotionally to

808
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,240
touch and um fake quite better after so

809
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,480
i wanted to to understand how this might

810
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,679
happen

811
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,600
so based on our hypothesis you can see

812
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,960
in figure

813
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,720
3 panel 8

814
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,600
that

815
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,679
the therapeutic input

816
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:56,880
that is

817
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,520
provided during treatment may contradict

818
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,200
the predicted state of pain and

819
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,240
depression

820
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,080
and produce an interceptive prediction

821
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,039
error

822
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,279
which is used to infer emotional states

823
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,600
and need to minimize minimize by active

824
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,080
influence harvest perceptive and what

825
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,919
you can see in nla is that the initial

826
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,080
active influence is quite

827
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,279
quick and sharp and we have seen or i've

828
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,320
seen

829
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,919
my colleagues as well from experience

830
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,960
that often if patients display emotional

831
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,640
responses during treatment

832
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,240
they firstly experienced some

833
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,799
sympathetic activity like sweating and

834
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,520
muscle tightness combined with emotional

835
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,440
distress for example

836
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,720
starting to cry

837
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,360
but these initial reactions

838
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,840
frequently

839
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,080
are replaced with

840
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,880
very

841
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,240
parasympathetic activity so the

842
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
breathing goes down and the patient

843
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,200
starts to relax and emotional calmness

844
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,080
starts to set in and i believe this is

845
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,679
quite well explainable with the

846
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,679
framework we have provided here because

847
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,200
an active interference might be the

848
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,679
first way to engage

849
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,520
in minimizing these prediction errors

850
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,440
and perceptive influence might be the

851
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,159
second and more sustainable way of

852
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,799
minimizing these predictions

853
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,159
so

854
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,640
lastly you can see on panel b

855
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,919
another

856
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,679
idea which might come from this

857
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,880
framework and this is the ground for

858
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,919
multidisciplinary collaborations in the

859
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,880
treatment of mental and physical

860
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,240
disorders

861
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,480
so we propose a kind of

862
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,320
integrative interceptive exposure

863
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,840
therapy in which

864
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,840
both physical but also mental health

865
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,039
specialists can come together and

866
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,039
work in a multi-disciplinary but also

867
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,279
person-centered care approach and the

868
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,760
idea is if you can see on the left-hand

869
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,200
side here is that

870
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,600
mindfulness practices

871
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,919
likely work top down uh helping the

872
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,919
patient to attend to the sensation that

873
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,919
he or she is experiencing

874
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,840
um but also

875
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,440
affecting the sensory information like

876
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,000
osteopathy working bottom up also

877
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,640
affecting the sensory information by

878
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,080
likely producing a sensation itself and

879
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
psychotherapy is slightly toward the top

880
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,120
down

881
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,360
to help identify and

882
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,399
also

883
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,480
reflect on the sensation and likely

884
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,640
works on

885
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,960
works on the prior the belief

886
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,279
directly and not through the sensory

887
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,799
information

888
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,000
so um these are a few few future

889
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,200
research ideas and now we can conclude

890
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,799
this presentation

891
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,519
and to put it all together

892
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,240
this hypothesis and theory article

893
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,000
proposes the embodied predictive and

894
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,840
interests of the framework

895
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,600
and it does so to reason and research

896
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,480
the effect of osteopathic treatment um

897
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,640
hesitatively on comodo psychological

898
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,960
factors in patients with persistent

899
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,880
physical conditions

900
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,720
and

901
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,880
one of the basic ideas is that

902
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,159
persistent physical and mental

903
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,440
conditions like chronic pain and

904
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,000
depression

905
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,559
may be underlined by first overly

906
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,120
precise interceptive predictions meaning

907
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,640
that

908
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,240
the symptom congruent information is

909
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,679
expected

910
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,440
and second imprecise interceptive

911
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,600
prediction errors meaning that

912
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,760
symptom incongruent information is not

913
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,360
sensed

914
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,720
so osteopathic treatment may provide

915
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,480
uncertain and surprising interceptive

916
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,960
information to the bodily area that is

917
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,880
associated with the physical and also

918
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,679
comorbid mental symptoms resulting in

919
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,200
interceptive prediction errors that

920
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,840
first engage active impedance processes

921
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,039
which lead to

922
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,519
initial autonomic activity resembling

923
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,519
the predicted symptoms

924
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,960
and this is

925
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,039
because it is the most likely cause of

926
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,279
uncertain interceptive information due

927
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,600
to the past experiences of the patient

928
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,240
and afterwards due to the contextual

929
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,720
factors uh the patient likely engages

930
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
perceptual appearance processes that

931
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,960
then update the maladaptive intercept

932
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,120
predictions based on

933
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,200
the actual interceptive information

934
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,840
and positivity might also

935
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,919
actually improve the ability to attend

936
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,360
to actual intercepted information

937
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,600
so in a nutshell persistent and noisy

938
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,519
interceptive prediction errors that

939
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,519
maintain the symptoms are likely

940
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,679
replaced with surprising and precise and

941
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,600
receptive prediction errors that

942
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,240
arguably alleviate the sentence

943
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,960
and in this way treatment might reduce

944
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,519
the belief about and also the prediction

945
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,279
of physical emitted states that are

946
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,480
associated with chronic pain and

947
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,399
comorbid depression

948
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,159
and we are currently also at the

949
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,679
osteopathic research institute

950
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,159
conducting research into

951
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,559
these approaches so thorson has also

952
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,600
joined us today um has developed

953
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,000
an approach to psychosomatic osteopathy

954
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,159
and we are currently having a look on

955
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,600
how these techniques might influence

956
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,200
stress levels and healthy participants

957
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,440
but also patients with chronic attention

958
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,799
type headaches so chronic

959
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,640
musculoskeletal disorders

960
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,000
so maybe there's

961
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,720
some things to follow in the future so

962
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,359
that's it thank you very much for your

963
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,199
attention i'm really looking forward to

964
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,918
the discussion and to engaging uh robert

965
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,239
george and francesco um

966
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,399
and here are the references i think i

967
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,199
scrolled through them shortly and if

968
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,839
someone's interested i think they can

969
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,679
get the presentation said right daniel

970
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,839
yes

971
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,440
so that's it

972
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,119
thanks lucas that was an awesome

973
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,520
presentation really a lot to

974
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,520
think and talk about

975
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,119
so

976
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,918
perhaps we'll first just open it up to

977
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,440
any of the authors and colleagues here

978
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,679
please just uh jump in wherever you'd

979
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,960
like i think

980
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,359
it'd be awesome to hear about just your

981
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,359
overview or what brought you to this

982
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,119
area of research as well as anything

983
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,920
that you picked up on from this last

984
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,560
presentation

985
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,680
i think maybe i can say a few words

986
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,040
because i forgot something in the

987
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,760
beginning so um it all started with with

988
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,400
george and francesco um inviting

989
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,800
inviting uh robert and me to join a

990
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,000
research group that um tries to to

991
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,839
reconceptualize osteopathic care under

992
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,400
the active endurance framework so

993
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,040
we have a group of osteopaths from

994
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,240
europe

995
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,800
working with the influence framework and

996
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,599
there are also other papers coming

997
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,400
in

998
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,520
a special topic which is also uh has

999
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,480
been

1000
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,079
added by edited by george and francesco

1001
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,320
so there's there are other ideas coming

1002
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,760
forward in the near future

1003
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,800
i think you know one one thing that um

1004
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,800
i guess brought us into this area

1005
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,280
you know it's a sort of a way of looking

1006
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,839
into how we can best

1007
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,920
help our patients in particularly those

1008
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,720
with um you know present with complexity

1009
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,200
um including you know chronic pain but

1010
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,800
not just running by

1011
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,200
uh you know the the broad sort of uh

1012
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,520
area of persistent physical symptoms you

1013
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,040
know those that

1014
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,359
tend to sort of um go around see

1015
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,160
different practitioners um

1016
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,400
look for a solution to their problem try

1017
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,240
to know what's going on

1018
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,839
and you know we tend to sort of seat

1019
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,839
them in practice and struggle at times

1020
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,640
if we use um you know a very

1021
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,720
reductionist approach to practice which

1022
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,520
is do a manual intervention and hope for

1023
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,839
the best you know that's that's far from

1024
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,160
um you know from what is best practice

1025
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,400
this day is what this patient-centered

1026
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,520
care and also

1027
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,680
can you still here i just lost george

1028
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,599
for an audio i was just

1029
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,079
gonna ask me too okay

1030
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,800
i i can pick up a bit

1031
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,360
um

1032
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,440
[Music]

1033
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,520
there's been a kind of a problem it with

1034
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,920
osteopathic theory over the years um

1035
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,520
which george is

1036
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,280
uh hinting at around the reductionistic

1037
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,140
the bio

1038
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,760
[Music]

1039
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,920
biomechanical model

1040
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,079
and when it comes to complexity those

1041
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,480
sorts of traditional ways of looking at

1042
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,520
people's

1043
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,040
chronic

1044
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,560
symptoms

1045
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,480
um leave something to be

1046
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,680
um

1047
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,920
well they they

1048
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,000
they're not really

1049
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,359
really things missing we we're realizing

1050
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,720
using

1051
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,280
uh if we draw from other disciplines

1052
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
that we can see that there's a

1053
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,480
potentially much better way to describe

1054
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,760
why people

1055
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,079
have these kind of chronic type symptoms

1056
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,960
and um i i came into this a bit like

1057
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,040
lucas with um

1058
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,960
being quite surprised in practice about

1059
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,920
how people reacted to treatment

1060
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,839
and i think we have this um

1061
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,720
it's almost a kind of a tacit uh sort of

1062
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,880
thing within the profession that we we

1063
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,440
treat people with emotional disturbance

1064
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,040
but we don't actually

1065
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,320
up front it

1066
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,960
and so this conceptual framework is

1067
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,400
actually starting to redress the balance

1068
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,320
um which i think is really really

1069
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,560
important and trying to understand why

1070
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,240
is it people react

1071
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,000
um i think the

1072
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,800
this notion of prediction areas is um

1073
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,040
kind of an interesting one

1074
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,680
i i came into it a long time ago looking

1075
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,680
at it from a psychodynamic point of view

1076
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,160
and things called ab reactions

1077
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,079
but i think what we're moving towards is

1078
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,359
trying to come up with a bit more of a

1079
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,760
unified theory and that's why i think

1080
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,480
the

1081
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,079
concepts of

1082
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,000
active inference and activism are

1083
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,520
actually starting to help

1084
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,119
and also the participatory sense making

1085
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,119
a movement also adds a lot to

1086
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,480
how we can start to understand it

1087
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,920
i know luke has mentioned we haven't

1088
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,960
talked about the therapeutic

1089
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,040
relationship but we are

1090
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,560
there are other papers in the pipeline

1091
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,480
that we'll look at

1092
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,839
i'm losing my voice

1093
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,480
i hope that sort of did a bit of a

1094
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,839
summary for you george i mean

1095
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,400
very interesting

1096
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,599
george

1097
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,480
no no no i i think robert you know did a

1098
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,640
brilliant job in summarizing everything

1099
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,480
so you know all the challenges and the

1100
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,839
reasons why

1101
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,760
you know we we are

1102
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,839
interested in into exploring a different

1103
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:56,640
kind of

1104
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,760
way of

1105
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,720
of looking at things

1106
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,040
francesca or torsten would you like to

1107
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,200
add anything um otherwise anyone in the

1108
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,960
live chat is welcome to add a question

1109
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,280
and i have some questions too

1110
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,960
uh yes daniel so and one other um

1111
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,880
viewpoint that i cannot at this point is

1112
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,640
that from previous research that

1113
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,800
actually we published looking at the

1114
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,760
uh and using fmri but also other uh

1115
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,720
neuroscience you know scientific tools

1116
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,880
like for example thermocount

1117
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,000
um we ended up understanding or

1118
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,839
exploring the fact that actually the

1119
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,280
brain is starting to react to specific

1120
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,440
or general touch

1121
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,880
in a kind of uh similar but different

1122
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,720
way so and these actually creates a kind

1123
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,839
of a question a research question on

1124
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:48,720
where

1125
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,599
the

1126
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,880
ability of the specific manual therapies

1127
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,839
approach

1128
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,839
might intercede with a specific brain

1129
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,160
bottom-up or top-down

1130
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,599
uh in

1131
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,000
an old-style way describing the how the

1132
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
brain works because actually now we know

1133
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,240
and looking in particular in the

1134
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,800
inactivism that uh and an active

1135
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,640
influence the body the brain actually

1136
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,640
doesn't work without the with the top

1137
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,520
down or bottom up and bottom outstream

1138
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,720
so far but in a in a way we actually we

1139
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,640
ended up saying that

1140
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,280
probably uh the interaction with the

1141
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,200
body so using a kind of uh affordance

1142
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,240
and sense making so creating action

1143
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,480
into the the uh

1144
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,400
into the patient and

1145
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,640
through the action of the uh the

1146
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,280
therapeutic alliance and therefore

1147
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,720
through the uh the uh professional and

1148
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,319
the operator might create a kind of a

1149
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,800
sharing

1150
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,720
scenario or a sharing environment that

1151
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,640
when with the

1152
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,000
with the

1153
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,960
concept of predictive processing and

1154
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,839
active inference might also be explained

1155
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,440
through the markov blankets

1156
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,200
communication and markov blankets

1157
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,800
connection between the

1158
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,720
uh the the two the two elements uh so

1159
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,640
the patient and the operator that some

1160
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,880
something might happen

1161
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,520
not only through the specific activity

1162
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,560
that any type of manual therapist can do

1163
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,720
but also in within a framework of

1164
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,640
closeness between

1165
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,160
the um

1166
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,520
the the two uh the two elements indeed

1167
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,000
one of the of the early study that also

1168
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,760
lucas mentioned

1169
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,079
what actually we did was just touching

1170
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:42,800
the

1171
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,280
uh the ankles of um and a healthy

1172
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,800
patient lay down on the scan and we just

1173
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,920
change our uh mental attitude on

1174
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,920
focusing towards the hand or avoiding

1175
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,400
the attention towards the hand so like

1176
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,200
mimicking the way in which a

1177
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,160
um a manual therapist was uh paying

1178
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,119
attention to what he or she is doing

1179
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,160
through

1180
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,560
manual manual touch or

1181
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,400
just being absolutely uh away from the

1182
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,480
attention of the manuals and therefore

1183
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,960
in the specific elements of the uh of

1184
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,680
the of the research was just counting a

1185
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,520
random bit

1186
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,280
through the through the headphones so

1187
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,119
and what actually we we saw is that in

1188
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,560
in those people that were touched uh

1189
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,839
through an attention towards the hand

1190
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,880
there there was an higher activation of

1191
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,720
the insula and the infra frontal gyrus

1192
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,920
like in a way the the the perception of

1193
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,079
the patient is

1194
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,880
is before the fact that actually is

1195
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,200
conscious of something happening from an

1196
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,440
interceptive point of view within the

1197
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,560
body so and the body is saying do you

1198
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,119
know what i'm feeling something that

1199
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,000
actually i'm processing through an

1200
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,200
interceptive framework in the in the

1201
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,640
insula and at the same time i'm changing

1202
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,440
my

1203
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,560
um

1204
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,839
endos endogenous or exogenous attention

1205
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,280
based on the way in which you touch me

1206
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,560
so and therefore this creates a more

1207
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,680
complex environment in which actually we

1208
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,400
we we would like to understand better

1209
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,599
and we think that and the inactive

1210
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,880
uh approach is one of the and with all

1211
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,680
its

1212
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,880
let's say subsections and elements that

1213
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,000
might be an inter interesting way of

1214
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,079
interpreting or at least trying to read

1215
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,400
what it's happening in the complex

1216
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,440
clinical environment

1217
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,800
thank you

1218
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,760
so

1219
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,079
i'll make an observation and then ask a

1220
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,319
question so robert i really like what

1221
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,680
you said about uh being motivated

1222
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,880
from earlier on by what you saw the

1223
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,040
outcomes of treatment were and then that

1224
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,640
was kind of alluded to in what we just

1225
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,440
heard

1226
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,359
like um you could be touching someone's

1227
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,400
ankle

1228
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,319
but it's not just the ankle that might

1229
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:19,839
change maybe it's their knee but maybe

1230
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,200
it's something in their head but then

1231
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,680
maybe it's something in their

1232
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,480
organ or their brain or their mind

1233
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,520
and um

1234
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,200
that idea of like entering at the

1235
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,400
anomaly

1236
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,520
is it's very clinical like i'm not that

1237
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,359
kind of a doctor but that's kind of what

1238
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,040
i understand to be done like looking for

1239
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,119
patterns and anomalies

1240
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,040
and then it's also

1241
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,240
very at home in the realm of

1242
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,400
participatory sense making like you also

1243
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,560
address but also that's kind of active

1244
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,560
inference which is relative to a

1245
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,000
generative model of the world

1246
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,720
observations are either consistent or

1247
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,560
surprising in some way

1248
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,920
and so that was just kind of it's an

1249
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,440
interesting tie-in and i think it just

1250
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,400
speaks to how

1251
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,319
even in a qualitative or just a

1252
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:03,520
conceptual

1253
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,480
level

1254
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,400
across different domains we can like

1255
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,000
talk about active inference as well as

1256
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,359
other areas and there are concordances

1257
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,760
and it's not like one has to nest over

1258
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,079
the other there are different domains

1259
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,240
and um approaches

1260
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,119
so um robert any thoughts on that or i

1261
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,200
have other questions

1262
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,680
yeah i think um

1263
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,319
there needs to be some

1264
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,119
some kind of a dressing of

1265
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,720
um

1266
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,200
you got to you know you have

1267
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,720
a relationship between a practitioner

1268
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,000
and the patient

1269
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,560
and i think the participatory sense

1270
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,079
making

1271
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,440
can start to

1272
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,680
somehow dissolve a little bit of the the

1273
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,480
kind of normative language

1274
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,160
which

1275
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,200
has become problematic so so anomalies

1276
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,839
in the past have been

1277
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,520
dismissed as in oh you're not getting

1278
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,839
better because you're not

1279
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,040
reacting to the treatment properly

1280
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,960
whereas these types of approaches are

1281
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,560
saying oh oh

1282
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,720
there is a shared

1283
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,880
narrative and i think the narrative

1284
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,720
medicine movement is also quite

1285
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,000
important in in these ideas obviously we

1286
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,079
can't write about that as well

1287
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,520
um

1288
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,520
but it's it's it's nice i think you've

1289
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,400
picked up on that sort of

1290
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,920
multi-dimensional and

1291
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,680
crossover between different disciplines

1292
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,800
because i think that's another thing

1293
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,359
we're trying to make a big point of in

1294
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:32,640
this paper

1295
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,400
we need to reach out to other

1296
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,240
disciplines and say look

1297
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,920
we have this way of doing things but we

1298
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,839
know we're not we don't have the whole

1299
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,440
picture at all

1300
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,280
but if we can combine

1301
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,319
um

1302
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,440
with

1303
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,240
psychologists psychiatrists

1304
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,400
i mean all of all of us on the paper

1305
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,040
we've all gone outside of osteopathy to

1306
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,680
to look at other disciplines

1307
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,480
um

1308
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,920
and again that's the kind of another

1309
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,880
kind of it's like a meta kind of

1310
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,160
participatory sense-making that goes

1311
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,119
into

1312
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,400
i think what we're trying to achieve

1313
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,400
like someone will look at that figure

1314
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,880
and you all are saying hey we're the

1315
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,520
person above the table with the hands on

1316
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,920
and with medical training

1317
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,760
but then there's another part that you

1318
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,000
didn't go into detail on what would be

1319
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,040
that

1320
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,200
therapy component or the

1321
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,680
niche modification component so totally

1322
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,119
agree that the paper is like an

1323
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,599
invitation and that was really um to my

1324
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,280
question

1325
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,920
like we see in other domains and

1326
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,240
applications of active inference you

1327
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,680
reframe something that might have been

1328
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,160
perceived about like um

1329
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,359
just

1330
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:42,480
reward

1331
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,760
or

1332
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,119
a normative

1333
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,640
precision based approach like this is

1334
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,640
the reference range this you're getting

1335
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,240
your objective function is to enter that

1336
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,319
reference range and it's like a red flag

1337
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:53,359
if it's not

1338
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,880
um towards this more

1339
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,280
perhaps even customized uh

1340
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,599
reduction of

1341
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,599
uncertainty um

1342
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,240
and the body like predicting its own

1343
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,520
sensation so i just wondered what are

1344
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,280
the implications

1345
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,880
does that

1346
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,240
play a role in how the medical expert

1347
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,559
understands the scenario does it play a

1348
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:19,760
role in

1349
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,359
the patient's own understanding of

1350
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,040
what's happening just

1351
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,079
how

1352
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,240
beyond the research predictions and

1353
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,160
experiments that are being described how

1354
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,599
does this translate into a um

1355
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,800
clinical experience

1356
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,119
so one of the things uh it's quite

1357
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,640
interesting you bringing the you know

1358
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,520
the concept of nature construction um on

1359
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,040
the other paper that we have in the

1360
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,760
pipeline where we explore we actually

1361
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,680
argue that australia osteopathic care is

1362
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,000
a kind of a effective inference

1363
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,880
uh

1364
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,280
you know an argument around you know the

1365
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,960
construction of you know a niche which

1366
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,079
can be a diet uh in the case in most

1367
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,480
adult interactions in clinical practice

1368
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,240
but you can also go beyond that and be

1369
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,319
it with a triadic kind of relationship

1370
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:09,520
for example

1371
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,319
when you're treating a baby where

1372
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,280
actually

1373
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,000
it's not a two-way communication between

1374
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,599
the practitioner and the baby but it's

1375
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,599
also with with the parents

1376
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,520
with the mother and and in fact you know

1377
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,960
the first person you need to bring you

1378
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,520
need to synchronize is probably with the

1379
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,599
mother as well because you know if you

1380
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,520
if you kind of treat the baby indirectly

1381
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,359
you get there so i think that there's a

1382
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,280
lot of sort of alignments a lot of

1383
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,640
synchrony um to take into account into

1384
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,040
the therapeutic encounter

1385
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,559
and you know arguably the the kind of

1386
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,599
the development of a robust uh throbbing

1387
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,680
alliance is through that when the two

1388
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,319
people sort of sharing uh sharing a

1389
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,200
common niche but also sharing a you know

1390
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,680
common kind of uh you know mental states

1391
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,119
and predicting

1392
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,599
uh in a lot of times without any words

1393
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,800
uh what the response of the other person

1394
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,240
is is likely to be so it could be uh for

1395
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,079
some people may sort of sound a little

1396
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,440
bit uh

1397
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,520
more kind of esoteric but if we put it

1398
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,680
through a lens of you know active

1399
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,480
inference in activism and so on sense

1400
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,760
making

1401
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,920
you talking about things that are

1402
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,440
pre-reflective

1403
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,119
you're talking about things that's just

1404
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,160
happened

1405
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,280
and

1406
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,200
when um

1407
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,000
even down the realms of at times we hear

1408
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
practitioners or our own experiences

1409
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,480
practitioners on kind of bodily work

1410
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,640
then you feel like at times that uh you

1411
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,720
know the patient is seems to be relaxing

1412
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,640
because you got some relaxation through

1413
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,119
your own kind of a body and it's a sort

1414
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,000
of

1415
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,920
it could be the esoteric side of things

1416
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,920
but also you could think that maybe that

1417
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,480
show that demonstrates some form of

1418
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,800
alignment maybe that demonstrates an

1419
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,800
element of synchrony

1420
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,640
that can be done at such a more

1421
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,319
physiological level so

1422
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,720
there's a lot of um you know there's a

1423
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,240
lot of mileage

1424
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,079
uh in in my opinion and in exploring

1425
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,119
clinical practice uh particularly in

1426
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,760
particular in in situations of with an

1427
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,520
element of

1428
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,960
of complexity to explore it through them

1429
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,000
you know these lenses

1430
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,559
yeah and also yes

1431
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,760
yeah and also uh these also in line with

1432
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,880
the um the most recent theoretical paper

1433
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,079
just published a few a few months ago by

1434
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,200
um

1435
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,440
antonio damasio and

1436
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,480
and

1437
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,599
colleagues

1438
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:45,680
uh where actually they they were looking

1439
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,559
at the

1440
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,839
complexity through the um

1441
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:50,640
the

1442
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,119
interceptive nervous system so what

1443
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,280
actually they called for the first time

1444
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,720
ever no

1445
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,040
intercepted nervous system so it's a

1446
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,160
system that includes not only the fact

1447
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,440
that actually

1448
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,480
we need to understand what it's going in

1449
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,079
um within our body so the old concept

1450
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,800
between what's the old concept of crane

1451
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,400
so how do you feel

1452
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,839
but it's also goes into the the fact

1453
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,920
that the body actually interacts with

1454
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,599
the environment and also the uh that

1455
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,160
beautiful issue on

1456
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,720
uh neuro or neuroscience uh based on uh

1457
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,880
interception where actually they try to

1458
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,520
predict you uh say

1459
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,599
something new in in terms of uh

1460
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,280
interception where

1461
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,800
the uh the the main hypothesis was that

1462
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,720
the the way in which we create

1463
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,280
interception that is

1464
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,160
the base for a complex clinical

1465
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,359
condition

1466
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,760
is not only related to the fact that the

1467
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,760
different brain areas and therefore the

1468
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,280
introspective

1469
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,240
nervous system it's creating a kind of

1470
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,200
interaction between all the autonomic

1471
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,720
and non-autonomic uh areas but also

1472
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,640
those areas are important for um for

1473
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,680
decoding what it's happening outside the

1474
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,359
body and therefore through a sun through

1475
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,280
a descending

1476
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,359
primary and secondary descending

1477
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,839
mechanism that actually they're in

1478
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:27,040
introduce new variables within uh within

1479
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,640
the system that uh it allows the system

1480
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,000
to detect and to understand better the

1481
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,040
complexity and through this complexity

1482
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,400
created the

1483
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,680
appropriate changes that might be helped

1484
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,520
and for um keeping the non-equilibrium

1485
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,599
city state and therefore all the concept

1486
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,559
in relation to the predicted cause

1487
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:54,160
so what is the how we we can intercede

1488
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,400
with that because actually we are using

1489
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,599
one element that is touch that in a way

1490
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,240
might be disturbing the system because

1491
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,319
actually it's using

1492
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,640
in particular gentle touch or what is

1493
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,000
called affective touch is disturbing or

1494
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
interacting with the system and just

1495
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,280
through those uh anatomy functional

1496
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,200
pathways that actually goes directly to

1497
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:21,359
the insula and so through the ct fibers

1498
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,480
and therefore we are interacting uh in

1499
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,160
an ascending way uh with that specific

1500
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,559
areas that are including the um

1501
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,319
interceptive nervous system that

1502
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:35,359
actually actually are they the one on

1503
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,799
the part for emerging the uh the

1504
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:41,280
elements that we are talking about now

1505
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,079
and why it's important as just to

1506
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,040
underline what joe said which uh

1507
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,520
i found very clever and i support that

1508
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,440
so it's a way of creating a sort of uh

1509
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,520
entry point that

1510
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,559
also in the complex system might

1511
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,599
intercede with something that is

1512
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:04,880
multi-factorial within the well within

1513
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,839
the body that not only includes for

1514
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:08,880
example

1515
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,359
pain the perception of pain and the

1516
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:14,559
experience of pain and all the elements

1517
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:15,599
that are

1518
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,799
inside the body but also it creates the

1519
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,559
the bound with something that is

1520
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,599
external and bonding with external it

1521
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,520
means that actually you are establishing

1522
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,480
the therapeutic alliance in terms of the

1523
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,960
dyadic but also indirectly the triadic

1524
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,720
condition when actually you treat for

1525
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,200
example a baby or an early person so

1526
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,440
when actually there is someone there

1527
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,640
might be a parent there might be a

1528
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,359
the son the daughter or legal guardian

1529
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:48,640
actually are bringing the uh that person

1530
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,880
into you into the clinical encounter and

1531
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,839
therefore are part of the uh the general

1532
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:57,440
uh treatment uh session so i think it's

1533
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,000
a it's a way by by looking at the

1534
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,640
neuroscience behind that and the

1535
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,359
theoretical theoretical framework and

1536
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:08,319
the practical examples that are

1537
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:09,920
clinically

1538
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,000
found can be clinically found it can can

1539
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,319
be clinically explored i think there is

1540
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:16,799
a nice way also to

1541
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,160
um uh intercede with the uh with a

1542
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,520
different lens uh to understand complex

1543
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,319
situations

1544
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:30,000
i would add something to

1545
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,839
yes please torsten

1546
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,280
okay i would add something to um what

1547
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,880
was said by jay telly and basharsh

1548
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,079
and

1549
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,000
was that

1550
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,480
i would even go a step further

1551
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,680
i mean we decided to support

1552
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,079
luka's work financially because it is

1553
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,480
part of the psychosomatic asparty and

1554
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,400
our point of view but it's not only

1555
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,400
that we want to interact our palpation

1556
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,960
in reaction to interception but also to

1557
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,319
body sensations to arousals to emotions

1558
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,119
to belief systems and from my point of

1559
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,920
view in this case the osteopath is less

1560
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,799
a therapist but more a co-regulator by

1561
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:19,760
the interaction between both of them the

1562
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,240
awareness of the patient to his own

1563
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,799
stimulus in different levels will

1564
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:27,599
increase and secondly

1565
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:29,760
from the beginning osteopathy was

1566
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,000
interested in interrelationships

1567
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,880
and this means that we are already in

1568
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,839
our own profession in a way

1569
00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:39,119
interdisciplinary so it means for

1570
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,640
example that also we could look that

1571
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,799
peripheral hyperglycamine will lead

1572
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:48,079
always to a central hypoglycemia

1573
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:48,839
to

1574
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:50,799
central uh

1575
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:53,040
glucopini even so it means you have no

1576
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,520
more sugar in your brain so even if you

1577
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,040
would touch and you do all your

1578
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,119
psychological stuff but by your

1579
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,079
metabolic system you create a

1580
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,880
hypoglycemia in your brain even then

1581
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,119
whatever you do it will not has a big

1582
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:09,599
result so as more

1583
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,559
fragmented areas in the functioning of

1584
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,880
the patient's health we can include in

1585
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,520
our treatment and this means basically

1586
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,720
which was in the past not so much

1587
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,440
dominant and more active patient

1588
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,359
because in research it was show

1589
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,839
proactivity is one of the most factors

1590
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:30,880
to be healthy and basically in an

1591
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,960
australian treatment the patient is

1592
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,200
laying passively most of the time in the

1593
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,400
past so here we have not only looking in

1594
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,680
research how osmatic treatment can help

1595
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,920
but even change ospatic treatment in a

1596
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,440
more

1597
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,119
post-modern way

1598
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:49,119
so where we can help the patient even

1599
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,920
more with our hands instead

1600
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,160
what was past treatments done in

1601
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,359
australic treatment before

1602
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,240
so actually on that theme of kind of

1603
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,200
origins and futures of osteopathy i'll

1604
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,960
read a comment from the live chat and

1605
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,200
anyone else can write a chat too

1606
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,559
um

1607
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,400
good morning my dear osteopathic

1608
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,559
brothers and sisters i'm an american

1609
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:14,319
osteopath and must leave for work now

1610
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,400
but wanted to share a history of the

1611
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,799
still hildreth hospital in kirksville

1612
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:21,040
which was an outgrowth of dr stills

1613
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,119
original concept wishing to have

1614
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,119
osteopathic applications to mental

1615
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,000
health

1616
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,200
there are still papers papers by still

1617
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,799
which came out of that institution about

1618
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:32,960
effects osteopathy had on mental health

1619
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,640
conditions and early research on

1620
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,799
osteopathy and mental health from mel

1621
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,079
friedman who

1622
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:41,599
is actually my father so um any thoughts

1623
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,799
on that and

1624
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:44,160
also just keeping in mind the guest

1625
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,839
stream is kind of a two-way street

1626
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:47,599
people inactive inference who are

1627
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:49,440
perhaps hearing about osteopathy for the

1628
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,880
first time and vice versa just what

1629
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,480
are some of those

1630
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,880
principles lucas that you mentioned in

1631
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,559
your presentation informed by

1632
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,480
osteopathic principles like what are

1633
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,319
some of those principles

1634
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,480
and origins and how has it changed

1635
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,079
because it was very interesting what

1636
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,720
torsten had addressed

1637
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,920
yeah so i think an important distinction

1638
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,319
that we have to make is between american

1639
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,799
osteopaths and osteopaths mostly around

1640
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:21,760
the world because um i for myself i'm

1641
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,480
not a medical doctor so in

1642
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,520
the us

1643
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,720
um

1644
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:30,720
the old the do is a medical doctor in

1645
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,440
osteopathic uh in the osteopathic field

1646
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,920
so they are um they can treat mental

1647
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,839
health conditions and psychiatric

1648
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:40,400
disorders and it is regulated that they

1649
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,359
can do this so in germany for example i

1650
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,359
can't treat someone with a major

1651
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,760
depression because my training was not

1652
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,880
oriented to allow me to treat that so it

1653
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,400
is important for us to

1654
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,200
to emphasize that we are um not treating

1655
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,640
mental disorders on our own but that we

1656
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,960
try to um

1657
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,160
address

1658
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,559
psychological factors in people with

1659
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,640
physical conditions that are visiting us

1660
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,119
quite frequently so i think that that is

1661
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,280
another distinction that i have to make

1662
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,920
between our colleagues from america

1663
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,880
and then to the point of of the history

1664
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,520
of osteopathy we came across a few

1665
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,319
papers um that have argued for an

1666
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:25,680
osteopathic psychiatry i think that was

1667
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,000
involved in this paper a little bit in

1668
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,520
the earlier times

1669
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,280
and um

1670
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,400
there has been some work done but the

1671
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,720
work is as your father has outlined

1672
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,240
quite old so uh we we try to put some

1673
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,720
new perspectives uh to this discussion i

1674
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,599
think

1675
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:44,799
that

1676
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:46,880
it's another thing

1677
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,839
one thing if i may uh would be

1678
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:52,559
useful to to add is

1679
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,480
you know the origins of australia with

1680
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,440
undertale still and and some of you know

1681
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,480
his early

1682
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,119
students including um john martin little

1683
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,400
john

1684
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,039
were uh were primarily based around you

1685
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,359
know new concepts um you know concepts

1686
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,119
of you know

1687
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,480
sort of

1688
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,680
uh unity self-regulation that were kind

1689
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,559
of uh

1690
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,440
relatively new in the late 19th century

1691
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,200
and and a lot of the work was sort of

1692
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,720
one one interesting and important

1693
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,960
concept of the concept of adaptation so

1694
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,160
you know enabling people to adapt to

1695
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,039
uh to their day-to-day activities to to

1696
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,760
adapt and interact with the environment

1697
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,640
unfortunately that was a little bit loss

1698
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,720
uh lost over the years and

1699
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,920
endoscopity and other forms of manual

1700
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,240
therapy chiropractic for

1701
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,799
musculoskeletal physiotherapy became a

1702
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:46,240
long time

1703
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,720
based on a kind of very biomechanical

1704
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,440
model of care you know looking primarily

1705
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,960
at the test structure the

1706
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,799
musculoskeletal structures the reason

1707
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:57,599
for uh quite quite a lot of the of the

1708
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,680
clinical problems which

1709
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,720
you know in fact led to um hoover and

1710
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,480
american australian 1963 to to write a

1711
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,960
very important paper that not many

1712
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,559
people actually read

1713
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,880
or actually acted on which actually

1714
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,960
called for osteopathy or osteopathic

1715
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,359
medicine to be ecological medicine

1716
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:20,240
because you know it's not about just the

1717
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,480
theology it's not about sort of using a

1718
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,839
pure biomechanical biomedical model and

1719
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:27,440
try to find

1720
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,440
what is the cause of the problem what is

1721
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,280
the pathology so i think you know the

1722
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,799
interesting thing over the years and

1723
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:34,400
actually that's um you know something

1724
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,760
that actually

1725
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,559
um

1726
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,640
you know personally attracted me a lot

1727
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,559
to this and to these new ideas uh is

1728
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:44,559
actually these ideas

1729
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:48,079
uh kind of are are very much you know in

1730
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:49,440
in a sense

1731
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,920
aligned with those initial ideas of lost

1732
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,280
geography where everything kind of

1733
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,920
started from concept of this sort of

1734
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,920
adaptation as a central concept around

1735
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,319
the free energy principle for example

1736
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:01,760
the interactions with the environment

1737
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,920
central consciousness concepts around

1738
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,880
inactivism so really to think about the

1739
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,079
person in that sort of unique ecological

1740
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,760
niche and how can we as practitioners

1741
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,640
kind of help that person to you know

1742
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,520
help with self-regulation etc also

1743
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,520
taking into account the knowledge we

1744
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,119
have these days about what is actually

1745
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,039
the role of the nervous system pretty

1746
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:26,880
much about you know in the role of our

1747
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,640
stages for example

1748
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,799
uh not so much about some sort of the

1749
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:33,119
high order cognitive stuff so i think

1750
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:34,079
there's

1751
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:36,480
there's a lot to extract from

1752
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,039
you know these frameworks and and not

1753
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:40,960
necessarily try to rewrite the history

1754
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,480
of osteopathy or other forms of

1755
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,559
nanotherapy but actually

1756
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:47,039
applying things in a in a kind of a

1757
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:48,400
critical

1758
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,440
and you know serious manner to actually

1759
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,319
sort of move forward and move away from

1760
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:55,119
uh

1761
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,839
you know from sort of you know ideas

1762
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,000
that actually no longer make that much

1763
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,319
sense from for example you know

1764
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:04,640
practicing entirely on a biomechanical

1765
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:08,799
model of of you know of care

1766
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,200
i like very much what george was saying

1767
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,280
and basically it was not only whoever it

1768
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,440
was already little john and mcconnell

1769
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,839
who gone in this way what hoover

1770
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:20,480
explored more and we are on the way of

1771
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,760
them basically so if we nowadays look

1772
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,720
also into genetics which was in the

1773
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,559
beginning of osteopathy not possible

1774
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:32,079
look into epigenetics look into un

1775
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,960
lifestyle factors and with each factor

1776
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,440
the success ability of a person to get

1777
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,920
sick or get health increases

1778
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,720
and if we include this with our patient

1779
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,400
we are on the way

1780
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,200
of

1781
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,720
little john mcconnell and who was opened

1782
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,880
up for us already in the very early

1783
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,920
times of osteopathy

1784
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,920
thank you torsten robert and then anyone

1785
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,960
else

1786
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,559
yeah i just

1787
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:00,079
don't want to lose sight of the fact

1788
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:03,280
that the paper is about

1789
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,440
recognizing that even though we might

1790
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,240
not be trained to

1791
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,799
deal with psychological interventions an

1792
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,319
awful lot of our patients have

1793
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,280
psychological

1794
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,599
problems of some order or another i

1795
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:18,319
think

1796
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,079
something like 40

1797
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:23,440
of primary care consultations coexist

1798
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,000
with mental disturbance

1799
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,599
so whether we like it or not we're

1800
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,200
dealing with it

1801
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,160
and this is a this is a way we can go

1802
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,599
we're not training people we're not

1803
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:35,440
saying osteopaths should become psycho

1804
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,359
psychotherapists or psychologists but

1805
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:38,640
we're saying

1806
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,520
if we

1807
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,400
raise awareness of these issues

1808
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,400
is going to help in our patient care

1809
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,359
i agree very much what robot was saying

1810
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,680
and even i would go a step further we

1811
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:54,240
can't avoid to interchange with

1812
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,799
emotional being with

1813
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:00,720
the ans being with cognitive levels of a

1814
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,119
person we only can be a little bit more

1815
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,839
competent when we treat with our patient

1816
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:08,000
in these areas and this doesn't mean

1817
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,720
that we need to be a psychotherapist in

1818
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,598
treating patients

1819
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,680
it's the complex systems perspective

1820
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,839
that the entity is in the niche and that

1821
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:20,319
the mind and body are

1822
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:23,040
interrelated inseparable and so

1823
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,759
any model that for some sort of like um

1824
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:28,080
credentialing reason chooses to ignore

1825
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,960
that is going to be operating in peril

1826
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,880
so how do we

1827
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,799
recognize this system's complexity but

1828
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,719
also the amend

1829
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,799
immense amount of information you know

1830
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:40,719
you could study just the liver and there

1831
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:42,158
would be a lot to learn or just the

1832
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:44,479
lungs so how do we pull back and

1833
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:46,719
actually have a healthy

1834
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,000
relationship in this very complex

1835
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,040
setting

1836
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,799
so here's a sort of um fun question also

1837
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:57,600
staying with the anomaly theme

1838
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,080
i was wondering if throughout your

1839
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,719
training or experiences had come across

1840
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:04,719
any embodied

1841
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,359
exercises that you think are really good

1842
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:09,679
entry points to

1843
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,158
the predictive body and interoception so

1844
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,319
like i was thinking of having one's arms

1845
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:16,000
in the door frame and trying to raise

1846
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,040
them out

1847
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,799
and then when you step out you know the

1848
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:20,960
arms will raise

1849
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,880
and um i was wondering if there was any

1850
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,679
other

1851
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:26,960
experiences that might be that anomaly

1852
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,960
for someone to start wondering if they

1853
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:29,839
were

1854
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:32,399
interested to look into more of these

1855
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:34,880
approaches that you outline in the paper

1856
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,479
rather than

1857
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:38,799
the signal processing perception

1858
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,359
framework or some other um

1859
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:46,679
non or pre-act imp model

1860
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:53,439
so i i think the literature is quite

1861
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,000
dense with examples on on how the the

1862
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,920
body influences the mind in these kind

1863
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,199
of instances

1864
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:02,480
um for example going back to to struck

1865
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,560
who published the study with the pen in

1866
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,520
between the teeth uh showing that people

1867
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,679
find comics much more funnier if they

1868
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:12,239
had a pen between the teeth because this

1869
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:15,120
pen activates the supermarket major with

1870
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,719
this the primary muscle of laughing so

1871
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:21,520
there are quite a few examples on

1872
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,600
how simple manipulations of the body

1873
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,440
framework influences

1874
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,440
cognition and emotion

1875
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,040
but i don't have some specific uh

1876
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:34,480
exercises uh to to give to patients um

1877
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,678
if that answers the question

1878
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:40,880
right because also daniel i think it

1879
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,199
depends from the patient's condition so

1880
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:46,400
far so if we take into account what we

1881
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,679
what we said up to now so it means that

1882
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:53,440
uh each pain each patient has got its uh

1883
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,920
his or her own

1884
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,840
clinical specific condition so and uh

1885
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,080
going into a protocol lies for example

1886
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,199
exercise my ended up with patients

1887
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:09,040
having different reactions

1888
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:14,480
so and therefore the the use of

1889
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,280
this framework that consider the

1890
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,280
complexity of the patient

1891
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,640
within

1892
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,360
the uniqueness of uh

1893
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,159
of shame or hair

1894
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:30,159
definitely my uh help us to be

1895
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,800
to have fantasy or to have imagination

1896
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,000
during the during the during the

1897
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,320
the treatment and adapt

1898
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,400
the different possibilities

1899
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,040
that might be exercising might be uh

1900
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,960
treatment procedures it might be

1901
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,360
techniques and might be approaches

1902
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,560
into the condition of the patient that

1903
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,120
is not only the patient but is the the

1904
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,440
patient within the environment within

1905
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,000
his or her environment and therefore

1906
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,840
create the optimal way of what we

1907
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,600
predict that might be optimal for uh for

1908
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,640
the patient in order to achieve the uh

1909
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,080
the outcome that was um

1910
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,760
that needs to be obtained obtained

1911
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,679
i think there's uh

1912
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:19,440
in fact you know i'm just thinking one

1913
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,280
exercise that i

1914
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,679
tend to use and it's nothing that

1915
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:25,840
i develop myself but it's used by quite

1916
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,159
a number of practitioners to

1917
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,760
you know so

1918
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,000
to teach patients about pain and and

1919
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,239
about the sensations they feel is for

1920
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,880
example to use the analogy to do

1921
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,159
you know the

1922
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:39,760
sort of

1923
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,960
this so you if you ask a patient if for

1924
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,080
example in cases of patients with

1925
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,159
chronic pain fear of movement you

1926
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,480
identified that for example movement

1927
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,800
tends to be quite slow and and

1928
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,960
and certainly restricted not so much

1929
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,719
because there's a serious limitation in

1930
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:58,159
the movement but because there's a fear

1931
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:00,719
of movement they tend to use for example

1932
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,480
as the professional looking if you make

1933
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,360
a fist and you try to move your wrist

1934
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,199
it's going to feel uncomfortable and

1935
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:09,040
that's in a sense how

1936
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,360
how your neck is trying to move against

1937
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:15,040
you resisting if you try to move relax

1938
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,640
you know it's the sensations are

1939
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,320
completely different so you can actually

1940
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,679
create if you think about these

1941
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,159
exercises that are used by

1942
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:24,400
you know quite a lot of musculoskeletal

1943
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,719
practitioners to actually start

1944
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:29,679
introducing the the sort of some

1945
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:32,960
some of the the sensations that we want

1946
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,679
uh that might actually violate their

1947
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:37,760
generative model and change things a

1948
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,080
little bit so that's a good way of you

1949
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,239
know try to teach the patients you know

1950
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:44,880
this is how you should feel this is how

1951
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,640
you should move and not so much like

1952
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,040
trying to move against resistance which

1953
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,440
happens if you make a fist and try to

1954
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,080
you know move your wrist

1955
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,239
in general i like well it's very much

1956
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,400
also francesco's

1957
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,280
commentary because in osteopathy we try

1958
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,120
really to identify

1959
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,239
uh individualized approaches so there

1960
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:08,960
was a nice research from amy cutty where

1961
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,679
she changed body postures and measured

1962
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:15,679
the cortisol and testosterone outcomes

1963
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,920
but in

1964
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,560
research it was not confirmed because it

1965
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,480
was too

1966
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,040
it was not adapted to a certain person

1967
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,000
sometimes it's enough that just a slight

1968
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,199
extension in two verticals can give a

1969
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:33,040
person a different

1970
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,520
kind of breathing experience in another

1971
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,920
person it could be that just

1972
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,239
the face could be a little bit released

1973
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:42,800
in some muscles like for example

1974
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,159
lucas was mentioned so i think the

1975
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:49,440
approaches to a patient in an ospatic

1976
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,920
treatment is very individualized

1977
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,960
and it's not a general

1978
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,600
techniques for everybody which

1979
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,880
could help

1980
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,760
so good as in individualized approaches

1981
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:06,159
in relation to different experiences

1982
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,400
thanks for all the

1983
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:12,159
awesome and diverse answers so i'll

1984
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:14,080
ask the question um

1985
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,560
carefully i guess but standardized

1986
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,040
interventions whether they're measured

1987
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,960
in milligrams or

1988
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,880
educational curriculum

1989
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,280
lend themselves towards being

1990
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,880
scientifically tested more easily like a

1991
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,520
two group experiment people who do or

1992
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,600
don't have the diagnosis

1993
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,719
or

1994
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:36,719
any other number of situations and it

1995
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:38,640
was really also just highlighted in what

1996
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,440
torsten added with this

1997
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,800
uh

1998
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,840
individuated experience and the dyad is

1999
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,440
unique there's never going to be another

2000
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,360
one like that in the history of

2001
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,760
osteopathy with those people in that

2002
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,840
niche interacting that way

2003
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,560
so

2004
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,120
just wondered um what insights from all

2005
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,719
of your different areas of expertise

2006
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:02,000
start to

2007
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,120
help us

2008
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,520
address like the specificity of the

2009
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,880
particulars of an encounter but also

2010
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,640
know what

2011
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,280
kinds of things should be available

2012
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,600
for population level use or on average

2013
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:19,560
you know are eggs good or bad

2014
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,159
yeah i think this is a really big

2015
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:28,960
problem in osteopathy um and research

2016
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,360
osteopathic research in general is what

2017
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:34,000
kind of control groups are we are we

2018
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,480
doing so if we if we are treating a

2019
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,320
patient is a

2020
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,480
mere touch without intention a good

2021
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:43,679
control group or no intervention so

2022
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:46,640
there are many problems to the

2023
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,199
to researching the person-centered

2024
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:51,840
nature of osteopathy but also the manual

2025
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,679
nature of osteopathy and i think

2026
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:56,159
francesco is a good person to speak

2027
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,159
about this because he recently published

2028
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,080
a paper on control

2029
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,920
interventions in osteopathy maybe you

2030
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,480
want to add something francesca

2031
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,440
um

2032
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:09,199
thanks lucas so uh i think the

2033
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:13,440
this is a very interesting um

2034
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,280
question uh daniel um for three reasons

2035
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,800
so the first one is that

2036
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:21,840
we are

2037
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:26,719
still within um a drug based research

2038
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:28,000
paradigm

2039
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,600
because actually um during the la from

2040
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,400
1980 some word the and then with the

2041
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,960
development of evidence-based medicine

2042
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,960
the majority of the research actually

2043
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,360
was drug-based research and therefore we

2044
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,520
can control milligrams as you said we

2045
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,000
can control the the type of

2046
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,360
administration and all the elements that

2047
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:52,320
actually created the randomized control

2048
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,800
trial very controlled very specific and

2049
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,840
so on

2050
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:59,360
however uh in during the last 10 years

2051
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,320
uh all these paradigms actually start to

2052
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,040
like having some creepy things

2053
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,840
and in which sense because actually uh

2054
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,040
it's

2055
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:12,480
it's very far away from the from the

2056
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,239
clinical practice

2057
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:17,199
and the clinical practice is based on

2058
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,560
variability

2059
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,719
and the variable and our clients and the

2060
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:22,800
variability in our clients are important

2061
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,440
to understand what are the clinical

2062
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,480
effects

2063
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,960
of a specific treatment

2064
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,239
so um indeed

2065
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:35,520
during the last 15 years this concept of

2066
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,400
having

2067
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,560
super rigid

2068
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,480
randomized control trial in particular

2069
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,719
in the intervention group and therefore

2070
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,719
in the control group actually started to

2071
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,679
change the sun to be molded in a way

2072
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:49,760
of creating

2073
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,400
something it's much more

2074
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,040
much closer to the reality therefore

2075
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,600
they ended up with pro pragmatic

2076
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,760
clinical trial and

2077
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,080
pragmatic clinical trial those trials

2078
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,679
actually are more

2079
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:06,960
are closer to the reality in which there

2080
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,080
is not just one an administration in

2081
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,159
terms of for example drug treatment but

2082
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:14,080
actually they are taking into account

2083
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,320
all the different elements that might

2084
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:19,040
influence the effect of the treatment

2085
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:22,159
itself indeed when actually we

2086
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:25,920
administer for example

2087
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:27,679
a drug

2088
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,040
but then

2089
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:32,400
we looking for long-term

2090
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,560
effects on long-term outcomes in the

2091
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,560
intervention group an intervention group

2092
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,600
then goes back home and they are one

2093
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,600
group one part of this intervention

2094
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,400
group is very very happy because they

2095
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,440
just

2096
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,239
they just got in a new child uh they

2097
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:51,120
just had and they just won the lottery

2098
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,400
and all the positive elements obviously

2099
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:57,199
the long-term effects of the the drug

2100
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:59,920
treatment is definitely better than

2101
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,600
the uh the someone instead who

2102
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,840
for example had lost

2103
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,960
so what is the the what is the concept

2104
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,760
underneath that is the concept of the

2105
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,000
the research is changing and also the

2106
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
methodological elements underneath

2107
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,080
research are changing now there are

2108
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,920
pragmatic trials but they're also what

2109
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,480
they call the benchmarking control trial

2110
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,679
so there are actually are trials that

2111
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:27,920
are important

2112
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,040
for detecting what is happening during

2113
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,719
the clinical

2114
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:35,440
routine life within the hospital and

2115
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,920
then adding another intervention to the

2116
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,040
normal routine care then you see what is

2117
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,840
the difference between the two pathways

2118
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,320
so what it's saying by that it's saying

2119
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,760
that it is true that it's important to

2120
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,320
control all the variables

2121
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:56,159
within a given intervention but at the

2122
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:57,440
same time

2123
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,400
if we look at the cause effect and

2124
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,440
therefore efficacy yes it's important if

2125
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,760
we want to look at what is in

2126
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,560
instead it's called effectiveness so the

2127
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,480
clinical effect of the specific

2128
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,440
treatment then what you do what you

2129
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:17,440
specifically do a specific treatment or

2130
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:21,040
uh 10 grams 10 grams more or 15 grams

2131
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:21,840
left

2132
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,600
actually doesn't make so

2133
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,560
that difference because of the what we

2134
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:29,520
are talking here and also because

2135
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,719
probably those 15 grams are

2136
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:35,760
less are and probably

2137
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,280
will have more powerful effects if i'm

2138
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,600
talking to the patient with the right

2139
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,480
tone

2140
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:46,000
and therefore creating an inducing

2141
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,480
and increased effect

2142
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,880
uh based on the

2143
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,520
uh interaction the narrative the shared

2144
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,400
narratives that we are talking so in a

2145
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,159
way it's true but at the same time uh

2146
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:03,440
the the recent evidence are shifting the

2147
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,239
uh the methodological research com

2148
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:11,480
concept towards complex intervention

2149
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,560
thanks for the awesome response and

2150
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,719
indeed it is mirroring

2151
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:19,120
trends in other scientific areas to

2152
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,239
study

2153
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:23,280
um targeted perturbations and measuring

2154
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,320
dynamical systems after perturbation or

2155
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,400
testing different dynamical models

2156
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,199
rather than just summary statistic and

2157
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:33,280
t-test and then you know rubber-stamped

2158
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,679
that so it is absolutely

2159
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:39,679
really um interesting um

2160
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:42,719
does anyone else have any uh comments or

2161
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:45,280
questions or things here please robert i

2162
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,639
mean there's quite a tradition in the

2163
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:48,880
nursing world to look at action research

2164
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,320
which is real life in real life

2165
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,159
interventions you know what happens at

2166
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:55,520
the ground level and i think that's

2167
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:56,960
really where we are

2168
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,639
that's what we're saying

2169
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:00,080
you know what actually happens in the

2170
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,159
treatment room not what we think what

2171
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:05,120
happens but actually what happens

2172
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,960
and this is a conceptual framework that

2173
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,360
enables that

2174
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,840
so almost within active it'd be like the

2175
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,520
difference between what we think is

2176
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,840
going to happen like well if

2177
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,920
the two comparisons of the two different

2178
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,719
amounts had this effect on the biomarker

2179
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:22,000
well then the one that had the better

2180
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,679
biomarker effect should be used in the

2181
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:25,600
clinic right

2182
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,120
and so that's like staying within the

2183
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,520
generative model but then

2184
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,679
always being open to having new

2185
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:34,239
information and being able to have um

2186
01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:35,679
discernment to know whether it's

2187
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:37,760
consistent or inconsistent with our

2188
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,840
expectations but our expectations for

2189
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,239
complex systems even people we know very

2190
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:44,080
well like they can still

2191
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,679
surprise you and so

2192
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:49,040
um but always keeping that openness to

2193
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,000
the

2194
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,239
even the tactile which is something that

2195
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:55,040
a lot of other medical modalities don't

2196
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:55,760
do

2197
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,159
so maybe the tactile five percent of the

2198
01:23:58,159 --> 01:23:59,920
time it diverts

2199
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,159
a cohort of patients towards another

2200
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:04,960
diagnosis like the tissue is warm

2201
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,280
but that at the whole population level

2202
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,560
wouldn't even be statistically

2203
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:09,760
significant

2204
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,000
but it might be very important for a

2205
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,800
small subset so it's very interesting

2206
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,480
about like kind of

2207
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,400
pointing without um

2208
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,199
dwelling on some of the limitations

2209
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:22,400
of the current

2210
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,320
medical system which i think most people

2211
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,440
can agree

2212
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:29,600
is uh not realizing our preferences

2213
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,360
and then here's actually a

2214
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,120
science-informed way

2215
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,120
when we can start to look at

2216
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,120
complex interventions

2217
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40,159
in human systems

2218
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,040
absolutely and

2219
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,280
therefore there there are still they are

2220
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,520
starting we are starting to have also

2221
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,199
some theories

2222
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:51,040
uh behind that

2223
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,920
uh that can be um a complexity or living

2224
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,000
system that actually can be also applied

2225
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,360
into uh this field um

2226
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,960
this changing

2227
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,239
view of the research field that up to

2228
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:07,920
now as we said was mainly based on

2229
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,840
was biased towards the former

2230
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,560
pharmaceutical

2231
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,280
standpoint

2232
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,080
any other

2233
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:23,120
thoughts or comments on that

2234
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,480
yeah this is a very big point francesco

2235
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:30,639
is saying and all his uh his extremely

2236
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:32,639
engagement in

2237
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:36,159
in helping us to get more science is

2238
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:37,760
incredibly important

2239
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,679
basically to have a little bit balanced

2240
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:41,679
we will never have a full balance

2241
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:44,560
because with our treatment we can't make

2242
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:49,520
so much money like farmer concern can do

2243
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:55,360
but at least uh we have opportunities

2244
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:56,719
for

2245
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:59,760
uh opening uh doors in

2246
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,080
in a way that is

2247
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,239
closer to reality

2248
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:06,840
and creating

2249
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,400
um

2250
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,440
a a way that up to now

2251
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:14,239
is the mainstream because actually also

2252
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:17,360
the um uh drug based uh treatment

2253
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:20,880
actually are uh facing uh big challenges

2254
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,800
up to now

2255
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,760
and the more you go either you go in

2256
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,920
ultra precise medicine

2257
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,400
because actually we are all going all

2258
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:34,000
the way down and deep into

2259
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,560
precise medicine or you need to go on

2260
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,800
the opposite side in the middle

2261
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,040
everything is already discovered

2262
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:44,239
so uh therefore there are chances to

2263
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:46,080
integrate the two because there are

2264
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,480
chances because actually we are living

2265
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,880
in a way that actually we need precise

2266
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,560
medicine

2267
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:56,719
uh but at the same time we need also um

2268
01:26:56,719 --> 01:27:00,080
complex intervention we need complex way

2269
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,679
of looking

2270
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:04,080
at the

2271
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:08,880
uh in a different way not in a

2272
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,199
super segmented way

2273
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:13,920
uh but in a way that actually it brings

2274
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,800
everything together

2275
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,800
i think another

2276
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,719
piece the puzzle was brought up when

2277
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:22,480
someone mentioned the early paper about

2278
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,360
osteopathic approaches as ecological

2279
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:28,719
medicine because in my own research with

2280
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:31,120
insect ecology that was always the

2281
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,639
question well you could have the insects

2282
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:34,480
in the lab and then you know what age

2283
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,960
they were and what they ate but then

2284
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,320
the temperature and the humidity aren't

2285
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,480
what they have evolved to experience and

2286
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,840
you don't know whether they're healthy

2287
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,600
but then out in the wild they're doing

2288
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,760
interesting stuff in the way that it's

2289
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,760
meant to happen but you don't know how

2290
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,000
old the animal is or you don't know what

2291
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,600
its physiological condition is or you

2292
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,239
don't get the measurements and so

2293
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:56,639
there's a dialogue there between the

2294
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:00,480
more controlled laboratory side

2295
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,800
which is like kind of precision medicine

2296
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,560
i mean some people may want to live in a

2297
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:05,920
laboratory if that means that they could

2298
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,320
make more measurements about their body

2299
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,239
and then there's sort of the field

2300
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:11,920
ecology

2301
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,600
natural history

2302
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,520
angle

2303
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:16,400
so

2304
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,120
that's very um interesting how there's

2305
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,719
like a medical

2306
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:22,480
along with a mental health

2307
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:25,040
and ecological synthesis happening in a

2308
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:25,920
sense

2309
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,760
through osteopathy

2310
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,440
that

2311
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,280
now a lot of different perspectives are

2312
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,280
helping to combine

2313
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,080
um

2314
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,320
typified and lucas's very dense and

2315
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,880
informative slides

2316
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:46,080
is one of the ease we mentioned

2317
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,520
yes

2318
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,960
there are many e's

2319
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,920
and like maybe the term inactive might

2320
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,920
not come in also

2321
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,679
it's another heat okay

2322
01:28:57,679 --> 01:28:58,960
seven e

2323
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:01,120
more used um but

2324
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,520
it also shows how different um

2325
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,120
ways of describing across fields can

2326
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,639
prevent their synthesis like again

2327
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:08,560
osteopathy might not have used the term

2328
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,080
inactivism

2329
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,199
but

2330
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:13,280
i mean looking back on it isn't it it's

2331
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,639
almost

2332
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:16,719
it's it's not even to say it's

2333
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:19,520
definitional it's like an understatement

2334
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,600
so then there's a lot of latent

2335
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,880
possibility and then how does that get

2336
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:28,320
applied and how does it um

2337
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,560
change the way that the

2338
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,040
art and the science are carried out are

2339
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,480
enacted themselves

2340
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,719
um

2341
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,719
if anyone else would like to ask a

2342
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:40,800
question or like

2343
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,280
what would you say to those who are

2344
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,440
learning active inference and

2345
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,280
just hearing about what you've described

2346
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,840
for the first time or those maybe from

2347
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:52,880
the medical or osteopathic community who

2348
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,560
are learning about active inference for

2349
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,719
the first time in sort of closing

2350
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,880
i would say that

2351
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:04,840
active inference

2352
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:06,560
provides um

2353
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,679
a way

2354
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:11,199
in which we can actually simplify

2355
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:13,360
things you know rather than making them

2356
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:16,239
more complex i think there's a lot to

2357
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:18,000
you know people would feel scared

2358
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,360
there's another model and there's

2359
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,440
another kind of complex thing to look

2360
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,400
into it in fact if you look at sort of

2361
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,159
the basic foundations of active

2362
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:27,600
inference

2363
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,080
is actually things make perfect sense

2364
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,080
and in fact

2365
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,040
you can simplify uh

2366
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,440
your interaction with your patients in

2367
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,440
and become a much more effective lawyer

2368
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,440
you know the kind of uh

2369
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,199
you know when you get to that point

2370
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:45,040
where you know that things are working

2371
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:45,840
well

2372
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,400
since you know your internal states are

2373
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,199
my

2374
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:52,320
active states and and vice versa when i

2375
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,159
can predict

2376
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:55,040
things

2377
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:56,719
so um

2378
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:58,639
i think you can can

2379
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:01,679
can help us with that can also help us

2380
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:04,159
to um to understand

2381
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,800
you know complexity that patients bring

2382
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,159
to the table

2383
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:10,560
and you know the paper is about mental

2384
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,560
health and oxyoptine you know a lot of

2385
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,360
people would argue post job is primarily

2386
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:16,639
based on

2387
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:19,120
focused on musculoskeletal care but as

2388
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,719
we've been talking about

2389
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:23,440
you know most musculoskeletal care and

2390
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:26,400
the most musculoskeletal conditions have

2391
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,679
an element of mental health

2392
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:31,760
in a sense the patient that

2393
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:34,000
can't get out don't do their normal

2394
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,400
day-to-day activities when their world

2395
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,280
stops making sense is likely to become

2396
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,760
depressed so if you

2397
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,320
by working on their you know

2398
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,400
musculoskeletal problems make them feel

2399
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,679
better

2400
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:50,239
indirectly or even directly you are

2401
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:52,000
treating their mental health conditions

2402
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,199
so

2403
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:54,080
i think

2404
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:56,719
can help us to see the bigger picture

2405
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:58,960
rather than simply the dysfunction in

2406
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,639
the body

2407
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:03,199
for the brain in fact

2408
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:05,440
i definitely echo that

2409
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,520
with george and i think what i've

2410
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,360
learned and i've been working in this

2411
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,600
field for 30 years

2412
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,159
is this is giving us a handle on some of

2413
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:17,280
the uncertainty that goes on

2414
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,000
as a practitioner

2415
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,080
a lot of my students get really scared

2416
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:25,040
about how to deal with unpredictable

2417
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,760
things that occur in practice

2418
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,120
and it can be you know pretty

2419
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:30,719
challenging because there's a lot of

2420
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:32,560
complexity

2421
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,320
and i think the big take-home message

2422
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,480
i'd say is you don't have to be the

2423
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,280
expert on your patient

2424
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,800
this gives us

2425
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,320
a handle

2426
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:43,760
yeah i mean you have a hard enough time

2427
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,840
to be an expert on yourself

2428
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,440
but to be an expert with another human

2429
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:48,639
being is

2430
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:50,560
pretty damn difficult

2431
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,080
this gives us a model framework

2432
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:57,040
it's some way it's reinventing things

2433
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,280
that may other people have said in the

2434
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,679
past but it's it's starting to bring it

2435
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:04,080
all together into a package that says

2436
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,280
right

2437
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,320
there's a

2438
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:09,280
ecological niche or you could say a

2439
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,920
shared narrative there's a way of

2440
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,560
talking to a patient

2441
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,120
that you don't have to tell them what to

2442
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:20,800
do that we can kind of work out

2443
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,719
we can facilitate

2444
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:24,880
healing and that actually

2445
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:29,360
is what initially got me into osteopathy

2446
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,560
i think this is a very interesting point

2447
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,679
robert

2448
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:34,560
and i

2449
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,480
it resonates with a

2450
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,320
thing that is

2451
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,639
an osteopathic principle that we try to

2452
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:42,560
activate the self-healing powers of

2453
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:43,600
patients and

2454
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,920
this implies for me that we are not

2455
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,159
the therapist who brings up healing in

2456
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:51,760
the patient but the patient in itself is

2457
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,400
generating the healing and therefore we

2458
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,400
are not the specialists who have to

2459
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,480
understand the complexity of the patient

2460
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:01,280
but to be there as a as a counterpart

2461
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,679
and evolve with the patient to generate

2462
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:07,120
a more healthy life

2463
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,880
i can't help but remark on robert what

2464
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,199
you said there about not having to be an

2465
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:16,560
expert

2466
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,960
it reminded me of how like the arm

2467
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,440
doesn't have to be a theoretical coffee

2468
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,320
cup

2469
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,960
subject matter expert

2470
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,760
it has to implement a strategy of which

2471
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:30,080
a broad range are going to be possible

2472
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,600
and none of them can be pre-stated but

2473
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,400
it has to implement a strategy

2474
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,159
to get the coffee cup

2475
01:34:36,159 --> 01:34:37,199
and so

2476
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:38,880
it's just a very

2477
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,199
um

2478
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:43,520
interesting way to tie together the

2479
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,040
trans-disciplinarity

2480
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:47,280
with also one of the

2481
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,600
threads of inactivism and ecological

2482
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,080
psychology and active inference which is

2483
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:54,000
that we're doing

2484
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,040
and thinking and doing are together

2485
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:59,600
rather than waiting to be

2486
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,239
subject matters on experts on everything

2487
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:03,440
before we

2488
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,920
are able to act in a complex niche that

2489
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,520
includes us as a part but we're not

2490
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,719
going to get the whole picture on

2491
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,880
well this was a very

2492
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,960
fun discussion it sounds like you all

2493
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,480
are on a very

2494
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,679
cool line of research and we

2495
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:23,840
really appreciate it in the lab i hope

2496
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:26,480
that you'll come back and discuss more

2497
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:27,360
as

2498
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:30,080
more research occurs

2499
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,639
thank you thank you daniel thank you

2500
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:35,520
very much all right thanks a lot okay

2501
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,600
have a good day thanks everyone

2502
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:42,080
youtube okay bye-bye see you soon
