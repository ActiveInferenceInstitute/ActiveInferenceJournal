1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,360
hello and welcome it's January 26 2023

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,820
we're here in active inference model

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,519
stream number 8.1

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,760
today we're appreciative to have Thomas

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,080
ringstrom

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,539
who will be presenting on reward is not

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,080
necessary a compositional theory of

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,460
self-preserving Agents with empowerment

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,460
gain maximization there will be a

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,040
presentation followed by a discussion so

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,320
Thomas thank you for joining really

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,800
looking forward to this off to you

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,840
yeah thank you very much it's really

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,059
nice to be here and talk to this uh to

15
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,739
this group

16
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,219
um I'm uh a computer science PhD student

17
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,579
at the University of Minnesota uh my my

18
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,660
interests are in sort of what you know

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,300
what are the composition what are the uh

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,940
sort of computational properties that we

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,680
would need to have

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,799
uh agents which

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,280
um flexibly plan in sort of high

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,740
dimensional you know product spaces of

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,299
variables

26
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,600
um and also how do we get agents to

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,659
perform complex tasks uh in an

28
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,880
intrinsically motivated way especially

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,200
in in high dimensional product spaces

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,240
um so this uh this presentation is going

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,479
to argue that

32
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,000
um reward uh and I know I'm talking to a

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,939
sort of active inference crowd um

34
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,000
but uh some of the same points apply to

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,420
active inference perhaps too but I this

36
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,960
this presentation is is mostly about how

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,520
there there's going to be some major

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,979
problems I think uh using reward

39
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,820
maximization objectives and by moving to

40
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,220
sort of reward free objective functions

41
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,740
we can get really nice

42
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,979
um factorizations that help us plan so

43
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,500
let's just start off with a sort of

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,139
simple picture a simplified picture of

45
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,239
an organism so we have a honey badger

46
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,580
here and

47
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,300
um

48
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,720
so this honey badger has

49
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,900
internal States it gets hungry and it

50
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,540
gets thirsty and there's also an

51
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,280
external World

52
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,140
um that the agent lives in

53
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,500
and you know in order to sort of modify

54
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,080
internal State spaces the the agent

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,360
might have to

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,060
perform some complex tasks

57
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,440
um it might have to get several items uh

58
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,500
in order to you know eat eat an apple or

59
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,959
things like that so you could you could

60
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,940
see that maybe maybe

61
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,519
um some symbolic State space sort of

62
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,080
mediates the connection between things

63
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,300
you do in the world and Transformations

64
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,000
that you make on some internal State

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,060
space and of course real you know Real

66
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,739
Worlds

67
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,920
um organisms and humans are live in a

68
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,300
high dimensional world so you could

69
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,940
imagine that there's an encoder and a

70
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,959
decoder

71
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,120
and really you know there's a sort of

72
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,760
high dimensional uh physiological or

73
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,800
interceptive

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,640
um domain that that is these sort of Y

75
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,220
tilde with the dot

76
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,800
um for y tilde I should say and Z tell

77
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,780
them and then there's you know High

78
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,760
dimensional worlds you could just say

79
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,099
that the that's X tilde

80
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,800
and really you just need to sort of uh

81
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,780
map these down to some discrete State

82
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,459
space in which uh these domains can uh

83
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,080
interact

84
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,599
so

85
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,060
yeah here here's like a simple encoder

86
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,280
and decoder and

87
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,159
and so if if an agent

88
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,459
has a kind of simple ontology like this

89
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,379
you can imagine that it's sort of

90
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,260
generatively entrained to the world uh

91
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,580
that it lives in

92
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,980
uh which is a notion that's probably

93
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,900
um pretty familiar to sort of active

94
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,080
inference uh people

95
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,480
um so you know you have some encoder of

96
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,459
these high dimensional States and then

97
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,820
you have some uh operator PS which is in

98
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,460
the middle of the head here and that

99
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,320
just sort of advances the latent States

100
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,780
and then you decode and you'll get a

101
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,259
sort of expectations of of the high

102
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,120
dimensional world that the the agent

103
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,400
lives in

104
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,500
and so

105
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,780
the problem is is that you can't really

106
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,560
represent explicitly these latent space

107
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,080
transition operators that would dictate

108
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,440
you know the Dynamics of of all these

109
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,419
variables you can't represent it as an

110
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,880
explicit object because the more State

111
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,400
spaces that you keep track of in the

112
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,900
world uh the larger this uh object PS

113
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,419
becomes so

114
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,060
in order to handle this you'd have to

115
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,220
represent it in a sort of factorized

116
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,040
form so you just would represent its

117
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,860
factors you wouldn't explicitly sort of

118
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,080
enumerate all of the state Vector

119
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,360
transitions under under this transition

120
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,860
operator

121
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,860
and so

122
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,440
what we really need to think about is

123
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,120
you know what are the sort of model

124
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,380
based

125
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,680
or the sort of bellman principles for

126
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,120
decomposing hierarchical State spaces

127
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,280
um so that we can create the right

128
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,460
representations that help us plan in a

129
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,580
flexible way in a sort of time to time

130
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,000
varying time dependent uh world of lots

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,199
of lots of variables so this just means

132
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,940
um you know what is a sort of objective

133
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,080
function L telegraphic L applied to PS

134
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,199
or its factorization that would give us

135
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,740
um that would give us some factors here

136
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,160
uh Ada and and these omegas that could

137
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,900
help us plan

138
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,940
and also

139
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,880
how you know given the fact that you

140
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,220
know the state space the effective

141
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,259
product space that we're working at is

142
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,780
so large and there's many possible State

143
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,000
vectors that describe possible states of

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,479
the world how do you know what to do I

145
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,759
mean if you're an RL theorist you would

146
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,440
have to say well there exists some kind

147
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,100
of reward function that tells you you

148
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,440
know this state of the world is is worth

149
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,940
this much reward in this state of the

150
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,000
world is worth this much reward but it's

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
not really clear how you should Define

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
reward functions on huge product spaces

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,600
so I'll address this a question from uh

154
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,919
sort of reward free perspective and the

155
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,020
just to give you a hint of what it's

156
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,340
going to be like what I'm going to argue

157
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,600
is that what we really need are agents

158
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,600
that have a kind of structured core

159
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,759
ontology that it needs to maintain that

160
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,979
is coupled State spaces that really

161
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,680
depend on each other

162
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,500
in which the policies that you use

163
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,180
maintain the sort of internal Integrity

164
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,840
or controllability of the agent

165
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,680
um

166
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,000
so

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,680
and that's where empowerment will

168
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,539
eventually come in so I'll talk about

169
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,000
empowerment a little too that's the

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,919
controllability metric

171
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,300
so

172
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,740
um here I'm just saying what's a nice

173
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,740
policy or what's an objective function f

174
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,979
that takes in some intrinsic motivation

175
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:43,380
function which is this fancy V here

176
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,639
along with a nice factorization that

177
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,800
that allows you to plan in the world

178
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,139
okay so just to recap things that I

179
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,220
already said

180
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,240
um we're in a product space of uh state

181
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,880
of variables we have internal and

182
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,400
external State spaces

183
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,960
um you know hunger and hydration State

184
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,000
spaces can be dynamic as you do things

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,880
in the world you get hungrier

186
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,580
um so how do we plan how do we know what

187
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,199
a good goal is and what I'm going to

188
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,880
argue is that we should compute a

189
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,280
specific representation called estate

190
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,500
time feasibility function

191
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,919
which is going to be an abstraction uh

192
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,720
that's going to map us from initial

193
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,000
State times to final State times and

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,379
this will have some really nice

195
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,080
properties that allow us to sort of

196
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,080
reason in this High dimensional uh State

197
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,240
space and I'm going to talk about this

198
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,599
from a just a dynamic programming uh

199
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,219
point of view there's there isn't going

200
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,440
to be any learning

201
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,040
okay so let's just talk about transition

202
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,720
operator composition because I said well

203
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,760
we have this large product space State

204
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,860
variables and it'd be nice if we just

205
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,320
represent it as a factorization so what

206
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,120
does that mean

207
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,779
um

208
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,300
so imagine that you have PX which is

209
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,980
like a base State space to move around

210
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,380
the world and you have some internal

211
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,839
State space or secondary State space p y

212
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,720
and these are linked by some function f

213
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,260
so here's your base State space and uh

214
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,940
here's the honey badger in the state

215
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,920
space

216
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,580
and here's the secondary State space

217
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,260
which is just like a you know your

218
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,320
internal hunger space

219
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,600
um and so F what f is going to be is

220
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,120
called an availability function and an

221
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,160
availability function is going to say oh

222
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,740
this you know this honey badger is in

223
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,420
state x a t and at time T and given that

224
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,040
it's there

225
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,200
um what's the probability that this goal

226
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,120
is available from this State time State

227
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,839
action time and so this goal is formally

228
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,120
going to be an action on the higher

229
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,880
level State space so for instance these

230
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,240
green lines on the uh high-level State

231
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,120
space are going to map you to you know

232
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,100
the most

233
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,019
satiated uh state where you're not

234
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,940
hungry anymore at all and then these

235
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,740
black lines on the on the internal State

236
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,420
space are just going to decrement you

237
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,240
you know one States if you're if you're

238
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,880
not at the tree so you eat apples at the

239
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,019
tree and that's going to map you to the

240
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,720
top and all other states without a tree

241
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,540
you're going to get hungrier over time

242
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,140
okay so if we wanted to write a product

243
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,200
space operator uh you know PDS you know

244
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,940
y Prime X Prime

245
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,820
uh we can just represent this as a

246
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,680
composition where Lambda p is our

247
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,360
composition operator and it's just going

248
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,500
to be defined as the product of uh your

249
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,760
two State spaces with f linking them and

250
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,440
then we sum over G so we're getting rid

251
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,180
of the goal variable and so we can

252
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,019
represent the uh the product space this

253
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:56,459
way and we can also just call the

254
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,100
product space we can say that s bold s

255
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,279
here is just the state Vector for you

256
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,500
know Y X or if we have more variables

257
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,740
that can be incorporated into bold s

258
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,360
Okay so

259
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:14,339
what if we have more features of the

260
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,279
world we can drink water or we can get

261
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,740
warm at the house

262
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,180
um well we will need to have a a bigger

263
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,420
composition so we can just create an

264
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,300
operator called we'll just call PR or

265
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,380
bold R is just a state factor of w y and

266
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,100
c and W Y and Z correspond to the

267
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,680
hydration uh the the hunger and the

268
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,120
temperature space

269
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,700
and so this is just a product of the

270
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,180
individual ones uh individual operators

271
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,700
and so this influence graph is

272
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,899
connecting PX to uh PW p y and TZ

273
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,720
through F and so we can just Define the

274
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,600
product space operator as a composition

275
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,980
this way

276
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,980
and if we do that you know you start to

277
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,040
realize well this is nice because the

278
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,040
effect of State space you know

279
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,839
exponentiates essentially you know as

280
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,019
you add on more State spaces that you

281
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,399
can control

282
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,620
and so this influence graph is just

283
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,140
showing you know you know what is the

284
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,079
sort of ontology of the agent what is

285
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,500
what what constitutes it uh as its

286
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,839
internal and external coupling

287
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,700
and you could imagine that it gets more

288
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,640
complicated for instance that if you hit

289
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,079
you know w0 or y y zero or whatever that

290
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,480
you you these skull and crossbones

291
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,820
indicates that you die so you can

292
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,800
imagine being in a state has a

293
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,600
bi-directional influence so Zeta here is

294
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,060
um is conditioning the possible Dynamics

295
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,700
PX can produce so you could imagine that

296
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,320
you know once you're in one of those

297
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,420
sort of defective bad states that it

298
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,579
kills you and you can't move around so

299
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,860
you can imagine you know sort of more

300
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,399
complicated uh structures like this

301
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,079
which essentially mean that you have to

302
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,180
go out in the world and do things in

303
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,820
order to keep the system alive uh so you

304
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,180
don't want to hit W you know w w naught

305
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,639
or Z naught

306
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,019
um and you can imagine this gets even

307
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,019
more complicated you could compose sort

308
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:28,740
of larger structures where P Sigma is

309
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,420
going to be some logical State space

310
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,079
that keeps track of you know multiple

311
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,519
conditional events that need to occur to

312
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,399
for say you know say eat eaten apple or

313
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,680
something like that

314
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,639
um

315
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,519
so representing it in this form is is

316
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,860
very nice we just represent the factors

317
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,320
and the the links between the state

318
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,740
spaces and that's a sort of a sort of

319
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,100
memory efficient way of representing the

320
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,540
space

321
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,459
okay so if we have a homeostatic task

322
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,260
um I'll eventually get to the the sort

323
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,779
of bellman equations in the model based

324
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,360
form formulas but first i'm just going

325
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,260
to sort of uh build up an intuition in

326
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,839
the form of an example about how these

327
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,579
State time feasibility functions are

328
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,139
going to work the the state times

329
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,880
usability function being the the

330
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,579
representation that I'm arguing for in

331
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,860
in this talk

332
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,440
so if we have a hiker

333
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,779
um and it can go into the world and

334
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,000
drink and eat and get warm

335
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,660
uh with these goal variables well there

336
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,220
there's also

337
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,100
um this goal variable G Epsilon which is

338
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,440
going to uh decrement by by one uh by

339
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,300
one state

340
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:54,060
then as the uh as the hiker moves around

341
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,160
you can

342
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,199
you could represent this as a function

343
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:02,040
so imagine that the hiker starts at xg1

344
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,839
that's the house

345
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,380
and TS which is the start time and if

346
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,279
the hiker follows a policy Pi 2. so

347
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,220
imagine that you have a policy that is a

348
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,220
goal like a gold condition policy Pi G2

349
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,760
that's going to take you to xg2

350
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,920
okay so it's a policy it's like a

351
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,279
shortest path policy or whatever

352
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,440
um then that means that there's going to

353
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,639
be some final State time xg2 TF

354
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,699
uh that you achieve this goal g-drink

355
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:38,579
which remember is is an action on the

356
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,300
higher level space

357
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,600
so what this would look like is that you

358
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,540
decrement two rights because that takes

359
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,639
two time steps to get to the leg and

360
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,920
then once you get to the lake you take

361
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,720
the state action that's going to drink

362
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,279
and it's going to bring you up so

363
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,160
there's there's three total steps in

364
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,240
this uh process of uh inducing the drink

365
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,519
goal variable and then the step after

366
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,519
drinking

367
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,980
which would look like this

368
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,160
and then you can imagine well the other

369
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,760
state spaces are are not involved and so

370
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,980
they will all decrement three because

371
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,199
there's three time steps

372
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:26,459
and so one way to represent this is is

373
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:30,720
to realize that uh if all of these goal

374
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,540
variable sort of goal variables on the

375
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,600
way to the um to the lake are sort of

376
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,880
the null goal variables meaning that the

377
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,920
agent isn't affecting some other state

378
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,000
space

379
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,399
then you can Define that as a Markov

380
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,639
chain so if you set you know all of the

381
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,259
goals to be uh the Epsilon goal the null

382
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:53,339
goal

383
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:58,800
then this py Epsilon is going to be

384
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,399
um a Markov chain Matrix and so that

385
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,419
means that the time difference

386
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:07,559
um

387
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,480
encoded in the state time feasibility

388
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,260
function the TF minus TS is going to be

389
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,880
the power that you can take this Markov

390
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,900
chain to in order to forward evolve the

391
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,260
uh this the internal State spaces all

392
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,359
the other internal State spaces so you

393
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,240
can define a an operator that does this

394
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,900
in one step called Omega Y which is just

395
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,580
going to take some initial States so

396
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,000
this Green Dot or this Red Dot

397
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,179
[Music]

398
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:37,559
um

399
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,360
and it's going to take the time

400
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,520
difference so this is going to be 2 to

401
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,440
get from the house to the lake it's two

402
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,880
time steps and so these uh gray arcs are

403
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,660
just a an initial to final state map

404
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,980
under this policy

405
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,780
and so

406
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,179
what this looks like this is sort of

407
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,039
looks sort of complicated but you can

408
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,340
build a jump operator that jumps you

409
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,360
from your initial High dimensional state

410
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,280
for instance y x t

411
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,320
and we're just considering why for now I

412
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,320
don't have the other state spaces uh w

413
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,000
and z in here but uh this Ada over here

414
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,720
is is mapping you on the X space the

415
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,100
Omega Y is mapping you forward to in in

416
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,600
the uh

417
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,780
in the y space and then the py and the p

418
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,620
x are just evolving by one step

419
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,500
um to update after you hit the goal so

420
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,700
after you hit the goal you have to

421
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,480
update by one step so uh p y and PS do

422
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,059
that for both state spaces and then of

423
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:49,080
course

424
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,840
you can do this for all the state spaces

425
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,080
so a jump operator for all of the

426
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,480
internal State spaces are

427
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,660
where R is you know remembers the vector

428
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,160
of all your internal States w y and z

429
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,559
then this is similarly defined where

430
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,280
umega

431
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,520
Omega R is just the product of all of

432
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,520
these other omegas so we defined Omega y

433
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,440
up here but you can just Define this for

434
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,700
all of your other state spaces

435
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,440
so

436
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,340
now that we've done that we can continue

437
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,039
our journey by going to the tree

438
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,740
and so that's two steps away so all of

439
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,600
the other things decrement two and then

440
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,160
an additional one

441
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,799
and then if we go back to the house

442
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:43,679
that's four times steps away plus the

443
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,039
the additional time step of uh entering

444
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,960
the housing and getting warm

445
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,160
okay

446
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,500
so

447
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,740
here is another route you could take

448
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,679
uh where the uh agent the hiker goes to

449
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,460
the tree to eat and then the hiker goes

450
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,600
to the lake to drink

451
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,820
and then goes back to the house to get

452
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,960
warm and so this is this JS is a huge

453
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,780
it's important to keep in mind that JS

454
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,020
is a huge operator and we cannot

455
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,320
uh explicitly form it in memory uh

456
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,380
because it's unless we have you know a

457
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,200
lot of memory on our computer

458
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,600
um but having this factorization allows

459
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,320
us to chain policies together and evolve

460
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,140
a high dimensional State vector in these

461
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,380
jumps so we're we're jumping a state

462
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,720
Vector around in this object-oriented

463
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,740
fashion where each state Vector is

464
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,400
updated once you get to some key object

465
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,440
of Interest such as the tree with the

466
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,360
the apple or the lake with the water

467
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,559
so um also in this uh example you can

468
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,260
see that it the the agent went from the

469
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,860
lake to the house and

470
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,360
um technically if Z it it occupies the

471
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,940
lowest State Z zero and so technically

472
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,640
it should die uh at least skull and

473
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,679
crossbones on the map but we let it

474
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,539
finish uh his journey and we haven't

475
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,580
talked about this sort of bi-directional

476
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,320
coupling yet but we'll we'll do that in

477
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,600
the next slide to

478
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,380
um to make that concrete

479
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,600
all right

480
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,280
so

481
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,039
if we have these defective States we can

482
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,940
define mode parameters e plus and E

483
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,460
minus which

484
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,020
um are just going to be variables that

485
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,299
condition our Dynamics and we can have a

486
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:51,179
mode function that takes any Vector r

487
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:55,320
uh and so an R is any Vector of blue

488
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,620
green and red squares in the space and

489
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,740
we can map it to a mode parameter so we

490
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,679
can Define Zeta

491
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,400
to map to the good mode the the normal

492
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,620
healthy mode

493
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,780
um if it's not occupying any of the

494
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,260
defective States but if one one or more

495
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,940
um you know defective states are

496
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,659
occupied then we can map it to e minus

497
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:24,480
and so that means if we have some you

498
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,799
know low level transition operator

499
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,200
that's indexed by E that means we can

500
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,320
split it into a normal Dynamics

501
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,220
p e plus and a defective Dynamics p e

502
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,559
minus and you just know notice that the

503
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,480
defective Dynamics is the sort of

504
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,000
identity operation it just sort of

505
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,919
arrests your Dynamics in the space so

506
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,299
you can't move around but the normal

507
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:48,539
Dynamics is just normal grid world uh

508
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:49,860
movement

509
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:55,320
okay and so what we can do is we can

510
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,679
compute a set of individual feasibility

511
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,440
functions for each object of interest in

512
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,799
the map so in in the previous example we

513
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,460
had you know two trees two lakes and a

514
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,340
house so it would have five state-time

515
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,620
feasibility functions

516
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,640
and then this Ada hat is an aggregate

517
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,120
function of of all of these uh functions

518
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,700
where the pi is indexing the

519
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,299
corresponding Pi for that function

520
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:30,179
of anyone can ask questions by the way

521
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,679
if they have any questions

522
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:37,880
all right

523
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,280
all right so

524
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:48,600
the full Dynamics is going to be just

525
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,360
defined like we defined it before where

526
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,799
we uh we have uh these two State spaces

527
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,320
the base State space coupled to the

528
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,419
internal State space through F but then

529
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:04,200
we have this Zeta uh R here on the

530
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,320
conditioning side and so this is a sort

531
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,940
of uh a a an operator that you sort of

532
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,280
have to

533
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,220
uh you have to achieve goals in order to

534
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,100
keep yourself out of uh these sort of

535
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,760
absorbing defective States

536
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,120
and this is and I showed this um

537
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,620
influence diagram before but this

538
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,039
influence diagram uh is capturing uh

539
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,940
this coupling

540
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,620
Okay so

541
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,340
um

542
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,679
many of you will probably be familiar

543
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,320
with the standard Bellman equations

544
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,100
um

545
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,880
where which are you know formalized this

546
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,940
way where you have some reward function

547
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,600
plus some discounted expectation of your

548
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,059
future value and so the value function

549
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:58,620
in a sort of standard Bellman equation

550
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,020
says how much reward am I going to get

551
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,940
if I act

552
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,740
um here optimally

553
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,740
um over an infinite Horizon

554
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,659
and so the reward function is that's

555
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,840
often thought to be a task it has that

556
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,299
sort of semantics in in RL land

557
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:19,320
um

558
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,900
and then the optimal policy is just

559
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,659
going to return the action uh that

560
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:27,240
corresponds to the best action that

561
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,380
maximizes your value your long run sum

562
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,299
of rewards that you're going to get

563
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:37,320
so this is a a recursive equation and

564
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,840
but in this

565
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,960
uh my my thesis is is is that we need to

566
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,620
rethink the sort of model-based bellman

567
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,620
uh formalizations in order to compute

568
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,080
these nice factorizations that move us

569
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,600
around High dimensional space like we've

570
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,919
been talking about on the previous

571
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,299
slides

572
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,419
so we're going to formalize some new

573
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,340
development equations called operator

574
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,960
development equations

575
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,140
and these are going to be

576
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,380
uh non-stationary development equations

577
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,539
or they're going to be functions of time

578
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:18,059
so instead of having a value function

579
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,159
that says you know what's the

580
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,860
accumulated reward that I get I'm going

581
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,779
to have a cumulative feasibility

582
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,059
function Kappa

583
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,360
and this is going to represent what is

584
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,460
the cumulative probability that I

585
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,980
achieve a particular goal where a goal

586
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,020
remember is an action on a higher level

587
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,320
space

588
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,080
so this has a very similar form to the

589
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,460
infinite Horizon development equation

590
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,919
that I just showed but you'll notice

591
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:49,380
that we have this availability function

592
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,200
here for a specific goal so this is a

593
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,240
single goal G that we're picking out so

594
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,840
say the uh the Eden Apple goal or the

595
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,580
drink the water goal we're just choosing

596
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,539
one

597
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,960
and so f is

598
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,679
um returning the availability of G from

599
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,100
any given State and time and action

600
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,940
and then so it either the agent achieves

601
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,400
a goal now which is what this equation

602
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,659
is saying or which is the plus the agent

603
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:27,120
does not achieve the goal so one minus

604
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,220
the probability of achieving the goal is

605
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,059
the probability that you you don't

606
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:34,740
achieve the goal

607
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,559
times the expectation that you achieve

608
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,740
it in the future so it has this similar

609
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,100
recursive structure that the infinite

610
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,400
Horizon development equation has

611
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:53,580
okay so then we have the policy and this

612
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,200
policy equation is a little different

613
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,679
from the last one because you can

614
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,260
imagine that you can maximize the

615
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,260
cumulative that you achieve a goal but

616
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,940
you you sort of do it at the last second

617
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,520
you have a lot of you have maximized

618
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,500
certainty that you can get to the store

619
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,559
right before it closes so you have you

620
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:16,380
know you know 100 that you can achieve

621
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,600
the goal of getting an item from the

622
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,520
store you know five minutes before it

623
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,279
closes well it might be if the store is

624
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,020
open for some you know period of time

625
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,799
that

626
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:29,640
um

627
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,039
essentially you might want to get it as

628
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:34,020
soon as possible so what this equation

629
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,039
is saying is that we're going to

630
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,779
pick the action

631
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:43,200
which maximizes the cumulative but from

632
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,600
that set of equivalent actions that

633
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,700
maximize the cumulative which is a star

634
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,980
so we're collecting the actions that

635
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,559
maximize the cumulative and we're going

636
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,960
to pick the one that minimizes the time

637
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,120
so this is a sort of conditional

638
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,820
optimization that says you know subject

639
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,460
to the fact that we want to maximize the

640
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,760
cumulative we want to get there as fast

641
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,299
as we can

642
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,299
um and so normally there's just you know

643
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:13,799
with the infinite Horizon development

644
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,120
equation there's the value function in

645
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,000
the policy here we have a third

646
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,179
um uh function which is the state time

647
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:22,799
feasibility function which I've been

648
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,240
talking about

649
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,520
and the state time feasibility function

650
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,500
says given that I start at x and t

651
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,840
what's the probability that I achieve a

652
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,159
goal G

653
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:39,240
at a particular State final State and

654
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,399
time XF and TF

655
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,559
and so

656
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,140
um you can compute this via dynamic

657
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,059
programming as you're Computing these

658
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,679
other functions

659
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,539
and

660
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,480
um there's a relationship between the

661
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,860
cumulative feasibility and the state

662
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,100
time feasibility which is that if you

663
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,460
you can sum up the individual spinal

664
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,039
States and times in that uh from your

665
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,320
state time feasibility and that is the

666
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,820
cumulative

667
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,340
so the cumulative feasibility it's just

668
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,200
summing over the individual

669
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,299
probabilities of a of a given State

670
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:18,000
final State time

671
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,779
and the nice property is that when you

672
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,640
move when you use these operator Bellman

673
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,919
equations on hierarchical state spaces

674
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,679
such as the product space

675
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,880
um of the agent's core ontology

676
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,799
um it has a nice decomposition property

677
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,279
which is that if you're just solving to

678
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,700
go to a particular point in the world

679
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,659
then you can actually you compute Ada

680
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:48,659
separately from the high level space so

681
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:51,059
you just solve for for Ada the state

682
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,220
time feasibility function on the low

683
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,220
level space but then Omega can be

684
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,919
computed independently in the high level

685
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:01,860
space and they can be combined so this

686
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,539
decomposition property is really nice

687
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:05,520
because we never want to work in a

688
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,919
product space

689
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:10,080
especially as we learn tons of Dynamics

690
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,960
about how the world works we need to we

691
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,220
need to be able to compute

692
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,860
representations in a factorized way

693
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,220
which is going to help us move around uh

694
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,600
in reason

695
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,220
so

696
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,000
the this means that you know when we

697
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,380
compute

698
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,740
um a bunch of uh individual State time

699
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,140
feasibility functions for each goal I

700
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,580
don't know why this little hat is here

701
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,080
but

702
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,039
um

703
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,320
then if we have you know five of these

704
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,360
and we have an aggregate feasibility

705
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,919
function

706
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,080
then we can use this aggregate

707
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,720
feasibility function

708
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,360
to move around from

709
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,700
uh from feature to feature in the low

710
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,860
level World and update all of our

711
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,299
internal and higher level States

712
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:02,520
and so

713
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,320
this is the object from the previous

714
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,480
slides that that sort of map us around

715
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,580
the world

716
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,799
so you can also do and I won't talk

717
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,840
about this much but you can also you

718
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,820
know do logical tasks where instead of

719
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,380
eating an apple you might want to gather

720
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,919
an Apple so if you if you go obtain an

721
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,960
apple then there could be a bit that

722
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,820
corresponds to having an apple and you

723
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,740
flip that bit to one once you go to the

724
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,080
tree and then you go gather water at the

725
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,140
lake and you flip that bit and then you

726
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,860
go to the key and you uh obtain that key

727
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,679
and that might be a task where you have

728
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,179
to do these three you have to obtain

729
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:41,460
these three items perhaps because you

730
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,740
wanted to compose this task with

731
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,779
something else you want to you know

732
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,880
bring these items to another agent or

733
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,520
whatever so the point is is that you can

734
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,559
use these factorizations to move around

735
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,600
the world especially when you know

736
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,820
things in the world have a sort of

737
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,860
limited time period in which they are

738
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,840
available

739
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,480
so

740
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,260
um

741
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,779
so yeah I talked about

742
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,580
how we can plan in these high

743
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,919
dimensional State spaces

744
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,700
uh using this factorization

745
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,679
and now

746
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,260
um we get to the question well why

747
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,640
should I

748
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,919
plan to any particular High dimensional

749
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,980
States that's the intrinsic motivation

750
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,559
question you know given that there's an

751
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,659
exponential number of State vectors in a

752
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:34,500
product space Y is one why is one state

753
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,779
Vector of the world you know in the

754
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:39,860
far-off distance better than another

755
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,080
so that's where empowerment comes in

756
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,399
empowerment is an intrinsic motivation

757
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,399
metric which sort of represents

758
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,760
controllability so formally empowerment

759
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,059
is a function of a transition operator

760
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:01,320
it's a it's an intrinsic uh measure of

761
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,440
an intern of a transition operator and

762
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,539
it's and you can also condition it on

763
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:09,300
the states that an agent is at so it

764
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,520
takes two arguments

765
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,760
it also has a horizon n which we'll talk

766
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,139
about in a second

767
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,940
um so it's formally defined it's the

768
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,040
Shannon Channel capacity between your

769
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,179
actuators or sequences of actions that

770
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,179
you take and the resulting States so the

771
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,800
channel capacity

772
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,739
uh so here you know an open loop

773
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,780
sequence of actions would just be a you

774
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,260
know go up right and up again or up left

775
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,239
and then down

776
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,460
um there's a whole bunch there there are

777
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,560
a lot of possible sequences of actions

778
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,859
so big a here is a random variable for

779
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:50,399
your sequences of actions and so for a

780
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,940
horizon n you can ask what's how much

781
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,540
information can we transmit from our

782
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,320
actuators to the resulting State at time

783
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,359
Tau so Tau minus uh Tau minus t is our

784
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:09,540
Horizon uh n which is this parameter on

785
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,940
the empowerment so it's just saying you

786
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,339
know how much what's what's the agent's

787
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:18,420
capacity to affect the future with uh

788
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,420
certainty or or varying amounts of

789
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,560
certainty

790
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,960
and so the channel capacity is formally

791
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,500
defined as the maximum Mutual

792
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,380
information Givens uh distribution over

793
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,760
these action sequences

794
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,880
um and the mutual information decomposes

795
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,240
into the entropy of the final States

796
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,980
minus the conditional entropy of the

797
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,980
final State random uh random variable

798
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,760
given that you know given the actions

799
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,160
and and your starting state

800
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,380
so

801
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,560
this means that there are two sort of

802
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,480
like

803
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,820
extremes to empowerment

804
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,940
um if PX is a deterministic operator

805
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,880
and so anytime I'm at State X and I

806
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,540
apply an action I get a deter

807
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,400
deterministic output X Prime

808
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,320
then

809
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,660
um the conditional entropy

810
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,960
there there's going to be no uncertainty

811
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,839
over my future States so the entropy is

812
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,940
going to be zero there's no uncertainty

813
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,280
and so that means that the conditional

814
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,540
entropy has to uh cancel out and so

815
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,420
empowerment is really just the maximum

816
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,960
possible entropy given

817
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,960
this distribution and this just reduces

818
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,599
down to the log of the number of

819
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,820
possible reachable States so how much

820
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,500
can I actually reach

821
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,839
in the world

822
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,099
um

823
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:55,980
and so you know if my Horizon is two we

824
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,900
can see that the empowerment here is

825
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,440
just log of 13. so I get there are 13

826
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,240
states I can get to and I have perfect

827
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,940
control so I can actually realize any of

828
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,240
those 13 states if I want

829
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,380
and the Other Extreme is if like if PX

830
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,079
is action independent meaning that any

831
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,180
sort of state that I'm in I have an

832
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,839
action that maybe there's a the same you

833
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,060
know distribution given that action say

834
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,450
a uniform distribution

835
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,240
[Music]

836
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,200
um then you know my conditional uh

837
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,220
my uh and my conditional entropy given

838
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,220
the actions is just going to be uh the

839
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,540
entropy and so the empowerment has to be

840
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,820
zero because this term is going to

841
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,920
cancel out

842
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,320
um and so there might be a lot of States

843
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,119
you can technically reach because I can

844
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,680
select actions I'm just going to go

845
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,839
random places so pink is all the states

846
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,599
I could possibly reach but I don't have

847
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,760
any control over which state I'm going

848
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,400
to result I'm going to end up in

849
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,000
and so I can't influence my future in

850
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,560
any way

851
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,280
um

852
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,140
even though there are a lot of possible

853
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,420
Futures so empowerment in that extreme

854
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,940
is zero and then there's

855
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,099
um you know an in-between Zone where you

856
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:19,740
know you take actions and there's a bias

857
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,839
in One Direction or there's different

858
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,300
distributions for each action and so

859
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,280
there might be uncertainty but you can

860
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,980
sort of control how much information you

861
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,020
can sort of control what state that you

862
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,680
want to end up at

863
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,040
okay so what I'm going to Define is a

864
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,980
function valence

865
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,440
um and

866
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,300
it's important to note that you know

867
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,060
there's there's two arguments uh the

868
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,859
states and you can include the time too

869
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:52,260
and the conditioning side so you have

870
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,960
empowerment uh

871
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,420
and

872
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,640
um so you can define a diff an

873
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,920
empowerment difference so say you start

874
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,859
at uh s and t

875
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:07,859
and then you

876
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:10,020
um end up at a future State and time

877
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,619
after you've execute some sequence of

878
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:16,140
policies so row here

879
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,380
uh appended to the s t is a sequence of

880
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,260
policies and S row and T row are the

881
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,000
resulting States

882
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,160
then you can compute an empowerment

883
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,900
difference

884
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,920
and this will be our valence function

885
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,960
so Q here is our is a function I'll talk

886
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,660
about in in just a second but we can see

887
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,619
that

888
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:41,220
um

889
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,859
our our jump operator that's moving

890
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:46,460
around High dimensional space

891
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,800
is defined as this factorization so we

892
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,119
don't have to represent it remember

893
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,040
that's an important part

894
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,440
and so we can sample you know multiple

895
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,660
policies from this or chains of policies

896
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,480
so if I have policy one policy two then

897
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,079
I'm going to have some resulting State R

898
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,220
double Prime X double Prime TF2

899
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,880
um and so Q here can just represent out

900
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,160
the output of chains of policies so you

901
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,160
can imagine you know a tree search of

902
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,960
chains of policies and Q is just

903
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,240
summarizing the final state of those

904
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,200
branches in a research of policies of

905
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,859
chains of policies

906
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,780
all right

907
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:34,020
so we can use this Q right so notice

908
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,599
that this Q here is in the expectation

909
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,780
over here so uh it's linking our

910
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,119
original state time to the final State

911
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:44,339
time so it's the empowerment after some

912
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:47,160
chain of policies

913
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,300
okay so if we have

914
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:49,680
[Music]

915
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,680
um

916
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,619
uh so say we have a deterministic

917
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,920
operator and this should be a p

918
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,720
um then valence is an empowerment

919
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,480
difference we can have a simple sort of

920
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,700
example here where we have two hikers

921
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,339
that are considering two different plans

922
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:09,900
and so

923
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,640
if this tree here is like the space of

924
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,460
um you know two possible chains of

925
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,720
policies

926
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,240
then these hikers are just executing you

927
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,260
know one sort of path through this tree

928
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,579
so the um

929
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:30,900
the hiker on the so they both have the

930
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,980
same empowerment because they're

931
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,520
starting at the same state

932
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,980
and they're both too away from starving

933
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,900
so they if we just consider an

934
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,780
empowerment at the beginning that's a

935
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,940
log of 13.

936
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,140
and if we chain together two uh two

937
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:54,119
policies here we can advance our

938
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:54,900
um

939
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,300
internal State space and the agent will

940
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,400
end up down at the lake

941
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,160
and so given that it's at the lake

942
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,560
you'll notice that it's one state away

943
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,099
from uh from dying so that there's

944
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,940
effect an effective range of what it can

945
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,820
uh where it can go so the empower the

946
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,460
final empowerment is log five because

947
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,040
there's five reachable states and we're

948
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,339
assuming determinism to make this easy

949
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:27,300
so the valence here and this should be

950
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,200
PS uh here but I have t here but the

951
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,000
valence is just log 5 minus log 13 and

952
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,160
that's the difference between the final

953
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,260
and the initial and so that has a

954
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,619
negative valence uh the the hiker the

955
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:44,760
yellow

956
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,640
Spirit hiker is clearly in a worse

957
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,000
position that he started off at

958
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,859
but we can advance the uh other hiker

959
00:42:55,859 --> 00:43:00,180
with uh Pi G3 to the lake and then Pi G4

960
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,160
to the tree

961
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,780
and updates

962
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,780
his internal States

963
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,140
and we can see that he's three away from

964
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,240
dying so there's a bigger effective

965
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,220
range

966
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,619
um and so there are 25 states that he

967
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:18,100
can get to and

968
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,319
[Music]

969
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:25,579
um so log of 25 minus log of 13 is 0.94

970
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:30,780
which means that uh he is he's better

971
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,780
off than where he started and so clearly

972
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,540
um the second hiker is executing a

973
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,859
better plan

974
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:42,180
um yet he has more freedom to uh to

975
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,640
engage with other tasks in the world

976
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,480
and so if if we you know searched over

977
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,619
this entire tree of policy chance uh we

978
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:54,720
could pick the best one uh and then in

979
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,280
this example we're just going to

980
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,280
consider two two of these uh branches

981
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:06,140
and we'd pick policy IG IG hi G3 Pi G4

982
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,280
all right

983
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,920
so there's also an another interesting

984
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,740
so in in this past example we're just

985
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,900
sort of changing the structure we're

986
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,020
just changing the initial state

987
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,119
um but since empowerment is also a

988
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,700
function of a transition operator

989
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,060
and our operator Bellman equations are

990
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,819
producing transition operators that map

991
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:31,920
us from State time to State time

992
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,440
then the output of those Bellman

993
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,440
equations the operator Bellman equations

994
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,300
produce transition operators so we can

995
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,940
compute their empowerment

996
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,740
uh so that's that's a deep connection

997
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,040
between development equations and these

998
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,380
intrinsic motivation metrics

999
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,319
so we can do interesting things where we

1000
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,720
can say well if the structure of the

1001
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,420
world were different then the

1002
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,040
feasibility functions that I could

1003
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,500
compute in different configurations of

1004
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,520
the world would be different so

1005
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,660
if

1006
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,180
if the honey badger gets a key

1007
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,180
and it opens a door in the mountain pass

1008
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,200
then it could it could potentially get

1009
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,760
through the other side but it's

1010
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,819
important to note that this is changing

1011
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:23,880
this the structure of the low-level

1012
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,680
State space so p e naught is what we'll

1013
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,960
call the the original transition

1014
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,640
operator in which we can't go through

1015
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,140
the mountain pass

1016
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,780
and that means that if we compute State

1017
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,839
time feasibility functions kit on this

1018
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:44,160
operator that means PPE here is going

1019
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,160
into the development equation

1020
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,200
then we're going to produce you know

1021
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,000
State time feasibility functions from

1022
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,980
those operator Bellman equations that's

1023
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,400
this uh object here which means that we

1024
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,560
can use it to construct J to move us

1025
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,780
around High dimensional space

1026
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,140
and so there's a an empowerment for this

1027
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,400
J

1028
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,040
but then if we get the key and the key

1029
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,200
allows us to move through the door it

1030
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,160
changes the structure of the world then

1031
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,839
that's a different

1032
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,540
um that's a different mode of Dynamics

1033
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,760
so that means that

1034
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,680
all of the supplies on the other side

1035
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,240
where we can compute you know

1036
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,819
feasibility functions off of a different

1037
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:29,460
mode of Dynamics in which we can move to

1038
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,800
the mountain pass and so that means we

1039
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,020
can compute things you know

1040
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,800
um by compute valence by asking you know

1041
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,980
is is this configuration configuration

1042
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,859
of the world more conducive to the

1043
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:46,500
agent's core ontology that is the

1044
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,619
agent's internal external coupling that

1045
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:51,720
needs to be maintained

1046
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,890
um as a as a sort of core object

1047
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,040
[Music]

1048
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,380
and so we can compute valence just by

1049
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,800
changing J the structure of the agent's

1050
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,640
abstractions that it moves to go to

1051
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,220
um perform tasks in the world so by

1052
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,560
Computing empowerment on J we're sort of

1053
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,599
computing it in task space we don't have

1054
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:16,079
we don't have to consider all possible

1055
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,760
states of the product space we can

1056
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,400
narrow it down to

1057
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,740
um to operators that move us around task

1058
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,859
space that induce Dynamics on you know

1059
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:27,540
key other state spaces that we care

1060
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,920
about maintaining such as our

1061
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,880
physiological State spaces

1062
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,900
okay so here here's a simple example say

1063
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,380
uh the honey badger uh starts at the

1064
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:44,099
lake and has some initial

1065
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:44,760
um

1066
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,520
empowerment uh just on the low level

1067
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,920
operator so that's p

1068
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,960
uh five zero

1069
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,180
uh there

1070
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,640
there's 12 states that can reach but it

1071
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,400
also has a task empowerment

1072
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,500
um which is actually zero because

1073
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,020
there's only one task that it can in

1074
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:07,380
engage at uh in if you don't include

1075
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,520
getting the key as a task so

1076
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,440
um the circle here is saying that

1077
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,720
there's only one one sort of task that

1078
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,099
can be done

1079
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,619
and so if the agent goes and gets the

1080
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:20,819
key

1081
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:24,000
uh that's going to it's going to uh you

1082
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,319
know reduce its physiological States

1083
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,420
because it had to travel there

1084
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,060
and then it gets the key and it uh

1085
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,859
conditions a different mode of Dynamics

1086
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:33,240
so there's different feasibility

1087
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,119
functions associated with that mode uh

1088
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:37,800
which I just described on the on the

1089
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,359
last slide

1090
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,160
then

1091
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,220
uh the the door will open and it can

1092
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,839
travel back to the lake

1093
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,660
and so now that it's at the lake it can

1094
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,200
uh go uh eats food on the other side

1095
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,220
right so before getting the key uh if it

1096
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,660
couldn't get the key if there were no

1097
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,119
key then it would just starve because

1098
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:01,560
um well it could drink water and stay

1099
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,540
hydrated it couldn't get it couldn't eat

1100
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,119
from the apple tree but now it can cycle

1101
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:07,859
back back and forth between the apple

1102
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:12,119
tree and the lake uh for as long as it

1103
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:16,260
wants and so it has a higher empowerment

1104
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:19,079
just on the uh on the low-level State

1105
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:21,540
spaces but also has a higher task

1106
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,240
empowerment because there are you know

1107
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,819
just over a horizon of three and we're

1108
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:28,920
just Computing uh where we have to

1109
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,040
choose a horizon so the empowerment in

1110
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,380
task space is eight because there's

1111
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:37,619
eight possible branches in resulting

1112
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:39,480
States from

1113
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:45,000
from where it is and so that's very

1114
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,319
useful

1115
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:49,440
um so we can compute the the valence

1116
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,540
which is uh 0.5 just in the in the low

1117
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,000
level space but also three in the task

1118
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,260
space

1119
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,780
and another interesting question which

1120
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,680
is

1121
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,720
um very important is to say well what's

1122
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,420
the value of the key and you can compute

1123
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,540
this too you can say well given if I

1124
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,760
just fix a state Vector that I'm at and

1125
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,760
I just alter the state Phi that encodes

1126
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,180
the object of a key if I just alter that

1127
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,740
state and switch it between having a key

1128
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:25,319
and I event key you can say well this

1129
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:28,079
key is has this much value to the

1130
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,420
internal organization the internal

1131
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,420
Integrity or controllability of the

1132
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,020
agent so it's a sort of agent-centric uh

1133
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:40,920
it uh Judgment of how much something in

1134
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,560
the world is valuable and so the key can

1135
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,079
be not valuable if it doesn't do

1136
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,480
anything in the world that helps the

1137
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,720
agent control its core ontology

1138
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,359
so this is a way in which you can sort

1139
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:58,680
of bootstrap uh value into the world you

1140
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,920
can use it you can use the change in an

1141
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,700
agent's internal structure it's coupling

1142
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,700
between the internal State spaces and

1143
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,859
the external world you can use the

1144
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,780
changes in that structure to assign

1145
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,700
value to things and it's very useful

1146
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,980
okay I think our we're approaching an

1147
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:24,240
hour and so I'll just conclude by saying

1148
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,520
um intelligent systems operate in high

1149
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,559
dimensional product spaces

1150
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,839
often with non-stationary Dynamics this

1151
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:34,619
this introduces a lot of problems

1152
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:36,960
um especially in artificial intelligence

1153
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,619
because people normally deal with

1154
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:42,480
structured tasks and non-stationarity by

1155
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,520
training you know recurrent neural

1156
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,380
networks and things like this which take

1157
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,480
which contribute a lot to sample

1158
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,760
complexity and what I'm saying is that

1159
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,220
you know operator Bellman equations have

1160
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,720
this different form which produces

1161
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,640
transition operators which helps you

1162
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,980
factorize

1163
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,540
um your representations for moving

1164
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,220
around the world and predicting the

1165
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:06,559
resulting High dimensional State Factor

1166
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:10,079
and these operators are composable they

1167
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,579
compose with themselves but they also

1168
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:13,800
compose with higher level structure so

1169
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,839
you can remap different transition

1170
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,660
structures to them it's very modular and

1171
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,579
these are very nice properties that you

1172
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:21,839
that you need

1173
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,780
uh if you want to if you don't want to

1174
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,640
recompute things and you want to have

1175
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,440
sort of modular structure come in and

1176
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,559
remap to your representations that

1177
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:33,540
you've already computed

1178
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,880
and then so

1179
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,099
forward sampling

1180
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:41,660
uh can you still hear me Daniel

1181
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,420
okay just checking so forward sampling

1182
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,160
is a good way of solving a problems in

1183
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,599
high dimensional State spaces without

1184
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:50,579
representing the product space we can't

1185
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:53,579
really solve we can't do dynamic

1186
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:55,980
programming in a huge product space

1187
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,260
that's not going to work we can't sample

1188
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,480
low-level actions that's not going to

1189
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,440
work it's the the tree is too big but we

1190
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,040
can uh we can work at the level of

1191
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,440
sequences of policies

1192
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,680
and we can evaluate empowerment gain to

1193
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,680
justify our goal States

1194
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:21,660
and so valence sort of unifies a lot of

1195
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:24,359
distinct drives like there's a different

1196
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:26,160
sort of subfield of RL called

1197
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,599
multi-objective

1198
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,960
reinforcement learning which says oh

1199
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,700
we'll we'll have a bunch of different

1200
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,859
reward functions and then we'll have

1201
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:36,960
value functions for each of these reward

1202
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,240
functions for like different tasks and

1203
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,619
that'll make like a high dimensional

1204
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:44,640
value function Vector space

1205
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,160
um and usually in in like

1206
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,260
multi-objective RL you have to like pick

1207
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,859
a policy that that's in that you know

1208
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:55,380
that's does well

1209
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,020
um in that you know value function space

1210
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,980
but normally you have to uh you have to

1211
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:03,900
deal with the trade-offs by some waiting

1212
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,200
function so what I'm saying here is that

1213
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,079
it this allows a because valence is just

1214
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,380
one number and it summarizes an entire

1215
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,859
sort of control architecture

1216
00:54:15,859 --> 00:54:18,540
that you don't have to have introduce

1217
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,599
things like waiting functions or

1218
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,720
weighting coefficients to say oh this

1219
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,059
objective is more important now or this

1220
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:30,480
objective is more important now now

1221
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,599
um

1222
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:36,180
so yeah many latent drives is not

1223
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,920
necessarily multi-objective it's

1224
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,079
multi-dimensional it's multi-goal but it

1225
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,559
doesn't have to be multi-objective

1226
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:44,960
um

1227
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,240
uh and so yeah with empowerment you

1228
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,680
don't have weighted combinations of

1229
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,880
empowerment

1230
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,880
and

1231
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,440
valence uh depends on the structure of

1232
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,500
the environment so it's um it's it's not

1233
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,559
just some static property of the world

1234
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:04,460
or a static property of an agent it it

1235
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:09,540
incorporates uh agent World coupling

1236
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,520
and I thought I'd just

1237
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,920
um end with this quote from Terence

1238
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,480
Deacon

1239
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,280
um who wrote a great book called

1240
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,680
incomplete nature which I love and I

1241
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,839
read it at the beginning of grad school

1242
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:25,140
and which inspired me a lot and Terence

1243
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,740
Deacon wrote a lot about

1244
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,359
teleology from a sort of thermodynamic

1245
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:32,700
perspective and it's really compelling

1246
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,280
um and I just liked what he had to say

1247
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,619
about

1248
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:40,380
teleodynamics the the idea that you know

1249
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,540
that an organism could be or Its

1250
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,180
Behavior could be organized around

1251
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,980
realizing you know something which is

1252
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,559
sort of virtual and he says teledynamics

1253
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:51,960
is the dynamical realization of Final

1254
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,359
causality in which a given dynamical

1255
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:57,059
organization exists because of the

1256
00:55:57,059 --> 00:55:59,819
consequences of its own continuous and

1257
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:02,579
therefore continuance and therefore it

1258
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:03,900
can be described as being

1259
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,420
self-generating specifically it is the

1260
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,339
emergence of a distinct a distinctive

1261
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:10,859
realm of orthograde dynamics that is

1262
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:12,960
organized around a self-realizing

1263
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,619
potential or to be somewhat enigmatic it

1264
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:19,200
is a consequence organized Dynamic that

1265
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,380
is that is its own consequence and I

1266
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,300
think I think that's relevant to what

1267
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,220
I'm doing here because

1268
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,579
um I think empowerment sort of on a an

1269
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:30,780
internal

1270
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,660
sort of structured ontology allows an

1271
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,040
agent to say

1272
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,380
there are multiple there there's a huge

1273
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,160
space of possible Futures but I can

1274
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,140
evaluate you know a state of the world

1275
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:46,500
that's far you know far off in the

1276
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,000
distant future

1277
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,160
and I can organize all of my behavior

1278
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,099
around that because I can say I can give

1279
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:58,260
an explanation for why it benefits uh my

1280
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,540
sort of core ontology and so therefore

1281
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,160
it makes me

1282
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,099
um capable of acting that way in the

1283
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:06,720
future it's a consequence organized

1284
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,660
Dynamic that is its own consequence

1285
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,480
so um with that I will I just want to

1286
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,240
thank the active inference Institute

1287
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,579
um and I will take questions and I'm

1288
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:20,760
very interested in you know what active

1289
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,280
inference uh theorists think about to

1290
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,980
sort of potential for a sort of

1291
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,500
integrated view of empowerment because I

1292
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,200
think you all have a lot a lot of

1293
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,460
experience thinking about generative

1294
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,559
models and things of of that nature so

1295
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,420
I'd be very curious to know what you

1296
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,380
think thank you

1297
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,420
excellent thanks a lot

1298
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:46,619
great presentation so this will be a fun

1299
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:48,540
discussion those who are watching live

1300
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:51,599
please feel free to add questions in the

1301
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:52,619
live chat

1302
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:55,740
and you can unshare your screen and

1303
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,098
we'll begin

1304
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,359
I guess I'll

1305
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:03,240
take an empowering deep breath

1306
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,859
and

1307
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:07,920
ask a general question and then I have

1308
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,660
some scattered notes that I'll love to

1309
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,359
dive into so how did you come to this

1310
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:15,960
area of research what brought you to

1311
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,720
control theory modeling and to the

1312
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,640
empowerment perspective specifically

1313
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,380
um hold on I'm just bringing up the

1314
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,180
YouTube stream so I can see comments

1315
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,980
right now

1316
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,480
um

1317
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,280
what brought and

1318
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,619
just a general question mute that one

1319
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:37,859
there we go yeah I'll meet that

1320
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:39,900
sounds good thank you

1321
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:43,319
yeah so what brought me to empowerment

1322
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:47,819
I've always been interested in yeah how

1323
00:58:47,819 --> 00:58:50,780
you know how how could animals

1324
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:54,720
uh interact in a world in a way that's

1325
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,140
so sample efficient especially like you

1326
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,299
know knowing that you know animals can

1327
00:59:00,299 --> 00:59:03,420
you know like oh like a baby horse can

1328
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,280
you know get up and move around and

1329
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,799
interact with the world in a sort of

1330
00:59:07,799 --> 00:59:10,799
fluid flexible way you know what are the

1331
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:14,339
sort of core representational

1332
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:16,380
capacities that are needed to do that

1333
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,079
and I didn't really see anything from

1334
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:21,839
the RL world and this is before I knew

1335
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,760
about active inference

1336
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,980
um and so that's always been in the back

1337
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,319
of my mind and

1338
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:31,020
another big influence

1339
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:34,740
was a guy named nishith srivastava who

1340
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,960
wrote an interesting paper about

1341
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,440
how you can basically have a sort of

1342
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,839
relativistic decision theory that

1343
00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:46,040
allowed you to make judgments between

1344
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:50,579
different items without recourse to sort

1345
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:53,400
of hedonic utility Theory maximization

1346
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,700
and so he he sort of argued that if

1347
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,559
there was something like a latent

1348
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,319
acceptability function that you could

1349
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:03,660
you could sort of measure you could sort

1350
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:06,540
of remember a history of item

1351
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,760
acceptability and you could remember the

1352
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,319
context that you made decisions and then

1353
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:11,460
you could actually just do Bayesian

1354
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:15,180
inference over those memories and you

1355
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,319
could explain a lot of interesting

1356
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:17,819
things like preference reversal

1357
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:20,040
phenomena and decision Theory where you

1358
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,040
introduced irrelevant Alternatives and

1359
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,339
it like changes the fundamental

1360
01:00:25,339 --> 01:00:28,200
choice you make and I thought that that

1361
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:32,040
that sort of initiated a lot of thinking

1362
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:36,420
into how could you have

1363
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,059
um how could you bring those kinds of

1364
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:41,599
intuitions into sort of embodied

1365
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,700
planning like how how could it be that

1366
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:48,020
you have an agent assign value to things

1367
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:52,020
without them being sort of attributed as

1368
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,180
sort of static

1369
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:57,000
um sort of static preferences or static

1370
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,059
Utilities in the world so I think that

1371
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:03,619
was also a big inspiration

1372
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:07,260
awesome okay and then one short general

1373
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,880
question why the honey badger

1374
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,540
hey Badger

1375
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:16,740
um yeah my advisor showed me a a YouTube

1376
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,859
video of of a honey badger named stoffel

1377
01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:23,520
and in my paper reward is not necessary

1378
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,280
it's the the opening

1379
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,799
um paragraph talks about stoffel and

1380
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:31,020
there's a link to this YouTube video but

1381
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,500
stoffel is is is a honey badger in

1382
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,839
Australia and

1383
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:38,880
um he he he's at some sort of like

1384
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,700
Animal Care Center and he he's really

1385
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:45,119
good at escaping from things so the uh

1386
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,160
the caretaker of of

1387
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:51,420
of at this animal sanctuary constantly

1388
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,400
has to build you know like elaborate

1389
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,040
structures to keep stoffel in so he has

1390
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,400
this sort of pen called Badger Alcatraz

1391
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,619
and uh stoffel would do interesting

1392
01:02:01,619 --> 01:02:04,079
things like you know find objects to

1393
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:06,420
lean against the wall and climb over or

1394
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:09,000
and if you took those away sofa would

1395
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,599
pack you know mud into balls and stack

1396
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:15,180
them into like a little pyramid against

1397
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,799
the wall to climb up and things like

1398
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,740
that so yeah it got me thinking like

1399
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:23,000
what is what is a sort of good General

1400
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,640
intrinsic motivation function that isn't

1401
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,119
doesn't just work on you know low-level

1402
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:33,000
States but also in a sort of more

1403
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,640
conceptual hierarchical space like there

1404
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,760
might be objects or mating opportunities

1405
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,980
or anything sort of outside Badger

1406
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:44,220
Alcatraz what is a sort of way in which

1407
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,680
you could have an agent sort of think in

1408
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,980
a sort of abstract way in order to

1409
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:54,720
justify motivate its motivations

1410
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,079
so I I encourage the uh the listeners to

1411
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:00,180
to uh look up that video it's

1412
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,920
entertaining

1413
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,660
it's like this General Escape impulse

1414
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:11,520
yes extended into our open air

1415
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,819
context where we also want to maintain

1416
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:16,619
the ability to move and for mobile

1417
01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:19,140
creatures

1418
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:23,040
that's quite a good proxy for what we

1419
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,280
might want to care about like living

1420
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,260
right

1421
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,780
all right I'll go to a question in the

1422
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:32,040
chat

1423
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,200
from Alex Kiefer

1424
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,720
fantastic work maybe a naive question

1425
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,400
and I'm sure it's clear in the formalism

1426
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,099
which I have only begun to look at but

1427
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:43,680
the idea is that actual agent

1428
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,500
environment coupling figures in

1429
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,900
Computing empowerment right

1430
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:52,680
if so is there a fully internal proxy

1431
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,319
that can be optimized given information

1432
01:03:55,319 --> 01:03:59,000
available internally

1433
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:03,059
hmm is there

1434
01:04:03,059 --> 01:04:05,460
let's see

1435
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:08,940
is there a fully internal proxy that can

1436
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,520
be computed that can be optimized given

1437
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,079
info

1438
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:14,660
available

1439
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:18,119
internally in that part of the coupling

1440
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:20,760
does he mean

1441
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,400
I I suppose I mean you I suppose you

1442
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,380
could compute empowerment just on the

1443
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:28,200
internal State space

1444
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,740
um but I don't know I actually I kind of

1445
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,839
want to say no just because you do need

1446
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:37,740
to use actions to move around and

1447
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,839
influence other state spaces and things

1448
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:41,579
like this

1449
01:04:41,579 --> 01:04:44,540
um I don't know how I would

1450
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:48,920
compute yeah just a sort of internal

1451
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,599
yeah intrinsic motivation function that

1452
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:54,000
that isn't a part of some coupling to

1453
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,460
some broader system

1454
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:59,339
what about the desire to think freely

1455
01:04:59,339 --> 01:05:03,540
and to move in cognitive spaces broadly

1456
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:07,319
yeah I agree that's that okay so yeah I

1457
01:05:07,319 --> 01:05:08,880
definitely agree if I mean if you have

1458
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,339
all of your sort of physiological you

1459
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:14,220
know needs met and there aren't sort of

1460
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:17,460
imposing themselves on you you're sort

1461
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:20,760
of freed up to do other things right

1462
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,540
um so yeah I think that

1463
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:27,240
this could work generally into very

1464
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,520
abstract spaces maybe even mathematical

1465
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,200
spaces

1466
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,119
um and

1467
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:34,920
yeah I think that there can be dependent

1468
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,780
like higher level dependency structures

1469
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:39,780
in you know abstract thought or

1470
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,339
mathematical thoughts or things like

1471
01:05:41,339 --> 01:05:43,280
this I mean you think about you know

1472
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,260
faulty proofs that that sort of like

1473
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,059
destroy an entire field or something

1474
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:50,819
like uh there there's a sort of

1475
01:05:50,819 --> 01:05:54,900
dependency structure in which you

1476
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,720
the you know if if you're working on

1477
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,880
mathematics that assume some proof is

1478
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,339
true and it turns out to be false then

1479
01:06:02,339 --> 01:06:05,339
you know perhaps that's disempowering

1480
01:06:05,339 --> 01:06:07,619
from a sort of abstract

1481
01:06:07,619 --> 01:06:10,079
uh perspective I suppose

1482
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:12,720
so that would be yeah

1483
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,780
and when they're again you are yeah

1484
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:17,520
good I was just going to say but again

1485
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,500
yeah all that mathematics is being done

1486
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,980
by you know some system that has to uh

1487
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,200
perform computation which takes energy

1488
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,900
and stuff like that so it's always

1489
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:32,700
sort of constrained constrained by them

1490
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,920
well constrained by some kind of

1491
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,720
external internal coupling yeah

1492
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:44,099
many ways to go let's let's swerve

1493
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:46,500
towards active inference and then see if

1494
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,740
we can come back to some other areas

1495
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:51,660
um

1496
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:54,180
you mentioned the generative model of

1497
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:56,760
active inference but you

1498
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,260
took a different approach there's

1499
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:01,500
different model ontology so just broadly

1500
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:05,160
how would you structurally contrast the

1501
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,559
coupling of the agent in the environment

1502
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:10,500
in active inference and in what you've

1503
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,480
proposed because the representations

1504
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,880
that we see in active inference often

1505
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,339
feature the particular partitioning

1506
01:07:17,339 --> 01:07:20,039
where a Markov blanket of a Bayesian

1507
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:22,799
graph is intermediating between internal

1508
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:25,319
and external States and then there's a

1509
01:07:25,319 --> 01:07:27,480
mapping function between those internal

1510
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,539
and external states such that they can

1511
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:33,359
um engage in an Adaptive coupling again

1512
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,160
mediated through the blanket which is

1513
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,859
interpreted as providing incoming

1514
01:07:37,859 --> 01:07:40,200
sensory observations and outgoing

1515
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,380
actions so structurally is that

1516
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:47,339
compatible incompatible or some other

1517
01:07:47,339 --> 01:07:49,079
secret third thing with what you

1518
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:51,599
proposed

1519
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,240
yeah so I would start off by saying that

1520
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,780
I think the thing that makes my work

1521
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:01,260
different is that it's the structure of

1522
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,960
the you know the latent just sort of

1523
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:07,319
discrete State space it's that structure

1524
01:08:07,319 --> 01:08:12,119
that's under consideration and I think

1525
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:15,000
and I think that inactive inference

1526
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,100
usually in code

1527
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,679
things like homeostatic drives right you

1528
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:23,219
encode them in a generative model right

1529
01:08:23,219 --> 01:08:26,040
correct they're encoded as a preference

1530
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,420
over sensory observations so that the

1531
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:32,880
entity uh seeks out and selects

1532
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,540
ultimately policies that reduce or bound

1533
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:38,520
their surprise about those observations

1534
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,979
like I expect and prefer myself to be at

1535
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:43,080
a homeostatic temperature I'm not

1536
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,000
surprised when I'm in that range and I'm

1537
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,160
going to undergo action so that I find

1538
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,679
myself in that range

1539
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:52,560
yeah yeah so I would say that that is a

1540
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,120
major difference

1541
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:57,179
um because the

1542
01:08:57,179 --> 01:09:00,179
because the state space in my case has

1543
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:02,279
this sort of self-undermining quality

1544
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:05,279
where it's like bad you know starvation

1545
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,640
States it's not it's not really a

1546
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,979
surprise an expectation of receiving a

1547
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:13,080
particular signal or having a preference

1548
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:16,439
over some state of the world it has a

1549
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:20,399
sort of uh self-undermining quality that

1550
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:22,259
affects your ability to control every

1551
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:23,939
everything else

1552
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:27,000
so I think that I would

1553
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,859
yeah I think I would contrast it that

1554
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:31,560
way that's usually the preferences or

1555
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,259
the quality of the states are sort of

1556
01:09:34,259 --> 01:09:36,839
encoded uh in a generative model in the

1557
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:40,500
active inference setting and here I'm

1558
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,779
saying that there's a sort of structural

1559
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:45,179
coupling that's giving rise to these

1560
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:48,560
valence signals

1561
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:50,719
um

1562
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:55,560
you mentioned the key being obtained as

1563
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,500
inducing this change in the agent's

1564
01:09:58,500 --> 01:09:59,699
ontology

1565
01:09:59,699 --> 01:10:02,820
and one that was ultimately reflected by

1566
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:05,160
increasing empowerment hence increase in

1567
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:08,820
valence so how does it come to

1568
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:12,960
understand that this shiny object

1569
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,780
unlocks that door

1570
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:20,239
yeah I wish uh yeah I mean I think that

1571
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:23,219
uh throughout my career I will try to

1572
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,080
make steps towards like you know

1573
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,679
actually

1574
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:30,120
um actually figuring that out because a

1575
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,800
lot of this would comes down to Dynamics

1576
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,960
learning you know if an agent doesn't

1577
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,600
know what a key does right it's not

1578
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,060
going to know that it opens a door and

1579
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:40,380
therefore that it can move through the

1580
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:42,239
door and things like this I think there

1581
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:45,360
are a lot of sort of maybe like Dinah

1582
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,580
like

1583
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:48,719
algorithms in which you sort of

1584
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:51,780
alternate between learning learning

1585
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,699
things about Dynamics or things like

1586
01:10:53,699 --> 01:10:55,380
this but that that is a sort of

1587
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,840
outstanding question for me is like yeah

1588
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,239
how would you take a key and learn

1589
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:03,300
exactly how it's changing the Dynamics

1590
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,320
um

1591
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:08,580
but yeah what I am saying is that given

1592
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:11,159
given that you can do that if if you can

1593
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:13,260
do that then you can really

1594
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,960
sort of make these value judgments to

1595
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,640
things in the world

1596
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,320
so I think that's really important too

1597
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,960
because like consider money right like

1598
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,659
if I find a 20 bill on the ground I'm

1599
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:25,980
just going to pick it up I don't think

1600
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:28,679
I'm doing a fancy computation right um

1601
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:32,219
of of like oh no my my bank account is

1602
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:34,920
twenty dollars greater and so therefore

1603
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,600
I'm gonna I have all this new capacity

1604
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,300
or things like this I think I think

1605
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,940
these sort of preferences for various

1606
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:45,300
objects like a a key or a dollar bill or

1607
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:48,960
things like this can sort of be you know

1608
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,560
stored and maybe you know maybe models

1609
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,800
with utility Theory who knows

1610
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,199
hmm okay

1611
01:11:58,199 --> 01:11:59,820
jumping around to some different

1612
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:01,260
questions

1613
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,179
I hope I'm accurate in saying you

1614
01:12:03,179 --> 01:12:06,120
described empowerment as a Shannon

1615
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,640
information theoretic Channel capacity

1616
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,520
between the actuators and the

1617
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,040
realization of the state

1618
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,020
yeah we might be familiar with hearing

1619
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,840
uh Shannon Channel capacity in the

1620
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,940
context of bandwidth of information

1621
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:24,239
transfer or upload and download for

1622
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,120
example but this is kind of an

1623
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,679
action-oriented Shannon Channel capacity

1624
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:32,340
so what is it mean to to get an

1625
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:35,100
intuition on that capacity between the

1626
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:38,040
actuators in the state

1627
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,679
yeah so it's it's the channel capacity

1628
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:43,199
is the maximum possible Mutual

1629
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,840
information between the actions

1630
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,500
you choose and the resulting States so

1631
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,239
the

1632
01:12:51,239 --> 01:12:55,260
Channel capacity is sort of the maximum

1633
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:57,780
information that you can transmit

1634
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:01,199
from your actuators to possible states

1635
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:04,620
of the world it's it's a it's a form of

1636
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,840
optionality that says you know I can

1637
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,739
affect

1638
01:13:07,739 --> 01:13:11,580
this many sort of possible Futures so

1639
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,800
yeah it's a sort of intrinsic property

1640
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,620
of an agent

1641
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:19,860
and so in a product space this is going

1642
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:21,300
to be affected

1643
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,400
by a lot of different state spaces if

1644
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,140
they're interacting like physiological

1645
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:28,739
State spaces can you know kill you if

1646
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:30,179
they get too low

1647
01:13:30,179 --> 01:13:31,739
so

1648
01:13:31,739 --> 01:13:34,380
I think the interesting thing about this

1649
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:38,040
is that it sort of encourages you to

1650
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:42,060
think about cognition in a in this sort

1651
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,920
of interrogative way

1652
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,280
um because you know you're essentially

1653
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,460
trying to figure out you know what what

1654
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:53,400
you can do but there are a lot of you

1655
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,280
know different state spaces that are

1656
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,380
hindering that information transfer from

1657
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:00,060
you know your actuators to your state

1658
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,000
spaces so I think I think it's very

1659
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,699
useful because it can sort of

1660
01:14:05,699 --> 01:14:07,920
it's it also sort of leads to like

1661
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,140
explainable AI right you can sort of

1662
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:12,719
explain your intentions in terms of

1663
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:15,239
concrete State spaces which which have

1664
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:17,100
structure and explanation things like

1665
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,540
that

1666
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:20,219
um I think I got off topic from your

1667
01:14:20,219 --> 01:14:22,080
your question but

1668
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,100
um

1669
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:25,739
anything else on channel Shannon Channel

1670
01:14:25,739 --> 01:14:28,620
capacity that I should talk about

1671
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:29,280
um

1672
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,739
I think before we Loop it back to

1673
01:14:31,739 --> 01:14:34,500
potentially expected free energy

1674
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,900
uh you mentioned the

1675
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,940
um AI

1676
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:42,900
topic and is there any risk

1677
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:47,340
of an imperative that features its own

1678
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:50,060
empowerment

1679
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:53,040
in terms of an AI being able to then

1680
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,219
select action policies that might not be

1681
01:14:56,219 --> 01:14:59,159
what anyone else expects or prefers

1682
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:01,440
may not even be concordant with their

1683
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:05,040
own encoded explainable AI priors but

1684
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,780
rather something that takes an

1685
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:09,980
unbounding approach

1686
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,900
yeah I do think that that is

1687
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:15,060
um a fear I don't I haven't thought that

1688
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:17,159
much about like the alignment questions

1689
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:19,440
so I'd be very interested in in what

1690
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,840
like alignment researchers think of this

1691
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,460
perspective

1692
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:25,260
um I think that there's a lot of

1693
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:27,420
interesting work to do on sort of

1694
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:30,239
multi-agent empowerment especially with

1695
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:32,940
these sort of abstract uh transition

1696
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:36,840
operators that work on long time scales

1697
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,219
um and you know you can see

1698
01:15:40,219 --> 01:15:43,920
that house sort of socialization matters

1699
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,540
and things like this

1700
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:47,520
um you know if you're you know in a

1701
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,280
world with multiple agents

1702
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,120
um

1703
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,520
do you have to you know do you have to

1704
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,159
learn to respect all of the agents you

1705
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:57,780
know empowerments I mean they can also

1706
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:59,820
act against you right

1707
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:02,820
um so yeah I don't know I do think it's

1708
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:06,420
a fear to take seriously

1709
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:08,159
um I don't know how I would do it though

1710
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:10,560
because it's it's an outstanding

1711
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,780
research question to me

1712
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:15,900
coming from an ant colony background you

1713
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,460
mentioned the socialization and I

1714
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:18,900
immediately thought well let's just say

1715
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:22,380
that the seeds take two or three Nest

1716
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:24,540
mates to carry home

1717
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:28,340
so in order to have one Nest mate

1718
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:31,739
achieve the maximum empowerment they

1719
01:16:31,739 --> 01:16:34,199
must also engage in a pro-social

1720
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:37,560
environment because if anyone else even

1721
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,560
if their model is like smaller and less

1722
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,719
empowered if they just decide not to

1723
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:45,360
play then that individual until it

1724
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,040
figures out how to carry the seed Home

1725
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,540
Alone

1726
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:51,420
is going to actually be kind of

1727
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:54,060
um Tethered to a social fabric

1728
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:57,600
that helps it actually obtain those

1729
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,380
goals so it puts the social imperative

1730
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:04,080
as a screen in front of potentially any

1731
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,420
other imperative

1732
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:08,040
just not

1733
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,840
um yeah that's a great that's a great

1734
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,520
thought

1735
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,659
you mentioned the decomposition of

1736
01:17:15,659 --> 01:17:18,900
some function I'll let you unpack what

1737
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,460
exactly what function was being

1738
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:22,500
decomposed and you you

1739
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:25,260
um you Justified that by saying we never

1740
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:28,739
want to work in the product space

1741
01:17:28,739 --> 01:17:30,300
yeah

1742
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:32,520
from a computational complexity

1743
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:36,060
perspective or however makes sense what

1744
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:39,540
are the dangers or what are the scaling

1745
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:42,719
features of that product space and then

1746
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,699
what is the decomposition that

1747
01:17:44,699 --> 01:17:48,840
facilitates a more tractable form

1748
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,820
yeah I'll share my screen again we can

1749
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:52,739
go back to that slide

1750
01:17:52,739 --> 01:17:55,099
thank you

1751
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:02,059
let's see

1752
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:07,400
foreign

1753
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,180
[Music]

1754
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:33,480
you can see my screen yep and maybe even

1755
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,880
a brief summary of what is a Bellman

1756
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:39,540
equation and how did you move from the

1757
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:41,340
standard formalization of bellman

1758
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:45,020
equations into this operator space

1759
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:49,940
sure yeah the standard Bellman equation

1760
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:55,080
I don't know the button for one slide

1761
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:57,120
forward but okay so the standard

1762
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:00,360
dominant equation just says this uh

1763
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,100
recursive form

1764
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:05,100
and it just the value of a state that

1765
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,120
you're at

1766
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,179
the the optimal value of that state is

1767
01:19:09,179 --> 01:19:12,360
the maximum it is the maximum value that

1768
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,880
you can get by choosing an action that

1769
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,380
rewards you

1770
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:19,140
and takes you to a state from which you

1771
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:21,679
can act in the future to get more reward

1772
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:25,800
so the Bellman equation

1773
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:30,060
um can be solved by dynamic programming

1774
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:33,420
um in order to maximize this function V

1775
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:36,840
so it'll it'll it'll result in a policy

1776
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:39,719
that moves you around the world uh in a

1777
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:42,480
way that accumulates a reward that

1778
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,659
you'll find in your environment

1779
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:48,179
um so it has this recursive form uh you

1780
01:19:48,179 --> 01:19:49,920
can you can sort of unroll it into a

1781
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,840
sequence

1782
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,820
um and then the operator Bellman

1783
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:57,840
equation has this similar recursive form

1784
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,940
where now

1785
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:02,340
you'll notice that there isn't a reward

1786
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:04,199
function there's this availability

1787
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:06,300
function and it returns a number between

1788
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,880
zero and one it returns a probability

1789
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,760
and so that's significant because it

1790
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,100
makes it means that you can maximize the

1791
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,320
cumulative feasibility

1792
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,440
and so F here is just saying this goal

1793
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,380
is available either you achieve the goal

1794
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,900
now or you take an action you don't

1795
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,219
achieve it now but you've taken an

1796
01:20:26,219 --> 01:20:28,860
action in which you'll achieve it in the

1797
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,380
future

1798
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:32,940
so that

1799
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,980
um it has the same form where you can

1800
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:36,300
sort of think of an availability

1801
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,600
function as a reward but it's

1802
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,420
maintaining a probabilistic

1803
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:45,000
um form and that probabilistic form is

1804
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,239
importance because it's what allows you

1805
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:52,679
to compute the state time feasibility as

1806
01:20:52,679 --> 01:20:54,840
a transition operator as an operator

1807
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:58,380
that Maps you from where you are now the

1808
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:00,780
state time you're at now which is XT

1809
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:04,020
to the final State time and goal that

1810
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:05,780
you achieve

1811
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:09,780
so under the policies so it says if I

1812
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:12,300
start at XT and I follow this policy and

1813
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,920
I'm choosing actions that move me

1814
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,199
through this state space

1815
01:21:16,199 --> 01:21:17,940
then I'm eventually going to get to the

1816
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:20,940
goal and I want to know the final State

1817
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:24,179
and time the probability that I uh

1818
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:26,360
achieved this at any given state in time

1819
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:29,580
and so the state time feasibility

1820
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:33,659
function is here as it's expressed is a

1821
01:21:33,659 --> 01:21:35,280
transition operator with one action

1822
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,040
which is the policy but when we

1823
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:41,460
aggregate it oh bring this up when we

1824
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:44,580
aggregate it into multiple possible

1825
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:46,620
feasibility functions that are centered

1826
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:47,460
around

1827
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:50,520
uh multiple sort of objects in the world

1828
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:53,640
then all of the policies associated with

1829
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,980
with each one of those these are goal

1830
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:58,560
condition policies that that are going

1831
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,300
to terminate on

1832
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:02,940
achieving the goal of going to one of

1833
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:05,100
these features and and you know getting

1834
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,679
the Apple for instance then those pop

1835
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:11,100
each of those policies is an action for

1836
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,739
this transition operator so there's five

1837
01:22:13,739 --> 01:22:15,719
five possible policies that are going to

1838
01:22:15,719 --> 01:22:17,640
take you around the world around the

1839
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,320
space so these operator development

1840
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,000
equations have this probabilistic form

1841
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,820
which retain this probabilistic

1842
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:24,960
structure

1843
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,320
and you can sort of compare this with

1844
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,520
um I don't know if you're familiar but

1845
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,739
there's this concept in RL called the

1846
01:22:31,739 --> 01:22:34,380
successor representation

1847
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:36,960
um which is like often a Hot Topic in

1848
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,900
you know computational neuroscience and

1849
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,760
the successor representation

1850
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,739
is sort of talked about like it's this

1851
01:22:43,739 --> 01:22:46,620
predictive operator but really what it

1852
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:50,100
represents is expected State occupancies

1853
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,520
under a policy and those expected state

1854
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,500
occupancies are awaited by the discount

1855
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,320
Factor so it's really a for it's really

1856
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,780
a successful representation is really a

1857
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:02,640
sort of weighted statistic

1858
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,620
and it doesn't map

1859
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:07,620
from like an initial state to the state

1860
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:11,400
of achieving of inducing an event of of

1861
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,100
achieving a goal these are

1862
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,280
so where successor representations

1863
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:19,620
aren't compositional you can't multiply

1864
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,719
two successor representations and get

1865
01:23:21,719 --> 01:23:24,420
another successor representation but you

1866
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,960
can multiply matrices that represent

1867
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,280
feasibility functions because they're

1868
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,360
mapping

1869
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:34,020
their their probabilities so of events

1870
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:36,540
so you can you can combine them just by

1871
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:38,760
multiplying you know matrices that

1872
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:41,040
represent you know the state time

1873
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,679
feasibility function for a given policy

1874
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:46,100
with another one for a different policy

1875
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:49,020
so that will

1876
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:51,239
um retain a

1877
01:23:51,239 --> 01:23:53,880
the form of a probabilistic function and

1878
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,860
that's what makes them reusable

1879
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:57,300
composable

1880
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:58,320
Etc

1881
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:01,140
and I think you asked me about the

1882
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:02,760
decomposition

1883
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:06,480
and this decomposition

1884
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,640
yeah I might have glossed over this but

1885
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:11,640
the decomposition result is that if you

1886
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:15,120
have if you were to compute a state-time

1887
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,340
feasibility function in a product space

1888
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:21,420
okay which has lots of State lots of

1889
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:23,880
States lots of State vectors which are

1890
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,400
each States

1891
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,840
um then

1892
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,580
you know you don't want to do that

1893
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:32,040
because product spaces are very large

1894
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:35,580
and take a lot of you know in memory to

1895
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:39,659
represent the operator uh so if if this

1896
01:24:39,659 --> 01:24:43,500
was not PX and this was PS and PS was

1897
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,540
the full product space operator that

1898
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:47,580
moves you around this High dimensional

1899
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:49,440
space well you can't really represent

1900
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,239
that and you don't really want to but if

1901
01:24:51,239 --> 01:24:54,239
you did and you computed a state time

1902
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:56,900
feasibility function in a product space

1903
01:24:56,900 --> 01:25:02,159
then you can under certain conditions uh

1904
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:03,360
and I can say what those conditions are

1905
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,699
but under certain conditions you can

1906
01:25:05,699 --> 01:25:09,780
decompose this into a prediction of all

1907
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:11,840
of the higher level State spaces

1908
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:15,840
computed independently so you evolve the

1909
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,880
hunger space separately and you evolve

1910
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:20,219
the their space separately and you

1911
01:25:20,219 --> 01:25:23,400
evolve the temperature space separately

1912
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,219
you can do all of those computations

1913
01:25:25,219 --> 01:25:28,860
locally on those spaces

1914
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:31,679
um and you can combine them with a state

1915
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:33,420
time feasibility function that's only

1916
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:37,920
computed on the low level space so

1917
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:41,580
um so this hierarchical stf of the state

1918
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:44,699
time feasibility function is an

1919
01:25:44,699 --> 01:25:47,100
intractable object for for most

1920
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:50,280
reasonable reasonably sized problems but

1921
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:54,360
you can implicitly form it by this

1922
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,420
product of these things individually and

1923
01:25:57,420 --> 01:26:02,400
so this works when you're when your goal

1924
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,980
if for the for the uh hierarchical

1925
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:07,080
state-time feasibility function when you

1926
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:10,380
just have a single goal at arriving at a

1927
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:12,060
particular feature of the world like a

1928
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:13,920
tree

1929
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,000
um

1930
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,100
that's that's this that's the sort of

1931
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:19,080
can that's one of the conditions in

1932
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:22,260
which this decomposition holds so I

1933
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:23,820
think that that answered your question

1934
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:25,679
about you know the burden of a product

1935
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:28,440
space well you need to uh you need to

1936
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:31,139
overcome it by doing local computations

1937
01:26:31,139 --> 01:26:34,080
on individual State spaces in a sort of

1938
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,460
network

1939
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:38,639
of interconnected State spaces

1940
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:42,000
that implicitly form a product space but

1941
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,620
you you want to compute all of the

1942
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,840
representation separately in this

1943
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,480
network of State spaces so that you can

1944
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,920
sort of move around this High

1945
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,400
dimensional State space under successive

1946
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,980
policies

1947
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:58,020
and so that's that's what allows you to

1948
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:59,280
handle

1949
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,560
forward sampling in in this High

1950
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:04,679
dimensional State space and that's

1951
01:27:04,679 --> 01:27:08,100
that's important because I I think

1952
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:13,860
and just to um recall uh the sort of uh

1953
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:17,100
presentation I think was aval a-a-v-e-l

1954
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:19,760
who yes

1955
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:23,460
yeah just to Echo that that sort of

1956
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:25,860
sentiments that

1957
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:28,440
if you're composing if you're creating

1958
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:31,020
new state spaces or you're composing

1959
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:34,500
you're not Computing policies in a fixed

1960
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,360
world

1961
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:39,780
um you're composing things together

1962
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:42,120
um that's of course going to expand the

1963
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,699
product space implicitly of all the

1964
01:27:44,699 --> 01:27:48,120
state vectors of the system and the act

1965
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:50,280
of composing thing or bringing new

1966
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:53,400
information in is expanding the implicit

1967
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:56,340
product space that you are in

1968
01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:00,780
and so from an RL standpoint

1969
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:02,880
um it's not so clear you know what a

1970
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,620
reward function on that product space is

1971
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:06,840
even supposed to be I don't think that

1972
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,880
anyone will

1973
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:12,360
I answered that question but it's also

1974
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,520
not clear what you know what a

1975
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:17,699
generative model should look like on

1976
01:28:17,699 --> 01:28:20,000
that product space either and I think

1977
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,520
given that you know organisms or humans

1978
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,780
at least are so skilled at this at this

1979
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:31,199
sort of dialectical process of proposing

1980
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:35,460
theories in you know composing structure

1981
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:38,760
um as hypotheses and in

1982
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:41,580
um in interrogating what that means I

1983
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:43,860
think that they're I think that value

1984
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:47,820
comes from interrogating you know what

1985
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:49,739
it means for the structure of the world

1986
01:28:49,739 --> 01:28:52,920
to be a certain way so if I if I learn

1987
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,719
new dynamics of the world and I want to

1988
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:55,739
control

1989
01:28:55,739 --> 01:28:58,139
Dynamics on some new space it might

1990
01:28:58,139 --> 01:29:01,080
affect other state spaces but you know

1991
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:03,239
from a normative perspective it's not

1992
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:05,460
really clear you know when once you

1993
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:07,920
compose something in your and you're

1994
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,659
expanding the implicit product space

1995
01:29:09,659 --> 01:29:12,540
it's not so clear where any sort of

1996
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:14,580
normative source of normativity should

1997
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:16,920
come from but I think the sort of

1998
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:20,280
flexible human reasoning that we sort of

1999
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:23,760
know humans to engage in I think is in

2000
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:27,179
this sort of regime of composition and

2001
01:29:27,179 --> 01:29:29,520
interrogation where you're always sort

2002
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,699
of saying oh if the world were this way

2003
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:35,699
then I'm sort of I I then I could see

2004
01:29:35,699 --> 01:29:37,620
how this state space affects these other

2005
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:39,120
state spaces in a way that I didn't

2006
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,840
anticipate and so I think normativity in

2007
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,699
a creative way has to come from

2008
01:29:44,699 --> 01:29:46,199
controllability

2009
01:29:46,199 --> 01:29:49,759
that that would be my argument

2010
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,679
there's a lot

2011
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:56,699
there so if you directions

2012
01:29:56,699 --> 01:29:59,340
first to our colleagues in reinforcement

2013
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:00,920
learning RL

2014
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:04,620
the paper is provocative in that it

2015
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:09,239
includes reward is not necessary so

2016
01:30:09,239 --> 01:30:11,820
is reward sufficient

2017
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:15,120
and or what is necessary

2018
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,900
for what

2019
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:21,900
yeah it's a good question is is reward

2020
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:25,260
sufficient I think

2021
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:29,699
I would argue this you know

2022
01:30:29,699 --> 01:30:30,960
I think

2023
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,500
that the reward enough hypothesis which

2024
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,659
just to remind the some of the viewers

2025
01:30:36,659 --> 01:30:38,760
is the hypothesis that reward

2026
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:40,440
maximization

2027
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,860
can account for all sort of artificial

2028
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:47,460
and sort of natural intelligence that

2029
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:48,900
all of the sort of features of

2030
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:50,580
intelligence the sort of capabilities

2031
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:52,440
the

2032
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:55,560
structure learning and stuff can all

2033
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:58,620
sort of arise out of some need to

2034
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:01,679
there's some some process of maximizing

2035
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:03,960
reward and

2036
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,060
from my standpoint this that's a

2037
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:08,699
frustrating statement because it's

2038
01:31:08,699 --> 01:31:12,138
one it doesn't

2039
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:14,100
um

2040
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:16,860
one it doesn't really address

2041
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:19,380
where your preferences for specific

2042
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:22,380
reward functions come from and in the

2043
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:24,239
paper that they will say well we

2044
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:26,780
acknowledge you know that there could be

2045
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:30,060
multiple sources of reward

2046
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:33,420
and but you know the process of deciding

2047
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:35,760
on what you know reward you should

2048
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:39,120
attend to or care about that's I think

2049
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:42,600
is is a deciding what signals you should

2050
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,000
care about is an important part of

2051
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
intelligence itself and I think that

2052
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,580
reward is enough hypothesis as a

2053
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:52,440
hypothesis is sort of under constrained

2054
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:56,219
in that whatever that mechanism is to to

2055
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:58,739
that perspective it's going to be

2056
01:31:58,739 --> 01:32:01,380
maximizing reward you know under their

2057
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:05,360
Paradigm and so therefore whatever

2058
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:08,120
whatever shapes what that mechanism is

2059
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:10,860
that that you know an agent should

2060
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:13,320
attend to this or an agent should stop

2061
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:14,880
attending to the things that's always

2062
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:17,100
cared about in and attend to some new

2063
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:18,179
signal

2064
01:32:18,179 --> 01:32:21,239
I think that that call you know I think

2065
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:24,780
that that forces you to sort of

2066
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:27,540
take the position that you know maybe

2067
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:29,820
there's a meta Source like a meta reward

2068
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:31,920
that tells you that that directs this

2069
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,260
process because all sort of attendant

2070
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:37,860
processes of intelligent systems sort of

2071
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:40,380
are underlie the process of reward

2072
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:43,500
maximization and also you know

2073
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:47,900
it the the reward the reward is enough

2074
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:49,800
hypothesis

2075
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:53,100
is not being specific about

2076
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:56,520
it doesn't tell you what necessarily to

2077
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,860
compute it just says that if you try to

2078
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:02,340
maximize reward it will you will

2079
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:04,620
you will compute the right

2080
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:08,280
uh representations and so I think that

2081
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:09,659
there's just a lot of like nuts and

2082
01:33:09,659 --> 01:33:10,739
bolts about

2083
01:33:10,739 --> 01:33:13,620
what it takes to be able to reason in a

2084
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:16,500
flexible human way in what I'm proposing

2085
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:18,239
here with the operator Bellman equations

2086
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:19,920
is to say hey look there's these

2087
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,260
reward-free Bowman equations that help

2088
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:24,719
you deal with the complexity of the

2089
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:27,659
world there's no reward in them and you

2090
01:33:27,659 --> 01:33:29,280
could make the case well maybe you could

2091
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:30,600
just use these operator development

2092
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,940
equations to occupy states that are

2093
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:36,600
rewarding but I would argue that since

2094
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:39,239
the product space the effective product

2095
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:41,940
space that we all live in is so vast

2096
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:43,739
and we reason about it in such a

2097
01:33:43,739 --> 01:33:47,699
flexible way I very much doubt that RL

2098
01:33:47,699 --> 01:33:49,860
will rise to the challenge of being able

2099
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:53,100
to justify motivations in real time in a

2100
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:56,520
way that humans can and so to get to the

2101
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:00,000
question of you know is it sufficient

2102
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,460
my hunch is no I can't like I don't have

2103
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:05,219
a proof of like you know reward is not

2104
01:34:05,219 --> 01:34:07,080
sufficient

2105
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:10,320
um but I also think that the information

2106
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,840
that a reward function is supposed to

2107
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:16,260
carry about what is good I don't think

2108
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:20,000
that that is that is Noble or computable

2109
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,280
on the time scales that we understand

2110
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:27,000
human intelligence to to work at to work

2111
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,659
on and so yeah in order to answer your

2112
01:34:30,659 --> 01:34:32,639
question about what is necessary I don't

2113
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:34,739
know

2114
01:34:34,739 --> 01:34:39,239
what is necessary but I would just sort

2115
01:34:39,239 --> 01:34:39,960
of

2116
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:42,000
make the point that I already made of

2117
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,960
that I think that we have to get to a

2118
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:47,659
point in which we sort of acknowledge

2119
01:34:47,659 --> 01:34:51,000
the problems of product spaces and sort

2120
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,179
of reasoning dialectically in a product

2121
01:34:54,179 --> 01:34:57,840
space that we can't explicitly represent

2122
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:01,560
uh and so I don't know

2123
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:04,920
I don't know what is necessary but I can

2124
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:07,100
say that it's not necessary for simple

2125
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:09,480
self-preserving agents and that's the

2126
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,340
claim of the paper

2127
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:13,980
awesome

2128
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:16,020
all right in our

2129
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:18,840
closing segments

2130
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:22,440
I'd like to take a journey to philosophy

2131
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,239
and then connect this back to

2132
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:25,500
potentially

2133
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,719
relationships

2134
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:29,760
between the models that you've presented

2135
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:33,480
here and active inference and maybe even

2136
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:34,620
walk

2137
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:36,420
to the edge of that Cliff of the hybrid

2138
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:38,659
model so

2139
01:35:38,659 --> 01:35:43,380
Aristotle proposed four causes

2140
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:46,080
material cause what something is made of

2141
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,840
the efficient cause which is the source

2142
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:50,159
of change

2143
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:53,219
the formal cause is the essence and the

2144
01:35:53,219 --> 01:35:56,940
final cause is the the teleology the end

2145
01:35:56,940 --> 01:36:01,139
goal of the object and your

2146
01:36:01,139 --> 01:36:03,739
presentations

2147
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:06,719
was Deacon's

2148
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:10,020
analysis of these different forms of

2149
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:11,520
teleology

2150
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,900
and

2151
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:15,420
indeed within the model proposed

2152
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:18,860
empowerment was that type of

2153
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:22,860
self-referential teleology

2154
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:25,400
when

2155
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:28,679
juxtaposing with active inference and

2156
01:36:28,679 --> 01:36:31,219
specifically the expected free energy

2157
01:36:31,219 --> 01:36:34,080
functional which has a lot of analogies

2158
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,780
with an operator it's a function of

2159
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:38,460
other functions the expected free energy

2160
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:39,719
functional

2161
01:36:39,719 --> 01:36:41,000
is

2162
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,980
predicated around helping the agent

2163
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:47,880
select policies that over expected

2164
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:50,100
Futures reduce their uncertainty the

2165
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:53,580
most about which Sensations they receive

2166
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:56,400
and that's what ties active inference

2167
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,760
closely with perceptual control theory

2168
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:02,340
that that expected free energy

2169
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:05,940
is ultimately looking at a Divergence

2170
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:08,760
between preferences over observations

2171
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:12,060
and incoming observations so that's kind

2172
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:15,420
of the sense side of the coin it's like

2173
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:19,260
I want to stay in the game to be able to

2174
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:22,280
align observations with my preferences

2175
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:26,040
and I'm wondering if

2176
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:29,040
empowerment is the action side of the

2177
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,280
game

2178
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:35,280
you'll be involved with yes repeatedly

2179
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,679
sensing yourself to not be starving not

2180
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:39,540
be dying of thirst not be dying of cold

2181
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:43,380
like you'll be in your preference vector

2182
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:48,719
by way of this single value

2183
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:51,480
which is the empowerment whereas active

2184
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:53,219
inference kind of comes from the other

2185
01:37:53,219 --> 01:37:55,800
side saying you're going to end up

2186
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:57,420
having a lot of squares to move around

2187
01:37:57,420 --> 01:38:00,659
in But first you need to make sure that

2188
01:38:00,659 --> 01:38:02,940
you're reducing Divergence between your

2189
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:04,380
preferences and your expected

2190
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:07,219
observations

2191
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,440
what do you think about that map or

2192
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:17,040
where would that take these intertwined

2193
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,320
models

2194
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:22,860
well I think that there could be like an

2195
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:25,679
interface between the two concepts if we

2196
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:28,080
consider that models of how things work

2197
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:31,679
like composed models of how things work

2198
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:33,840
could induce

2199
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,179
particular generative models

2200
01:38:36,179 --> 01:38:39,000
that you would want to use in a sort of

2201
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,219
active inference setting and that would

2202
01:38:41,219 --> 01:38:45,000
be the sort of dual nature between the

2203
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,080
two that there's a cross talk between

2204
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:51,360
the proposal of of some kind of

2205
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,880
generative model that would be conducive

2206
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:55,460
to the agent

2207
01:38:55,460 --> 01:38:57,060
and

2208
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:59,280
if it is then it's a good then it could

2209
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,260
be a good State encoding which feeds

2210
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:04,620
back in on you know controllability or

2211
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:07,320
empowerment and things like this so I

2212
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,120
mean there's a lot to think about on

2213
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:11,340
this topic

2214
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:13,739
um but I guess I would just put put it

2215
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:15,659
that way that

2216
01:39:15,659 --> 01:39:20,100
um that we still need to justify

2217
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:22,920
where

2218
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:26,280
generative models come from uh in new

2219
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,260
situations for new theories of how

2220
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:30,060
things work and things like that

2221
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:32,219
you know there could be a dual process

2222
01:39:32,219 --> 01:39:33,300
in which

2223
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,520
the action side the internal

2224
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,190
controllability side is dictating

2225
01:39:38,190 --> 01:39:39,480
[Music]

2226
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:41,940
what kinds of generative models that we

2227
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:44,900
that should be considered

2228
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:48,659
very

2229
01:39:48,659 --> 01:39:52,460
interesting and the reason I brought up

2230
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:56,460
Aristotle's causes was because active

2231
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:59,340
inference as a process Theory

2232
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:02,340
seems to be describing that efficient

2233
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:03,540
cause

2234
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:06,780
it's just especially with a variational

2235
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:10,139
free energy which is kind of the real

2236
01:40:10,139 --> 01:40:12,560
time version of the expected free energy

2237
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:16,920
it's like one step at a time

2238
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:20,159
ball going downhill and so variational

2239
01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:23,600
inference is enabling incremental

2240
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:27,360
unfolding optimization again oriented

2241
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:30,000
around reducing that sensory preference

2242
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,139
and outcome

2243
01:40:33,179 --> 01:40:35,280
it

2244
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:38,219
does everything but specify a final

2245
01:40:38,219 --> 01:40:40,980
cause in a sense

2246
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:42,900
one might say that there's a local final

2247
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:44,580
cause within the active inference

2248
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:47,100
generative model which is like to reduce

2249
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:49,020
the Divergence between the preferences

2250
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:51,000
and the observations

2251
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,940
but the generative model

2252
01:40:53,940 --> 01:40:56,940
also

2253
01:40:56,940 --> 01:40:59,520
from the action selection side which is

2254
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,560
what makes active inference active

2255
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:04,860
inference it also needs

2256
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:08,120
a final cause

2257
01:41:08,219 --> 01:41:10,760
in that

2258
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:14,340
self-referential teledynamic way

2259
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:15,900
and so there could be some very

2260
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:17,639
interesting

2261
01:41:17,639 --> 01:41:20,880
architectures where

2262
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:23,699
active inference picks up

2263
01:41:23,699 --> 01:41:27,840
where empowerment leads like through a

2264
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,199
needle

2265
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:33,360
because it's such a small representation

2266
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,400
with valence

2267
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:37,860
and then one other kind of connection or

2268
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:41,400
maybe mapping between them is we've seen

2269
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:45,420
models of valence in active inference

2270
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:49,320
such as the affective inference work

2271
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:53,880
where valence was associated

2272
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:55,800
broadly with whether things are going

2273
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:59,460
better or worse than expected in terms

2274
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:02,880
of statistical uncertainty if you're

2275
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,739
reducing your uncertainty more than you

2276
01:42:04,739 --> 01:42:06,360
expected things are going better than

2277
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:10,380
expected and vice versa

2278
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:14,900
um so that is a very

2279
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:16,500
variance

2280
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:19,500
oriented

2281
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:23,520
valence Concepts

2282
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:25,520
where broader

2283
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:28,739
uncertainties are associated with

2284
01:42:28,739 --> 01:42:31,679
inferior valence and Tighter

2285
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:33,360
uncertainties are associated with

2286
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:35,159
positive valence and it's just

2287
01:42:35,159 --> 01:42:36,659
interesting that that's kind of like an

2288
01:42:36,659 --> 01:42:39,179
orthogonal valence concept

2289
01:42:39,179 --> 01:42:43,080
from how much you can actually do that's

2290
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:45,780
the actionable valence would you rather

2291
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:49,739
have a high Precision around not being

2292
01:42:49,739 --> 01:42:51,300
able to do anything

2293
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:54,719
or High uncertainty

2294
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:58,560
about being able to do a lot or a huge

2295
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,880
amount

2296
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:01,619
and so it almost seems like when we

2297
01:43:01,619 --> 01:43:03,239
contrast those two

2298
01:43:03,239 --> 01:43:08,520
the direction that dominates is

2299
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:11,820
in the final analysis the ability to

2300
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:15,119
have empowerment not necessarily to just

2301
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:16,980
have tight control over your

2302
01:43:16,980 --> 01:43:19,638
observations

2303
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:22,320
yeah

2304
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:25,619
yeah I agree lots lots of interesting

2305
01:43:25,619 --> 01:43:29,179
avenues for hybrid theories

2306
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:34,699
well what a very

2307
01:43:34,699 --> 01:43:38,340
interesting talk I guess one more

2308
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:40,500
question on the model and then we'll

2309
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:42,000
close which is

2310
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,219
the time Horizon

2311
01:43:44,219 --> 01:43:48,719
is it an infinite time horizon or

2312
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:51,900
what is the treatment of time and can

2313
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:53,699
time be continuous or is time always

2314
01:43:53,699 --> 01:43:55,860
discrete and is it finite or infinite

2315
01:43:55,860 --> 01:43:57,800
Horizon

2316
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:00,179
it's uh so the operator Bellman

2317
01:44:00,179 --> 01:44:02,699
equations are formalized as a finite

2318
01:44:02,699 --> 01:44:03,960
Horizon

2319
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:06,060
I suppose they could be extended to

2320
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:09,719
infinite ryzen and infinite

2321
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:11,940
um or continuous time I suppose that's

2322
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:13,500
possible too

2323
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:16,139
but as as they're formalized now it's

2324
01:44:16,139 --> 01:44:19,320
discrete State discrete time finite

2325
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:21,540
Horizon

2326
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:22,320
um

2327
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,360
but yeah I mean I think that there is

2328
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:27,179
there's Alternative forms that could be

2329
01:44:27,179 --> 01:44:29,510
could be made

2330
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:29,880
[Music]

2331
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:31,800
um

2332
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:33,960
is the was there another question too in

2333
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:37,280
that I can't remember

2334
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:42,000
let us close with your time Horizon

2335
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,420
what are your next steps with the

2336
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:49,560
research and how would you imagine an

2337
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:54,000
ecosystem of continuation of the work

2338
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,219
yeah I'm I'm interested in getting this

2339
01:44:56,219 --> 01:44:58,500
work into

2340
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:00,880
computational Neuroscience

2341
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:01,380
[Music]

2342
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:02,280
um

2343
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:05,040
uh because there's a lot of I think

2344
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:06,960
alternative models that need to be

2345
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:09,360
considered especially given some of the

2346
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:12,179
themes that I've touched on in terms of

2347
01:45:12,179 --> 01:45:14,340
justifying what to do in a product space

2348
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:16,320
how do you represent

2349
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:20,639
control in a distributed system Etc

2350
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:23,100
um and so I think that there's a lot a

2351
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:24,600
lot to do there in computational

2352
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:27,480
Neuroscience on the AI side I want to

2353
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:30,719
put this in a world model

2354
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:36,179
I want to uh get good you know Auto

2355
01:45:36,179 --> 01:45:38,699
encoders kind of like how I had on on

2356
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:40,440
the first slide where you have a high

2357
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:42,960
dimensional you know agent in a high

2358
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:45,119
dimensional multimodal world how do you

2359
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:47,040
how do you have nice World models and

2360
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,679
put this in in something like that so

2361
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:52,139
that's that's the AI future Direction

2362
01:45:52,139 --> 01:45:55,280
and I'd like to do both of them so

2363
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:58,440
a lot of work to do

2364
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:01,199
awesome well in closing I'm just going

2365
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:03,840
to read some of the more statement like

2366
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,119
comments from the live chat just so that

2367
01:46:06,119 --> 01:46:08,100
they're included in the active inference

2368
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:11,340
Journal so Dave Douglas wrote

2369
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:13,639
with regards to Deacon's consequence

2370
01:46:13,639 --> 01:46:16,440
Galileo may have gotten in trouble less

2371
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:18,179
from insisting on a heliocentric

2372
01:46:18,179 --> 01:46:19,800
Universe than from insisting that

2373
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:22,080
purpose value and meaning

2374
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,679
be banished from science as connecting

2375
01:46:24,679 --> 01:46:26,940
explanatory principles

2376
01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:29,460
the Galileo tolerated remaining

2377
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:32,340
connecting principle causation may have

2378
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:34,139
reached the limits of its explanatory

2379
01:46:34,139 --> 01:46:37,440
power sometime between Newtons and four

2380
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,760
years day

2381
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:41,100
where all respectable principles of

2382
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:43,380
explanation must ultimately rest on

2383
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:46,380
invocation of either rigid rods or on

2384
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:48,000
elastic bands

2385
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,719
the Galilean program of Sola casa

2386
01:46:51,719 --> 01:46:54,179
attained its absurdity in karnap's

2387
01:46:54,179 --> 01:46:56,000
insistence that meaning value

2388
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,040
counterfactuals must be judged as

2389
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:02,760
strictly and literally as meaningless

2390
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:05,159
have we passed the point when the

2391
01:47:05,159 --> 01:47:07,739
Galilean program must be simply

2392
01:47:07,739 --> 01:47:10,080
abandoned and meaning value and purpose

2393
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,420
must be restored to science as

2394
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:14,520
irreducible explanatory principles

2395
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,980
alongside causation

2396
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:20,040
I find the mysticisms of both boom and

2397
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:22,920
Heisenberg's Quantum completeness and of

2398
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:26,159
Pauli and Young's synchronicity to just

2399
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:29,340
be too fluffy to be very useful in a

2400
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:31,860
word it has become a tradition of

2401
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:33,600
science as funded

2402
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,699
to insist that causation and causation

2403
01:47:35,699 --> 01:47:39,119
alone must bound our Enterprise this is

2404
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:41,699
a tradition of men not a feature of

2405
01:47:41,699 --> 01:47:44,340
Ultimate Reality meaning and value also

2406
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:48,800
have their place Not reducible to cause

2407
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:53,699
I like it yeah

2408
01:47:53,699 --> 01:47:56,340
excellent well Thomas thank you again

2409
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:58,560
for joining you're always welcome back

2410
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:00,719
and really looking forward to seeing how

2411
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:03,540
this all continues

2412
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:05,520
me too and thanks again for having me

2413
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,199
I've been very impressed with how much

2414
01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:09,780
work you do for the Discord and uh it's

2415
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:11,699
it's a it's a great Community I can

2416
01:48:11,699 --> 01:48:13,800
everyone's very very nice and

2417
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:16,380
enthusiastic so I was excited to see it

2418
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:18,360
I just sort of randomly stumbled across

2419
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:21,659
it so I'm glad uh I'm glad I introduced

2420
01:48:21,659 --> 01:48:24,260
myself to to the Discord so thank you

2421
01:48:24,260 --> 01:48:27,060
excellent all right till next time thank

2422
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:31,100
you great thank you
