00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,182
Hello and welcome. It's January 26,

3
00:00:08,236 --> 00:00:11,474
2023. We're here in active inference

4
00:00:11,522 --> 00:00:16,018
model stream number 8.1. Today we're

5
00:00:16,194 --> 00:00:18,930
appreciative to have Thomas Ringstrom,

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,494
who will be presenting on Reward is Not

7
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:23,862
Necessary, a compositional theory of

8
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,506
Self Preserving Agents with Empowerment

9
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:29,406
gain maximization. There will be a

10
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:31,578
presentation followed by a discussion.

11
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:34,074
So Thomas, thank you for joining.

12
00:00:34,122 --> 00:00:36,206
Really looking forward to this. Off to

13
00:00:36,228 --> 00:00:39,186
you. Yeah, thank you very much.

14
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:41,474
It's really nice to be here and talk to

15
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:42,660
this group.

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,634
I'm a computer science PhD student at

17
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,546
the University of Minnesota. My

18
00:00:50,568 --> 00:00:56,386
interests are in what

19
00:00:56,408 --> 00:00:59,846
are the computational properties that we

20
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:03,900
would need to have agents which

21
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,266
flexibly plan in sort of high

22
00:01:08,288 --> 00:01:11,610
dimensional product spaces of variables,

23
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,134
and also how do we get agents to perform

24
00:01:16,272 --> 00:01:19,082
complex tasks in an intrinsically

25
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:22,254
motivated way, especially in high

26
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,270
dimensional product spaces.

27
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,246
So this presentation

28
00:01:29,358 --> 00:01:34,370
is going to argue that reward

29
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,558
I know I'm talking to a sort of active

30
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:40,866
inference crowd, but some

31
00:01:40,888 --> 00:01:42,226
of the same points apply to active

32
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:46,022
inference perhaps too. But this

33
00:01:46,076 --> 00:01:49,778
presentation is mostly about how there's

34
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:51,958
going to be some major problems. I think

35
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:54,678
using reward maximization objectives,

36
00:01:54,854 --> 00:01:57,802
and by moving to sort of reward free

37
00:01:57,856 --> 00:01:59,962
objective functions, we can get really

38
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:04,282
nice factorizations that help us plan.

39
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,374
So let's just start off with a sort of

40
00:02:07,412 --> 00:02:10,446
simple, picture simplified picture of an

41
00:02:10,468 --> 00:02:12,154
organism. So we have a honey badger

42
00:02:12,202 --> 00:02:12,800
here.

43
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,374
This honey badger has internal

44
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:21,954
states. It gets hungry and it gets

45
00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:25,134
thirsty. And there's also an external

46
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:28,034
world that the agent lives in.

47
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:32,194
And in order to sort of modify internal

48
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:35,080
state spaces, the agent might have to

49
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,230
perform some complex tasks.

50
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,286
It might have to get several items in

51
00:02:43,308 --> 00:02:46,874
order to eat an apple or things like

52
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:51,770
that. So you could see that maybe some

53
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,926
symbolic state space sort of mediates

54
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,498
the connection between things you do in

55
00:02:55,504 --> 00:02:57,726
the world and transformations that you

56
00:02:57,748 --> 00:03:00,654
make on some internal state space.

57
00:03:00,852 --> 00:03:05,930
And of course, real world organisms

58
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,406
and humans live in a high dimensional

59
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,798
world. So you could imagine that there's

60
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:13,970
an encoder and a decoder and really

61
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,142
there's a sort of high dimensional

62
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:20,690
physiological or interoceptive domain

63
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,530
that is these Y tilde

64
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,990
with the dot or Y tilde, I should say,

65
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,646
and Z tilde. And then there's a high

66
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,090
dimensional world. You could just say

67
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,154
that's x tilde. And really you just need

68
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:38,922
to sort of map these down to some

69
00:03:38,976 --> 00:03:42,314
discrete state space in which these

70
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:49,546
domains can interact here's

71
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:52,030
like a simple encoder and decoder.

72
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,806
If an agent has a kind of

73
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,746
simple ontology like this, you can

74
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:01,934
imagine that it's sort of generatively

75
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:05,380
entrained to the world that it lives in,

76
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,162
which is a notion that's probably pretty

77
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:10,730
familiar to sort of active inference

78
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,534
people. So you have some

79
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:16,678
encoder of these high dimensional states

80
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:20,098
and then you have some operator PS,

81
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,902
which is in the middle of the head here.

82
00:04:22,956 --> 00:04:24,666
And that just sort of advances the

83
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:26,906
latent states. And then you decode and

84
00:04:26,928 --> 00:04:30,922
you'll get sort of expectations of the

85
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:32,970
high dimensional world that the agent

86
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,900
lives in.

87
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,710
The problem is that you can't really

88
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,258
represent explicitly these latent

89
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:45,326
space transition operators that would

90
00:04:45,428 --> 00:04:49,314
dictate the dynamics of all these

91
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:51,266
variables. You can't represent it as an

92
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:53,842
explicit object because the more state

93
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:56,306
spaces that you keep track of in the

94
00:04:56,328 --> 00:05:00,258
world, the larger this object

95
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:04,610
PS becomes. So in order to

96
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,742
handle this, you'd have to represent it

97
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:08,886
in a sort of factorized form. So you

98
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,926
just would represent its factors. You

99
00:05:11,948 --> 00:05:14,398
wouldn't explicitly sort of enumerate

100
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:16,982
all of the state vector transitions

101
00:05:17,126 --> 00:05:20,860
under this transition operator. And so

102
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,020
what we really need to think about is

103
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,974
what are the sort of model based or the

104
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:31,614
sort of bellman principles for

105
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:35,150
decomposing hierarchical state spaces

106
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,314
so that we can create the right

107
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:41,346
representations that help us plan in a

108
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:45,022
flexible way in a sort of time varying,

109
00:05:45,086 --> 00:05:49,086
time dependent world of lots

110
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:52,886
of variables. So this just means what is

111
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:54,950
a sort of objective function l

112
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,454
calligraphic L applied to PS or its

113
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:02,086
factorization that would

114
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:06,006
give us some factors here ada

115
00:06:06,118 --> 00:06:08,698
and these omegas that could help us

116
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:11,260
plan. And also,

117
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,458
given the fact that the state space,

118
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,554
the effective product space that we're

119
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:21,038
working in is so large and there's many

120
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:22,938
possible state vectors that describe

121
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:25,534
possible states of the world, how do you

122
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,986
know what to do? I mean, if you're an RL

123
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:30,298
theorist, you would have to say, well,

124
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:31,982
there exists some kind of reward

125
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:35,426
function that tells you this

126
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:37,826
state of the world is worth this much

127
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:39,458
reward and this state of the world is

128
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:42,214
worth this much reward. But it's not

129
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:45,234
really clear how you should define

130
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:48,226
reward functions on huge product spaces.

131
00:06:48,338 --> 00:06:51,334
So I will address this question from

132
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,390
sort of reward free perspective.

133
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,958
And just to give you a hint of what it's

134
00:06:57,974 --> 00:06:58,986
going to be like, what I'm going to

135
00:06:59,008 --> 00:07:02,506
argue is that what we really need

136
00:07:02,608 --> 00:07:04,842
are agents that have a kind of

137
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:07,854
structured core ontology that it needs

138
00:07:07,892 --> 00:07:10,014
to maintain. That is coupled state

139
00:07:10,052 --> 00:07:12,400
spaces that really depend on each other,

140
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,518
in which the policies that you use

141
00:07:15,684 --> 00:07:18,154
maintain the sort of internal integrity

142
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:20,740
or controllability of the agent.

143
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,730
And that's where empowerment will

144
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,634
eventually come in. So I'll talk about

145
00:07:27,672 --> 00:07:29,986
empowerment a little too. That's the

146
00:07:30,008 --> 00:07:33,446
controllability metric. So here

147
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:35,814
I'm just saying what's a nice policy or

148
00:07:35,852 --> 00:07:38,086
what's an objective function f that

149
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:40,258
takes in some intrinsic motivation

150
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:43,586
function, which is this fancy V here,

151
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:47,754
along with a nice factorization that

152
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:50,234
allows you to plan in the world. Okay?

153
00:07:50,272 --> 00:07:52,234
So just to recap things that I already

154
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:56,394
said, we're in a product space of

155
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:59,854
state of variables. We have internal and

156
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:03,086
external state spaces, hunger and

157
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,194
hydration state spaces can be dynamic.

158
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:07,166
As you do things in the world, you get

159
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:10,510
hungrier. So how do we plan?

160
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,674
How do we know what a good goal is? And

161
00:08:12,712 --> 00:08:13,906
what I'm going to argue is that we

162
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:16,462
should compute a specific representation

163
00:08:16,526 --> 00:08:18,302
called a state time feasibility

164
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:20,946
function, which is going to be an

165
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:24,246
abstraction that's going to map us from

166
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:26,102
initial state times to final state

167
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:28,086
times. And this will have some really

168
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:31,014
nice properties that allow us to sort of

169
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,042
reason in this high dimensional state

170
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,234
space. And I'm going to talk about this

171
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:39,914
from just a dynamic programming point

172
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,562
of view. There isn't going to be any

173
00:08:41,616 --> 00:08:45,446
learning. Okay? So let's

174
00:08:45,478 --> 00:08:47,334
just talk about transition operator

175
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:48,798
composition, because I said, well, we

176
00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:50,654
have this large product space of state

177
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:52,766
variables and it'd be nice if we just

178
00:08:52,788 --> 00:08:55,054
represented it as a factorization. So

179
00:08:55,092 --> 00:08:58,846
what does that mean? So imagine that

180
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:00,986
you have PX, which is like a base state

181
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:03,426
space to move around the world, and you

182
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:05,186
have some internal state space or

183
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:08,194
secondary state space PY. And these are

184
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:10,286
linked by some function f. So here's

185
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:13,526
your base state space. And here's the

186
00:09:13,548 --> 00:09:15,560
honey badger in the state space.

187
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,560
And here's the secondary state space,

188
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,042
which is just like your internal hunger

189
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:26,522
space. And so F,

190
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:27,994
what F is going to be is called an

191
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:29,946
availability function. And an

192
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:31,818
availability function is going to say,

193
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:36,410
oh, this honey badger is in state XAT

194
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,400
at time T. And given that it's there,

195
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,790
what's the probability that this goal is

196
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,710
available from this state time,

197
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,250
state action time. And so this goal is

198
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,746
formally going to be an action on the

199
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:56,066
higher level state space. So for

200
00:09:56,088 --> 00:09:59,634
instance, these green lines on the high

201
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:02,302
level state space are going to map you

202
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:06,102
to the most satiated state

203
00:10:06,236 --> 00:10:08,198
where you're not hungry anymore at all.

204
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:10,166
And then these black lines on the

205
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:11,798
internal state space are just going to

206
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:15,606
decrement you one state if you're not at

207
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:18,006
the tree, so you eat apples at the tree

208
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:19,306
and that's going to map you to the top.

209
00:10:19,408 --> 00:10:21,910
And all other states without a tree,

210
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,820
you're going to get hungrier over time.

211
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,030
Okay, so if we wanted to write a product

212
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,510
space operator PS y prime, x prime,

213
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,774
we can just represent this as a

214
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:37,614
composition where lambda P is our

215
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:39,198
composition operator, and it's just

216
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:42,580
going to be defined as the product of

217
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:46,814
your two state spaces with F linking

218
00:10:46,862 --> 00:10:49,038
them. And then we sum over G. So we're

219
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:50,786
getting rid of the goal variable and so

220
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:53,990
we can represent the

221
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,766
product space this way. And we can also

222
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,526
just call the product space. We can say

223
00:10:57,548 --> 00:11:00,614
that bold S here is just the state

224
00:11:00,652 --> 00:11:03,866
vector for yx, or if we have more

225
00:11:03,888 --> 00:11:06,138
variables that can be incorporated into

226
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:11,914
bold S. Okay, so what

227
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:14,442
if we have more features of the world?

228
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:17,678
We can drink water, we can get warm at

229
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:21,118
the house. Well, we will need

230
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:25,018
to have a bigger composition.

231
00:11:25,194 --> 00:11:28,094
So we can just create an operator called

232
00:11:28,132 --> 00:11:31,762
we'll just call PR, where bold R is

233
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:35,506
just state vector of w y and Z, and w y

234
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,210
and Z correspond to the hydration,

235
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,720
the hunger, and the temperature space.

236
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,630
And so this is just a product of the

237
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,050
individual ones, individual operators.

238
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,614
And so this influence graph is

239
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:54,142
connecting PX to Pwpy

240
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:56,714
and PZ through F. And so we can just

241
00:11:56,752 --> 00:12:00,058
define the product space operator as

242
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:03,466
a composition this way. And if we do

243
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:06,798
that, you start to realize, well, this

244
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:08,574
is nice because the effective state

245
00:12:08,612 --> 00:12:12,298
space exponentiates essentially

246
00:12:12,474 --> 00:12:15,854
as you add on more state spaces that you

247
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:19,086
can control. And so this influence graph

248
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:22,498
is just showing what is the sort of

249
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:26,270
ontology of the agent, what constitutes

250
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,614
it as its internal and external

251
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:32,246
coupling. And you could imagine that it

252
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:34,034
gets more complicated, for instance,

253
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:37,974
that if you hit W zero or

254
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,480
Y zero or whatever,

255
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,074
these skull and crossbones indicates

256
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:45,354
that you die. So you can imagine being

257
00:12:45,392 --> 00:12:47,494
in a state has a bi directional

258
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:52,170
influence. So Zeta here is

259
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,534
conditioning the possible dynamics PX

260
00:12:54,582 --> 00:12:56,826
can produce. So you could imagine that

261
00:12:56,928 --> 00:12:58,526
once you're in one of those sort of

262
00:12:58,548 --> 00:13:00,766
defective bad states that it kills you

263
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:02,766
and you can't move around. So you could

264
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:05,866
imagine sort of more complicated

265
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:08,922
structures like this, which essentially

266
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:10,738
mean that you have to go out in the

267
00:13:10,744 --> 00:13:12,834
world and do things in order to keep the

268
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:16,340
system alive. So you don't want to hit W

269
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,046
zero or Z zero. And you can

270
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:22,642
imagine this gets even more complicated.

271
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:25,602
You could compose sort of larger

272
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:29,094
structures where P sigma is going to be

273
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:31,346
some logical state space that keeps

274
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:34,418
track of multiple conditional events

275
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:37,834
that need to occur for say, eat an

276
00:13:37,872 --> 00:13:39,820
apple or something like that.

277
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,746
So representing it in this form is very

278
00:13:44,768 --> 00:13:47,438
nice. We just represent the factors and

279
00:13:47,524 --> 00:13:50,654
the links between the state spaces and

280
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:54,622
that's a sort of memory efficient way

281
00:13:54,756 --> 00:13:56,560
of representing the space.

282
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:01,810
Okay, so if we have a homeostatic task,

283
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,226
I'll eventually get to the sort of

284
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:07,074
Bellman equations and the model based

285
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:09,762
formulas. But first I'm just going to

286
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:13,126
sort of build up an intuition in

287
00:14:13,148 --> 00:14:15,750
the form of an example about how these

288
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,558
state time feasibility functions are

289
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:19,094
going to work. The state time

290
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:20,854
feasibility function being the

291
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:23,946
representation that I'm arguing for in

292
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:27,530
this talk. So if we have a hiker

293
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,810
and it can go out into the world and

294
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,442
drink and eat and get warm with these

295
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:38,334
goal variables, well, there's also this

296
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:41,294
goal variable, G epsilon, which is going

297
00:14:41,332 --> 00:14:46,334
to decrement by

298
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:51,266
one state. Then as

299
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:52,820
the hiker moves around,

300
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,274
you could represent this as a function.

301
00:14:58,392 --> 00:15:01,762
So imagine that the hiker starts at xg

302
00:15:01,826 --> 00:15:05,202
one, that's the house, and TS,

303
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:08,066
which is the start time, and the hiker

304
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:11,798
follows a policy pi two. So imagine that

305
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:15,046
you have a policy that is like a goal

306
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:18,106
condition policy pi G two that's going

307
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:21,706
to take you to xg two. Okay? So it's a

308
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:24,042
policy, it's like a shortest path policy

309
00:15:24,176 --> 00:15:27,742
or whatever, then that means

310
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:29,342
that there's going to be some final

311
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:33,534
state time xg two TF that you

312
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:36,302
achieve this goal G drink, which

313
00:15:36,356 --> 00:15:38,674
remember is in action on the higher

314
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:39,620
level space.

315
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,378
So what this would look like is that you

316
00:15:45,464 --> 00:15:48,434
decrement two, right, because that takes

317
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:50,466
two time steps to get to the lake. And

318
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:52,806
then once you get to the lake, you take

319
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,930
the state action that's going to drink

320
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,406
and it's going to bring you up. So

321
00:15:56,508 --> 00:15:59,542
there's three total steps in this

322
00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:02,754
process of inducing

323
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:04,874
the drink goal variable and then the

324
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:07,050
step after drinking,

325
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,186
which would look like this. And then you

326
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:16,046
can imagine the other state spaces are

327
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:18,894
not involved and so they will all

328
00:16:18,932 --> 00:16:20,366
decrement three because there's three

329
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:24,094
time steps. And so one

330
00:16:24,132 --> 00:16:27,498
way to represent this is to realize

331
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:31,426
that if all of these sort

332
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:35,154
of goal variables on the way to the

333
00:16:35,192 --> 00:16:37,294
lake are sort of the null goal

334
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:39,630
variables, meaning that the agent isn't

335
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,502
affecting some other state space, then

336
00:16:42,556 --> 00:16:44,754
you can define that as a Markov chain.

337
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:48,434
So if you set all of the goals

338
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:52,242
to be the epsilon goal, the null

339
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:55,930
goal, then this PY epsilon

340
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:00,086
is going to be a Markov

341
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:03,690
chain matrix. And so that means that

342
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,266
the time difference encoded

343
00:17:08,298 --> 00:17:10,110
in the state time feasibility function,

344
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,662
the TF minus TS is going to be the power

345
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:15,694
that you can take this Markov chain to

346
00:17:15,812 --> 00:17:22,194
in order to forward evolve all

347
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:24,258
the other internal state spaces. So you

348
00:17:24,264 --> 00:17:27,954
can define an operator that does this in

349
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:30,818
one step called Omega Y, which is just

350
00:17:30,824 --> 00:17:32,466
going to take some initial state. So

351
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:34,870
this green dot or this red dot,

352
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,254
and it's going to take the time

353
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,046
difference. So this is going to be two

354
00:17:41,148 --> 00:17:43,218
to get from the house to the lake. It's

355
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:47,382
two time steps. And so these gray arcs

356
00:17:47,446 --> 00:17:51,094
are just an initial to final state map

357
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:53,020
under this policy.

358
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,230
And so what this looks like,

359
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,806
this looks sort of complicated, but you

360
00:18:01,828 --> 00:18:05,534
can build a jump operator that jumps you

361
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:07,834
from your initial high dimensional

362
00:18:07,882 --> 00:18:10,530
state. For instance YXT.

363
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,218
And we're just considering Y for now. I

364
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:16,386
don't have the other state spaces W and

365
00:18:16,408 --> 00:18:19,970
Z in here, but this Ada

366
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,990
over here is mapping you on the X space.

367
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:30,966
The Omega Y is mapping you forward in

368
00:18:30,988 --> 00:18:33,922
the Y space and then the PY and the PX

369
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:37,754
are just evolving by one step to

370
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:40,586
update after you hit the goal. So after

371
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:42,266
you hit the goal, you have to update by

372
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:46,054
one step. So PY and PX do that for both

373
00:18:46,112 --> 00:18:49,534
state spaces and then of course you

374
00:18:49,572 --> 00:18:51,802
can do this for all of the state spaces.

375
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:54,926
So a jump operator for all of the

376
00:18:54,948 --> 00:18:59,026
internal state spaces, r, where R is

377
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,634
remember, is the vector of all your

378
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:04,420
internal states w, Y and Z.

379
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,180
Then this is similarly defined where

380
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,406
omega R is just the product of all of

381
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:17,266
these other Omegas. So we defined Omega

382
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:19,174
Y up here, but you can just define this

383
00:19:19,212 --> 00:19:21,110
for all of your other state spaces.

384
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,130
So now that we've done that,

385
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,986
we can continue our journey by going to

386
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:33,770
the tree. And so that's two steps away.

387
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,122
So all of the other things decrement two

388
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,846
and then an additional one. And then if

389
00:19:38,868 --> 00:19:41,102
we go back to the house, that's four

390
00:19:41,156 --> 00:19:44,654
time steps away plus the additional time

391
00:19:44,692 --> 00:19:47,902
step of entering the house and getting

392
00:19:47,956 --> 00:19:52,914
warm. Okay, so here

393
00:19:52,952 --> 00:19:56,820
is another route you could take where

394
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,814
the hiker goes to the tree to eat and

395
00:20:00,872 --> 00:20:04,374
then the hiker goes to the lake to

396
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:08,006
drink and then goes back to the

397
00:20:08,028 --> 00:20:11,714
house to get warm. And so this JS

398
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:15,034
is a huge it's important to keep in mind

399
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:18,650
that JS is a huge operator and we cannot

400
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,442
explicitly form it in memory because

401
00:20:22,496 --> 00:20:26,154
it's unless we have a lot of memory

402
00:20:26,202 --> 00:20:28,926
on our computer. But having this

403
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:31,802
factorization allows us to chain

404
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:34,526
policies together and evolve a high

405
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:37,754
dimensional state vector in these jumps.

406
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:41,198
So we're jumping a state vector around

407
00:20:41,284 --> 00:20:44,078
in this object oriented fashion where

408
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:48,014
each state vector is updated once

409
00:20:48,052 --> 00:20:50,998
you get to some key object of interest,

410
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,526
such as the tree with the apple or the

411
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:58,566
lake with the water. So also

412
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:02,966
in this example, you can see that the

413
00:21:02,988 --> 00:21:05,900
agent went from the lake to the house.

414
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,820
And technically, if z,

415
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,770
it occupies the lowest state, z zero.

416
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,938
And so technically it should die at the

417
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:19,246
skull and crossbones on the map, but we

418
00:21:19,268 --> 00:21:21,358
let it finish his journey. And we

419
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,006
haven't talked about this sort of bi

420
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:24,926
directional coupling yet, but we'll do

421
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:28,578
that in the next slide to

422
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:32,500
make that concrete. All right,

423
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,330
so if we have these defective states,

424
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,974
we can define mode parameters e

425
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:44,806
plus and E minus, which are

426
00:21:44,828 --> 00:21:46,054
just going to be variables that

427
00:21:46,092 --> 00:21:48,118
condition our dynamics. And we can have

428
00:21:48,124 --> 00:21:50,840
a mode function that takes any vector r

429
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,042
and R is any vector of blue, green and

430
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,046
red squares in the space, and we can map

431
00:21:59,078 --> 00:22:02,650
it to a mode parameter. So we can define

432
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,498
zeta to map to the good mode,

433
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:11,386
the normal healthy mode, if it's

434
00:22:11,418 --> 00:22:13,146
not occupying any of the defective

435
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:17,466
states. But if one or more defective

436
00:22:17,498 --> 00:22:20,626
states are occupied, then we can map it

437
00:22:20,648 --> 00:22:23,474
to E minus. And so that means if we have

438
00:22:23,512 --> 00:22:25,822
some low level transition operator

439
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,146
that's indexed by E, that means we can

440
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:31,958
split it into a normal dynamics PE

441
00:22:32,044 --> 00:22:35,554
plus and a defective dynamics PE minus.

442
00:22:35,602 --> 00:22:37,906
And you just notice that the defective

443
00:22:37,938 --> 00:22:40,338
dynamics is a sort of identity

444
00:22:40,514 --> 00:22:42,726
operation. It just sort of arrests your

445
00:22:42,748 --> 00:22:44,394
dynamics in the space so you can't move

446
00:22:44,432 --> 00:22:46,346
around, but the normal dynamics is just

447
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,210
normal grid world movement.

448
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:53,146
Okay, what we

449
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:56,558
can do is we can compute a set

450
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:59,710
of individual feasibility functions for

451
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,022
each object of interest in the map. So

452
00:23:03,156 --> 00:23:06,670
in the previous example, we had two

453
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,778
trees, two lakes and a house. So we have

454
00:23:09,864 --> 00:23:12,930
five state time feasibility functions.

455
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:17,614
And then this Ada hat is an aggregate

456
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:21,242
function of all of these functions

457
00:23:21,326 --> 00:23:23,526
where the pi is indexing the

458
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:26,440
corresponding pi for that function.

459
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,198
Anyone can ask questions, by the way,

460
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,880
if they have any questions.

461
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,980
All right,

462
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,776
so the full dynamics is

463
00:23:46,878 --> 00:23:49,760
going to be just defined like we defined

464
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,676
it before, where we have

465
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:56,396
these two state spaces, the base state

466
00:23:56,418 --> 00:23:58,924
space coupled to the internal state

467
00:23:58,962 --> 00:24:00,844
space through F. But then we have this

468
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:04,684
zeta R here on the conditioning

469
00:24:04,732 --> 00:24:10,736
side. And so this is an

470
00:24:10,758 --> 00:24:15,124
operator that you

471
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,284
have to achieve goals in order to keep

472
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,864
yourself out of these sort of absorbing

473
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,310
defective states.

474
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,232
I showed this influence diagram before,

475
00:24:28,286 --> 00:24:31,320
but this influence diagram is capturing

476
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,400
this coupling.

477
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,016
Okay, so many

478
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:40,828
of you will probably be familiar with

479
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:45,004
the standard Bellman equations which

480
00:24:45,042 --> 00:24:48,876
are formalized this way, where you

481
00:24:48,898 --> 00:24:52,124
have some reward function plus some

482
00:24:52,162 --> 00:24:54,832
discounted expectation of your future

483
00:24:54,886 --> 00:24:57,376
value. And so the value function in a

484
00:24:57,398 --> 00:24:59,024
sort of standard Bellman equation says,

485
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:01,680
how much reward am I going to get if I

486
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,616
act here optimally over an infinite

487
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:09,430
horizon? And so the reward function is

488
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,724
often thought to be a task. It has that

489
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:16,630
sort of semantics in RL land.

490
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,056
And then the optimal policy is just

491
00:25:22,238 --> 00:25:24,504
going to return the action that

492
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:27,112
corresponds to the best action that

493
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:30,716
maximizes your value, your long run

494
00:25:30,898 --> 00:25:33,148
sum of rewards that you're going to get.

495
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:36,220
So this is a recursive equation,

496
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,484
but my

497
00:25:41,522 --> 00:25:45,912
thesis is that we need to rethink

498
00:25:45,976 --> 00:25:48,400
the sort of model based Bellman

499
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,072
formalizations in order to compute these

500
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:55,428
nice factorizations that move us around

501
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:57,636
high dimensional space like we've been

502
00:25:57,658 --> 00:25:59,860
talking about on the previous slides.

503
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,300
So we're going to formalize some new

504
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,232
Bellman equations called operator

505
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:09,096
Bellman equations. And these are going

506
00:26:09,118 --> 00:26:12,468
to be non stationary

507
00:26:12,564 --> 00:26:14,056
Bellman equations or they're going to be

508
00:26:14,078 --> 00:26:17,144
functions of time. So instead of having

509
00:26:17,182 --> 00:26:20,284
a value function that says what's the

510
00:26:20,402 --> 00:26:22,828
accumulated reward that I get? I'm going

511
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:24,840
to have a cumulative feasibility

512
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,780
function kappa. And this is going to

513
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,952
represent what is the cumulative

514
00:26:31,016 --> 00:26:33,296
probability that I achieve a particular

515
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:35,616
goal, where a goal, remember, is an

516
00:26:35,638 --> 00:26:37,970
action on a higher level space.

517
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,896
So this has a very similar form to the

518
00:26:42,918 --> 00:26:44,736
infinite horizon Bellman equation that I

519
00:26:44,758 --> 00:26:47,284
just showed. But you'll notice that we

520
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:49,796
have this availability function here for

521
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:52,340
a specific goal. So this is a single

522
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,950
goal G that we're picking out. So say

523
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,216
the eaten apple goal or the drink the

524
00:26:58,238 --> 00:27:00,170
water goal. We're just choosing one.

525
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:05,060
And so F is returning

526
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,584
the availability of G from any given

527
00:27:08,702 --> 00:27:11,900
state and time and action.

528
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,684
And then, so either the

529
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:19,788
agent achieves a goal now, which is what

530
00:27:19,794 --> 00:27:22,816
this equation is saying, or which is the

531
00:27:22,838 --> 00:27:26,016
plus the agent does not achieve the

532
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:27,936
goal. So one minus the probability of

533
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:30,268
achieving the goal is the probability

534
00:27:30,364 --> 00:27:33,776
that you don't achieve the

535
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:37,204
goal times the expectation that you

536
00:27:37,242 --> 00:27:40,100
achieve it in the future. So it has this

537
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:43,460
similar recursive structure that the

538
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,470
infinite horizon Bellman equation has.

539
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,664
Okay, so then we have the

540
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:54,324
policy, and this policy equation

541
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,490
is a little different from the last one

542
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,216
because you can imagine that you can

543
00:28:00,318 --> 00:28:03,256
maximize the cumulative that you achieve

544
00:28:03,288 --> 00:28:05,548
a goal, but you sort of do it at the

545
00:28:05,554 --> 00:28:08,440
last second. You have maximized

546
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,492
certainty that you can get to the store

547
00:28:10,546 --> 00:28:14,252
right before it closes. So you know

548
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:17,296
100% that you can achieve the goal of

549
00:28:17,318 --> 00:28:19,744
getting an item from the store five

550
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:22,256
minutes before it closes. Well, it might

551
00:28:22,278 --> 00:28:25,456
be if the store is open for some period

552
00:28:25,488 --> 00:28:30,272
of time, that essentially

553
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,276
you might want to get it as soon as

554
00:28:32,298 --> 00:28:34,324
possible. So what this equation is

555
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:38,552
saying is that we're going to pick the

556
00:28:38,606 --> 00:28:42,052
action which maximizes the cumulative,

557
00:28:42,116 --> 00:28:45,204
but from that set of equivalent actions

558
00:28:45,252 --> 00:28:47,304
that maximize the cumulative, which is a

559
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:49,652
star. So we're collecting the actions

560
00:28:49,716 --> 00:28:52,376
that maximize the cumulative and we're

561
00:28:52,408 --> 00:28:54,604
going to pick the one that minimizes the

562
00:28:54,642 --> 00:28:56,968
time. So this is the sort of conditional

563
00:28:57,064 --> 00:29:00,156
optimization that says subject to the

564
00:29:00,178 --> 00:29:02,416
fact that we want to maximize the

565
00:29:02,438 --> 00:29:05,664
cumulative, we want to get there as fast

566
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:11,212
as we can normally

567
00:29:11,276 --> 00:29:13,356
there's just with the infinite Horizon

568
00:29:13,388 --> 00:29:14,624
Belmont equation, there's the value

569
00:29:14,662 --> 00:29:16,724
function and the policy. Here we have a

570
00:29:16,762 --> 00:29:20,756
third function, which is the

571
00:29:20,778 --> 00:29:22,356
state time feasibility function which

572
00:29:22,378 --> 00:29:25,284
I've been talking about. And the state

573
00:29:25,322 --> 00:29:27,864
time feasibility function says given

574
00:29:27,902 --> 00:29:31,736
that I start at X and T, what's the

575
00:29:31,758 --> 00:29:35,624
probability that I achieve a goal g at

576
00:29:35,662 --> 00:29:39,400
a particular state final state in time

577
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,676
XF and TF? And so you

578
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,808
can compute this via dynamic programming

579
00:29:46,904 --> 00:29:48,252
as you're computing these other

580
00:29:48,306 --> 00:29:52,460
functions. And there's

581
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,924
a relationship between the cumulative

582
00:29:54,972 --> 00:29:56,112
feasibility and the state time

583
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:59,776
feasibility, which is that if you can

584
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:03,024
sum up the individual final states and

585
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:06,240
times from your state time feasibility

586
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,572
and that is the cumulative. So the

587
00:30:09,626 --> 00:30:11,616
cumulative feasibility is just summing

588
00:30:11,648 --> 00:30:14,628
over the individual probabilities of a

589
00:30:14,634 --> 00:30:16,790
given state final state time.

590
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,136
And the nice property is that when

591
00:30:22,158 --> 00:30:24,020
you use these operator bellman equations

592
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,456
on hierarchical state spaces, such as

593
00:30:26,478 --> 00:30:30,344
the product space of the agent's

594
00:30:30,472 --> 00:30:33,564
core ontology, it has a nice

595
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:37,004
decomposition property, which is that if

596
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:38,764
you're just solving to go to a

597
00:30:38,802 --> 00:30:42,056
particular point in the world, then you

598
00:30:42,098 --> 00:30:45,516
can actually compute Ada

599
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:48,272
separately from the high level space.

600
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:51,136
So you just solve for Ada the state time

601
00:30:51,158 --> 00:30:53,520
feasibility function on the low level

602
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:57,184
space, but then omega can be computed

603
00:30:57,312 --> 00:30:59,380
independently in the high level space

604
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,764
and they can be combined. So this

605
00:31:01,802 --> 00:31:03,764
decomposition property is really nice

606
00:31:03,882 --> 00:31:05,396
because we never want to work in a

607
00:31:05,418 --> 00:31:08,696
product space, especially as we

608
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:10,648
learn tons of dynamics about how the

609
00:31:10,654 --> 00:31:13,736
world works, we need to be able to

610
00:31:13,758 --> 00:31:16,692
compute representations in a factorized

611
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:18,872
way which is going to help us move

612
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:24,492
around in reason. So this

613
00:31:24,546 --> 00:31:28,636
means that when we compute a

614
00:31:28,658 --> 00:31:31,692
bunch of individual state time

615
00:31:31,746 --> 00:31:34,048
feasibility functions for each goal I

616
00:31:34,054 --> 00:31:35,664
don't know why this little hat is here,

617
00:31:35,702 --> 00:31:39,280
but then if we have

618
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,724
five of these and we have an aggregate

619
00:31:41,772 --> 00:31:45,204
feasibility function. Then we can use

620
00:31:45,242 --> 00:31:48,436
this aggregate feasibility function to

621
00:31:48,618 --> 00:31:52,212
move around from

622
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:53,924
feature to feature in the low level

623
00:31:53,962 --> 00:31:57,040
world and update all of our internal and

624
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,730
higher level states.

625
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,096
And so this is

626
00:32:03,118 --> 00:32:05,384
the object from the previous slides that

627
00:32:05,422 --> 00:32:09,256
sort of map us around the world. So you

628
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:11,096
can also do, and I won't talk about this

629
00:32:11,118 --> 00:32:14,184
much, but you can also do logical tasks

630
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,628
where instead of eating an apple, you

631
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:18,988
might want to gather an apple. So if you

632
00:32:18,994 --> 00:32:21,276
go obtain an apple, then there could be

633
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:23,196
a bit that corresponds to having an

634
00:32:23,218 --> 00:32:25,176
apple. And you flip that bit to one once

635
00:32:25,218 --> 00:32:26,896
you go to the tree and then you go

636
00:32:26,918 --> 00:32:28,796
gather water at the lake and you flip

637
00:32:28,828 --> 00:32:32,544
that bit and then you go to the

638
00:32:32,582 --> 00:32:35,308
key and you obtain that key. And that

639
00:32:35,334 --> 00:32:39,136
might be a task where you have to obtain

640
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,316
these three items, perhaps because you

641
00:32:41,338 --> 00:32:43,684
wanted to compose this task with

642
00:32:43,722 --> 00:32:46,436
something else. You want to bring these

643
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:49,108
items to another agent or whatever. So

644
00:32:49,194 --> 00:32:50,824
the point is that you can use these

645
00:32:50,862 --> 00:32:53,000
factorizations to move around the world,

646
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,232
especially when things in the world have

647
00:32:56,286 --> 00:32:58,296
a sort of limited time period in which

648
00:32:58,318 --> 00:32:59,450
they are available.

649
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,364
I talked about how we can plan in these

650
00:33:08,402 --> 00:33:11,884
high dimensional state spaces using this

651
00:33:11,922 --> 00:33:15,970
factorization. And now

652
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,584
we get to the question, well, why should

653
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,256
I plan to any particular high

654
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:25,376
dimensional state? That's the intrinsic

655
00:33:25,408 --> 00:33:28,256
motivation question. Given that there's

656
00:33:28,288 --> 00:33:30,176
an exponential number of state vectors

657
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:34,036
in a product space, why is one

658
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:37,104
state vector of the world in the far off

659
00:33:37,162 --> 00:33:40,916
distance better than another? So that's

660
00:33:40,948 --> 00:33:44,068
where empowerment comes in. Empowerment

661
00:33:44,164 --> 00:33:47,668
is an intrinsic motivation metric

662
00:33:47,844 --> 00:33:50,312
which sort of represents

663
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:53,080
controllability. So formally,

664
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,124
empowerment is a function of a

665
00:33:56,162 --> 00:33:59,740
transition operator. It's an intrinsic

666
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,896
measure of a transition operator and

667
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,880
you can also condition it on the state

668
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,792
that an agent is at. So it takes two

669
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:13,324
arguments and it also has a horizon

670
00:34:13,372 --> 00:34:15,716
n, which we'll talk about in a second.

671
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:18,304
So it's formally defined as the Shannon

672
00:34:18,352 --> 00:34:21,024
channel capacity between your actuators

673
00:34:21,152 --> 00:34:24,676
or sequences of actions that you take

674
00:34:24,778 --> 00:34:27,352
and the resulting states. So the channel

675
00:34:27,406 --> 00:34:31,304
capacity, so here open

676
00:34:31,342 --> 00:34:33,530
loop sequence of actions would just be

677
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,496
go up right and up again, or up left and

678
00:34:37,518 --> 00:34:38,330
then down.

679
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,036
There are a lot of possible sequences of

680
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:45,704
actions. So big a here is a random

681
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:48,456
variable for your sequences of actions.

682
00:34:48,648 --> 00:34:52,850
And so for a horizon n, you can ask

683
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,980
how much information can we transmit

684
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,724
from our actuators to the resulting

685
00:34:59,852 --> 00:35:04,896
state at time tau. So tau

686
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:08,644
minus T is our horizon n, which is this

687
00:35:08,682 --> 00:35:11,088
parameter on the empowerment. So it's

688
00:35:11,104 --> 00:35:14,880
just saying what's the agent's capacity

689
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,400
to affect the future with certainty

690
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,120
or varying amounts of certainty?

691
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,884
And so the channel capacity is formally

692
00:35:24,932 --> 00:35:28,404
defined as the maximum mutual

693
00:35:28,452 --> 00:35:31,372
information given distribution over

694
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:36,476
these action sequences and

695
00:35:36,578 --> 00:35:39,244
the mutual information decomposes into

696
00:35:39,282 --> 00:35:42,132
the entropy of the final states minus

697
00:35:42,216 --> 00:35:44,336
the conditional entropy of the final

698
00:35:44,438 --> 00:35:47,888
state random variable given that,

699
00:35:47,894 --> 00:35:51,504
you know, given the actions and your

700
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:55,952
starting state. So this

701
00:35:56,006 --> 00:36:00,528
means there are two sort of extremes

702
00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:04,704
to empowerment. If PX is a deterministic

703
00:36:04,752 --> 00:36:08,264
operator, so anytime I'm at state

704
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:11,448
X and I apply an action, I get a

705
00:36:11,614 --> 00:36:13,880
deterministic output x prime,

706
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:18,120
then the conditional entropy,

707
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,964
there's going to be no uncertainty over

708
00:36:22,082 --> 00:36:24,876
my future state. So the entropy is going

709
00:36:24,898 --> 00:36:27,676
to be zero. There's no uncertainty. And

710
00:36:27,698 --> 00:36:29,192
so that means that the conditional

711
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:32,440
entropy has to cancel out.

712
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,584
And so empowerment is really just the

713
00:36:35,702 --> 00:36:40,384
maximum possible entropy given this

714
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:43,152
distribution. And this just reduces down

715
00:36:43,206 --> 00:36:45,780
to the log of the number of possible

716
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,116
reachable states. So how much can I

717
00:36:48,138 --> 00:36:50,550
actually reach in the world?

718
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,244
And so if my horizon is two, we can see

719
00:36:56,282 --> 00:36:59,304
that the empowerment here is just log of

720
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,424
13. So there are 13 states I can get to,

721
00:37:02,462 --> 00:37:04,664
and I have perfect control, so I can

722
00:37:04,702 --> 00:37:06,712
actually realize any of those 13 states

723
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:11,208
if I want. And the other extreme

724
00:37:11,384 --> 00:37:14,760
is, if PX is action independent,

725
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,048
meaning that any sort of state that I'm

726
00:37:17,064 --> 00:37:20,136
in, I have an action, that maybe there's

727
00:37:20,248 --> 00:37:23,852
the same distribution given that action,

728
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:25,680
say a uniform distribution,

729
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:33,296
then my

730
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:36,004
conditional entropy given the actions is

731
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:39,040
just going to be the entropy.

732
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,820
And so the empowerment has to be zero

733
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,184
because this term is going to cancel

734
00:37:45,232 --> 00:37:48,356
out. And so there

735
00:37:48,378 --> 00:37:49,716
might be a lot of states you can

736
00:37:49,738 --> 00:37:51,368
technically reach because I can select

737
00:37:51,454 --> 00:37:53,044
actions and I'm just going to go random

738
00:37:53,092 --> 00:37:55,096
places. So Pink is all the states I

739
00:37:55,118 --> 00:37:57,496
could possibly reach, but I don't have

740
00:37:57,518 --> 00:38:00,908
any control over which state I'm going

741
00:38:00,914 --> 00:38:04,344
to end up in. And so I can't influence

742
00:38:04,392 --> 00:38:06,670
my future in any way,

743
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,948
even though there are a lot of possible

744
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:12,356
futures. So empowerment in that extreme

745
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:15,776
is zero. And then there's an in

746
00:38:15,798 --> 00:38:18,656
between zone where you take actions and

747
00:38:18,758 --> 00:38:21,344
there's a bias in one direction or

748
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,912
there's different distributions for each

749
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:25,296
action. And so there might be

750
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:27,140
uncertainty, but you can sort of control

751
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,476
how much information. You can sort of

752
00:38:29,498 --> 00:38:31,236
control what state that you want to end

753
00:38:31,258 --> 00:38:32,070
up at.

754
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,656
Okay, so what I'm going to define is

755
00:38:37,678 --> 00:38:39,480
a function valence.

756
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,336
And it's important to note that

757
00:38:45,518 --> 00:38:48,536
there's two arguments, the states, and

758
00:38:48,558 --> 00:38:50,636
you can include the time too, and the

759
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:52,252
conditioning side. So you have

760
00:38:52,306 --> 00:38:55,870
empowerment and

761
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,104
you can define an empowerment

762
00:39:00,152 --> 00:39:04,290
difference. So say you start at S and T,

763
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,896
and then you end up at a

764
00:39:08,918 --> 00:39:12,172
future state in time after you execute

765
00:39:12,236 --> 00:39:15,830
some sequence of policies. So Row here

766
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,316
appended to the S and T is a sequence of

767
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:22,180
policies, and S row and T row are the

768
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,456
resulting states. Then you can compute

769
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:29,064
an empowerment difference. And this will

770
00:39:29,102 --> 00:39:33,450
be our valence function. So Q here

771
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,496
is a function that I'll talk about in

772
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:42,044
just a second. But we can see that our

773
00:39:42,082 --> 00:39:44,204
jump operator that's moving around high

774
00:39:44,242 --> 00:39:47,976
dimensional space is defined

775
00:39:48,008 --> 00:39:49,996
as this factorization. So we don't have

776
00:39:50,018 --> 00:39:51,596
to represent it. Remember, that's an

777
00:39:51,618 --> 00:39:54,812
important part. And so we. Can sample

778
00:39:54,956 --> 00:39:57,216
multiple policies from this or chains of

779
00:39:57,238 --> 00:39:58,784
policies. So if I have policy one,

780
00:39:58,822 --> 00:40:01,792
policy two, then I'm going to have some

781
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:05,264
resulting state r double prime, x double

782
00:40:05,312 --> 00:40:06,870
prime, TF two.

783
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,956
And so Q here can just represent the

784
00:40:11,978 --> 00:40:14,196
output of chains of policies. So you can

785
00:40:14,218 --> 00:40:17,428
imagine a tree search of chains

786
00:40:17,444 --> 00:40:19,396
of policies, and Q is just summarizing

787
00:40:19,428 --> 00:40:22,888
the final state of those branches in a

788
00:40:22,974 --> 00:40:25,576
tree search of policies of chains of

789
00:40:25,598 --> 00:40:29,210
policies. All right,

790
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,570
so we can use this Q.

791
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,884
So notice that this Q here is in the

792
00:40:35,922 --> 00:40:39,272
expectation over here. So it's linking

793
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,852
our original state time to the final

794
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,612
state time. So it's the empowerment

795
00:40:43,676 --> 00:40:45,520
after some chain of policies.

796
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:47,970
Okay,

797
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,966
so say we have a deterministic operator,

798
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:57,560
and this should be P,

799
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,674
then valence is an empowerment

800
00:41:00,722 --> 00:41:03,366
difference. We can have a simple sort of

801
00:41:03,388 --> 00:41:05,714
example here where we have two hikers

802
00:41:05,762 --> 00:41:07,190
that are considering two different

803
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,206
plans. And so if this tree

804
00:41:11,238 --> 00:41:16,042
here is like the space of two

805
00:41:16,096 --> 00:41:19,466
possible chains of policies, then these

806
00:41:19,488 --> 00:41:23,006
hikers are just executing one sort of

807
00:41:23,028 --> 00:41:24,590
path through this tree.

808
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,466
They both have the same empowerment

809
00:41:31,498 --> 00:41:33,086
because they're starting at the same

810
00:41:33,268 --> 00:41:37,202
state and they're both two away

811
00:41:37,256 --> 00:41:39,794
from starving. So if we just consider an

812
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:43,010
empowerment at the beginning, that's log

813
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,626
of 13, and if we chain

814
00:41:46,658 --> 00:41:49,910
together two policies

815
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:55,586
here, we can advance our internal

816
00:41:55,618 --> 00:41:57,702
state space and the agent will end up

817
00:41:57,756 --> 00:42:01,306
down at the lake. And so given that

818
00:42:01,328 --> 00:42:02,826
it's at the lake, you'll notice that

819
00:42:02,848 --> 00:42:06,634
it's one state away from

820
00:42:06,672 --> 00:42:09,414
dying, so that there's an effective

821
00:42:09,462 --> 00:42:12,766
range of where it can

822
00:42:12,788 --> 00:42:16,126
go. So the final empowerment is

823
00:42:16,228 --> 00:42:19,162
log five, because there's five reachable

824
00:42:19,226 --> 00:42:21,198
states and we're assuming determinism to

825
00:42:21,204 --> 00:42:24,846
make this easy. So the valence

826
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:28,962
here, and this should be PS here,

827
00:42:29,016 --> 00:42:31,746
but I have T here, but the valence is

828
00:42:31,768 --> 00:42:35,566
just log five minus log 13.

829
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,702
And that's the difference between the

830
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:40,118
final and the initial. And so that has a

831
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:44,230
negative valence. The yellow

832
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,474
shirt hiker is clearly in a worse

833
00:42:47,522 --> 00:42:50,140
position that he started off at.

834
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:55,274
But we can advance the other

835
00:42:55,312 --> 00:42:58,746
hiker with pi g three to the

836
00:42:58,768 --> 00:43:02,590
lake and then pi g four to the tree and

837
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,520
update his internal states.

838
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,110
And we can see that he's three away from

839
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,234
dying. So there's a bigger effective

840
00:43:12,282 --> 00:43:16,318
range. And so there are 25 states that

841
00:43:16,324 --> 00:43:17,440
he can get to.

842
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:24,242
Log of 25 minus log of 13 is

843
00:43:24,376 --> 00:43:27,638
zero point 94, which means

844
00:43:27,724 --> 00:43:31,014
that he's better off

845
00:43:31,052 --> 00:43:33,350
than where he started. And so clearly,

846
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,662
the second hiker is executing a better

847
00:43:36,716 --> 00:43:42,026
plan. He has more freedom to

848
00:43:42,048 --> 00:43:44,380
engage with other tasks in the world.

849
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:48,246
And so if we searched

850
00:43:48,278 --> 00:43:51,770
over this entire tree of policy chains,

851
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,766
we could pick the best one. And in this

852
00:43:54,788 --> 00:43:56,894
example, we're just going to consider

853
00:43:57,092 --> 00:44:00,590
two of these branches and we'd pick

854
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,514
policy pi g three,

855
00:44:03,572 --> 00:44:07,780
pi g four. All right,

856
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:11,426
so there's also another interesting so

857
00:44:11,528 --> 00:44:14,034
in this past example, we're just sort of

858
00:44:14,072 --> 00:44:16,126
changing the structure we're just

859
00:44:16,168 --> 00:44:19,702
changing the initial state. But since

860
00:44:19,756 --> 00:44:21,766
empowerment is also a function of a

861
00:44:21,788 --> 00:44:25,234
transition operator, and our operator

862
00:44:25,282 --> 00:44:27,750
Bellman equations are producing

863
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,186
transition operators that map us from

864
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:32,506
state time to state time, then the

865
00:44:32,528 --> 00:44:35,226
output of those Bellman equations, the

866
00:44:35,248 --> 00:44:37,414
operator Bellman equations, produce

867
00:44:37,462 --> 00:44:39,638
transition operators so we can compute

868
00:44:39,654 --> 00:44:43,018
their empowerment. So that's

869
00:44:43,034 --> 00:44:44,954
a deep connection between Bellman

870
00:44:45,002 --> 00:44:47,914
equations and these intrinsic motivation

871
00:44:47,962 --> 00:44:51,118
metrics. So we can do interesting

872
00:44:51,204 --> 00:44:53,794
things where we can say, well, if the

873
00:44:53,832 --> 00:44:56,260
structure of the world were different,

874
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,706
then the feasibility functions that I

875
00:44:58,728 --> 00:45:00,242
could compute in different

876
00:45:00,296 --> 00:45:02,786
configurations of the world would be

877
00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:06,926
different. So if

878
00:45:06,968 --> 00:45:10,226
the Honey Badger gets a key and it opens

879
00:45:10,258 --> 00:45:14,454
a door in the mountain pass, then it

880
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:16,518
could potentially get through to the

881
00:45:16,524 --> 00:45:18,894
other side. But it's important to note

882
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:22,470
that this is changing the structure

883
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:26,886
of the low level state space. So PE knot

884
00:45:26,998 --> 00:45:30,246
is what we'll call the original

885
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:32,186
transition operator, in which we can't

886
00:45:32,218 --> 00:45:34,606
go through the mountain pass. And that

887
00:45:34,628 --> 00:45:36,974
means that if we compute state time

888
00:45:37,012 --> 00:45:40,554
feasibility functions on this operator,

889
00:45:40,682 --> 00:45:44,434
that means PE here is going into

890
00:45:44,472 --> 00:45:48,018
the Bellman equation, then we're going

891
00:45:48,024 --> 00:45:50,174
to produce state time feasibility

892
00:45:50,222 --> 00:45:52,014
functions from those operator Bellman

893
00:45:52,062 --> 00:45:55,298
equations. That's this object here,

894
00:45:55,464 --> 00:45:56,966
which means that we can use it to

895
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:59,174
construct j to move us around high

896
00:45:59,212 --> 00:46:02,854
dimensional space. And so there's an

897
00:46:02,892 --> 00:46:06,454
empowerment for this j. But then if

898
00:46:06,492 --> 00:46:08,906
we get the key and the key allows us to

899
00:46:08,928 --> 00:46:10,714
move through the door, it changes the

900
00:46:10,752 --> 00:46:16,198
structure of the world, then that's

901
00:46:16,214 --> 00:46:19,354
a different mode of dynamics. So that

902
00:46:19,392 --> 00:46:22,298
means that all of this applies on the

903
00:46:22,304 --> 00:46:23,994
other side, where we can compute

904
00:46:24,122 --> 00:46:26,878
feasibility functions off of a different

905
00:46:26,964 --> 00:46:29,406
mode of dynamics in which we can move to

906
00:46:29,428 --> 00:46:31,726
the mountain pass. And so that means we

907
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:32,880
can compute things,

908
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:39,540
we can compute valence by asking is this

909
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,242
configuration of the world more

910
00:46:42,296 --> 00:46:45,294
conducive to the agent's core ontology

911
00:46:45,422 --> 00:46:48,626
that is, the agent's internal external

912
00:46:48,658 --> 00:46:52,566
coupling that needs to be maintained as

913
00:46:52,588 --> 00:46:56,342
a sort of core object. And so

914
00:46:56,476 --> 00:46:58,994
we can compute valence just by changing

915
00:46:59,122 --> 00:47:01,714
j the structure of the agent's

916
00:47:01,762 --> 00:47:05,930
abstractions that it moves to perform

917
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,566
tasks in the world. So by computing

918
00:47:08,598 --> 00:47:10,506
empowerment on j, we're sort of

919
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:12,938
computing it in task space. We don't

920
00:47:12,954 --> 00:47:16,558
have to consider all possible states of

921
00:47:16,564 --> 00:47:18,462
the product space. We can narrow it down

922
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:22,302
to operators that move us around

923
00:47:22,356 --> 00:47:26,002
task space, that induce dynamics on key

924
00:47:26,056 --> 00:47:27,714
other state spaces that we care about

925
00:47:27,752 --> 00:47:29,890
maintaining, such as our physiological

926
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,570
state spaces.

927
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:36,982
Okay, so here's a simple example. Say

928
00:47:37,116 --> 00:47:40,882
the Honey Badger starts at the lake

929
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:45,910
and has some initial empowerment

930
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:48,694
just on the low level operator. So

931
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:54,646
that's P 50 there's

932
00:47:54,678 --> 00:47:56,794
twelve states it can reach. But it also

933
00:47:56,832 --> 00:48:00,838
has a task empowerment which is actually

934
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:03,246
zero because there's only one task that

935
00:48:03,268 --> 00:48:07,450
it can engage in if you don't include

936
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:12,014
getting the key as a task. So the

937
00:48:12,052 --> 00:48:14,002
circle here is saying that there's only

938
00:48:14,136 --> 00:48:17,394
one sort of task that can be done. And

939
00:48:17,432 --> 00:48:20,100
so if the agent goes and gets the key,

940
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:25,086
it's going to reduce its physiological

941
00:48:25,118 --> 00:48:26,980
states because it had to travel there.

942
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:29,814
And then it gets the key and it

943
00:48:29,932 --> 00:48:31,938
conditions a different mode of dynamics.

944
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,282
So there's different feasibility

945
00:48:33,346 --> 00:48:35,698
functions associated with that mode

946
00:48:35,874 --> 00:48:37,894
which I just described on the last

947
00:48:37,932 --> 00:48:42,506
slide. Then the

948
00:48:42,528 --> 00:48:44,778
door will open and it can travel back to

949
00:48:44,784 --> 00:48:47,354
the lake. And so now that it's at the

950
00:48:47,392 --> 00:48:51,258
lake, it can go eat food

951
00:48:51,344 --> 00:48:54,298
on the other side, right? So before

952
00:48:54,384 --> 00:48:56,766
getting the key, if it couldn't get the

953
00:48:56,788 --> 00:48:58,446
key, if there were no key, then it would

954
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:00,826
just starve because while it could drink

955
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:03,598
water and stay hydrated, it couldn't eat

956
00:49:03,684 --> 00:49:05,714
from the apple tree. But now it can

957
00:49:05,752 --> 00:49:07,966
cycle back and forth between the apple

958
00:49:07,998 --> 00:49:11,586
tree and the lake for as

959
00:49:11,608 --> 00:49:14,914
long as it wants. And so it has

960
00:49:15,112 --> 00:49:18,514
a higher empowerment just on the low

961
00:49:18,552 --> 00:49:20,838
level state spaces, but it also has a

962
00:49:20,844 --> 00:49:23,254
higher task empowerment because there

963
00:49:23,292 --> 00:49:26,518
are just over a horizon of three and

964
00:49:26,524 --> 00:49:29,034
we're just computing, we have to choose

965
00:49:29,072 --> 00:49:32,326
a horizon. So the empowerment in task

966
00:49:32,358 --> 00:49:34,922
space is eight because there's eight

967
00:49:34,976 --> 00:49:38,140
possible branches in resolving states

968
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:42,880
from where it is. And so

969
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:46,926
that's very useful. So we

970
00:49:46,948 --> 00:49:50,560
can compute the valence, which is

971
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:55,122
0.5 just in the low level space,

972
00:49:55,176 --> 00:49:57,700
but also three in the task space.

973
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:00,674
And another interesting question which

974
00:50:00,712 --> 00:50:03,394
is very important is to say, well,

975
00:50:03,432 --> 00:50:05,966
what's the value of the key? And you can

976
00:50:06,008 --> 00:50:08,246
compute this too. You can say, well,

977
00:50:08,428 --> 00:50:10,594
given if I just fix the state vector

978
00:50:10,642 --> 00:50:14,774
that I'm at, and I just alter the state

979
00:50:14,892 --> 00:50:18,406
phi that encodes the

980
00:50:18,428 --> 00:50:21,066
object of a key, if I just alter that

981
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:22,586
state and switch it between having a key

982
00:50:22,608 --> 00:50:24,586
and not having a key, you can say,

983
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,754
well, this key has this much value to

984
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:30,566
the internal organization, the internal

985
00:50:30,678 --> 00:50:33,326
integrity or controllability of the

986
00:50:33,348 --> 00:50:35,950
agent. So it's a sort of agent centric

987
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:40,926
judgment of how much something in the

988
00:50:40,948 --> 00:50:43,962
world is valuable. And so the key can be

989
00:50:44,116 --> 00:50:46,450
not valuable if it doesn't do anything

990
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,738
in the world that helps the agent

991
00:50:48,824 --> 00:50:50,930
control its core ontology.

992
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,306
So this is a way in which you can sort

993
00:50:54,328 --> 00:50:58,440
of bootstrap value into the world.

994
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:02,642
You can use the change in an agent's

995
00:51:02,786 --> 00:51:06,390
internal structure, its coupling between

996
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,746
the internal state spaces and the

997
00:51:08,768 --> 00:51:11,082
external world. You can use the changes

998
00:51:11,136 --> 00:51:13,434
in that structure to assign value to

999
00:51:13,472 --> 00:51:15,370
things. And that's very useful.

1000
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:20,218
Okay, I think we're approaching an hour.

1001
00:51:20,304 --> 00:51:22,880
And so I'll just conclude by saying

1002
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:26,446
intelligent systems operate in high

1003
00:51:26,468 --> 00:51:29,326
dimensional product spaces, often with

1004
00:51:29,348 --> 00:51:32,234
non stationary dynamics. This introduces

1005
00:51:32,282 --> 00:51:35,826
a lot of problems, especially in

1006
00:51:35,848 --> 00:51:38,322
artificial intelligence because people

1007
00:51:38,376 --> 00:51:41,266
normally deal with structured tasks and

1008
00:51:41,288 --> 00:51:44,094
non stationary by training recurrent

1009
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,100
neural networks and things like this,

1010
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,366
which contribute a lot to sample

1011
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:50,958
complexity. And what I'm saying is know

1012
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:53,334
operator Bellman equations have this

1013
00:51:53,372 --> 00:51:55,154
different form which produces transition

1014
00:51:55,202 --> 00:51:57,590
operators, which helps you factorize

1015
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:00,714
your representations for moving around

1016
00:52:00,752 --> 00:52:02,806
the world and predicting the resulting

1017
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:04,810
high dimensional state vector.

1018
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:09,734
And these operators are composable,

1019
00:52:09,782 --> 00:52:11,226
they compose with themselves, but they

1020
00:52:11,248 --> 00:52:12,542
also compose with higher level

1021
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:15,262
structure. So you can remap different

1022
00:52:15,316 --> 00:52:17,534
transition structures to them. It's very

1023
00:52:17,572 --> 00:52:19,454
modular and these are very nice

1024
00:52:19,492 --> 00:52:24,066
properties that you need if

1025
00:52:24,088 --> 00:52:25,906
you don't want to recompute things and

1026
00:52:25,928 --> 00:52:27,342
you want to have sort of modular

1027
00:52:27,406 --> 00:52:30,194
structure come in and remap to your

1028
00:52:30,392 --> 00:52:34,980
representations that you've already so

1029
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:39,346
forward sampling. Can you still hear me,

1030
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:40,130
Daniel?

1031
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:45,346
OK, just checking. So forward sampling

1032
00:52:45,378 --> 00:52:47,078
is a good way of solving problems in

1033
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:48,662
high dimensional state spaces without

1034
00:52:48,716 --> 00:52:50,614
representing the product space. We can't

1035
00:52:50,662 --> 00:52:53,526
really solve, we can't do dynamic

1036
00:52:53,558 --> 00:52:56,010
programming in a huge product space

1037
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,782
that's not going to work. We can't

1038
00:52:57,846 --> 00:53:00,186
sample low level actions, that's not

1039
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:03,486
going to work, the tree is too

1040
00:53:03,508 --> 00:53:07,742
big. But we can work at the level

1041
00:53:07,796 --> 00:53:11,326
of sequences of policies and we

1042
00:53:11,348 --> 00:53:13,982
can evaluate empowerment gain to justify

1043
00:53:14,046 --> 00:53:17,714
our goal states. And so

1044
00:53:17,832 --> 00:53:21,426
Valence sort of unifies a lot

1045
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,066
of distinct drives. Like there's a

1046
00:53:24,088 --> 00:53:26,166
different sort of subfield of RL called

1047
00:53:26,188 --> 00:53:29,062
multi objective reinforcement learning,

1048
00:53:29,196 --> 00:53:32,278
which says we'll have a bunch of

1049
00:53:32,364 --> 00:53:34,438
different reward functions and then

1050
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:36,406
we'll have value functions for each of

1051
00:53:36,428 --> 00:53:37,974
these reward functions for different

1052
00:53:38,012 --> 00:53:40,054
tasks and that'll make like a high

1053
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:43,240
dimensional value function vector space.

1054
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:48,274
And usually in multi objective RL,

1055
00:53:48,322 --> 00:53:51,840
you have to pick a policy that that

1056
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:57,262
does well in that value

1057
00:53:57,316 --> 00:54:01,646
function space, but normally you

1058
00:54:01,668 --> 00:54:03,374
have to deal with the trade offs by some

1059
00:54:03,412 --> 00:54:05,634
weighting function. So what I'm saying

1060
00:54:05,672 --> 00:54:09,614
here is that because valence

1061
00:54:09,662 --> 00:54:12,834
is just one number and it summarizes an

1062
00:54:12,872 --> 00:54:15,330
entire sort of control architecture,

1063
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,822
that you don't have to introduce things

1064
00:54:18,876 --> 00:54:21,986
like weighting functions or weighting

1065
00:54:22,018 --> 00:54:25,250
coefficients to say, oh, this objective

1066
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:27,346
is more important now, or this objective

1067
00:54:27,378 --> 00:54:29,420
is more important now.

1068
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:36,074
So yeah, many latent drives is not

1069
00:54:36,112 --> 00:54:37,846
necessarily multi objective, it's

1070
00:54:37,878 --> 00:54:39,866
multidimensional, it's multi goal. But

1071
00:54:39,888 --> 00:54:42,030
it doesn't have to be multi objective

1072
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:48,446
with empowerment. You don't have

1073
00:54:48,468 --> 00:54:50,510
weighted combinations of empowerment.

1074
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:54,818
And valence depends on the

1075
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:58,046
structure of the environment. So it's

1076
00:54:58,078 --> 00:55:01,186
not just some static property of the

1077
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:04,194
world or a static property of an agent.

1078
00:55:04,392 --> 00:55:08,550
It incorporates agent world coupling.

1079
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:12,614
And I thought I'd just end with this

1080
00:55:12,652 --> 00:55:16,566
quote from Terrence Deakin, who wrote a

1081
00:55:16,588 --> 00:55:18,130
great book called Incomplete Nature,

1082
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:21,094
which I love and I read at the beginning

1083
00:55:21,142 --> 00:55:24,202
of Grad school, which inspired me a lot.

1084
00:55:24,336 --> 00:55:27,420
And Terrence Deakin wrote a lot about

1085
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:30,390
teleology from a sort of thermodynamic

1086
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:32,410
perspective and it's really compelling.

1087
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,322
And I just liked what he had to say

1088
00:55:35,376 --> 00:55:38,526
about teleodynamics, the idea

1089
00:55:38,628 --> 00:55:42,254
that an organism could be, or its

1090
00:55:42,292 --> 00:55:44,242
behavior could be organized around

1091
00:55:44,376 --> 00:55:47,154
realizing something which is sort of

1092
00:55:47,192 --> 00:55:49,666
virtual. And he says Teleodynamics is

1093
00:55:49,688 --> 00:55:52,002
the dynamical realization of final

1094
00:55:52,056 --> 00:55:54,382
causality in which a given dynamical

1095
00:55:54,446 --> 00:55:56,886
organization exists because of the

1096
00:55:56,908 --> 00:55:59,270
consequences of its own continuous

1097
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,806
continuance and therefore it can be

1098
00:56:02,828 --> 00:56:04,962
described as being self generating.

1099
00:56:05,106 --> 00:56:07,478
Specifically, it is the emergence of a

1100
00:56:07,644 --> 00:56:10,182
distinctive realm of orthograde dynamics

1101
00:56:10,246 --> 00:56:12,234
that is organized around a self

1102
00:56:12,272 --> 00:56:15,206
realizing potential, or to be somewhat

1103
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:18,054
enigmatic, it is a consequence organized

1104
00:56:18,102 --> 00:56:21,490
dynamic that is its own consequence.

1105
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:24,366
And I think that's relevant to what I'm

1106
00:56:24,388 --> 00:56:27,386
doing here because I think empowerment

1107
00:56:27,498 --> 00:56:31,166
sort of on an internal sort

1108
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:33,842
of structured ontology, allows an agent

1109
00:56:33,896 --> 00:56:36,978
to say there are multiple, there's a

1110
00:56:36,984 --> 00:56:39,474
huge space of possible futures. But I

1111
00:56:39,512 --> 00:56:43,314
can evaluate a state of the world

1112
00:56:43,432 --> 00:56:46,802
that's far off in the distant

1113
00:56:46,866 --> 00:56:49,766
future, and I can organize all of my

1114
00:56:49,788 --> 00:56:52,726
behavior around that because I can say I

1115
00:56:52,748 --> 00:56:55,814
can give an explanation for why it

1116
00:56:55,852 --> 00:56:59,590
benefits my sort of core ontology.

1117
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,046
And so therefore, it makes me capable

1118
00:57:03,158 --> 00:57:05,658
of acting that way in the future. It's a

1119
00:57:05,664 --> 00:57:07,706
consequence organized dynamic that is

1120
00:57:07,728 --> 00:57:11,462
its own consequence. So with that,

1121
00:57:11,616 --> 00:57:13,066
I just want to thank the Active

1122
00:57:13,098 --> 00:57:16,174
Inference Institute, and I will take

1123
00:57:16,212 --> 00:57:19,360
questions. And I'm very interested in

1124
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:22,814
what active inference theorists think

1125
00:57:22,852 --> 00:57:25,726
about the sort of potential for a sort

1126
00:57:25,748 --> 00:57:28,062
of integrated view of empowerment,

1127
00:57:28,126 --> 00:57:31,106
because I think you all have a lot of

1128
00:57:31,128 --> 00:57:32,414
experience thinking about generative

1129
00:57:32,462 --> 00:57:34,718
models and things of that nature. So I'd

1130
00:57:34,734 --> 00:57:36,806
be very curious to know what you think.

1131
00:57:36,908 --> 00:57:37,720
Thank you.

1132
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,720
Excellent. Thanks a lot.

1133
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:46,166
Great presentation. So this will be a

1134
00:57:46,188 --> 00:57:48,182
fun discussion. Those who are watching

1135
00:57:48,236 --> 00:57:51,018
live, please feel free to add questions

1136
00:57:51,104 --> 00:57:54,266
in the live chat and you

1137
00:57:54,288 --> 00:57:56,620
can unshare your screen and we'll begin.

1138
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:01,994
I guess I'll take an empowering deep

1139
00:58:02,042 --> 00:58:05,438
breath and ask a

1140
00:58:05,444 --> 00:58:08,046
general question, and then I have some

1141
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:09,866
scattered notes that I'll love to dive

1142
00:58:09,898 --> 00:58:12,766
into. So how did you come to this area

1143
00:58:12,868 --> 00:58:16,578
of research? What brought you to control

1144
00:58:16,664 --> 00:58:19,358
theory modeling and to the empowerment

1145
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,010
perspective specifically?

1146
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,282
Hold on, I'm just bringing up the

1147
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:26,994
YouTube stream so I can see comments

1148
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:27,880
right now.

1149
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:33,766
What brought just a general question.

1150
00:58:33,868 --> 00:58:36,546
Mute that one. There we go. Yeah, I'll

1151
00:58:36,578 --> 00:58:39,180
mute that sounds good. Thank you.

1152
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:43,398
Yeah. So what brought me to empowerment?

1153
00:58:43,494 --> 00:58:49,146
I've always been interested in how

1154
00:58:49,168 --> 00:58:52,442
could animals interact

1155
00:58:52,506 --> 00:58:55,194
in a world in a way that's so sample

1156
00:58:55,242 --> 00:58:59,182
efficient, especially like, knowing that

1157
00:58:59,316 --> 00:59:03,082
animals can, like a baby horse

1158
00:59:03,146 --> 00:59:05,902
can get up and move around and interact

1159
00:59:05,966 --> 00:59:08,542
with the world in a sort of fluid,

1160
00:59:08,606 --> 00:59:12,046
flexible way. What are the sort of core

1161
00:59:12,238 --> 00:59:15,346
representational capacities that are

1162
00:59:15,368 --> 00:59:17,350
needed to do that? And I didn't really

1163
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:21,078
see anything from the RL world, and this

1164
00:59:21,084 --> 00:59:23,190
is before I knew about active inference.

1165
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:26,086
And so that's always been in the back of

1166
00:59:26,108 --> 00:59:29,290
my mind. And another big

1167
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,822
influence was a guy named Nishith

1168
00:59:32,886 --> 00:59:35,450
Srivastava who wrote an interesting

1169
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,274
paper about how you can basically

1170
00:59:39,392 --> 00:59:41,562
have a sort of relativistic decision

1171
00:59:41,626 --> 00:59:44,702
theory that allowed you to make

1172
00:59:44,756 --> 00:59:48,570
judgments between different items

1173
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:51,706
without recourse to sort of hedonic

1174
00:59:51,818 --> 00:59:55,074
utility theory maximization. And so he

1175
00:59:55,112 --> 00:59:56,914
sort of argued that if there was

1176
00:59:56,952 --> 00:59:59,422
something like a latent acceptability

1177
00:59:59,486 --> 01:00:03,266
function, that you

1178
01:00:03,288 --> 01:00:06,494
could sort of remember a history of item

1179
01:00:06,542 --> 01:00:08,626
acceptability and you could remember the

1180
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:10,238
context that you made decisions and that

1181
01:00:10,264 --> 01:00:11,426
you could actually just do Bayesian

1182
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:15,046
inference over those memories. And you

1183
01:00:15,068 --> 01:00:16,230
could explain a lot of interesting

1184
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,794
things like preference reversal

1185
01:00:17,842 --> 01:00:20,010
phenomena in decision theory where you

1186
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,498
introduce irrelevant alternatives and it

1187
01:00:23,584 --> 01:00:26,634
changes the fundamental choice you make.

1188
01:00:26,672 --> 01:00:30,426
And I thought that sort of initiated a

1189
01:00:30,448 --> 01:00:33,040
lot of thinking into,

1190
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:39,086
how could you bring those kinds of

1191
01:00:39,108 --> 01:00:41,770
intuitions into sort of embodied

1192
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:44,914
planning? Like, how could it be that you

1193
01:00:44,952 --> 01:00:48,354
have an agent assign value to things

1194
01:00:48,552 --> 01:00:51,954
without them being sort of attributed as

1195
01:00:51,992 --> 01:00:55,614
sort of static

1196
01:00:55,742 --> 01:00:57,846
preferences or static utilities in the

1197
01:00:57,868 --> 01:01:00,870
world? So I think that was also a big

1198
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:01,910
inspiration.

1199
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,902
Awesome. Okay. And then one short

1200
01:01:06,956 --> 01:01:09,110
general question. Why the honey badger?

1201
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:14,454
The honey badger? My advisor

1202
01:01:14,582 --> 01:01:18,426
showed me a YouTube video of

1203
01:01:18,448 --> 01:01:21,326
a honey badger named Staffel, and in my

1204
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:23,790
paper, reward is not necessary.

1205
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:27,934
The opening paragraph talks about

1206
01:01:27,972 --> 01:01:29,902
Stauffel, and there's a link to this

1207
01:01:29,956 --> 01:01:33,626
YouTube video. But Stauffel is a

1208
01:01:33,668 --> 01:01:37,886
honey badger in Australia, and he's

1209
01:01:37,918 --> 01:01:40,930
at some sort of animal care center, and

1210
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,914
he's really good at escaping from

1211
01:01:42,952 --> 01:01:48,754
things. So the caretaker at

1212
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:51,714
this animal sanctuary constantly has to

1213
01:01:51,752 --> 01:01:54,374
build elaborate structures to keep

1214
01:01:54,412 --> 01:01:56,822
staffel in. So he has this sort of pen

1215
01:01:56,876 --> 01:02:00,146
called badger alcatraz. And staffel

1216
01:02:00,178 --> 01:02:03,370
would do interesting things, know, find

1217
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,146
objects to lean against the wall and

1218
01:02:05,168 --> 01:02:07,898
climb over. And if you took those away,

1219
01:02:08,064 --> 01:02:11,274
staffel would pack mud into

1220
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:13,678
balls and stack them into, like, a

1221
01:02:13,684 --> 01:02:16,058
little pyramid against the wall to climb

1222
01:02:16,074 --> 01:02:18,782
up and things like that. So, yeah, it

1223
01:02:18,836 --> 01:02:22,302
got me thinking, what is a sort of good

1224
01:02:22,356 --> 01:02:24,978
general intrinsic motivation function

1225
01:02:25,064 --> 01:02:28,500
that doesn't just work on

1226
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:32,386
low level states, but also in a

1227
01:02:32,408 --> 01:02:34,462
sort of more conceptual hierarchical

1228
01:02:34,526 --> 01:02:37,534
space? Like there might be objects or

1229
01:02:37,592 --> 01:02:39,926
mating opportunities or anything sort of

1230
01:02:39,948 --> 01:02:42,198
outside badger alcatraz? What is the

1231
01:02:42,204 --> 01:02:45,046
sort of way in which you could have an

1232
01:02:45,068 --> 01:02:47,142
agent sort of think in a sort of

1233
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:50,730
abstract way in order to justify

1234
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:53,050
its motivations?

1235
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:58,698
So I encourage the listeners to

1236
01:02:58,864 --> 01:03:01,210
look up that video. It's entertaining.

1237
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:05,290
It's like this general escape impulse

1238
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:10,270
yes. Extended into our open

1239
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:13,514
air context, where we also

1240
01:03:13,652 --> 01:03:15,842
want to maintain the ability to move.

1241
01:03:15,896 --> 01:03:18,130
And for mobile creatures,

1242
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:22,978
that's quite a good proxy for what we

1243
01:03:23,064 --> 01:03:25,220
might want to care about, like living.

1244
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:30,182
Right. All right. I'll go to a question

1245
01:03:30,316 --> 01:03:33,590
in the chat from Alex Kiefer.

1246
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:36,710
Fantastic work. Maybe a naive question,

1247
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,878
and I'm sure it's clear in the

1248
01:03:37,884 --> 01:03:39,866
formalism, which I have only begun to

1249
01:03:39,888 --> 01:03:43,066
look at, but the idea is that actual

1250
01:03:43,168 --> 01:03:46,442
agent environment coupling figures in

1251
01:03:46,496 --> 01:03:50,346
computing empowerment, right? If so, is

1252
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:53,614
there a fully internal proxy that can be

1253
01:03:53,652 --> 01:03:56,302
optimized given information available

1254
01:03:56,436 --> 01:03:57,390
internally?

1255
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:04,260
Is there let's see.

1256
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:08,834
Is there a fully internal proxy that can

1257
01:04:08,872 --> 01:04:11,410
be computed that can be optimized given

1258
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,946
info available internally

1259
01:04:16,078 --> 01:04:18,886
and not part of the coupling? Does he

1260
01:04:18,908 --> 01:04:19,480
mean,

1261
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,642
I suppose you could compute empowerment

1262
01:04:24,706 --> 01:04:26,840
just on the internal state space,

1263
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:31,706
but I don't know. Actually, I kind of

1264
01:04:31,728 --> 01:04:33,834
want to say no, just because you do need

1265
01:04:33,872 --> 01:04:37,226
to use actions to move around

1266
01:04:37,328 --> 01:04:39,594
and influence other state spaces and

1267
01:04:39,632 --> 01:04:42,494
things like this. I don't know how I

1268
01:04:42,532 --> 01:04:46,782
would compute just

1269
01:04:46,836 --> 01:04:50,762
a sort of internal intrinsic motivation

1270
01:04:50,826 --> 01:04:52,894
function that isn't a part of some

1271
01:04:52,932 --> 01:04:55,700
coupling to some broader system.

1272
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:59,182
What about the desire to think freely

1273
01:04:59,326 --> 01:05:02,450
and to move in cognitive spaces broadly?

1274
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:06,930
Yeah, I agree. Okay, so yeah,

1275
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,158
I definitely agree. If you have all of

1276
01:05:09,164 --> 01:05:12,630
your sort of physiological needs met

1277
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:14,754
and they aren't sort of imposing

1278
01:05:14,802 --> 01:05:17,986
themselves on you, you're sort of freed

1279
01:05:18,018 --> 01:05:21,898
up to do other things. Right? So yeah,

1280
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:26,182
I think that this could work generally

1281
01:05:26,246 --> 01:05:28,794
into very abstract spaces, maybe even

1282
01:05:28,832 --> 01:05:32,560
mathematical spaces and

1283
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:35,294
yeah, I think that there can be higher

1284
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:38,682
level dependency structures in abstract

1285
01:05:38,746 --> 01:05:40,926
thought or mathematical thought or

1286
01:05:40,948 --> 01:05:42,206
things like this. I mean, you think

1287
01:05:42,228 --> 01:05:45,886
about faulty proofs that sort

1288
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:47,806
of like destroy an entire field or

1289
01:05:47,828 --> 01:05:51,610
something. There is a sort of dependency

1290
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:55,680
structure in which that

1291
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:58,550
if you're working on mathematics that

1292
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:01,026
assume some proof is true and it turns

1293
01:06:01,058 --> 01:06:04,466
out to be false, then perhaps that's

1294
01:06:04,498 --> 01:06:06,710
disempowering from a sort of abstract

1295
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:11,082
perspective. I suppose so that would be

1296
01:06:11,136 --> 01:06:11,740
yeah,

1297
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:17,674
good, I was just going to say but again,

1298
01:06:17,792 --> 01:06:20,122
all that mathematics is being done by

1299
01:06:20,256 --> 01:06:23,566
some system that has to perform

1300
01:06:23,668 --> 01:06:26,126
computation which takes energy and stuff

1301
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:29,040
like that. So it's always sort of

1302
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:31,360
constrained by that,

1303
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:35,518
constrained by some kind of external

1304
01:06:35,614 --> 01:06:36,850
internal coupling.

1305
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:44,566
Many ways to go let's swerve towards

1306
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:46,982
active inference and then see if we can

1307
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:48,970
come back to some other areas.

1308
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:54,074
You mentioned the generative model of

1309
01:06:54,112 --> 01:06:57,258
active inference but you took a

1310
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:58,570
different approach there's, different

1311
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,854
model ontology. So just broadly, how

1312
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:04,974
would you structurally contrast the

1313
01:07:05,012 --> 01:07:07,006
coupling of the agent and the

1314
01:07:07,028 --> 01:07:09,726
environment in active inference and in

1315
01:07:09,748 --> 01:07:11,806
what you've proposed? Because the

1316
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:13,566
representations that we see in active

1317
01:07:13,598 --> 01:07:16,434
inference often feature the particular

1318
01:07:16,552 --> 01:07:19,538
partitioning where a Markov blanket of a

1319
01:07:19,544 --> 01:07:22,210
Bayesian graph is intermediating between

1320
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,706
internal and external states and then

1321
01:07:24,728 --> 01:07:27,014
there's a mapping function between those

1322
01:07:27,052 --> 01:07:29,254
internal and external. States such that

1323
01:07:29,372 --> 01:07:32,962
they can engage in an adaptive coupling,

1324
01:07:33,026 --> 01:07:34,706
again mediated through the blanket,

1325
01:07:34,738 --> 01:07:37,042
which is interpreted as providing

1326
01:07:37,106 --> 01:07:39,450
incoming sensory observations and

1327
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,954
outgoing actions. So structurally, is

1328
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:47,034
that compatible, incompatible or some

1329
01:07:47,072 --> 01:07:48,954
other secret third thing with what you

1330
01:07:48,992 --> 01:07:52,974
proposed? Yeah, so I would start

1331
01:07:53,012 --> 01:07:55,454
off by saying that I think the thing

1332
01:07:55,492 --> 01:07:58,702
that makes my work different is

1333
01:07:58,756 --> 01:08:03,222
that it's the structure of the latent

1334
01:08:03,386 --> 01:08:05,682
sort of discrete state space. It's that

1335
01:08:05,736 --> 01:08:09,970
structure that's under consideration

1336
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:15,022
and I think that in active inference

1337
01:08:15,086 --> 01:08:18,626
usually encode things like homeostatic

1338
01:08:18,658 --> 01:08:21,286
drives. Right? You encode them in a

1339
01:08:21,308 --> 01:08:24,086
generative model right, correct. They

1340
01:08:24,108 --> 01:08:27,202
are encoded as a preference over sensory

1341
01:08:27,266 --> 01:08:31,622
observations so that the entity seeks

1342
01:08:31,686 --> 01:08:35,370
out and selects ultimately policies that

1343
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,642
reduce or bound their surprise about

1344
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:39,834
those observations. Like I expect and

1345
01:08:39,872 --> 01:08:41,686
prefer myself to be at a homeostatic

1346
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:43,658
temperature. I'm not surprised when I'm

1347
01:08:43,674 --> 01:08:46,026
in that range and I'm going to undergo

1348
01:08:46,058 --> 01:08:48,014
actions so that I find myself in that

1349
01:08:48,052 --> 01:08:51,806
range. Yeah, so I would say that

1350
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:57,906
that is a major difference because the

1351
01:08:57,928 --> 01:09:00,642
state space in my case has this sort of

1352
01:09:00,696 --> 01:09:03,330
self undermining quality where it's like

1353
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,960
bad starvation states.

1354
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:09,254
It's not really a surprise, an

1355
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:11,430
expectation of receiving a particular

1356
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,150
signal or having a preference over some

1357
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:17,080
state of the world. It has a sort of

1358
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:20,886
self undermining quality that affects

1359
01:09:20,918 --> 01:09:23,500
your ability to control everything else.

1360
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:27,738
So I think

1361
01:09:27,744 --> 01:09:29,610
I would contrast it that way that

1362
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,846
usually the preferences or the quality

1363
01:09:32,948 --> 01:09:35,246
of the states are sort of encoded in a

1364
01:09:35,268 --> 01:09:37,754
generative model in the active inference

1365
01:09:37,802 --> 01:09:41,246
setting. And here I'm saying that

1366
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:43,374
there's a sort of structural coupling

1367
01:09:43,422 --> 01:09:45,902
that's giving rise to these valence

1368
01:09:45,966 --> 01:09:49,090
signals. MMM.

1369
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:55,374
You mentioned the key being obtained as

1370
01:09:55,432 --> 01:09:58,434
inducing this change in the agent's

1371
01:09:58,482 --> 01:10:01,794
ontology and one that was ultimately

1372
01:10:01,842 --> 01:10:03,970
reflected by increase in empowerment,

1373
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:07,206
hence increase in valence. So how does

1374
01:10:07,228 --> 01:10:10,682
it come to understand that this

1375
01:10:10,816 --> 01:10:14,810
shiny object unlocks that door?

1376
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:19,034
Yeah, I think

1377
01:10:19,072 --> 01:10:22,234
that throughout my career

1378
01:10:22,282 --> 01:10:24,320
I will try to make steps towards

1379
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:30,046
actually figuring that out because a lot

1380
01:10:30,068 --> 01:10:32,400
of this comes down to dynamics learning.

1381
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:34,622
If an agent doesn't know what a key

1382
01:10:34,676 --> 01:10:37,266
does, right, it's not going to know that

1383
01:10:37,288 --> 01:10:39,618
it opens a door and therefore that it

1384
01:10:39,624 --> 01:10:40,866
can move through the door and things

1385
01:10:40,888 --> 01:10:42,626
like this. I think there are a lot of

1386
01:10:42,648 --> 01:10:46,120
sort of maybe like Dyna like

1387
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:48,566
algorithms in which you sort of

1388
01:10:48,588 --> 01:10:51,894
alternate between learning things

1389
01:10:51,932 --> 01:10:54,278
about dynamics or things like this. But

1390
01:10:54,364 --> 01:10:56,054
that is a sort of outstanding question

1391
01:10:56,092 --> 01:10:58,442
for me, is like, yeah, how would you

1392
01:10:58,496 --> 01:11:01,206
take a key and learn exactly how it's

1393
01:11:01,238 --> 01:11:02,730
changing the dynamics?

1394
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:08,954
But yeah, what I am saying is that given

1395
01:11:08,992 --> 01:11:11,306
that you can do that, if you can do

1396
01:11:11,328 --> 01:11:14,062
that, then you can really sort of make

1397
01:11:14,116 --> 01:11:16,318
these value judgments to things in the

1398
01:11:16,324 --> 01:11:18,606
world. So I think that's really

1399
01:11:18,628 --> 01:11:21,246
important too, because consider money,

1400
01:11:21,348 --> 01:11:24,170
right? Like, if I find a $20 bill on the

1401
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,618
ground, I'm just going to pick it up. I

1402
01:11:25,624 --> 01:11:26,894
don't think I'm doing a fancy

1403
01:11:26,942 --> 01:11:30,114
computation, right, of like, oh,

1404
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:34,030
now my bank account is $20 greater

1405
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:36,006
and so therefore I have all this new

1406
01:11:36,028 --> 01:11:39,302
capacity or things like this. I think

1407
01:11:39,356 --> 01:11:41,842
these sort of preferences for various

1408
01:11:41,906 --> 01:11:45,254
objects like a key or a dollar bill or

1409
01:11:45,292 --> 01:11:48,730
things like this can sort of be

1410
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,486
stored and maybe models

1411
01:11:52,518 --> 01:11:54,490
with utility theory, who knows?

1412
01:11:56,830 --> 01:11:59,770
Okay, jumping around to some different

1413
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,974
questions. I hope I'm accurate in saying

1414
01:12:03,012 --> 01:12:06,234
you described empowerment as a Shannon

1415
01:12:06,362 --> 01:12:08,778
information theoretic channel capacity

1416
01:12:08,874 --> 01:12:11,550
between the actuators and the

1417
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:14,946
realization of the state. We might be

1418
01:12:14,968 --> 01:12:17,730
familiar with hearing Shannon channel

1419
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,610
capacity in the context of bandwidth of

1420
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,586
information transfer or upload and

1421
01:12:23,608 --> 01:12:25,718
download, for example. But this is kind

1422
01:12:25,724 --> 01:12:28,102
of an action oriented Shannon channel

1423
01:12:28,156 --> 01:12:31,926
capacity. So what does it mean to

1424
01:12:31,948 --> 01:12:34,098
get an intuition on that capacity

1425
01:12:34,194 --> 01:12:36,440
between the actuators and the state?

1426
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:40,906
Yeah, so the channel capacity is the

1427
01:12:40,928 --> 01:12:43,690
maximum possible mutual information

1428
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,274
between the actions you choose and the

1429
01:12:47,312 --> 01:12:51,630
resulting states. So the channel

1430
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:55,306
capacity is sort of the maximum

1431
01:12:55,418 --> 01:12:58,222
information that you can transmit from

1432
01:12:58,276 --> 01:13:01,406
your actuators to possible states of the

1433
01:13:01,428 --> 01:13:05,214
world. It's a form of optionality

1434
01:13:05,262 --> 01:13:09,346
that says I can affect this many sort

1435
01:13:09,368 --> 01:13:12,338
of possible futures. So, yeah, it's a

1436
01:13:12,344 --> 01:13:15,220
sort of intrinsic property of an agent.

1437
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:19,766
And so in a product space, this is going

1438
01:13:19,788 --> 01:13:22,502
to be affected by a lot of different

1439
01:13:22,556 --> 01:13:24,194
state spaces. If they're interacting,

1440
01:13:24,242 --> 01:13:27,080
like physiological, state spaces can

1441
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:32,426
kill you if they get too low. So I

1442
01:13:32,448 --> 01:13:34,330
think the interesting thing about this

1443
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,980
is that it sort of encourages you to

1444
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:41,626
think about cognition in

1445
01:13:41,648 --> 01:13:45,340
this sort of interrogative way because

1446
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:48,780
you're essentially trying to figure out

1447
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:52,866
what you can do. But there are a lot of,

1448
01:13:53,008 --> 01:13:55,650
you know, different state spaces that

1449
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,906
are hindering that information transfer

1450
01:13:58,008 --> 01:14:00,082
from your actuators to your state

1451
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:03,422
spaces. So I think it's very useful

1452
01:14:03,486 --> 01:14:06,758
because it

1453
01:14:06,764 --> 01:14:09,122
also sort of leads to explainable AI,

1454
01:14:09,186 --> 01:14:10,774
right? You can sort of explain your

1455
01:14:10,812 --> 01:14:13,622
intentions in terms of concrete state

1456
01:14:13,676 --> 01:14:15,974
spaces which which have structure and

1457
01:14:16,012 --> 01:14:18,986
explanation, things like that. I think I

1458
01:14:19,008 --> 01:14:21,660
got off topic from your question, but

1459
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:25,642
anything else on Shannon channel

1460
01:14:25,696 --> 01:14:27,980
capacity that I should talk about?

1461
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:31,662
I think, before we loop it back to

1462
01:14:31,716 --> 01:14:35,134
potentially expected free energy. You

1463
01:14:35,172 --> 01:14:39,866
mentioned the AI topic,

1464
01:14:39,978 --> 01:14:43,602
and is there any risk of

1465
01:14:43,736 --> 01:14:46,994
an imperative that features its

1466
01:14:47,032 --> 01:14:50,546
own empowerment in

1467
01:14:50,568 --> 01:14:53,378
terms of an AI being able to then select

1468
01:14:53,464 --> 01:14:56,502
action policies that might not be what

1469
01:14:56,556 --> 01:14:59,766
anyone else expects or prefers, may not

1470
01:14:59,788 --> 01:15:01,686
even be concordant with their own

1471
01:15:01,788 --> 01:15:04,950
encoded explainable AI priors, but

1472
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,646
rather something that takes an

1473
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,310
unbounding approach?

1474
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:13,770
Yeah, I do think that that is a fear.

1475
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:16,474
I haven't thought that much about the

1476
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:17,994
alignment question, so I'd be very

1477
01:15:18,032 --> 01:15:20,810
interested in what alignment researchers

1478
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:24,446
think of this perspective. I think that

1479
01:15:24,468 --> 01:15:26,526
there's a lot of interesting work to do

1480
01:15:26,628 --> 01:15:29,178
on sort of multi agent empowerment,

1481
01:15:29,354 --> 01:15:31,470
especially with these sort of abstract

1482
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:34,914
transition operators that work on long

1483
01:15:34,952 --> 01:15:38,866
time scales and you

1484
01:15:38,888 --> 01:15:43,246
can see that how sort of socialization

1485
01:15:43,358 --> 01:15:46,550
matters and things like this. If you're

1486
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:48,840
in a world with multiple agents,

1487
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:55,078
do you have to learn to respect all of

1488
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:57,414
the agents empowerment? I mean, they can

1489
01:15:57,452 --> 01:15:59,420
also act against you, right?

1490
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:03,238
So? Yeah. I don't know. I do think it's

1491
01:16:03,414 --> 01:16:05,530
a fear to take seriously.

1492
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:08,154
I don't know how I would do it though,

1493
01:16:08,192 --> 01:16:10,822
because it's an outstanding research

1494
01:16:10,896 --> 01:16:14,142
question to me. Coming from an ant

1495
01:16:14,196 --> 01:16:16,206
colony background, you mentioned the

1496
01:16:16,228 --> 01:16:17,966
socialization and I immediately thought,

1497
01:16:17,988 --> 01:16:21,262
well, let's just say that the seeds take

1498
01:16:21,316 --> 01:16:23,940
two or three nest mates to carry home.

1499
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:28,574
So in order to have one nest mate

1500
01:16:28,702 --> 01:16:31,634
achieve the maximum empowerment, they

1501
01:16:31,672 --> 01:16:34,258
must also engage in a pro social

1502
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:37,262
environment. Because if anyone else,

1503
01:16:37,336 --> 01:16:40,534
even if their model is smaller and less

1504
01:16:40,572 --> 01:16:42,614
empowered, if they just decide not to

1505
01:16:42,652 --> 01:16:45,350
play, then that individual until it

1506
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:47,062
figures out how to carry the seed home

1507
01:16:47,116 --> 01:16:50,940
alone is going to actually be kind of

1508
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:54,954
tethered to a social fabric that

1509
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:58,166
helps it actually obtain those goals.

1510
01:16:58,278 --> 01:17:01,854
So it puts the social imperative as

1511
01:17:01,892 --> 01:17:04,094
a screen in front of potentially any

1512
01:17:04,132 --> 01:17:07,520
other imperative. Just a thought.

1513
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:10,400
Yeah, that's a great thought.

1514
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:16,498
You mentioned the decomposition of some

1515
01:17:16,664 --> 01:17:19,298
function. I'll let you unpack exactly

1516
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:21,780
what function was being decomposed and

1517
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:25,262
you justified that by saying we never

1518
01:17:25,336 --> 01:17:30,694
want to work in the product space from

1519
01:17:30,732 --> 01:17:33,154
a computational complexity perspective

1520
01:17:33,202 --> 01:17:36,614
or however makes sense. What are the

1521
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:40,006
dangers or what are the scaling features

1522
01:17:40,038 --> 01:17:43,306
of that product space and then what is

1523
01:17:43,328 --> 01:17:46,154
the decomposition that facilitates a

1524
01:17:46,192 --> 01:17:49,706
more tractable form? Yeah, I'll share

1525
01:17:49,728 --> 01:17:51,306
my screen again. We can go back to that

1526
01:17:51,328 --> 01:17:53,500
slide. Thank you.

1527
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:00,310
Let's see,

1528
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,450
here it is.

1529
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:33,182
You can see my screen. Yep. And maybe

1530
01:18:33,236 --> 01:18:35,374
even a brief summary of what is a

1531
01:18:35,412 --> 01:18:38,734
Bellman equation and how did you move

1532
01:18:38,852 --> 01:18:40,946
from the standard formalization of

1533
01:18:40,968 --> 01:18:42,702
Bellman equations into this operator

1534
01:18:42,766 --> 01:18:46,770
space? Sure, yeah. The standard

1535
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,210
Bellman equation,

1536
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:55,016
I don't know the button for one slide

1537
01:18:55,068 --> 01:18:57,424
forward. Okay, so the standard Bellman

1538
01:18:57,472 --> 01:19:00,832
equation just has this recursive

1539
01:19:00,896 --> 01:19:04,436
form and it's just the value of

1540
01:19:04,458 --> 01:19:07,376
a state that you're at. The optimal

1541
01:19:07,408 --> 01:19:11,256
value of that state is the

1542
01:19:11,278 --> 01:19:13,224
maximum value that you can get by

1543
01:19:13,262 --> 01:19:16,968
choosing an action that rewards you and

1544
01:19:17,054 --> 01:19:19,176
takes you to a state from which you can

1545
01:19:19,198 --> 01:19:21,768
act in the future to get more reward.

1546
01:19:21,944 --> 01:19:26,396
So the Bellman equation can

1547
01:19:26,418 --> 01:19:30,636
be solved by dynamic programming in

1548
01:19:30,658 --> 01:19:33,728
order to maximize this function V.

1549
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:37,516
So it'll result in a policy that moves

1550
01:19:37,548 --> 01:19:39,984
you around the world in a way that

1551
01:19:40,022 --> 01:19:43,056
accumulates a reward that you'll find in

1552
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:46,436
your environment. So it has this

1553
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:49,152
recursive form. You can sort of unroll

1554
01:19:49,216 --> 01:19:52,836
it into a sequence and then the

1555
01:19:52,858 --> 01:19:55,764
operator Bellman equation has this

1556
01:19:55,882 --> 01:19:59,290
similar recursive form where now

1557
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:02,260
you'll notice that there isn't a reward

1558
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:04,228
function. There's this availability

1559
01:20:04,324 --> 01:20:06,264
function and it returns a number between

1560
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:08,200
zero and one. It returns a probability.

1561
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:12,876
And so that's significant because it

1562
01:20:12,898 --> 01:20:14,076
means that you can maximize the

1563
01:20:14,098 --> 01:20:17,660
cumulative feasibility. And so

1564
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,564
F here is just saying this goal is

1565
01:20:19,602 --> 01:20:22,216
available. Either you achieve the goal

1566
01:20:22,248 --> 01:20:24,876
now or you take an action. You don't

1567
01:20:24,908 --> 01:20:26,800
achieve it now, but you take an action

1568
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:28,768
in which you'll achieve it in the

1569
01:20:28,774 --> 01:20:33,104
future. So it

1570
01:20:33,142 --> 01:20:35,188
has the same form where you can sort of

1571
01:20:35,194 --> 01:20:37,716
think of an availability function as a

1572
01:20:37,738 --> 01:20:40,276
reward, but it's maintaining a

1573
01:20:40,298 --> 01:20:43,316
probabilistic form. And that

1574
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:46,628
probabilistic form is important because

1575
01:20:46,794 --> 01:20:50,376
it's what allows you to compute the

1576
01:20:50,398 --> 01:20:53,332
state time feasibility as a transition

1577
01:20:53,396 --> 01:20:55,624
operator, as an operator that maps you

1578
01:20:55,662 --> 01:20:58,664
from where you are now, the state time

1579
01:20:58,702 --> 01:21:01,916
you're at now, which is XT, to the final

1580
01:21:02,018 --> 01:21:04,860
state time and goal that you achieve.

1581
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,612
So under the policy, so it says if I

1582
01:21:09,666 --> 01:21:12,316
start at XT and I follow this policy and

1583
01:21:12,338 --> 01:21:13,952
I'm choosing actions that move me

1584
01:21:14,006 --> 01:21:16,796
through this state space, then I'm

1585
01:21:16,828 --> 01:21:18,496
eventually going to get to the goal and

1586
01:21:18,518 --> 01:21:21,776
I want to know the final state in time,

1587
01:21:21,958 --> 01:21:24,876
the probability that I achieved this at

1588
01:21:24,918 --> 01:21:28,532
any given state in time. And so the

1589
01:21:28,586 --> 01:21:31,652
state time feasibility function is here.

1590
01:21:31,706 --> 01:21:33,904
As it's expressed is a transition

1591
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:36,244
operator with one action, which is the

1592
01:21:36,282 --> 01:21:39,860
policy. But when we aggregate it I'll

1593
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:43,384
bring this up. When we aggregate it into

1594
01:21:43,502 --> 01:21:45,796
multiple possible feasibility functions

1595
01:21:45,828 --> 01:21:48,648
that are centered around multiple sort

1596
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:51,884
of objects in the world, then all of the

1597
01:21:51,922 --> 01:21:54,556
policies associated with each one of

1598
01:21:54,578 --> 01:21:57,416
those these are goal condition policies

1599
01:21:57,608 --> 01:22:00,952
that are going to terminate on achieving

1600
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:03,132
the goal of going to one of these

1601
01:22:03,186 --> 01:22:05,856
features and getting the apple, for

1602
01:22:05,878 --> 01:22:09,680
instance. Then each of those policies is

1603
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:12,492
an action for this transition operator.

1604
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:15,308
So there's five possible policies that

1605
01:22:15,334 --> 01:22:17,956
are going to take you around the space.

1606
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:19,876
So these operator Bellman equations have

1607
01:22:19,898 --> 01:22:22,544
this probabilistic form which retain

1608
01:22:22,672 --> 01:22:25,428
this probabilistic structure. And you

1609
01:22:25,434 --> 01:22:28,488
can sort of compare this with I don't

1610
01:22:28,494 --> 01:22:29,636
know if you're familiar, but there's

1611
01:22:29,668 --> 01:22:32,084
this concept in RL called the successor

1612
01:22:32,132 --> 01:22:35,672
representation which is often

1613
01:22:35,726 --> 01:22:38,292
a hot topic in computational

1614
01:22:38,356 --> 01:22:40,456
neuroscience. And the successor

1615
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:42,956
representation is sort of talked about

1616
01:22:42,978 --> 01:22:45,884
like it's this predictive operator. But

1617
01:22:45,922 --> 01:22:48,808
really what it represents is expected

1618
01:22:48,904 --> 01:22:52,424
state Occupancies under a policy and

1619
01:22:52,482 --> 01:22:54,336
those expected state Occupancies are

1620
01:22:54,358 --> 01:22:58,976
weighted by the discount factor. So a

1621
01:22:58,998 --> 01:23:00,656
successor representation is really a

1622
01:23:00,678 --> 01:23:03,344
sort of weighted statistic and it

1623
01:23:03,382 --> 01:23:06,240
doesn't map from like an initial state

1624
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:09,904
to the state of inducing

1625
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:15,044
an event of achieving a goal where

1626
01:23:15,082 --> 01:23:17,404
successor representations aren't

1627
01:23:17,472 --> 01:23:19,944
compositional. You can't multiply two

1628
01:23:19,982 --> 01:23:21,816
successor representations and get

1629
01:23:21,918 --> 01:23:24,136
another successor representation. Well,

1630
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:26,676
you can multiply matrices that represent

1631
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:28,920
state time feasibility functions because

1632
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:33,404
they're mapping their probabilities of

1633
01:23:33,442 --> 01:23:36,412
events. So you can combine them just by

1634
01:23:36,466 --> 01:23:40,492
multiplying matrices that represent the

1635
01:23:40,546 --> 01:23:42,816
state time feasibility function for a

1636
01:23:42,838 --> 01:23:45,216
given policy with another one for a

1637
01:23:45,238 --> 01:23:49,920
different policy. So that will retain

1638
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,696
the form of a probabilistic function and

1639
01:23:53,718 --> 01:23:55,936
that's what makes them reusable

1640
01:23:56,048 --> 01:23:59,412
composable, et cetera. And I think you

1641
01:23:59,466 --> 01:24:03,590
asked me about the decomposition and

1642
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:07,568
this decomposition. Yeah, I might have

1643
01:24:07,594 --> 01:24:09,780
glossed over this. But the decomposition

1644
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:14,276
result is that if you were to compute

1645
01:24:14,388 --> 01:24:16,696
a state time feasibility function in a

1646
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:22,328
product space which has lots

1647
01:24:22,344 --> 01:24:24,830
of state vectors which are each states,

1648
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,900
then you don't want to do that because

1649
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:32,848
product spaces are very large and take a

1650
01:24:32,854 --> 01:24:37,520
lot of memory to represent the operator.

1651
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:42,140
So if this was not PX and this was PS,

1652
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:44,832
and PS was the full product space

1653
01:24:44,886 --> 01:24:47,104
operator that moves you around this high

1654
01:24:47,142 --> 01:24:48,336
dimensional space, well, you can't

1655
01:24:48,368 --> 01:24:50,128
really represent that and you don't

1656
01:24:50,144 --> 01:24:52,724
really want to. But if you did and you

1657
01:24:52,762 --> 01:24:54,784
computed a state time feasibility

1658
01:24:54,832 --> 01:24:58,504
function in a product space, then you

1659
01:24:58,542 --> 01:25:02,296
can under certain conditions and I

1660
01:25:02,318 --> 01:25:03,496
can say what those conditions are, but

1661
01:25:03,518 --> 01:25:05,592
under certain conditions you can

1662
01:25:05,646 --> 01:25:09,028
decompose this into a prediction

1663
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:12,120
of all of the higher level state spaces

1664
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:15,272
computed independently. So you evolve

1665
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:17,356
the hunger space separately and you

1666
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:19,996
evolve the thirst space separately and

1667
01:25:20,018 --> 01:25:21,996
you evolve the temperature space

1668
01:25:22,098 --> 01:25:24,576
separately. You can do all of those

1669
01:25:24,598 --> 01:25:29,136
computations locally on those spaces and

1670
01:25:29,158 --> 01:25:31,824
you can combine them with a state time

1671
01:25:31,862 --> 01:25:33,360
feasibility function that's only

1672
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:35,750
computed on the low level space.

1673
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:41,796
So this hierarchical state time

1674
01:25:41,818 --> 01:25:45,184
feasibility function is an intractable

1675
01:25:45,232 --> 01:25:48,756
object for most reasonably sized

1676
01:25:48,788 --> 01:25:52,760
problems, but you can implicitly form

1677
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:56,072
it by this product of these things

1678
01:25:56,126 --> 01:26:00,068
individually. And so this works when

1679
01:26:00,174 --> 01:26:04,044
your goal for the

1680
01:26:04,162 --> 01:26:06,184
hierarchical state time feasibility

1681
01:26:06,232 --> 01:26:07,772
function, when you just have a single

1682
01:26:07,826 --> 01:26:11,032
goal at arriving at a particular feature

1683
01:26:11,096 --> 01:26:12,700
of the world like a tree,

1684
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:19,232
that's one of the conditions in which

1685
01:26:19,286 --> 01:26:22,384
this decomposition holds. So I think

1686
01:26:22,422 --> 01:26:24,844
that answered your question about the

1687
01:26:24,902 --> 01:26:27,350
burden of a product space. Well,

1688
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:30,420
you need to overcome it by doing local

1689
01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:33,344
computations on individual state spaces

1690
01:26:33,392 --> 01:26:36,944
in a sort of network of interconnected

1691
01:26:36,992 --> 01:26:40,776
state spaces that implicitly form a

1692
01:26:40,798 --> 01:26:43,076
product space. But you want to compute

1693
01:26:43,108 --> 01:26:45,496
all of the representations separately in

1694
01:26:45,518 --> 01:26:48,216
this network of state spaces so that you

1695
01:26:48,238 --> 01:26:49,908
can sort of move around this high

1696
01:26:49,934 --> 01:26:53,448
dimensional state space under successive

1697
01:26:53,544 --> 01:26:57,016
policies. And so that's

1698
01:26:57,048 --> 01:26:59,740
what allows you to handle forward

1699
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:02,960
sampling in this high dimensional state

1700
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:06,448
space. And that's important because

1701
01:27:06,614 --> 01:27:11,440
I think just to recall

1702
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:14,848
the sort of presentation, I think it

1703
01:27:14,854 --> 01:27:18,556
was aval A-V-E-L yes, the French.

1704
01:27:18,748 --> 01:27:22,496
Gwen Carlo yeah, just to echo

1705
01:27:22,688 --> 01:27:27,656
that sort of sentiment, that if

1706
01:27:27,678 --> 01:27:30,056
you're creating new state spaces or

1707
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:33,108
you're composing, you're not computing

1708
01:27:33,204 --> 01:27:35,050
policies in a fixed world,

1709
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:38,170
you're composing things together,

1710
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:41,916
that's of course, going to expand the

1711
01:27:41,938 --> 01:27:44,508
product space implicitly of all the

1712
01:27:44,594 --> 01:27:47,724
state vectors of the system. And the

1713
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:50,204
act of composing or bringing new

1714
01:27:50,242 --> 01:27:53,324
information in is expanding the implicit

1715
01:27:53,372 --> 01:27:56,144
product space that you are in.

1716
01:27:56,342 --> 01:27:59,520
And so from an RL standpoint,

1717
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:03,392
it's not so clear what a reward function

1718
01:28:03,446 --> 01:28:05,172
on that product space is even supposed

1719
01:28:05,226 --> 01:28:07,990
to be. I don't think that anyone will

1720
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:12,452
answer that question. But it's also not

1721
01:28:12,506 --> 01:28:16,230
clear what a generative model

1722
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:18,232
should look like on that product space

1723
01:28:18,286 --> 01:28:23,556
either. And I think given that humans

1724
01:28:23,588 --> 01:28:27,224
at least are so skilled at

1725
01:28:27,262 --> 01:28:30,348
this sort of dialectical process of

1726
01:28:30,434 --> 01:28:33,784
proposing theories and composing

1727
01:28:33,832 --> 01:28:37,790
structure as hypotheses and

1728
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,830
interrogating what that means,

1729
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,600
I think that value comes from

1730
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:48,784
interrogating what it means for

1731
01:28:48,822 --> 01:28:50,048
the structure of the world to be a

1732
01:28:50,054 --> 01:28:53,564
certain way. So if I learn new dynamics

1733
01:28:53,612 --> 01:28:55,170
of the world and I want to control

1734
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,004
dynamics on some new space, it might

1735
01:28:58,042 --> 01:29:01,716
affect other state spaces. But from

1736
01:29:01,738 --> 01:29:03,492
a normative perspective, it's not really

1737
01:29:03,546 --> 01:29:07,604
clear. Once you compose something and

1738
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:09,320
you're expanding the implicit product

1739
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:12,296
space, it's not so clear where any sort

1740
01:29:12,318 --> 01:29:14,776
of source of normativity should come

1741
01:29:14,798 --> 01:29:17,844
from. But I think the sort of flexible

1742
01:29:17,892 --> 01:29:20,324
human reasoning that we sort of know

1743
01:29:20,382 --> 01:29:23,932
humans to engage in, I think, is in this

1744
01:29:23,986 --> 01:29:27,132
sort of regime of composition and

1745
01:29:27,186 --> 01:29:29,404
interrogation where you're always sort

1746
01:29:29,442 --> 01:29:31,356
of saying, oh, if the world were this

1747
01:29:31,378 --> 01:29:35,276
way, then I

1748
01:29:35,298 --> 01:29:37,164
could see how this state space affects

1749
01:29:37,212 --> 01:29:38,896
these other state spaces in a way that I

1750
01:29:38,918 --> 01:29:41,024
didn't anticipate. And so I think

1751
01:29:41,062 --> 01:29:43,984
normativity in a creative way has to

1752
01:29:44,022 --> 01:29:47,108
come from controllability. That would be

1753
01:29:47,114 --> 01:29:48,020
my argument.

1754
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:54,804
There's a lot there. So a few

1755
01:29:55,002 --> 01:29:58,616
directions first to our colleagues in

1756
01:29:58,638 --> 01:30:02,632
reinforcement learning. RL, the paper is

1757
01:30:02,686 --> 01:30:06,132
provocative in that it includes reward

1758
01:30:06,196 --> 01:30:10,232
is not necessary. So is reward

1759
01:30:10,296 --> 01:30:14,460
sufficient and or what is necessary

1760
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,190
for what?

1761
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,800
Yeah, it's a good question. Is reward

1762
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:22,780
sufficient?

1763
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:30,144
I would argue this I

1764
01:30:30,182 --> 01:30:33,948
think that the reward enough hypothesis,

1765
01:30:34,124 --> 01:30:36,720
which just to remind some of the viewers

1766
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,704
is the hypothesis that reward

1767
01:30:38,752 --> 01:30:42,324
maximization can account for all

1768
01:30:42,522 --> 01:30:45,856
sort of artificial and sort of natural

1769
01:30:45,968 --> 01:30:48,136
intelligence. That all of the sort of

1770
01:30:48,158 --> 01:30:49,976
features of intelligence, the sort of

1771
01:30:49,998 --> 01:30:53,204
capabilities, the structure,

1772
01:30:53,252 --> 01:30:56,260
learning and stuff can all sort of arise

1773
01:30:56,340 --> 01:31:00,700
out of some need to some process

1774
01:31:00,770 --> 01:31:04,572
of maximizing reward. And from my

1775
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:06,600
standpoint that's a frustrating

1776
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:10,460
statement because one, it doesn't

1777
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:17,440
one it doesn't really address where

1778
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:19,884
your preferences for specific reward

1779
01:31:19,932 --> 01:31:22,752
functions come from. And in the paper

1780
01:31:22,886 --> 01:31:25,556
they will say well, we acknowledge that

1781
01:31:25,578 --> 01:31:28,804
there could be multiple sources of

1782
01:31:28,842 --> 01:31:32,420
reward but the process

1783
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:35,636
of deciding on what reward you should

1784
01:31:35,658 --> 01:31:39,370
attend to or care about that I think

1785
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:42,744
deciding what signals you should care

1786
01:31:42,782 --> 01:31:45,016
about is an important part of

1787
01:31:45,038 --> 01:31:47,450
intelligence itself and I think that

1788
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:50,428
reward is enough. Hypothesis as a

1789
01:31:50,434 --> 01:31:52,392
hypothesis is sort of under constrained

1790
01:31:52,456 --> 01:31:56,252
in that whatever that mechanism is to

1791
01:31:56,306 --> 01:31:58,636
that perspective it's going to be

1792
01:31:58,658 --> 01:32:02,340
maximizing reward under their paradigm.

1793
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:06,208
And so therefore whatever

1794
01:32:06,294 --> 01:32:10,256
shapes what that mechanism is that an

1795
01:32:10,278 --> 01:32:12,080
agent should attend to this or an agent

1796
01:32:12,150 --> 01:32:14,144
should stop attending to the things

1797
01:32:14,182 --> 01:32:16,564
that's always cared about and attend to

1798
01:32:16,602 --> 01:32:17,780
some new signal.

1799
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:24,150
I think that that forces you to sort of

1800
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:28,280
take the position that maybe there's,

1801
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:31,912
like, a meta reward that directs this

1802
01:32:31,966 --> 01:32:34,292
process because all sort of attendant

1803
01:32:34,356 --> 01:32:38,264
processes of intelligent systems sort of

1804
01:32:38,462 --> 01:32:40,296
underlie the process of reward.

1805
01:32:40,328 --> 01:32:46,316
Maximization and also the

1806
01:32:46,338 --> 01:32:50,204
reward is enough. Hypothesis is

1807
01:32:50,242 --> 01:32:53,504
not being specific about it

1808
01:32:53,542 --> 01:32:56,496
doesn't tell you what necessarily to

1809
01:32:56,518 --> 01:32:58,816
compute. It just says that if you try to

1810
01:32:58,838 --> 01:33:00,080
maximize reward,

1811
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,290
you will compute the right

1812
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:08,188
representations. And so I think that

1813
01:33:08,214 --> 01:33:09,984
there's just a lot of nuts and bolts

1814
01:33:10,032 --> 01:33:13,060
about what it takes to be able to reason

1815
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:16,048
in a flexible human way. And what I'm

1816
01:33:16,064 --> 01:33:17,792
proposing here with the operator Bellman

1817
01:33:17,856 --> 01:33:19,456
equations is to say hey, look, there's

1818
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:21,912
these reward free Bellman equations that

1819
01:33:21,966 --> 01:33:24,616
help you deal with the complexity of the

1820
01:33:24,638 --> 01:33:27,320
world, there's no reward in them. And

1821
01:33:27,390 --> 01:33:29,096
you could make the case, well, maybe you

1822
01:33:29,118 --> 01:33:30,584
could just use these operator Bellman

1823
01:33:30,632 --> 01:33:32,844
equations to occupy states that are

1824
01:33:32,882 --> 01:33:36,750
rewarding. But I would argue that since

1825
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:40,044
the effective product space that we all

1826
01:33:40,082 --> 01:33:42,956
live in is so vast and we reason about

1827
01:33:42,978 --> 01:33:45,712
it in such a flexible way, I very much

1828
01:33:45,766 --> 01:33:49,052
doubt that RL will rise to the challenge

1829
01:33:49,116 --> 01:33:52,064
of being able to justify motivations in

1830
01:33:52,102 --> 01:33:54,956
real time in a way that humans can. And

1831
01:33:54,998 --> 01:33:58,084
so to get to the question of is it

1832
01:33:58,122 --> 01:34:01,684
sufficient, my hunch is no,

1833
01:34:01,882 --> 01:34:05,124
I don't have a proof of reward is not

1834
01:34:05,162 --> 01:34:08,680
sufficient. But I also

1835
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:11,204
think that the information that a reward

1836
01:34:11,252 --> 01:34:14,504
function is supposed to carry about what

1837
01:34:14,542 --> 01:34:18,584
is good. I don't think that is

1838
01:34:18,622 --> 01:34:21,736
noble or computable on the timescales

1839
01:34:21,768 --> 01:34:25,324
that we understand human intelligence to

1840
01:34:25,362 --> 01:34:28,828
work at, to work on. And so,

1841
01:34:28,994 --> 01:34:30,844
yeah, in order to answer your question

1842
01:34:30,882 --> 01:34:33,250
about what is necessary, I don't know

1843
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:38,752
what is necessary, but I would just

1844
01:34:38,806 --> 01:34:41,872
sort of make the point I already made of

1845
01:34:41,926 --> 01:34:45,572
that. I think that we have to get to

1846
01:34:45,626 --> 01:34:48,048
a point in which we sort of acknowledge

1847
01:34:48,224 --> 01:34:50,836
the problems of product spaces and sort

1848
01:34:50,858 --> 01:34:54,212
of reasoning dialectically in a product

1849
01:34:54,266 --> 01:34:56,704
space that we can't explicitly

1850
01:34:56,752 --> 01:35:01,816
represent. And so I

1851
01:35:01,838 --> 01:35:04,776
don't know what is necessary, but I can

1852
01:35:04,798 --> 01:35:07,000
say that it's not necessary for simple

1853
01:35:07,150 --> 01:35:09,368
self preserving agents. And that's the

1854
01:35:09,374 --> 01:35:13,070
claim of the paper. Awesome.

1855
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,300
All right. In our closing segments,

1856
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:22,436
I'd like to take a journey to philosophy

1857
01:35:22,488 --> 01:35:24,160
and then connect this back to

1858
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:28,160
potentially relationships between

1859
01:35:28,230 --> 01:35:29,984
the models that you've presented here

1860
01:35:30,022 --> 01:35:34,384
and active inference and maybe even walk

1861
01:35:34,582 --> 01:35:36,560
to the edge of that cliff of the hybrid

1862
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:40,800
model. So Aristotle proposed

1863
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:44,644
four causes material cause,

1864
01:35:44,762 --> 01:35:47,024
what something is made of the efficient

1865
01:35:47,072 --> 01:35:49,770
cause, which is the source of change.

1866
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:53,016
The formal cause is the essence, and the

1867
01:35:53,038 --> 01:35:55,892
final cause is the teleology,

1868
01:35:56,036 --> 01:35:58,970
the end goal of the object.

1869
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:03,900
And your presentations TeLEOS

1870
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:08,172
was Deacon's analysis of these

1871
01:36:08,226 --> 01:36:11,020
different forms of teleology.

1872
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:15,404
And indeed, within the model proposed

1873
01:36:15,532 --> 01:36:18,672
empowerment was that type of

1874
01:36:18,726 --> 01:36:21,360
self referential teleology.

1875
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:27,840
When juxtaposing with active inference,

1876
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,724
and specifically the expected free

1877
01:36:30,762 --> 01:36:33,556
energy functional, which has a lot of

1878
01:36:33,578 --> 01:36:36,004
analogies with an operator, it's a

1879
01:36:36,042 --> 01:36:37,816
function of other functions. The

1880
01:36:37,838 --> 01:36:40,490
expected free energy functional is

1881
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:43,976
predicated around helping the agent

1882
01:36:44,078 --> 01:36:47,240
select policies that over

1883
01:36:47,310 --> 01:36:49,144
expected futures, reduce their

1884
01:36:49,182 --> 01:36:51,676
uncertainty the most about which

1885
01:36:51,858 --> 01:36:54,924
sensations they receive. And that's what

1886
01:36:55,042 --> 01:36:57,132
ties active inference closely with

1887
01:36:57,186 --> 01:37:00,492
perceptual control theory that that

1888
01:37:00,546 --> 01:37:04,284
expected free energy is ultimately

1889
01:37:04,412 --> 01:37:06,720
looking at a divergence between

1890
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:09,360
preferences over observations and

1891
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:12,128
incoming observations. So that's kind of

1892
01:37:12,134 --> 01:37:15,588
the sense side of the coin. It's like,

1893
01:37:15,674 --> 01:37:18,710
I want to stay in the game to be able to

1894
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:22,180
align observations with my preferences.

1895
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:27,088
And I'm wondering if empowerment

1896
01:37:27,184 --> 01:37:30,920
is the action side of the game. I agree.

1897
01:37:30,990 --> 01:37:34,200
Saying you'll be involved with,

1898
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:36,456
yes, repeatedly sensing yourself to not

1899
01:37:36,478 --> 01:37:38,484
be starving, not be dying of thirst,

1900
01:37:38,532 --> 01:37:40,604
not be dying of cold. You'll be in your

1901
01:37:40,642 --> 01:37:44,348
preference vector by way

1902
01:37:44,434 --> 01:37:47,790
of this single value,

1903
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,448
which is the empowerment. Whereas active

1904
01:37:51,464 --> 01:37:53,244
inference kind of comes from the other

1905
01:37:53,282 --> 01:37:55,904
side saying, you're going to end up

1906
01:37:55,942 --> 01:37:57,600
having a lot of squares to move around

1907
01:37:57,670 --> 01:38:00,576
in, but first you need to make sure that

1908
01:38:00,598 --> 01:38:02,864
you're reducing divergence between your

1909
01:38:02,902 --> 01:38:04,508
preferences and your expected

1910
01:38:04,604 --> 01:38:07,760
observations. Mmhmm.

1911
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,348
What do you think about that map? Or

1912
01:38:13,434 --> 01:38:17,180
where would that take these intertwined

1913
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:20,696
models? Well, I think that

1914
01:38:20,798 --> 01:38:23,460
there could be, like, an interface

1915
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:26,120
between the two concepts. If we consider

1916
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:28,392
that models of how things work, like

1917
01:38:28,446 --> 01:38:30,830
composed models of how things work,

1918
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:34,904
could induce particular generative

1919
01:38:34,952 --> 01:38:38,556
models that you would want to use in

1920
01:38:38,578 --> 01:38:40,876
a sort of active inference setting. And

1921
01:38:40,898 --> 01:38:43,516
that would be the sort of dual nature

1922
01:38:43,628 --> 01:38:47,004
between the two that there's a cross

1923
01:38:47,052 --> 01:38:50,816
talk between the proposal of

1924
01:38:50,838 --> 01:38:52,336
some kind of generative model that would

1925
01:38:52,358 --> 01:38:57,364
be conducive to the agent. And if

1926
01:38:57,402 --> 01:38:59,764
it is, then it could be a good state

1927
01:38:59,802 --> 01:39:02,150
encoding which feeds back in on

1928
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:05,284
controllability or empowerment and

1929
01:39:05,322 --> 01:39:07,848
things like this. So, I mean, there's a

1930
01:39:07,854 --> 01:39:10,040
lot to think about on this topic,

1931
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:13,896
but I guess I would just put it that

1932
01:39:13,918 --> 01:39:17,496
way, that we still need

1933
01:39:17,518 --> 01:39:21,070
to justify where

1934
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:26,044
generative models come from in new

1935
01:39:26,082 --> 01:39:28,076
situations, for new theories of how

1936
01:39:28,098 --> 01:39:30,636
things work and things like that. And

1937
01:39:30,738 --> 01:39:33,104
there could be a dual process in which

1938
01:39:33,302 --> 01:39:35,452
the action side, the internal

1939
01:39:35,516 --> 01:39:39,984
controllability side is dictating what

1940
01:39:40,022 --> 01:39:42,256
kinds of generative models that should

1941
01:39:42,278 --> 01:39:43,280
be considered.

1942
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:49,510
Very interesting.

1943
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:53,728
And the reason I brought up Aristotle's

1944
01:39:53,824 --> 01:39:57,440
causes was because active inference as

1945
01:39:57,530 --> 01:40:01,444
a process theory seems to be describing

1946
01:40:01,492 --> 01:40:04,760
that efficient cause. It's just

1947
01:40:04,910 --> 01:40:07,144
especially with a variational free

1948
01:40:07,182 --> 01:40:10,652
energy, which is kind of the real time

1949
01:40:10,786 --> 01:40:12,876
version of the expected free energy.

1950
01:40:13,058 --> 01:40:17,592
It's like one step at a time ball

1951
01:40:17,656 --> 01:40:20,376
going downhill. And so variational

1952
01:40:20,408 --> 01:40:23,516
inference is enabling incremental,

1953
01:40:23,708 --> 01:40:27,356
unfolding optimization, again oriented

1954
01:40:27,388 --> 01:40:30,060
around reducing that sensory preference

1955
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:31,440
and outcome.

1956
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:37,520
It does everything but specify

1957
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:41,604
a final cause. In a sense, one might

1958
01:40:41,642 --> 01:40:43,300
say that there's a local final cause

1959
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:44,944
within the active inference generative

1960
01:40:44,992 --> 01:40:47,408
model, which is like to reduce the

1961
01:40:47,434 --> 01:40:49,176
divergence between the preferences and

1962
01:40:49,198 --> 01:40:52,692
the observations. But the generative

1963
01:40:52,756 --> 01:40:57,304
model also from

1964
01:40:57,342 --> 01:40:59,812
the action selection side, which is what

1965
01:40:59,886 --> 01:41:02,552
makes active inference active inference.

1966
01:41:02,696 --> 01:41:08,860
It also needs a final cause in

1967
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:13,156
that self referential teleodynamic

1968
01:41:13,208 --> 01:41:15,872
way. And so there could be some very

1969
01:41:15,926 --> 01:41:19,650
interesting architectures where

1970
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:23,010
active inference picks up,

1971
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:27,136
where empowerment leads,

1972
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:31,408
like through a needle, because it's

1973
01:41:31,584 --> 01:41:33,972
such a small representation with

1974
01:41:34,026 --> 01:41:36,884
valence. And then one other kind of

1975
01:41:36,922 --> 01:41:39,560
connection or maybe mapping between them

1976
01:41:39,710 --> 01:41:43,720
is we've seen models of valence in

1977
01:41:43,790 --> 01:41:47,460
active inference, such as the affective

1978
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:51,416
inference work, where valence

1979
01:41:51,608 --> 01:41:54,972
was associated broadly with whether

1980
01:41:55,026 --> 01:41:57,532
things are going better or worse than

1981
01:41:57,586 --> 01:42:01,000
expected. In terms of statistical

1982
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,456
uncertainty, if you're reducing your

1983
01:42:03,478 --> 01:42:05,340
uncertainty more than you expected,

1984
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:07,116
things are going better than expected

1985
01:42:07,228 --> 01:42:09,120
and vice versa.

1986
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:16,020
So that is a very variance

1987
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:20,704
oriented valence

1988
01:42:20,832 --> 01:42:25,140
concept where broader

1989
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:28,410
uncertainties are associated with

1990
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:31,684
inferior valence and tighter

1991
01:42:31,732 --> 01:42:33,384
uncertainties are associated with

1992
01:42:33,422 --> 01:42:35,144
positive valence. And it's just

1993
01:42:35,182 --> 01:42:36,584
interesting that that's kind of like an

1994
01:42:36,622 --> 01:42:40,604
orthogonal valence concept from how

1995
01:42:40,642 --> 01:42:43,196
much you can actually do that's the

1996
01:42:43,218 --> 01:42:45,788
actionable valence. Would you rather

1997
01:42:45,874 --> 01:42:49,404
have a high precision around not

1998
01:42:49,442 --> 01:42:53,104
being able to do anything, or high

1999
01:42:53,142 --> 01:42:56,416
uncertainty about being able to do a

2000
01:42:56,438 --> 01:42:59,090
lot or a huge amount?

2001
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:01,536
And so it almost seems like when we

2002
01:43:01,558 --> 01:43:05,412
contrast those two, the direction that

2003
01:43:05,546 --> 01:43:08,996
dominates is, in the

2004
01:43:09,018 --> 01:43:12,196
final analysis, the ability to have

2005
01:43:12,298 --> 01:43:15,092
empowerment, not necessarily to just

2006
01:43:15,146 --> 01:43:16,932
have tight control over your

2007
01:43:16,986 --> 01:43:17,940
observations.

2008
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:23,464
Yeah, I agree.

2009
01:43:23,662 --> 01:43:26,564
Lots of interesting avenues for hybrid

2010
01:43:26,612 --> 01:43:27,320
theories.

2011
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:36,924
Well, what a very interesting talk.

2012
01:43:37,042 --> 01:43:39,628
I guess one more question on the model

2013
01:43:39,714 --> 01:43:42,604
and then we'll close, which is the time

2014
01:43:42,642 --> 01:43:46,748
horizon is it an infinite time horizon,

2015
01:43:46,924 --> 01:43:50,284
or what is the treatment

2016
01:43:50,332 --> 01:43:53,056
of time? And can time be continuous, or

2017
01:43:53,078 --> 01:43:54,736
is time always discrete, and is it

2018
01:43:54,758 --> 01:43:56,240
finite or infinite?

2019
01:43:58,340 --> 01:44:00,804
A so the operator Bellman equations are

2020
01:44:00,842 --> 01:44:04,276
formalized as a finite horizon. I

2021
01:44:04,298 --> 01:44:06,036
suppose they could be extended to

2022
01:44:06,058 --> 01:44:10,184
infinite horizon and infinite or

2023
01:44:10,222 --> 01:44:12,084
continuous time. I suppose that's

2024
01:44:12,132 --> 01:44:15,252
possible too. But as they're formalized

2025
01:44:15,316 --> 01:44:18,520
now, it's discrete state, discrete time,

2026
01:44:18,670 --> 01:44:20,120
finite horizon.

2027
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:25,272
But yeah, I think that there's

2028
01:44:25,336 --> 01:44:28,350
alternative forms that could be made.

2029
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:34,568
Was there another question too, in it?

2030
01:44:34,754 --> 01:44:35,650
Can't remember.

2031
01:44:38,590 --> 01:44:41,846
Let us close with your time horizon.

2032
01:44:42,038 --> 01:44:45,020
What are your next steps with the

2033
01:44:45,470 --> 01:44:49,434
research, and how would you imagine an

2034
01:44:49,472 --> 01:44:52,780
ecosystem of continuation of the work?

2035
01:44:54,110 --> 01:44:56,234
Yeah, I'm interested in getting this

2036
01:44:56,272 --> 01:45:00,250
work into computational neuroscience

2037
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:04,418
problem, because there's a lot of,

2038
01:45:04,504 --> 01:45:06,706
I think, alternative models that need to

2039
01:45:06,728 --> 01:45:09,186
be considered, especially given some of

2040
01:45:09,208 --> 01:45:11,122
the themes that I've touched on in terms

2041
01:45:11,176 --> 01:45:14,022
of justifying what to do in a product

2042
01:45:14,076 --> 01:45:17,142
space, how do you represent control

2043
01:45:17,276 --> 01:45:19,670
in a distributed system, et cetera.

2044
01:45:21,130 --> 01:45:23,574
And so I think that there's a lot to do

2045
01:45:23,612 --> 01:45:25,846
there in computational neuroscience. On

2046
01:45:25,868 --> 01:45:28,506
the AI side, I want to put this in a

2047
01:45:28,528 --> 01:45:31,980
world model. I want to

2048
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:37,046
get good auto encoders,

2049
01:45:37,158 --> 01:45:38,922
kind of like how I had on the first

2050
01:45:38,976 --> 01:45:41,310
slide, where you have a high dimensional

2051
01:45:41,890 --> 01:45:43,866
agent in a high dimensional multimodal

2052
01:45:43,898 --> 01:45:46,714
world, how do you have nice world models

2053
01:45:46,762 --> 01:45:49,374
and put this in something like that?

2054
01:45:49,412 --> 01:45:52,766
So that's the AI future direction, and

2055
01:45:52,788 --> 01:45:56,098
I'd like to do both of them. So I have a

2056
01:45:56,104 --> 01:45:59,442
lot of work to do. Awesome. Well,

2057
01:45:59,496 --> 01:46:01,986
in closing, I'm just going to read some

2058
01:46:02,008 --> 01:46:04,886
of the more statement like comments from

2059
01:46:04,908 --> 01:46:06,306
the live chat, just so that they're

2060
01:46:06,338 --> 01:46:08,034
included in the Active inference

2061
01:46:08,082 --> 01:46:11,686
journal. So Dave Douglas wrote with

2062
01:46:11,708 --> 01:46:13,618
regards to Deacon's consequence,

2063
01:46:13,714 --> 01:46:16,394
galileo may have gotten in trouble less

2064
01:46:16,432 --> 01:46:18,134
from insisting on a heliocentric

2065
01:46:18,182 --> 01:46:19,754
universe than from insisting that

2066
01:46:19,792 --> 01:46:22,886
purpose, value, and meaning be banished

2067
01:46:22,918 --> 01:46:25,702
from science as connecting explanatory

2068
01:46:25,766 --> 01:46:28,770
principles. The Galileo tolerated

2069
01:46:28,870 --> 01:46:30,666
remaining connecting principle,

2070
01:46:30,778 --> 01:46:33,166
causation may have reached the limits of

2071
01:46:33,188 --> 01:46:36,190
its explanatory power sometime between

2072
01:46:36,260 --> 01:46:39,662
Newton's and Fourier's day, where all

2073
01:46:39,716 --> 01:46:41,710
respectable principles of explanation

2074
01:46:41,790 --> 01:46:44,146
must ultimately rest on invocation of

2075
01:46:44,168 --> 01:46:47,758
either rigid rods or on elastic bands.

2076
01:46:47,934 --> 01:46:51,678
The Galilean program of Sola Casa

2077
01:46:51,854 --> 01:46:54,090
attained its absurdity in Carnap's

2078
01:46:54,110 --> 01:46:55,846
insistence that meaning, value,

2079
01:46:55,948 --> 01:46:58,934
counterfactuals must be judged as

2080
01:46:58,972 --> 01:47:02,150
strictly and literally as meaningless.

2081
01:47:02,810 --> 01:47:04,966
Have we passed the point when the

2082
01:47:04,988 --> 01:47:07,686
Galilean program must be simply

2083
01:47:07,718 --> 01:47:09,562
abandoned, and meaning, value, and

2084
01:47:09,616 --> 01:47:12,314
purpose must be restored to science as

2085
01:47:12,352 --> 01:47:14,662
irreducible explanatory principles?

2086
01:47:14,726 --> 01:47:17,578
Alongside Causation, I find the

2087
01:47:17,584 --> 01:47:20,806
mysticisms of both Bohm and Heisenberg's

2088
01:47:20,838 --> 01:47:23,582
quantum completeness and of Powelly and

2089
01:47:23,636 --> 01:47:26,622
Jung's synchronicity to just be too

2090
01:47:26,676 --> 01:47:30,046
fluffy to be very useful. In a word, it

2091
01:47:30,068 --> 01:47:32,514
has become a tradition of science as

2092
01:47:32,552 --> 01:47:35,186
funded to insist that Causation, and

2093
01:47:35,208 --> 01:47:37,554
Causation alone, must found our

2094
01:47:37,592 --> 01:47:40,386
enterprise. This is a tradition of men,

2095
01:47:40,568 --> 01:47:42,606
not a feature of ultimate reality.

2096
01:47:42,718 --> 01:47:45,254
Meaning and value also have their place

2097
01:47:45,372 --> 01:47:47,080
not reducible to cause.

2098
01:47:51,370 --> 01:47:54,982
I like it. Yeah. Excellent. Well,

2099
01:47:55,116 --> 01:47:57,202
Thomas, thank you again for joining.

2100
01:47:57,266 --> 01:47:59,546
You're always welcome back and really

2101
01:47:59,568 --> 01:48:01,354
looking forward to seeing how this all

2102
01:48:01,472 --> 01:48:04,634
continues. Me too. And thanks

2103
01:48:04,672 --> 01:48:05,866
again for having me. I've been very

2104
01:48:05,888 --> 01:48:07,786
impressed with how much work you do for

2105
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:11,260
the discord, and it's a great community.

2106
01:48:11,710 --> 01:48:14,550
Everyone's very nice and enthusiastic,

2107
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:16,746
so I was excited to see it. I just sort

2108
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:20,406
of randomly stumbled across it. So I'm

2109
01:48:20,438 --> 01:48:22,990
glad I introduced myself to the discord.

2110
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:25,682
So thank you. Excellent. All right,

2111
01:48:25,736 --> 01:48:28,834
till next time. Thank you. Great. Thank

2112
01:48:28,872 --> 01:48:29,460
you.
