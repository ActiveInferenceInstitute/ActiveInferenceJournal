00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,880
hello everyone

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,679
welcome to the active inference lab and

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,280
to the model stream

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,440
2.0 today is going to be a really

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,279
awesome discussion so let's just

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,359
introduce ourselves and get right into

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,199
it i'm daniel friedman i'm a

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,560
postdoctoral researcher

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,000
in davis california ryan

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,560
um yep so i'm ryan smith i'm an

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,000
associate investigator at

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,920
the uh laureate institute for brain

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,399
research

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,920
hi i'm christopher i'm a phd student at

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,719
the university of cambridge

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,200
and i'm max murphy and i'll be starting

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,039
my post-doctoral fellowship at carnegie

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:45,520
mellon

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,960
in hopefully a week awesome thanks to

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,280
ryan and christopher the authors uh or

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,879
two of the three authors of this paper

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,199
for joining today and for max for

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,360
lending your expertise as well

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,320
so this is the second model stream in a

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,840
multi-part series

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,039
that is going to be highlighting

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,280
perspectives and addressing questions

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,840
related to applied active inference and

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,680
so right now we're looking at the

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,040
tutorial paper of

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,680
smith at all a step-by-step tutorial on

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,640
active inference

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,799
and its application to empirical data

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,680
the link

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,000
uh you can find in the video description

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,680
so if you have any questions or

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,520
thoughts or comments during the live

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,920
stream type it in the youtube live chat

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,680
and we'll be monitoring that

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,360
and then if you have any questions after

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
the live stream leave a comment on the

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,200
video or get in touch with us another

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,520
way

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,439
and we'll try to address it in a future

45
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,520
session and if you want to learn more or

46
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,880
if you want to participate

47
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,479
go to activeinference.org all right

48
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,640
so today in our second session we're

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,600
going to be picking up

50
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,920
with a brief overview and summary of

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,600
where we're at where we've been

52
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,880
we're going to go through a few

53
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
clarifying questions that have been

54
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,119
raised in the last week and then we're

55
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,840
going to dive into the specific examples

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,079
and

57
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,240
into the code and do some code walk

58
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,320
through so that will be really exciting

59
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,479
all right so i'll just throw out the

60
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,799
first opening question which is

61
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,520
who is this session for what kinds of

62
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,080
tools

63
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,640
and skills would you say are required

64
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,400
and which kinds of tools or skills might

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,800
be

66
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,200
helpful

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,360
um okay well um

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,120
i mean i would say that the session and

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,280
i mean really the entire tutorial is for

70
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,560
people who

71
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,480
um are just kind of i mean mainly people

72
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,319
who are just starting out people who

73
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,160
want to be able who are interested in

74
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,599
active inference

75
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,080
um but maybe don't have a lot of

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,599
background in mathematics you know

77
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,879
especially like people coming from like

78
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,400
neuroscience and psychology backgrounds

79
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,840
for example that

80
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,720
want to or people who do some

81
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,920
computational modeling

82
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,680
but like maybe like simpler

83
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,040
reinforcement learning models things

84
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,400
like that

85
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,319
where active inference is kind of

86
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,760
notoriously a little bit more

87
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,519
kind of like black box you know it's

88
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,280
harder to kind of break into

89
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,440
um a lot of people think that the models

90
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,640
are described in a way that's kind of

91
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,000
like opaque

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,800
um you know and so the the idea was to

93
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,920
give people

94
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,640
the background needed um and the actual

95
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,519
example

96
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,519
code um that would be needed that could

97
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,120
be adapted to

98
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,640
build your own models do your own

99
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,280
simulation studies and apply

100
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,280
and build models of task studies and be

101
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,440
able to fit models to data

102
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,200
in other words to kind of start to

103
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
finish to be able for a person who wants

104
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,519
to to be able to

105
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,000
use active inference models to model

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,599
data in empirical studies and actually

107
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,440
use them in their own research

108
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,480
so as far as tools necessary um you know

109
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,440
the main thing

110
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,840
right now is going to be having some

111
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,599
minimal understanding or

112
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,040
motivation to learn how to use matlab

113
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,920
you know so you know we in the um

114
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,680
tutorial code so i mean we have

115
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,680
like seven or eight different you know

116
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,599
tutorial scripts you know this point but

117
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,799
the main one

118
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,640
is um the one that i'll be focusing on

119
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,799
today and it's very heavily commented

120
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,640
um so it kind of best we did try to

121
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,400
describe kind of like line by line each

122
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,680
thing that's going on i mean it's

123
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,400
honestly

124
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,519
there's enough comments and there'd

125
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,280
almost be kind of like a second paper in

126
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,400
and of itself

127
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,680
um so um you know we're hoping

128
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,080
um that even someone who doesn't have a

129
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,079
ton of background in matlab will be able

130
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,720
to kind of

131
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,839
bootstrap their way up um but

132
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,320
you definitely need to have a little bit

133
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,919
or be motivated to learn at least a

134
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,520
little bit

135
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,040
anything else to add on that christopher

136
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,280
or max

137
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,360
no i think that sums it up well just one

138
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,600
note on the code there so you mentioned

139
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,400
it's in matlab now what about other

140
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,240
programming languages or backgrounds

141
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,639
like

142
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,560
python so what other languages are

143
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,240
people in the active inference space

144
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,199
developing in

145
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,680
and how could we include more computer

146
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,960
languages as well as

147
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,840
natural human languages so i mean

148
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,120
there are so at present everything is

149
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,280
almost exclusively in matlab

150
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,320
unfortunately

151
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,919
and the reason for that is is that a lot

152
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,639
of this is actually built off of

153
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,199
spm scripts you know that carl fristen

154
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,400
originally wrote

155
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,199
in relation to uh neural imaging

156
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,560
approaches so things like

157
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,560
dynamic puzzle modeling and so

158
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,120
a lot of a lot of the current scripts

159
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,280
for doing active inference

160
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,320
call on a broad range of other spm

161
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,440
scripts that are used for a lot of

162
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,639
different purposes

163
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,680
for instance in sort of

164
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,000
dealing with large matrices in like

165
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,919
neuroimaging

166
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,840
so that so for that reason

167
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,440
and because carl is primarily worked in

168
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
matlab and relation spm

169
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,759
everything has kind of been in spm and

170
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,199
specifically in what's called the

171
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,400
dem toolbox in spm12

172
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
stands for dynamic expectation

173
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,840
maximization

174
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,360
there's a ton of active inference

175
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,560
scripts as well as a ton of other

176
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,400
modeling scripts for say like continuous

177
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
models and other sorts of things

178
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,600
in there and we just make use of

179
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,720
a couple of those um the main ones not

180
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,160
the ones they call on but

181
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,600
um but uh that being said

182
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,080
there are people who are trying at the

183
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,720
moment

184
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,039
to um translate some of the stuff into

185
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,919
python

186
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,199
uh alec schatz for example um

187
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,199
is currently in the process of trying to

188
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,880
put together uh

189
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,000
python versions of some of the main

190
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,280
simulation and inversion scripts um

191
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,520
i don't i mean they're very kind of in

192
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,199
beta at the moment as i understand them

193
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,639
but i know i know that that's something

194
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,479
that's in progress

195
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,800
cool so it sounds like because this

196
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
project has such a history

197
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,039
of being developed in matlab and the spm

198
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,720
toolkit and carl fristan's

199
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,199
research and collaborations were um

200
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,840
drawing heavily on matlab

201
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,199
however in the modern development

202
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,000
context

203
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,520
there's a lot of open source projects

204
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,360
that are developing in python

205
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,960
so that's definitely an area we'll hope

206
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,560
to be expanding and also a great

207
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,360
opportunity

208
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,840
for people who are experienced in python

209
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,919
or matlab and want to be curious about

210
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:02,880
active inference

211
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,599
this is the opening to help contribute

212
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,639
to something that could be really

213
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,360
exciting

214
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,400
so just a last um last uh

215
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,199
warm-up introduction question what kinds

216
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,319
of projects

217
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,039
or questions or investigations do you

218
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:17,440
think

219
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,919
this could apply to for somebody who

220
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,599
they've heard of scientific modeling but

221
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,199
not active inference modeling

222
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,039
what do you think are some low-hanging

223
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,880
fruit or really straightforward

224
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,560
interpretations where you think it could

225
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,400
be applied

226
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,840
so i mean i guess there's a couple

227
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,599
questions here i mean one is

228
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,840
um you know like well i guess the main

229
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,960
one is

230
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
given that the kind of history of

231
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,919
computational modeling has um

232
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,960
largely um than in the um like

233
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,400
reinforcement learning

234
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,160
i mean a sort of literature or i mean

235
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,520
there are others like drift of fusion

236
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,199
modeling and things like that but

237
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,800
um um the you know one of the kind of

238
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,720
major questions is oh well active

239
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,000
inference models seem

240
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
like they're really complicated you know

241
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,680
relative to some of these

242
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,599
simpler uh sort of traditional

243
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,199
reinforcement learning models

244
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,800
um so what is it that active inference

245
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,479
actually adds right

246
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,400
like what can you do using an active

247
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,560
inference model in a study

248
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,840
that um you maybe couldn't do or

249
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,879
could do as naturally using standard

250
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,319
sorts of existing reinforcement learning

251
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,360
models

252
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,479
and you know here the the kind of answer

253
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,160
that i would want to give is there's a

254
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,520
few parts to this

255
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,560
one is that um because

256
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,000
the kind of value or cost function in

257
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,279
active inference is expected for energy

258
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,320
as opposed to a reward function

259
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,440
and because the expected free energy has

260
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,399
a reward a reward component and an

261
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,080
information

262
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,640
value component then it's it's quite a

263
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,680
bit more natural

264
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,720
in active inference models to

265
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,880
model explore exploit tasks you know so

266
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,000
tasks where

267
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,760
the agent has to somehow intrinsically

268
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,040
assign value to seeking information

269
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,200
as a means of knowing how to maximize

270
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,519
reward eventually

271
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,440
so there are and there are actually two

272
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,560
different types

273
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,040
of um sort of directed or goal driven

274
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,680
explanation

275
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,240
or exploration in active inference one

276
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,760
is um

277
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,399
which is called parameter exploration

278
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,000
and the idea here is this is probably

279
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,959
the closest thing to um reinforcement

280
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,640
learning where say the agent might not

281
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,240
start out knowing what the reward

282
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,360
probabilities are

283
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,600
if they choose one action versus another

284
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,839
so they will choose actions

285
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,760
that will help them essentially learn

286
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,560
best what the reward probabilities are

287
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,000
before you know just reliably you're

288
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,480
continuously selecting the same option

289
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,600
right because that's the kind of know

290
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,800
which one's the most rewarding

291
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,279
first so that's called parameter

292
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,240
exploration

293
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,920
and that that like i said has analogs

294
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,560
in reinforcement learning but doesn't

295
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,519
have like a

296
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,920
specific in in standard models anyway it

297
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,360
doesn't have a very specific

298
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,880
sort of information drive um

299
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,040
to uh to seek that out um but there are

300
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,800
some so things like information bonus

301
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,519
terms uh

302
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,480
there's different things like that in

303
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,600
reinforcement learning that can do

304
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,720
something like that

305
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,399
um but they're kind of tacked on their

306
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,680
little little they have a little more

307
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,120
kind of like ad hoc feeling to them i

308
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
guess um

309
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,720
whereas it kind of emerges naturally

310
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,320
from expected free energy in active

311
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,120
inference

312
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,120
um there's also something that's a

313
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,800
little more unique in active inference

314
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,959
which is called state exploration

315
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,040
and that's more where you're just kind

316
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,200
of choosing to move to states

317
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,720
that you expect will give you the most

318
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,480
precise observations

319
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,360
about what state you're in um you know

320
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,880
so this would be the thing like

321
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,000
you don't know whether you're in the

322
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,079
green room or the red room so you should

323
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,760
go turn on a light

324
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,440
so you'll know which which room you're

325
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,800
in um

326
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,120
right so that also falls out of expected

327
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,200
free energy very naturally

328
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,720
but not out of a lot of other

329
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,839
traditional computational modeling

330
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,560
approaches um

331
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,440
the uh there's also sorry i could go out

332
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,880
for a while about this but

333
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
there's also something in reinforcement

334
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,399
learning models that has to do with

335
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,519
explore exploit called random

336
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,880
exploration

337
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,360
where people essentially start behaving

338
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,839
more randomly

339
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,880
if they're uncertain if they know they

340
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,079
have to make a bunch more future choices

341
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,640
but those values are typically fixed in

342
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,480
reinforcement learning models

343
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,120
whereas the uh expected free energy

344
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,839
precision

345
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,600
uh parameter and active inference is

346
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,920
actually a dynamically updated

347
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,200
version of that so it changes to remain

348
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,640
driving essentially the amount of

349
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,320
randomness and behavior that's

350
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,600
um expected given past observations

351
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,720
um and so that's kind of nice um

352
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,880
the last thing i would say is is that

353
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,399
active inference has a very kind of

354
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,000
specific neural process theory

355
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,120
associated with it

356
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,200
so it makes very specific predictions

357
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,360
about the neural responses you ought to

358
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,680
see

359
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,839
in studies whereas most other models

360
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:00,959
don't

361
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,040
so those are that's what i would say

362
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,320
thanks for the answer

363
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,079
any thoughts on that or any of the

364
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,200
questions christopher or max

365
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,519
i would just say very broadly speaking

366
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,800
active inference is really great for

367
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
modeling decision-making under

368
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,200
uncertainty

369
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,320
and in particular perceptual

370
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,079
various types of perceptual decision

371
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,440
making and

372
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,519
indiscreet state spaces so you can do

373
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,800
anything from modeling

374
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
so like ryan and i have some previous

375
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,240
work where we show

376
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
that you can reproduce a whole lot of

377
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
kind of classic

378
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,040
visual awareness neural correlates and

379
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,240
like the classic visual awareness

380
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,120
paradigms

381
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,600
for example using a hierarchical model

382
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,959
and the reason we can do that is because

383
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:45,760
it had

384
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,519
active inference has such a detailed and

385
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,399
rich process theory attached to it

386
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,320
and so for me i think what's really

387
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,839
unique about it is that

388
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,120
so there's lots of different ways of

389
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
providing unified explanations but one

390
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,480
way that you might want to provide a

391
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,079
unifying explanation is just have a

392
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,040
unifying set

393
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,880
of kind of uh com unifying computation

394
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
or one computational architecture where

395
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,399
you can draw in all of these different

396
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:08,800
things

397
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,839
into one paradigm and then understand or

398
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,760
well one computational paradigm that is

399
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,279
then understand how they're related

400
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,399
through the different parameters that

401
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,920
are being modulated when you

402
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,760
or being fit when you build models for

403
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,600
example

404
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
so i'm not aware of any other modeling

405
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,200
paradigm really where you could model

406
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,320
things as diverse

407
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,720
as a basic kind of explore exploit task

408
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,920
or looking at kind of phasic dopamine

409
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,880
dynamics

410
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,320
and then something that goes all the way

411
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
up to something like visual awareness

412
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,600
or even like planning and bellman

413
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,959
optimal planning

414
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,639
so to me that's what's so special about

415
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,160
this if you

416
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,240
if you want to unify things under one

417
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,120
umbrella this is really

418
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,519
um yeah one one last thing i'll say and

419
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,040
this is just kind of a practical

420
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,600
nice thing is this is that the in most

421
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,639
other um

422
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,079
modeling approaches you actually have to

423
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,160
kind of change the equations

424
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,880
you know like to fit it to a specific um

425
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,240
you know task

426
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,600
whereas an active inference technically

427
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,440
you don't all you do

428
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,040
is the the actual update equations are

429
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,560
always identical

430
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,360
all you have to do is write down the

431
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,279
appropriate generative model

432
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,480
um so it's nice because it's really

433
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,519
generic and

434
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,720
and you know once you have the

435
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,079
generative model specified everything

436
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,000
else kind of just comes for free

437
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,639
and just to jump in off of that uh

438
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,000
generalizability the the

439
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,839
reason i'm interested i'm somebody who

440
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,920
studies movement a totally

441
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,160
different area of neuroscience than

442
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,279
decision making

443
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,680
and uncertainty modeling but at the same

444
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,320
time

445
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,399
this framework what kind of interests me

446
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,519
about it is that

447
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,199
exactly that which is that it seems that

448
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,880
i can start out with kind of a structure

449
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,959
generative model that is consistent even

450
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,399
across domains

451
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,880
and then potentially use that to to

452
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,399
apply it to my own neuroscientific

453
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,519
research

454
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,160
um the the main questions that i have

455
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,600
and things that i'll be interested to

456
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,519
hear about moving forward would be

457
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,680
um you know we talked about that we can

458
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,000
use it both for parameter exploration

459
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,959
and state exploration but when we're in

460
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,320
in the empirical context of the

461
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,000
experiments being performed for

462
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,240
um it might be the case that i'm

463
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,399
uncertain about certain parameters

464
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,399
or i'm uncertain about the state and i

465
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,839
may be uncertain about both of those

466
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,360
things simultaneously

467
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,040
so um finding a way to either design my

468
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,680
experiments so that i impose certainty

469
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,639
on either the state or the parameters is

470
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,360
probably

471
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,759
seems to me an important part of using

472
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,839
this model

473
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,440
no no it's a great point actually me and

474
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,360
chris we're just talking about this like

475
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,440
like yesterday or something right like

476
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,000
how to design an optimal task to

477
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,959
disambiguate but include both having to

478
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:47,440
solve

479
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,360
problems that involve state and

480
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,240
parameter exploration simultaneously

481
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,120
technically the example model that we

482
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,880
have for the tutorial

483
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,399
is able to do that um but not

484
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,880
in an incredibly interesting way uh

485
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,800
justin justin kind of way to show that

486
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,839
how you could do it very interesting

487
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,440
about the experimental design because

488
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,360
the kind of statistical techniques like

489
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,240
a t-test

490
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,839
we know the statistical power

491
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,600
calculations or we might know the kinds

492
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,880
of experimental designs

493
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,680
that lead to good clean t-tests but it's

494
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,360
a great point about the experimental

495
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,160
design

496
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,720
and just to highlight this generalizable

497
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,920
and also generative

498
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,160
nature we talked about a lot of

499
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
different areas of research a lot of

500
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,199
different frameworks

501
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,120
but the parts that stood out to me were

502
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,880
christopher you said decision making

503
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,160
under uncertainty

504
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,120
and action and perception that covers a

505
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,720
lot a lot of different areas of

506
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,680
neuroscience

507
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,519
and then we are looking for this kind of

508
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,120
unified explanation

509
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,880
but rather than an explanation which

510
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,199
might be philosophical or based upon how

511
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,040
much we understand it or how we feel

512
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,320
that one day

513
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,720
we're rather going to look for a unified

514
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,680
computational

515
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,079
architecture or a computational paradigm

516
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:58,880
as you said

517
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,360
that will let us compare and design and

518
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,079
develop

519
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,079
these generative and generalizable

520
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,839
models so really

521
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,880
cool discussion and i'm just going to

522
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,559
ask one question from the youtube live

523
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,480
chat then we'll go to ryan with a screen

524
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,760
share

525
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,119
cb asks can active inference research

526
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,199
help us understand the neuroscience of

527
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,199
stimulus independent thoughts when there

528
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,359
isn't any sensory input at all

529
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,039
thanks for elaboration in this regard

530
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,720
i mean i guess i mean the broader answer

531
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,600
would say yes

532
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,400
but um the way that you would do it

533
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,440
would probably be

534
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,200
pretty task specific um you know so

535
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,760
so i'm um i'm not necessarily sure how

536
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,440
to give a really precise detailed answer

537
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,840
without knowing the particular like task

538
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,520
or even just general psychological

539
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,160
context

540
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,720
that's being imagined um so i mean it's

541
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,200
actually

542
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,280
really easy to model for instance like

543
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,960
working memory tasks

544
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,640
where you might get a stimulus at one

545
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,320
point but then there's no stimulus for a

546
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,679
really long time

547
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,440
and somehow the thing has to continue to

548
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
maintain representations

549
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,200
um in the absence of any stimulus to

550
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,039
know what to do you know at some

551
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,160
distant future point um um you know

552
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,200
just there's that kind of thing um i

553
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,880
mean just as one example i

554
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,760
again i like i said it the way to answer

555
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,120
the question is probably is

556
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,720
it would be different depending on the

557
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,640
exact sort of psychological or task

558
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,160
context in question

559
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,240
cool so just like explore exploit there

560
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,559
are tasks that looked more exploratory

561
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,240
or more exploitative

562
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,480
almost within this action of perception

563
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,600
we're going to be talking about some

564
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,480
tasks that

565
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,160
are more towards the action-oriented

566
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,679
side like the policy planning or the

567
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,640
motor behavior

568
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,400
and other tasks that are more towards

569
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,080
almost the perceptive side like this

570
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,360
visual awareness

571
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,679
task now ocular motor movement the

572
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,200
movement of the eye muscles is still a

573
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,919
behavior

574
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,760
and there's papers that model that but

575
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,600
it's almost like we're looking at the

576
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,679
whole spectrum of explore exploit or

577
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,840
action perception reinforcement learning

578
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,520
and wondering how we can

579
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,080
again make this unified framework for

580
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,200
talking about these different kinds of

581
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,679
systems

582
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,600
so shall we jump right in ryan or go

583
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,720
ahead anything else

584
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,559
well i mean unless i mean just just one

585
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,799
last point to bring up in relation to

586
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,360
their you know this person's question is

587
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,400
just that it's actually

588
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,080
what's really important and probably a

589
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,160
more recent development and this is

590
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,919
stuff that um some of the visual

591
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,280
awareness stuff that me and chris have

592
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,080
done and also

593
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,960
um some stuff uh that i've done

594
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,640
previously with like emotional awareness

595
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,080
for example like models of emotional

596
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,640
awareness

597
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,360
um there's there's a really important

598
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,720
sense of what you're doing

599
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,760
not just behavioral actions but actually

600
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,559
cognitive

601
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,440
actions um right so you're selecting

602
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,880
policies that

603
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,960
just do something like in the neural

604
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,400
implementation just do something like

605
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,880
change the the functional connectivity

606
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,160
between two brain regions or or change

607
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,679
in other words it is stimulus

608
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,799
independent uh

609
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,200
action they're actions that that have to

610
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,400
do with changing what you're doing

611
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,600
cognitively and not what you're doing

612
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,640
behaviorally

613
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,799
um you know so that's also an important

614
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,600
uh part of it that's been done in

615
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
you know a few previous papers that um i

616
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,799
think

617
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,799
uh relates an important way to this kind

618
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,240
of stimulus independence sort of

619
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,679
question um but again only if i

620
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,720
understood it right

621
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,600
cool good answer and thanks for that so

622
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,480
go ahead and

623
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,360
share your screen and just however we

624
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,679
can help whatever you want us to do or

625
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,679
not do we're there but i'm really

626
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,360
looking forward to this

627
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,559
okay so the um you know the main

628
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,440
the main thing here that i want to do

629
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,280
just to start as you know and this is in

630
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,440
part just because i'm assuming that not

631
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,840
everyone who's watching today was

632
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,640
watching

633
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,919
uh last week um so i'm not going to be

634
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:42,960
able to give you

635
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,120
a full understanding of where we're sort

636
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,960
of of how we're segueing from last week

637
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,320
to this week but i just want to give

638
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,240
kind of like a really sort of uh rapid

639
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,679
overview of where we're kind of going um

640
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,159
you know so first we covered this slide

641
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:58,720
here

642
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,760
which just um shows an example of how

643
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,799
you can do

644
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,440
um how you can do perception as bayesian

645
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,320
inference

646
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,080
and then and this is just an example a

647
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,400
mathematical example of how it works

648
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,640
um but the idea is where you're you see

649
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,320
this sort of two-dimensional image

650
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,240
and you're this gray thing under great

651
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,919
disc under observation you're trying to

652
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,760
infer

653
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,120
based on prior expectations whether it's

654
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,440
a

655
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,960
three dimensionally it's a concave or

656
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,960
convex shape

657
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,600
and so the idea is is that in simple

658
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,760
problems you can do that exactly by

659
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,559
solving

660
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,280
um bayes theorem so this equation up

661
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,159
here on the upper left

662
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,480
but in most cases that's actually

663
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,240
intractable to do

664
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,600
and so what you do in active inference

665
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,640
is you instead um define this thing

666
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,280
f here which is called expected free

667
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,240
energy

668
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,440
um and it's more or less

669
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,400
a measure of the accuracy of predictions

670
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,039
minus

671
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,240
the accuracy of beliefs and combined

672
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,600
with the complexity

673
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,200
of those beliefs essentially how much

674
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,440
you have to change your beliefs to

675
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,640
to get a model that's accurate so by

676
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,440
finding

677
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,880
a set of beliefs that minimize

678
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,039
expected free energy in other words ones

679
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,640
that are accurate

680
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,440
while changing as little as possible um

681
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,520
this is just an example of how by doing

682
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:23,840
that

683
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,520
by just kind of searching around for

684
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,280
different qs's here

685
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,360
different beliefs about the probability

686
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,720
of states

687
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,280
then you can find one that when you

688
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,280
calculate it gives the lowest value for

689
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,440
f and that's going to be the one that's

690
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,200
as close as possible

691
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,480
to the true uh answer the bayes theorem

692
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,760
would give you

693
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,039
um and so uh

694
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,600
so what you're um i'll kind of skip this

695
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,320
one but

696
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,240
well so what you're trying to do then an

697
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,720
active inference is you have some true

698
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,480
thing going on out in the world true

699
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,400
states and the observations that they

700
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,520
generate

701
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,919
um but then the brain has this model

702
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,600
where it's trying to say okay

703
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,640
what state must i be in given that

704
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,960
i got this observation so the brain is

705
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,080
trying to essentially

706
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,919
come up with the representation that

707
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,120
best matches

708
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,960
what's going on in the generative

709
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,240
process in other words the thing that's

710
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,720
truly generating the observations

711
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,000
um and so that's probability of

712
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,960
o and s so states and observations this

713
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,480
pi thing is policies

714
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,559
so it's what's the most likely action i

715
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,080
ought to choose

716
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,840
given that the world is this way and

717
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,679
given that i prefer some observations

718
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,000
over others

719
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,400
and what's going to be important for

720
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,760
what i cover

721
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,520
today is the way that you actually

722
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,720
set up these generative models

723
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,440
and the way that these are set up is you

724
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,039
have these states

725
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,880
s and you have these observations o um

726
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,279
and then you have prior initial prior

727
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,320
expectations

728
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,360
that we just called d um

729
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,520
and if you solve this right if you get

730
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,120
some observations

731
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,960
and you say given my generative model

732
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,559
what states are most likely

733
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,720
given those observations and given my

734
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,799
prior expectations d

735
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,600
then you get your sort of optimal belief

736
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,559
about what the

737
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,080
what the states ought to be given those

738
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,919
observations

739
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,720
but in active inference we do this in a

740
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,200
way that's also dynamic

741
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,440
so for instance states at one at time

742
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,400
one

743
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,320
are going to transition into states at

744
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,440
time two

745
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,919
and so you also have beliefs this thing

746
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:34,559
in b

747
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,960
about what states are most likely to

748
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,200
transition into what other states

749
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,320
um and then um

750
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,520
and this is kind of one of the unique

751
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,240
moves in active inference is that

752
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
policies so the different action

753
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,000
sequences you might choose

754
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,480
are just models as things that entail

755
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,279
different transitions between states

756
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,480
so b matrix 1 for example here would

757
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,200
entail

758
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,039
choosing to move from one state to

759
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,880
another state whereas some different

760
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,640
policy would entail a different b matrix

761
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,600
that means you transition

762
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,840
from one state to some other state

763
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,440
and the choice of policy depends

764
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,200
on g here which is the expected free

765
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,360
energy which is a function of

766
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,240
c which is your preferences so

767
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,679
essentially what you're trying to do is

768
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,760
you're trying to find the policy

769
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,000
which corresponds to a set of state

770
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,360
transitions

771
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,840
that will generate the observations over

772
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,960
time

773
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,559
that are going to be as consistent as

774
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,039
possible with uh your preferences which

775
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,799
corresponds to having the lowest

776
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,559
g um and so and then there's

777
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,640
some other sort of parameters up here

778
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,320
that can say

779
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,520
add habits so e here can give you kind

780
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,279
of an additional prior over policies

781
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:49,679
that

782
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,200
gives you kind of habits to do one thing

783
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,520
over another it can have this

784
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,440
beta gamma thing that also controls how

785
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,559
uh precise or how reliable um

786
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,120
the model expects uh the expected free

787
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,880
energy estimates to be

788
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,000
um so i realize that's a lot um but we

789
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,039
kind of covered this

790
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,080
more slowly last time

791
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,200
but what you really need to know um when

792
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
we're actually putting together the code

793
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,840
like i'm going to walk you through

794
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,880
this is what we're going to be

795
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,640
specifying step by step we're going to

796
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,520
be specifying what the observations are

797
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,919
um we're going to be specifying the

798
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,200
likelihood a

799
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,320
so in other words what states generate

800
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,000
what observations with what probability

801
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,320
we're going to be specifying d and b

802
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,039
which are the

803
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,520
priors of our initial states and beliefs

804
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,080
about how states are going to transition

805
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,640
um and we're going to define policies

806
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,279
this pi

807
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,240
thing which is going to tell us the

808
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,360
different possible

809
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,320
state transitions we could choose um and

810
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,919
then we're going to find

811
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,080
c here which is what the agent's

812
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,159
preferences are what observations

813
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,919
it wants to get over others um

814
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,559
as well as the habits and this beta

815
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,760
thing the expected

816
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,039
free energy precision so

817
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,960
building a model in the code amounts to

818
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,799
just specifying

819
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,600
what all these things are what the state

820
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,279
space is what the observation

821
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,000
space looks like what a and d and b look

822
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,399
like

823
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,760
and what c looks like and maybe e and

824
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,360
beta and so if you want to know the

825
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,440
exact equations for solving this

826
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,520
um you know we've shown them here but

827
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,559
again i'm not gonna

828
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,600
describe them in detail um but basically

829
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,360
all they're doing is they're saying

830
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,600
given my beliefs about state transitions

831
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,640
so my priors

832
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,919
and given a my likelihood what's my most

833
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,520
likely posterior belief going to be

834
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,360
which is just bayesian inference right

835
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,279
priors and likelihoods together

836
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,399
equal posteriors um or

837
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,840
are approximate to posteriors

838
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,520
technically um

839
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,799
but so that's what we're doing

840
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,080
we're going to make one comment on that

841
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,840
slide ryan yeah

842
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,440
yes so on the top left we have state

843
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,760
inference given priors and given

844
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,760
observations so that's kind of inference

845
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,360
and we're going to be building on the

846
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,080
strata

847
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,559
to go from inference bayesian inference

848
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,120
to

849
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
active inference so you go from the top

850
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,159
left which is just

851
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,080
perception at one moment in time that's

852
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,200
static to the bottom

853
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,360
left where you have states that are

854
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,880
updating through time

855
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,559
given priors and given observations

856
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,000
you're updating your estimate through

857
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,799
time

858
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,880
then you go to the top right so that so

859
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,799
the bottom left square adds in time

860
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,320
now on the top right we add in this

861
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,559
element of policy selection or control

862
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,520
theory

863
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,000
and then on the bottom right we get all

864
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,679
the way up to this full active inference

865
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,360
model which not just has a control

866
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,279
theory element through policy

867
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,480
but some extra parameters that help us

868
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,799
as we're going to find out soon like e

869
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,520
and beta

870
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,440
so just to give that one more time

871
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,799
because this is what's unique about

872
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,760
active inference

873
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,760
and this is the skeleton of the model

874
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,120
that everything else is going to be

875
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,240
scaffolded onto

876
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,039
thanks ryan continue yeah no thank you

877
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,159
that was definitely a good

878
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,360
uh quicker uh clear summary um

879
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,559
so appreciate it um okay so

880
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,600
and then again just to remind people the

881
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,320
end goal of all of this is to learn how

882
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,600
to put together

883
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,559
um particular generative models right

884
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,159
particular sets of

885
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,279
a matrices d vectors b matrices c

886
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,919
matrices etc for

887
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,600
empirical so for behavioral tasks that

888
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,320
participants can do and then you can fit

889
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,000
these models

890
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,520
to actual behavior to learn things

891
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,679
about participants for instance you

892
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:48,799
might learn

893
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,080
what their parameters are for a or for b

894
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,520
or for instance what their beta value is

895
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,720
um you know etc um so

896
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,720
that's the that's the kind of ultimate

897
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,000
goal here

898
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,240
but the kind of first step to do that

899
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,679
beyond just understanding the structure

900
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,360
i was talking about

901
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,559
is to know how to actually put that

902
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,559
together in the code

903
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,960
and so last time you know i gave a bunch

904
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,000
of examples

905
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,640
of past experiments that we and others

906
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,559
have done where we have built

907
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,640
active inference models for tasks fit

908
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,480
them to data and

909
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,559
learn things for instance about

910
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,240
differences in

911
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,640
substance use and learning rates for

912
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,960
example or differences in beta and

913
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,159
decision uncertainty

914
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,840
in between healthy people and people

915
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,000
with depression and anxiety or substance

916
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,760
use um or differences in um perception

917
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,720
of uh precision of precision estimates

918
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,039
for

919
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,000
uh interceptive perception for instance

920
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,559
um

921
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,159
you know so so i just kind of went

922
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,320
through these examples

923
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,399
of specific tasks and empirical results

924
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,600
just to show the kind of thing that you

925
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,879
can do with this in practice

926
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,159
and but um and then the the task that

927
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:06,720
we're

928
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,640
modeling is one that's designed to be

929
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,919
really simple but

930
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,039
that also kind of showcases um

931
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,200
the major important elements of active

932
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,720
inference models

933
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,679
um and so here what we're doing is we

934
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:20,559
have a task

935
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,679
where the agent starts in a start state

936
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,880
and they can either directly choose to

937
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,399
pull the left to choose the left slot

938
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,480
machine or the right slot machine

939
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,320
and if they do that they can either win

940
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,240
four dollars or zero dollars depending

941
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,600
on which machine is better

942
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
the left one or the right one but they

943
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,039
don't know ahead of time which one's

944
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,559
better so they can either kind of

945
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,640
take a risky guess and either get four

946
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,320
dollars or zero

947
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,399
or they can choose to seek information

948
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,960
first to ask for this hint

949
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,159
and the hint will tell them which uh the

950
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,600
left one which of the left one of the

951
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,480
right one is better

952
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,440
on that trial um and if it's the left

953
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,840
better

954
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,600
context that means the left one will win

955
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,120
80 of the time

956
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,559
and if the hint says the right one's

957
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,559
better then the right one will

958
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,919
pay out 80 of the time but there's a

959
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:08,559
cost

960
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,799
to taking the hint which is that if you

961
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,559
take the hint and then choose a machine

962
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,080
then you can only win two dollars

963
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,600
instead of four um so that's

964
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,799
what we're going to be modeling um and

965
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,960
so what we need to specify for that is

966
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,799
we need to specify

967
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,480
that there are two types of hidden

968
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,000
states one is

969
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,519
whether it's the left better or the

970
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,919
right better context whether it's a left

971
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,080
better or a better trial

972
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,440
and also the behavior states so choosing

973
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,440
to move from the start state to the hint

974
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,240
state

975
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,080
or choosing to move from the start state

976
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,279
directly to the

977
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,039
left or right slot machine

978
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,919
so that's two types of states um we have

979
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,279
to specify

980
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,480
the observations where in this case

981
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
the major observations are winning the

982
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,120
four dollars two dollars or zero dollars

983
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,120
um or in this case we're actually just

984
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,960
gonna model you win or you don't win and

985
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,240
i'll show you how that works

986
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,600
um and um

987
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,480
and we'll have to define uh the agent's

988
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,240
preferences so essentially saying it

989
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,679
prefers four dollars more than two

990
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,200
dollars and two dollars more than zero

991
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,480
dollars and that's going to be that

992
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,679
c thing um so

993
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,600
uh so that's kind of the general task

994
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,880
structure

995
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,240
and i went through um

996
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,480
you know the way to do this kind of

997
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,880
simply outside of the code which is

998
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,679
you define your initial state priors you

999
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,360
define your state outcome mapping

1000
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,120
you define your preference outcome

1001
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,360
preferences over outcomes

1002
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,679
you define the state transitions slash

1003
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,480
actions

1004
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,799
um so b and then you define the policies

1005
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,240
which you define as

1006
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,600
this letter of v um and then the final

1007
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,200
thing i'll talk about before going into

1008
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,240
the code

1009
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,679
is that in these models you can separate

1010
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:56,159
out

1011
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,720
the generative process so it's actually

1012
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,039
out in the world generating observations

1013
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,960
from the generative model which is the

1014
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,399
agent's beliefs

1015
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,360
about what's generating the observations

1016
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,960
um and if we want to separate those in

1017
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,000
the code

1018
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,520
then what we do is big d or big a

1019
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,480
um or big b um those are the generative

1020
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,760
process

1021
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,440
um but if you also specify a little d

1022
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,560
or a little a or a little b then that's

1023
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,440
the generative

1024
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,839
model so that's the agent's beliefs and

1025
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,440
if you specify those then they will be

1026
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,000
separate

1027
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,320
from the generative process and that's

1028
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,520
typically what you need to do

1029
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,960
that is what you need to do if you want

1030
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,760
to model learning which uh i'll show

1031
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,560
ryan just just two two quick points so

1032
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,199
first off

1033
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,199
um someone has asked will these slides

1034
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,399
be available

1035
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,839
or is there any resource where we can

1036
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,040
look at these slides because there's a

1037
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,079
lot of great information

1038
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,599
on them um i can make them available

1039
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,000
everything everything here is i mean

1040
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,399
almost all the figures that i'm showing

1041
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,720
um other than the actual task figure

1042
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,520
here are

1043
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,599
in the are in the tutorial paper and um

1044
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,359
everything i'm showing about how to

1045
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,040
actually build the models is is in the

1046
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,560
code and well explained in the code like

1047
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,520
i'll show

1048
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,560
um but i'm also happy to provide you

1049
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,520
know these

1050
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,079
slides i mean just just let me know um

1051
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,440
like i said the vast majority of them

1052
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,480
are literally just the figures in the

1053
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,280
paper

1054
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,560
um so uh so yeah i mean like i said i'm

1055
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,240
happy to make them available or send

1056
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:24,560
them

1057
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,599
um to anyone i could even just put them

1058
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,640
as supplementary

1059
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,640
additional supplementary material at the

1060
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,800
tutorial as well so i mean yeah just

1061
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,520
whatever whatever people want great idea

1062
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,320
and what a

1063
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,520
fun and accessible science we can have

1064
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,400
when we just

1065
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,920
receive questions like that and can put

1066
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,920
up our slides and then i think max there

1067
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,400
was a

1068
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,480
question that you had about the b matrix

1069
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,920
just while we're defining our

1070
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,760
terms what would you like to say about

1071
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,960
that

1072
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,280
all right so uh but just real quick uh

1073
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,800
for anybody who's just jumping in on the

1074
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,520
stream

1075
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,000
the link is is below the video you can

1076
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,520
go to their paper if you're looking for

1077
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,040
that supplementary code it's in the

1078
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,960
supplementary materials you can download

1079
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,880
all of the code from their supplementary

1080
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,480
materials there

1081
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,839
the question i had was um one thing to

1082
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,520
touch on is as we walk through the code

1083
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,119
one thing i noticed is that we have kind

1084
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,720
of a tensorial structure

1085
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,839
for these matrices um where

1086
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,599
we could also specify a transition

1087
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,920
matrix that was that had like a 2d

1088
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,640
structure

1089
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,680
with you know d with with probability of

1090
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,079
0.8 0.2 but instead we have a tensorial

1091
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,119
structure where we have

1092
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,520
a fixed probability of one for

1093
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,359
transitioning from any given state

1094
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,880
to another state and i just thought uh

1095
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,320
if you wanted to touch on maybe the

1096
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,000
motivation for that i i

1097
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,680
believe it's related to how the model

1098
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,359
like basically interpreting the model

1099
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:43,680
and

1100
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,280
and and how the model gets used um

1101
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,240
is that uh i don't know if you wanted to

1102
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,520
elaborate on that any

1103
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,680
yeah i mean i mean yes i mean so

1104
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,960
technically you know we call these

1105
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,240
things like that we call like

1106
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,079
a matrix to the b matrix matrices but

1107
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,520
technically they're tensors

1108
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,839
um so they're high dimensional matrices

1109
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:02,800
um

1110
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,839
and um so so and

1111
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,440
you know obviously go through this when

1112
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,200
we go through the code but

1113
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,000
because you can have different um types

1114
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,040
of states

1115
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,280
right so the state of being in the left

1116
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,720
better or the right better context

1117
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,280
versus the type of state that has to do

1118
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,359
with you know where you move to or what

1119
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:24,720
you choose right the

1120
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,400
being in a start state versus the hint

1121
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,960
state versus you know the left or right

1122
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,000
bandit or yeah slot machine choice state

1123
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,160
um because you have two different types

1124
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,440
of states those are called state factors

1125
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,079
and so essentially what you need to do

1126
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,359
is you need to

1127
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,760
specify these matrices or like i said

1128
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,040
really tensors

1129
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,400
that again this is for a that

1130
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,760
say um what outcomes for each type of

1131
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,440
outcome will be generated

1132
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,680
for each combination of each value for

1133
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,359
each state factor

1134
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,760
um you know which makes which makes it

1135
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,640
um

1136
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,640
you know higher dimensional um which is

1137
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,240
probably the trickiest part i'll explain

1138
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,520
this as well as i

1139
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,960
as i can when we go through the code um

1140
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,960
but so but so that's that's that and

1141
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,000
also so simultaneously because you have

1142
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,960
two um types of states here that also

1143
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,480
means you have to have

1144
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,839
a b matrix a transition matrix for each

1145
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,280
um type of state um

1146
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,720
and when you when the agent doesn't have

1147
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,520
control

1148
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,280
about state about transitions for a

1149
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,960
certain state um

1150
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,440
then there's only going to be one of

1151
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,000
these

1152
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,440
uh b matrices um

1153
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,880
so for example here so this just says b

1154
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,359
for factor one which is what context

1155
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,240
you're in

1156
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,920
um this is just a simple uh 2d

1157
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,800
matrix um although technically for

1158
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,359
reasons in the code you define it as a

1159
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,760
as a three-dimensional thing with just a

1160
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,800
one here this is just

1161
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,920
but that's just because the third

1162
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,839
dimension here defines the

1163
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,040
the number label for the action um

1164
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,640
so this is basically just saying there's

1165
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,320
only one action

1166
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,440
for state factor one and that is

1167
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,520
an identity matrix here which just means

1168
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,599
that for each trial

1169
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,920
it's gonna be the left better context

1170
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,040
through the whole trial

1171
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,960
right in other words within a trial it's

1172
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,960
not gonna like after they take the hint

1173
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,040
it's not gonna like switch on them you

1174
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,720
know so really the right one is better

1175
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,000
if they got the hint that the left one

1176
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,800
was better

1177
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,160
this is just saying if you start in the

1178
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,599
left better one you're going to stay in

1179
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,760
the left better one the whole trial

1180
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,280
and that's it whereas

1181
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,720
for stay factor two so the b matrices

1182
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,400
for state factor two

1183
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,040
um there are four of these which

1184
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,119
correspond to four different possible

1185
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,320
actions

1186
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,800
um so here the third dimension says this

1187
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,240
is action one

1188
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,720
which means that from any state which

1189
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,000
are the columns

1190
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,800
you can move to state 1 which is the

1191
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,560
first row

1192
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,040
whereas the second one says if i pick

1193
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,839
action 2

1194
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,480
so third dimension value 2 then i can

1195
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,319
move from any of the four states

1196
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,000
again columns 2 state 2 which is the

1197
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
hint state

1198
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,480
and so forth for action 3 and action 4

1199
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,760
moving to

1200
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,920
choose the left bandit or the left

1201
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,880
machine

1202
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,280
or choosing the right machine so these

1203
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,000
are going to be the four

1204
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,920
actions which are just the four possible

1205
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,359
transitions

1206
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,800
um and then when you specify policies

1207
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,480
this thing in v this is just saying for

1208
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,079
each state factor

1209
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,920
which of those actions can i string

1210
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,200
together

1211
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,640
um so v for

1212
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
one here for state factor one is just a

1213
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,400
bunch of ones because again

1214
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,319
there's only one action it just stays in

1215
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,319
whatever state it started in

1216
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,440
um and each column here is a policy and

1217
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,640
each row is a time

1218
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,119
is a an action time point basically so

1219
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,240
this is saying

1220
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,160
so the first row here is what action

1221
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,280
could i take

1222
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,000
when moving from time one to time two

1223
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,640
and the

1224
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,160
third row and the second row here is

1225
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,520
what action could i take when moving

1226
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,560
from time to time

1227
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,520
three and again each of these columns

1228
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,440
just says stay in ones because there is

1229
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,400
no

1230
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,440
possible action for uh

1231
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,040
changing the context but

1232
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,400
policy the policy for a space for data

1233
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,040
or for

1234
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,359
factor two here um so again the the

1235
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,480
actions

1236
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,440
um there's these five columns and this

1237
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,560
just says

1238
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,800
i can move to the start state and i can

1239
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,319
stay in the start state right so that's

1240
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:36,640
just

1241
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,680
action one up here twice um then the

1242
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,960
second column here says

1243
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,520
i could take action two so look at the

1244
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,400
hint

1245
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,599
and then yeah

1246
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,640
and then uh move to

1247
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,319
action three which is choose the left

1248
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,040
machine or i could take the hint two

1249
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,640
and then choose four which is move to

1250
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,040
the right machine or i can go straight

1251
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,560
to the right machine

1252
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,119
and then go back to start or i can go

1253
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:03,599
straight

1254
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,599
to the or straight to the sorry three is

1255
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:06,880
the left machine or straight to the

1256
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,599
right machine

1257
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,400
action four and then go back to start so

1258
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,359
so in other words

1259
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,240
you know there's a bunch of other

1260
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,400
possible transitions right strings that

1261
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,240
you might think of right you might

1262
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,160
for instance go to the left machine and

1263
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,760
then go take the hint or something like

1264
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,200
that but we're not allowing that we're

1265
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:21,920
saying

1266
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,240
these are the allowable transitions so

1267
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,000
these are the different policies

1268
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,720
or action sequences that can be chosen

1269
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,240
so correct me if i'm wrong but it seems

1270
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,680
that this tensorial structure kind of

1271
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,960
allows us to compress

1272
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,440
all those different combinatorial you

1273
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,200
know combinations that we might have so

1274
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,839
it allows

1275
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,920
the structure of basically just allows

1276
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,359
the code to be a little more efficient

1277
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:41,920
is that

1278
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,440
at the end of the day yeah that's a

1279
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,640
perfectly reasonable way to talk about

1280
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,599
it

1281
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,200
um so so okay so so that already gives

1282
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,160
you kind of a

1283
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,280
little bit of a start here um so now

1284
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,359
um um and then and then in

1285
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,560
so at the end of the day what we're

1286
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,680
going to be doing is we're going to be

1287
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,720
specifying

1288
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,640
each of these things so t the amount of

1289
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,720
time steps v the policy space

1290
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,040
a the likelihood the state outcome

1291
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,760
mapping

1292
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,680
b the transition probabilities or

1293
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,359
transition matrices

1294
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,560
c which is the preferred uh observations

1295
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,760
this is preferred states here but it

1296
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,520
should be preferred observations

1297
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,680
um d it would be the priors of our

1298
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,040
initial states

1299
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,599
um and then all these other extra little

1300
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,640
parameters that you

1301
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,720
can or cannot include i'll talk about

1302
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,839
those later

1303
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,079
um but then we also specify this little

1304
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,240
d which basically says the thing doesn't

1305
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,079
start out knowing the context

1306
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,920
so it has to learn the context over

1307
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,440
trials it has to sort of build up

1308
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,400
beliefs about d

1309
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,440
over trials um so

1310
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,599
with that as a kind of quick background

1311
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,720
um

1312
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,560
i'm going to now kind of move into the

1313
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,240
code

1314
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,079
it's cool that the whole thing is stored

1315
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,440
as one

1316
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,440
object with a bunch of fields because

1317
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,119
it's almost like you could have

1318
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,960
ensembles of these different models or

1319
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,480
you might have a bunch of ants in a

1320
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,200
colony

1321
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,200
it really lends itself to being

1322
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,880
reproducible and transparent

1323
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,240
with what each parameter is and

1324
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,400
comparing a whole host of them alongside

1325
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,839
or different kinds of models

1326
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,520
just really cool to see that instead of

1327
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,520
just a tangle of parameters

1328
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,440
that you can get lost in this is like a

1329
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,839
column of things that each has a very

1330
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:16,640
clear

1331
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,400
purpose uh yeah so i should say so you

1332
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,280
you do yeah put all these things into

1333
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,079
the structure

1334
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,079
that would usually just call little mvp

1335
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,520
which just stands for markov decision

1336
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,640
process

1337
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,720
um and then when you actually run the

1338
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,119
thing then you run it through

1339
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,119
the uh the uh vb the spm mdp vb

1340
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,240
underscore x

1341
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,040
uh code and we've provided a version

1342
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,520
that just

1343
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,720
appends it with the word tutorial um

1344
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,640
and you make that big mdp and then you

1345
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,240
can take

1346
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,040
use sub commands like this that just um

1347
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,160
generate figures

1348
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,000
that will show you the outcomes of the

1349
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,599
the simulation

1350
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,240
um and these are examples sort of

1351
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,520
simulation results

1352
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,400
but again i'll go into these after um we

1353
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,599
go through some of the code

1354
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,520
because to know how to actually use this

1355
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,280
stuff you need to understand the code

1356
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,040
um so hopefully i can make this not

1357
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,720
too monotonous you know walking through

1358
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,800
code isn't always the most exciting

1359
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,640
but um the way that we have this set up

1360
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,560
um is you know like i said we have

1361
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,240
comments that kind of try our best to

1362
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,000
explain what every little command means

1363
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,359
you know like what clear and close

1364
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,240
all mean what uh rng default means you

1365
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,440
know etc

1366
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,920
um i'm actually going to change this to

1367
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,800
shuffle

1368
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,720
and what that means is just that um the

1369
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,160
matlab will use a random number

1370
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,839
generator that um

1371
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,480
won't do the exact same thing each time

1372
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,599
so we can get

1373
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,200
variable results when we run it

1374
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,880
so we've provided um several different

1375
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,599
simulation

1376
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,839
options that we can use after building

1377
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,280
the model below which is what i'll walk

1378
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,160
through

1379
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,280
so if you set the sim variable equal to

1380
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,079
one

1381
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,839
then that will just simulate a single

1382
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,839
trial which will

1383
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,040
reproduce uh figure seven um

1384
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,280
in in the paper um so that'd just be a

1385
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,200
single trial simulation

1386
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,359
if you set sim equal to two then that'll

1387
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:14,880
simulate multiple trials

1388
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,800
um where the left context is always

1389
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,400
active but um

1390
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,920
the agent won't know that right the

1391
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,760
agent has to learn okay the the

1392
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,920
left one is the one it always is so

1393
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,839
after a while it'll be confident and

1394
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:26,319
won't

1395
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:29,440
need to take the hint anymore um if i

1396
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,880
could just briefly interject there so

1397
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,599
that would be

1398
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,480
for example an example of what we talked

1399
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,680
about earlier as parameter exploration

1400
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,440
yes uh well well not exactly it would be

1401
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,079
an example

1402
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,760
of learning the parameters over

1403
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,480
successive um

1404
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,359
yeah so state i mean state exploration

1405
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:50,880
is a bigger thing here right because

1406
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,119
either they choose to move to the queue

1407
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,960
or not to learn which context it is yeah

1408
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,240
i agree that so yeah the tricky thing is

1409
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,800
is that when you only have two options

1410
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,599
then

1411
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,440
parameter exploration would just amount

1412
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,680
to even though i've gotten some good

1413
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,839
results from

1414
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,160
choosing the left one

1415
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,680
i might also instead try to choose the

1416
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,200
right one a few times to be more

1417
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,880
confident in what the

1418
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,160
reward probability is for the right one

1419
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,200
but typically to get good dynamics like

1420
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,160
that you're probably

1421
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,200
gonna need something that has um has

1422
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,480
more like three arms

1423
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,079
like three different options instead of

1424
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,760
two

1425
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,280
if you're also going to include the

1426
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,599
state exploration thing with the q

1427
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,520
um it would get a little more

1428
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,040
complicated like a standard kind of

1429
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,040
paradigm for doing parameter exploration

1430
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,480
would be something where

1431
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,119
you don't have the queue and the um the

1432
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,280
agent just has like three choices

1433
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,599
and it just kind of has to choose

1434
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,280
different ones over time until it

1435
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,160
becomes confident

1436
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,760
which one is the best and then it'll

1437
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,319
just keep choosing that one

1438
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,160
so the parameter exploration would

1439
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,640
amount to how many times kind of it

1440
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,119
it chooses each slot machine initially

1441
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,040
just to figure out which one is best um

1442
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,680
and um a standard reinforcement learning

1443
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,960
agent will do that differently

1444
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,440
than an active inference agent um and

1445
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,359
the the substance use study i mentioned

1446
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,440
above actually specifically did that

1447
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,119
um but uh but yeah so just one question

1448
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:23,520
here

1449
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,599
in this sim equals one two three four

1450
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,800
five they're like

1451
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,960
scenarios that you're going to be able

1452
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,920
to rapidly

1453
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,319
plug and play so scenario one is like a

1454
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,160
static or scenario two is

1455
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,079
multi-trial so this is what is going to

1456
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,240
allow reproducible construction of the

1457
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,200
figures

1458
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,640
and understanding of how different

1459
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,559
parameter changes influence behavior but

1460
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:43,760
that's what we're laying out right now

1461
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,280
it's kind of like the scenarios

1462
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,599
for the agent right okay yeah i don't

1463
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:48,319
know about it quick

1464
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:49,839
is one thing i think sim five would take

1465
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,319
about half an hour to run

1466
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,480
yeah don't do it sim five we'll talk

1467
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,079
about with when we talk about parameter

1468
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,040
fitting which will be a different

1469
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,599
session

1470
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,480
um but mainly we'll be talking about sim

1471
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,240
one two and three here which just has to

1472
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,000
do with perception and learning

1473
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,240
as opposed to the real empirical stuff

1474
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,960
which is estimating parameters um

1475
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,480
and uh you know using them you know

1476
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,079
for group level analyses and things like

1477
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,440
that well it's just so helpful though

1478
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,640
how it's laid out

1479
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,280
from the most static straightforward

1480
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,319
perceptive

1481
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,119
inference to action in the loop and then

1482
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,480
now that action's in the loop

1483
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,000
we're gonna think about the simplest

1484
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,240
setting to explore action in a loop on a

1485
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,119
single trial

1486
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,559
unchanging and then we're going to keep

1487
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,720
on adding layers of ecological

1488
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,000
variability or other

1489
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,520
features into the model so thanks for

1490
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,200
making it so step wise and that's why

1491
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,400
it's a step-by-step tutorial

1492
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,680
yeah yeah we tried um but that's the

1493
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,319
last thing for

1494
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,720
for today so if you set sem equal to

1495
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,920
three

1496
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,240
then um that will simulate a reversal

1497
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,240
learning uh situation

1498
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,520
and that's where basically the left

1499
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,680
context is active for a certain number

1500
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,640
of trials

1501
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,400
and so the agent should build up a prior

1502
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,240
expectation that it's just the left one

1503
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,200
every time

1504
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,960
so it'll stop taking the hint and just

1505
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,720
start choosing left

1506
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,640
but then it switches and so now the

1507
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,960
right context is the right one

1508
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,599
is the correct one and you see basically

1509
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,119
how long it takes

1510
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,040
before the agent again says okay now i

1511
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,880
need to start taking the hint again

1512
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,160
and then eventually when it becomes

1513
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,319
confident to just choosing the right one

1514
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,880
you know directly um and not needing to

1515
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,000
take the hint

1516
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
um so it's kind of like a standard

1517
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,040
reversal learning

1518
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,520
kind of task um so those are the three

1519
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,240
that hopefully we'll get through today

1520
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,240
um and um there are several parameters

1521
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,480
you know that can be kind of messed with

1522
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,960
but the one that i've focused on mainly

1523
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,760
here at least

1524
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,559
we can set in the beginning is um this

1525
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,200
rs1 thing which just turns into rs

1526
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,440
later down um but that stands for risk

1527
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,200
seeking or it could also be reward

1528
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,079
seeking

1529
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,079
um but more or less the bigger this

1530
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,280
value is the

1531
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,880
stronger the agent's preference is for

1532
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,079
uh winning as much money as possible

1533
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,400
so it's this is the value that's in the

1534
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,720
c matrix that defines preferences

1535
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,440
over winning versus losing um so the

1536
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,559
bigger this number

1537
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:13,599
the the more the agent

1538
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,839
is going to say okay i care more about

1539
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,599
reward than about information and

1540
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:18,880
therefore i'm just going to take the

1541
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,480
risky choice to go for

1542
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,800
one of the slot machines directly so the

1543
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,480
the higher this the less information

1544
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,440
seeking the more

1545
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,520
the lower this is the more the more

1546
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,920
information seeking the agent will be

1547
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,280
um and so that's just kind of a really

1548
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,160
simple one

1549
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,920
to show how by tweaking parameters you

1550
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,440
can get different

1551
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,119
results here just allowing you to weight

1552
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,319
how strong the reward value component

1553
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:46,319
is in the expected free energy versus

1554
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:47,599
how

1555
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,000
strong the weight is of the information

1556
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,760
seeking component of the expected free

1557
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,960
energy

1558
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,400
um and then um you can kind of ignore

1559
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,359
this

1560
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,839
pebb thing down here this is basically

1561
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,599
you can turn this on if when you do sim

1562
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:02,960
equals five

1563
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,599
you want to actually do group level

1564
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,000
bayesian analyses on the parameters

1565
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,200
um this will also save the outputs of

1566
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:11,599
sim

1567
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,520
like chris said sim 5 like takes like a

1568
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,520
half hour to run

1569
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,400
so if you turn this thing on it'll also

1570
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:18,880
save

1571
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,040
the results of sim 5 so you can run this

1572
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,079
peb thing

1573
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,640
without having to reduce m5 every time

1574
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,280
um

1575
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,640
so we just figured hopefully that would

1576
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,800
help i just i just want to jump in and

1577
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,160
point out that it's really nice in this

1578
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:30,880
part where

1579
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,200
for example with ourselves set there now

1580
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,559
let's say that i'm designing my

1581
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,160
experiment and i need to know how many

1582
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,200
trials and how many

1583
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,680
uh subjects do i need when i'm doing my

1584
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,800
power analysis

1585
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,280
i can run a simulation like this set

1586
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,880
that parameter at what i think might be

1587
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,720
a reasonable range of values from the

1588
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,599
literature

1589
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,359
and then i can say well this is the

1590
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,359
expected difference in my groups based

1591
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:52,800
on what i think this range of values

1592
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,720
might be so it's a really powerful tool

1593
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,240
to be able to plug and play a single

1594
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,400
parameter like that

1595
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,920
yeah i know it's nice i mean typically

1596
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,680
with experimental you know with

1597
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,359
experiments what you do want to do first

1598
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,520
is you want to kind of see hey

1599
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,240
can tweaking different parameters in the

1600
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,119
model

1601
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,920
produce simulated behavior that looks a

1602
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,920
lot like the type of behavior i actually

1603
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,800
see in

1604
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,240
real participants um you know so

1605
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,920
yeah so exactly you'd be hoping for is

1606
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,920
hey like there's a chunk of people

1607
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,599
that look like that act as though they

1608
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,839
have a high risk seeking

1609
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,920
value and another group of people they

1610
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,040
have a lower

1611
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,960
risk seeking value based on their

1612
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,160
behavior

1613
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,160
you can fit the model to that explicitly

1614
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,240
and then you can say hey

1615
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,000
is the difference in the rs value

1616
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,520
between these two groups of people does

1617
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,440
that predict anything interesting

1618
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,720
you know does that tell you something

1619
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,559
about you know how well they're going to

1620
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:45,440
respond to like

1621
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,079
drug a versus drug b or does it tell you

1622
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,359
something about

1623
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,280
um you know their general cognitive

1624
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,960
ability or you know their current

1625
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,319
emotional state or

1626
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,079
you know like you can do all that kind

1627
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,319
of stuff which is the ultimate goal of

1628
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,599
all of this

1629
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,200
um but so okay

1630
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,680
so the first thing we need to do um at

1631
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,119
least in the order i have it set up

1632
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,200
is to set t so t is the number of time

1633
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,640
steps in the trial

1634
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,920
so in this case there are three time

1635
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,079
steps remember because

1636
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:18,240
the uh the agent

1637
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,960
the agent has to start in the start

1638
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,720
state and then

1639
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,640
move to the second time step choose the

1640
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,920
hint state

1641
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,000
and then third time step choose one of

1642
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,359
the machines

1643
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,280
or it can go straight from the start

1644
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,880
state to one of the machines

1645
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,480
but then at the third time step it'll

1646
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,480
just go back to the start state

1647
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,000
that's how we have it set up anyway so

1648
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,160
you need three time steps

1649
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,440
um so then

1650
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,480
um what's typically easiest is to first

1651
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:46,799
out

1652
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:49,839
start out by specifying the uh prior

1653
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,960
expectations over states um and so in

1654
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,280
the

1655
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,720
in big d which is the generative process

1656
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,720
for factor number one which is in the

1657
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,000
braces here

1658
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,760
we just specify this as a column vector

1659
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,599
so a row and then this means that it's

1660
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,359
transposed and becomes a column

1661
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,480
this uh apostrophe thing here

1662
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,400
and so we set this as one and zero which

1663
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,599
just means

1664
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,280
that it's with 100 probability gonna be

1665
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,839
in the left better context

1666
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,799
and then for the second state factor so

1667
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,000
this d2

1668
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,599
thing here we set it so the agent

1669
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,760
always starts out in the start state so

1670
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,280
a one in that first

1671
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,440
entry and then zeros for all the rest

1672
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,200
because it's never going to start

1673
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,799
in the hidden state or in the choose

1674
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:41,520
left state or in the choose right state

1675
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,119
so we're just saying absolutely the

1676
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,400
agent will always start in the start

1677
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,720
state

1678
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,440
but then and this is all explained but

1679
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,559
then for

1680
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,319
little d this is the agent's actual

1681
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,319
beliefs we say

1682
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:57,920
the agent has no idea what context it's

1683
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,559
going to be

1684
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,240
to start with so we set these to values

1685
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,720
that are flat so where each uh the left

1686
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,160
better and the right better context have

1687
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,760
the same values

1688
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,880
um but notice here that we didn't set

1689
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,720
these up to add up to one

1690
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,680
um like we did for big d i mean the

1691
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,079
reason

1692
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,520
is is that these are technically what

1693
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,760
are called dirichlet distributions

1694
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,200
um and dirichlet distributions um

1695
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,480
are uh basically they say

1696
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,960
um the smaller these numbers are the

1697
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,640
less confident the agent

1698
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,079
is um in its beliefs so if these are

1699
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,079
0.25 and 0.25

1700
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,480
it thinks it's a flat distribution but

1701
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,839
it's really unconfident

1702
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:42,640
whereas this thing was like 20 and 20

1703
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,119
then

1704
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,319
it would also believe it's a flat

1705
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,799
distribution but it'd be really really

1706
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:47,520
confident

1707
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,119
that its beliefs are about a flat

1708
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,960
distribution um

1709
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,359
and to explain that better um i we're

1710
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,040
actually going to transition over to

1711
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,480
chris who's going to give you a little

1712
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,440
bit of am a kind of more

1713
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,200
general explanation of how learning

1714
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,119
works here since you actually do need to

1715
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,720
understand this now

1716
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,400
um so we can transition over to chris

1717
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,599
here briefly

1718
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,760
yep because usually a probability people

1719
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,680
would imagine it sums to one

1720
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,440
something has to happen you know the

1721
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,520
coin has to go heads or tails so it has

1722
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,319
to add up to

1723
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:20,559
100 has to add up to one to be a

1724
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:21,839
classical probability

1725
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,440
but this is a little bit of a tweak on

1726
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,440
that some similar features but some

1727
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,640
unique features so

1728
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,400
thanks for switching over there and

1729
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,160
helping us understand it

1730
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,480
yep so can you guys see my screen yes we

1731
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,680
don't see you but we see your screen all

1732
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,000
right

1733
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,680
go ahead all good okay

1734
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,079
so as ryan was saying before essentially

1735
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,359
our likelihood

1736
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:42,559
what we were talking about before say

1737
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,480
we're talking about the a matrix there

1738
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,160
is technically speaking a

1739
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,799
dirichlet so all of the distributions

1740
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,400
will be categorical distributions our

1741
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:50,880
d's

1742
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,880
our b's and our a's they're all

1743
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,880
categorical distributions

1744
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,559
um and they all have a pro prior

1745
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,319
or a distribution over the parameter

1746
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,520
space which is a dirichlet distribution

1747
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,839
um and so just kind of the people who

1748
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,200
are technically like in the know as it

1749
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,160
were uh

1750
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,839
a categorical distribution is just a

1751
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,839
special case of

1752
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,960
a multinomial distribution

1753
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,119
and a dirichlet distribution is what's

1754
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,960
called a conjugate prior

1755
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,720
for the categorical and the multinomial

1756
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,319
distributions which just means that

1757
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:23,599
if you multiply these two things

1758
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:25,680
together these two distributions

1759
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,359
you get out the distribution that has

1760
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,119
the same form

1761
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,200
as the prior and that's really important

1762
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,319
if you're doing like

1763
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,119
empirical bays for example where the

1764
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:36,720
prior or

1765
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,200
the posterior after round one serves as

1766
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,079
the prior

1767
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:41,520
in round the second round of inference

1768
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,280
that kind of thing

1769
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,960
um and so just to briefly go through

1770
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,119
this so um

1771
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:49,440
you guys can see my cursor right yep

1772
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,480
yeah cool okay

1773
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,079
this is the categorical distribution

1774
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,319
where x is some

1775
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,599
uh categorical variable that occupies

1776
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:58,240
one of

1777
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,520
one decay mutually exclusive states of

1778
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,839
the world

1779
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:06,079
that is to say say i have a distribution

1780
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:07,680
over a grid world

1781
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,520
where my agent is my agent can't be in

1782
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,440
two places at once it's either in like

1783
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,680
it's either left or it's right

1784
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,559
for example um and theta are just the

1785
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,000
parameters of that distribution

1786
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,160
and so this function here this thing's

1787
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,200
sticking out the front

1788
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,119
is this normalization constant we can

1789
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:24,480
adjust this it just counts the

1790
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,079
combinatorics of the distribution and

1791
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,640
assume and

1792
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,440
ensures that sums to one exactly the

1793
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,640
same thing here with the dirichlet

1794
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,599
distribution

1795
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,240
although it is a distribution over the

1796
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,760
parameter space

1797
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,319
of our likelihood right and so dirichlet

1798
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,319
distributions often kind of colloquially

1799
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,160
called distributions of distributions

1800
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,240
um because they're a distribution over a

1801
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,520
vector that has to sum to one

1802
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,040
and then what's really beautiful about

1803
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,040
these two distributions is that when you

1804
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,319
multiply them together

1805
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,000
and we'll just ignore the normalization

1806
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,400
constant because things get pretty messy

1807
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,119
but you end up with a distribution that

1808
00:59:59,119 --> 00:59:59,680
it has

1809
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,359
at the same functional form as the prior

1810
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:03,280
it's also a dirichlet distribution so

1811
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,280
our posterior distribution

1812
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,920
over the parameters of our likelihood is

1813
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,960
also

1814
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,599
a dirichlet distribution and all that

1815
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,359
changes when we go from the prior

1816
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,720
likelihood is we add to this little

1817
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,520
alpha thing here it's called a count

1818
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,480
so we essentially just add a count to

1819
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,319
whatever it was that was observed to the

1820
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:23,760
variable that was observed

1821
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,880
so i'm just going to go into a little

1822
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,799
bit more detail than that on the next

1823
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:27,599
slide

1824
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:28,559
is there anything you want to add to

1825
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,640
that ryan um

1826
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,720
no i mean just just i mean at the at the

1827
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,839
end of the day and you know

1828
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,000
chris will chris will cover this you

1829
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,680
know i'm sure is that

1830
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,599
while this might look really complicated

1831
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:40,720
to somebody who doesn't have a lot of

1832
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,280
math background it really just amounts

1833
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,160
to

1834
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,319
um they're being like what i showed you

1835
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,960
with d there being a number

1836
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,240
that's assigned to each entry um and

1837
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,920
when you observe something

1838
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,960
that number will get bigger um so that

1839
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,359
just

1840
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:00,559
means that um like what i said that

1841
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:03,200
uh for instance if i believe that i was

1842
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:03,839
in the

1843
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,799
left better state the last five times

1844
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:07,200
then

1845
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,480
i'll add like five numbers

1846
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,480
you know i'll add one five times to that

1847
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,280
left one so now it would be like

1848
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,680
5.25 as opposed to just 0.25

1849
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,839
um and ultimately those numbers

1850
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,839
get soft maxed so they just get

1851
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,599
normalized and turned back into a

1852
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,280
probability distribution

1853
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,000
um but but like i said at the end of the

1854
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,359
day you're just adding

1855
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:33,359
counts each time you observe something

1856
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:34,480
yeah

1857
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,240
this is just like how you might be a

1858
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,240
little bit more confident about the true

1859
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,480
ratio of different kinds of colors of

1860
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,480
balls in an urn if you had three of one

1861
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,079
color and then one of the other color

1862
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:44,960
you're not quite sure

1863
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,880
if you had three million and one million

1864
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,079
you'd be very sure

1865
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,119
and then max you had a question yeah

1866
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:52,640
so just going to the other end of the

1867
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,400
spectrum then if i'm somebody

1868
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,319
who's in probability theory and i'm

1869
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,000
talking about a dirichlet distribution

1870
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,520
and i'm talking about the support for

1871
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,839
that distribution on the

1872
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:04,319
open interval 0 1 and as we can see here

1873
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:06,079
from these equations that are provided

1874
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,160
uh that you know if i if i go to zero

1875
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,680
then i'm basically going to end up with

1876
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,319
a

1877
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:12,400
since it's multiplying each time then

1878
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,079
there could be problems so

1879
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:17,440
in practice however uh my question

1880
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,880
not being very experienced with using

1881
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,799
these things in practice

1882
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:22,240
when we implement this does that have

1883
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,240
much of an effect on any of the

1884
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,400
estimated parameters

1885
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,079
um no but

1886
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,680
one thing to say is that because you

1887
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,599
always work with log

1888
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:37,599
you we're always in log space we end up

1889
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:40,240
once you just have basically a little

1890
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,920
numerical trick where

1891
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,599
all of your to make sure that you never

1892
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,760
have a log of 0 we add

1893
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,240
e to the negative 16 to all the entries

1894
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,799
um does that kind of answer your

1895
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:53,520
question

1896
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,240
yeah so if for example if i see at the

1897
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,119
end of the day

1898
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,760
uh i might have a a converged parameter

1899
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,359
that has apparently a very low

1900
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:04,400
log likelihood of uh you know when i

1901
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,520
when i converge on that estimate is it

1902
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,200
you know maybe part of that could be

1903
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,640
related to okay

1904
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,119
there's some times where i'm entering in

1905
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:14,720
a state that might be

1906
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,640
unlikely to occur most of the time or

1907
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,079
maybe it wasn't observed in this

1908
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:20,000
particular set of experiments but the

1909
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,359
rest of it kind of

1910
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,039
holds up is that maybe one way to think

1911
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,799
about low low

1912
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:27,200
uh values uh when i converge to my

1913
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,520
parameter estimates

1914
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,000
um i'm not sure i totally understand the

1915
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,359
example just because it's a bit a little

1916
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:34,960
bit abstract could we give it

1917
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,119
how about the the slot machine example

1918
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:38,799
it's like you go into the casino you've

1919
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,559
never done any of the slot machines

1920
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:41,839
it's like you haven't had much

1921
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:43,599
experience so even if you're

1922
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:45,200
um not sure about which one's better

1923
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,640
it's like you're not sure

1924
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,280
overall and then as you try more of the

1925
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,280
slot machines just like ryan was saying

1926
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,079
you increment up observations so to

1927
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:55,359
speak in those columns

1928
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:57,440
so after you've made a thousand slot

1929
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,799
machine visits you're a little bit more

1930
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:00,400
confident than after you had made

1931
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,480
zero or one or few is that the case just

1932
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,680
to bring it to the example

1933
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,359
that we're gonna be sure yeah or i could

1934
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:07,200
pull the slot machine three times and

1935
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:07,920
get

1936
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,680
only one result observed and i would

1937
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,280
never have um

1938
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,480
the complement to that result observed

1939
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,079
and so then effectively my my

1940
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:17,680
probability distribution is

1941
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,119
then one and zero on my posterior um

1942
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,319
so if i end up having like weird looking

1943
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:24,880
numbers

1944
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,480
in my on my converged parameter

1945
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,520
estimates in terms of the log

1946
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,359
likelihoods for the different things

1947
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:31,200
it's kind of maybe just relates to this

1948
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,720
particular property but at the end of

1949
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,839
the day

1950
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,200
what it sounds like is that i'm still

1951
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,119
going to converge to the correct values

1952
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:37,839
using this

1953
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:39,839
approach that's just like kind of an

1954
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:42,319
insurance um

1955
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,160
yeah i'm not sure honestly about any if

1956
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,599
there are any formal results that relate

1957
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:46,319
to this

1958
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:49,520
um but in practice because

1959
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,280
we always basically the categorical

1960
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,799
distribution is just and

1961
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,160
it just ends up being a soft max

1962
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,160
function over the concentration

1963
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,760
parameters

1964
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,079
um you'll always have something that's

1965
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:01,920
between zero and one

1966
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,160
um and the concentration parameters are

1967
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,520
basically will always kind of be

1968
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,480
somewhere between

1969
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,839
zero if it's never been observed and

1970
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,079
at whatever it is it goes to however

1971
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:13,039
high your

1972
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:14,640
however many experiments you run or

1973
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,240
simulations you run

1974
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,160
um i've never encountered a problem with

1975
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,280
this

1976
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,400
but then again i've never actually

1977
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,119
really looked into

1978
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,240
um possible consequences of

1979
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,240
that so i just don't know i'm sorry ryan

1980
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,839
do you ever think so um i mean the only

1981
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:30,640
thing i would say

1982
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,400
yeah and maybe maybe i misunderstood the

1983
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,000
question but i mean if it has to do with

1984
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,359
whether or not you'll

1985
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:36,880
there's certainly no guarantee that

1986
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,640
you'll converge on the

1987
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,000
on the uh on the true generative process

1988
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,559
yeah there's there's lots of cases where

1989
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:46,079
things can go wrong and you'll get stuck

1990
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,480
in local minima and things like that

1991
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,480
um we actually show several examples of

1992
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,240
that in this uh structure learning

1993
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,400
paper um where we show how you can use

1994
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,680
how you can use active inference for

1995
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,880
structure learning and um

1996
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,559
like bayesian model expansion or state

1997
01:05:58,559 --> 01:05:59,920
space expansion and safe space

1998
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,760
production and things like that

1999
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,799
there's lots of cases where you'll

2000
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:08,720
end up with the wrong likelihood um

2001
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,559
so so it's not uh yeah it's

2002
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:15,119
or maybe in my mind just a caveat would

2003
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:16,000
then be

2004
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,680
you know if going to that example with

2005
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,839
the posterior distribution i only have

2006
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:22,400
uh pulled the or picked a machine three

2007
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,280
times

2008
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,960
um when we're designing our experiment

2009
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,640
it might be important to consider

2010
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,839
setting it up so that

2011
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,039
you know we're not going to get into the

2012
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,559
case where we only have a sample of n of

2013
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,240
three because obviously that doesn't

2014
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,359
sound like good science to anybody

2015
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:34,160
anyways but

2016
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,920
it's just kind of the oversimplified

2017
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,880
case where as you add more categories

2018
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,640
you could run into that scenario for one

2019
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,920
of your particular categories which

2020
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,359
could cause some problems

2021
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:44,799
it sounds like if there's a hundred

2022
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,559
kinds of cereal and you only

2023
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:48,240
let people choose one time you're not

2024
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,760
going to get a good estimate it's kind

2025
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,559
of like a

2026
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:52,880
sample size and an experimental design

2027
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:53,599
question

2028
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:56,000
so just to kind of pull back for those

2029
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,119
because that's that's a

2030
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:58,960
really interesting question about where

2031
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,240
there's probability or

2032
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,079
how different sample sizes are related

2033
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:03,359
to each other but

2034
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,119
we're just thinking about this the

2035
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,480
structure for how

2036
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,359
additional observations are going to

2037
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,319
increase

2038
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:14,000
the kind or the the quality of this

2039
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,640
estimate of a parameter yeah and you'll

2040
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,520
and you'll see and what

2041
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,680
and what chris shows you that that um

2042
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:20,880
like the

2043
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,200
basically the the lower the

2044
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,640
concentration val the concentration

2045
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,680
priority values are

2046
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,319
generally the more the expected free

2047
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:29,440
energy will be weighted

2048
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,319
toward um choosing like uh parameter

2049
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:34,079
exploration policies

2050
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:35,839
right so it'll be a thing where if it's

2051
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:37,359
never chosen the

2052
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:39,760
99th serial before it'll be driven to go

2053
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,520
choose that one

2054
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,119
just because it wants to be more

2055
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,799
confident in what the actual parameters

2056
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:46,240
are

2057
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:49,200
but but anyway i uh crystal yeah go go

2058
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,160
ahead

2059
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,240
yeah yeah so we actually don't yeah we

2060
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,440
actually don't have any numerical

2061
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,200
examples in the paper where we

2062
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,359
kind of have show the free energy values

2063
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:59,119
um for different parameter

2064
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:01,520
values we only kind of have state

2065
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,720
exploration

2066
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:06,160
terms but um there are i mean

2067
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,200
maybe that's something we could add to

2068
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,400
the paper actually that would be

2069
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,520
something interesting

2070
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,640
yeah people yeah okay

2071
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,400
so essentially just to kind of give a

2072
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,080
little recap we just have

2073
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,920
our uh our

2074
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,600
probability distribution over a or the

2075
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,600
parameters of a is just a dirichlet

2076
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,960
distribution

2077
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,319
over kind of over a and then so we

2078
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:31,679
just end up with a matrix that has

2079
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,759
the number right where the rows are our

2080
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:35,198
possible observations

2081
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:38,080
and the columns are our hidden states

2082
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:38,479
and

2083
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:41,120
literally all that we're doing this so

2084
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,319
this little term this little kind of

2085
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,238
cross inside a circle is called a

2086
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:47,439
kronecker tensor product

2087
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,839
um actually that goodness is that

2088
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:51,198
correct i actually don't know

2089
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:54,880
that's the notation cross product

2090
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,600
it's in the spm textbook that notation

2091
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,799
is used for the chronicler

2092
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:02,238
product yeah thank you okay good um

2093
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:03,679
sorry i just had a brief mind blank i

2094
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:06,158
was like oh god anyway so and this eta

2095
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:08,080
thing here is just a learning rate and

2096
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,238
so whatever it will just multiply

2097
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:13,040
essentially this here so say i'll just

2098
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,399
give an example

2099
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:17,520
and we'll just add that to our previous

2100
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,080
values of whatever these a's are so just

2101
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,120
very simply say we have our posterior

2102
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:23,839
over states

2103
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:27,120
is something like 0.7.3 and

2104
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,839
our op we receive observation so this is

2105
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:30,238
a

2106
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:34,719
transpose vector so this corresponds to

2107
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,198
row 2. this all that this would do is

2108
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:38,479
we're literally adding

2109
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:41,679
a value of 0.7 and 0.3 to

2110
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:45,279
this matrix that's all that learning is

2111
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:48,560
really it's very simple um and then

2112
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,080
both of these things will get both of

2113
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,479
these uh columns will get passed through

2114
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,238
a softmax function at the end of the day

2115
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:55,199
and just kind of give

2116
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:57,280
a give an example of what we're talking

2117
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,400
about before so because they're both

2118
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,080
soft maxed

2119
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,800
all that soft all soft max cares about

2120
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,280
is

2121
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,199
that the difference between the two

2122
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:06,320
numbers in

2123
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,640
all the two elements of the vector so 51

2124
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,159
and 50 and two and one

2125
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:12,960
the same same value in the softmax but

2126
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,840
in one case the model is incredibly

2127
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,960
confident and in the other case it's not

2128
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,000
confident at all

2129
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,040
for example so if you had an agent that

2130
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,800
was actually doing parameter exploration

2131
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,560
there would be no the agent would have

2132
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,480
no motivation whatsoever

2133
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,719
to explore the parameters in the first

2134
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:31,040
case of 5150 but it would be quite

2135
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,560
motivated in the case of two one

2136
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,199
for example even though the likelihood

2137
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:36,400
distribution you end up getting out of

2138
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:36,719
that

2139
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:40,480
is the same okay good

2140
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,239
um so that is actually i think all that

2141
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:43,840
we really had that's all that i'd

2142
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,199
prepared for this is because

2143
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,440
it's really is in practice it's so

2144
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,800
simple

2145
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:54,000
um so back to you ryan okay

2146
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,840
sorry

2147
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,480
okay so anyway with that as a little bit

2148
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,679
of the background

2149
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:07,199
always all we're doing here is we're

2150
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:10,080
saying to start with the agent believes

2151
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,159
it's a flat distribution it has no idea

2152
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:13,280
which one's going to be better

2153
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,600
left or right on each trial that's in

2154
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,199
little d because that's our model

2155
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:19,520
so each time it believes that it was in

2156
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,880
the left better context it's just going

2157
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,000
to keep adding

2158
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,679
you know numbers to this 0.25 here

2159
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:27,120
and those will be scaled by the learning

2160
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,280
rate thing that uh

2161
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,560
that um chris showed where uh you know

2162
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,120
if

2163
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,199
if learning rate is one then each time

2164
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,560
it observes the left better context

2165
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,000
it'll just add a one so it'll become

2166
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
1.25 and then 2.25

2167
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,400
etc but if the learning rate was like

2168
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,280
0.5

2169
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,840
so it was like lower then it would add

2170
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,719
0.5

2171
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:50,159
each time so it'd be 0.75 1.25

2172
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,640
etc so the learning rate just scales how

2173
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,800
big the counts are they get added

2174
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,360
um and the learning rate could be zero

2175
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,120
at which case there wouldn't be an

2176
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,239
updating just

2177
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:02,400
thinking about just what could the whole

2178
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,280
range be from

2179
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,600
not a learning agent to very slowly

2180
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,440
incorporating new information

2181
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,600
using this dirichlet framework that

2182
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,880
christopher just described

2183
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,640
all the way up to just ridiculously high

2184
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,080
values so that

2185
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,640
it just yeah i should just highlight as

2186
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,320
well i think there's this is

2187
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,080
i just kind of want to this probably

2188
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,000
isn't a good point for discussion just

2189
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,280
to keep things moving but one thing

2190
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,239
that's worth highlighting is there's a

2191
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,520
genuine kind of

2192
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,520
debate or maybe debates a bit too strong

2193
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,360
word but discussion to be had

2194
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,880
about whether we should actually be

2195
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,520
moduling modulating learning rate

2196
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,560
given that the model is bayes optimal or

2197
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,719
approximately bayes optimal one would

2198
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:40,080
assume that there should be a way of

2199
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,440
modeling things without actually

2200
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,920
changing the learning rate from one

2201
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,640
um but in practice i'm not sure if that

2202
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,159
actually works but

2203
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,560
anyway so yeah so i mean i mean

2204
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,480
technically technically a learning rate

2205
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,920
of one is optimal

2206
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:57,360
yeah but for but for um

2207
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,760
for when you're fitting behavior when

2208
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,920
you're fitting the model to behavior

2209
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,960
um most people are not

2210
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,480
optimal um and so uh you have to

2211
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,520
estimate

2212
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,679
typically the learning rate for each

2213
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,960
person

2214
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,040
and oftentimes it's quite a bit below

2215
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,280
one but that's actually an interesting

2216
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,040
attribute and again it's an example

2217
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,280
about how using these generative

2218
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,520
and generalizable frameworks help us

2219
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,719
compare not just

2220
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,880
who could remember more numbers or who

2221
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,400
had a faster reaction time

2222
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,400
as far as just observable

2223
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,640
characteristics we're moving a step back

2224
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,600
and asking whether

2225
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,880
people might differ in their learning

2226
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,560
rate or in other attributes of this

2227
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,920
model

2228
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,000
yeah and there's also and again i mean

2229
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,199
this isn't something to really get into

2230
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:42,239
so much but

2231
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:45,360
there is effectively a learning rate

2232
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,400
that comes out of the

2233
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,880
precision of your posterior beliefs over

2234
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,920
states

2235
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,440
um like for instance if your posterior

2236
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,520
beliefs over states are really imprecise

2237
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,320
like say it's like point say afterwards

2238
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,480
you know this is like

2239
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:05,040
0.6.4 then whatever observation that you

2240
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:05,760
get

2241
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,920
is just going to add counts of 0.6 and

2242
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,040
0.4

2243
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,800
which means that you're not really going

2244
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,960
to build up

2245
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,480
strong priors um you know uh

2246
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:21,040
um a straw a more precise prior for one

2247
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,239
over the other

2248
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:26,239
um because uh you're you're not

2249
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:29,120
confident about which state you're in

2250
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,239
just a quick

2251
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,320
example of that you go into the casino

2252
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,600
and you're drawn a card

2253
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,080
and you can't read the card or it's the

2254
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,679
number is rubbed off so if there's no

2255
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,520
precision at the sensory level

2256
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,440
with which card you drew you're not

2257
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,800
going to be updating

2258
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,400
your estimate of how likely different

2259
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,840
numbers are and then if there's a

2260
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,360
perfectly legible card

2261
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,440
so it's 100 you have no error about

2262
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:50,719
which card it is

2263
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,480
there's the secondary question about how

2264
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,400
much you update your internal

2265
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,800
model but it's not a precision about the

2266
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:57,600
perception

2267
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,760
question so it's really a nice point and

2268
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:00,719
it's worth

2269
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:02,640
understanding that you can have

2270
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,880
uncertainty about observations

2271
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,000
that then is captured by this model but

2272
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:08,480
also

2273
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,239
even in the case of precise or even

2274
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,080
totally observable scenarios

2275
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,560
there's additional uncertainty related

2276
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,120
to learning

2277
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,840
yeah i mean again there's still

2278
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,440
potential problems i mean what tends to

2279
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,040
happen in these models is especially if

2280
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,800
learning rate is one then like

2281
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,040
the agent kind of becomes too confident

2282
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,480
too quickly

2283
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,360
or or a better way to put it as they

2284
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,120
once they've like observed a certain

2285
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,400
number of like

2286
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,440
lefts for example becomes really hard

2287
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,159
for it to

2288
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,120
unlearn that um which is different from

2289
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,000
what humans do

2290
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,600
humans tend to infer that there's a

2291
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,600
different context like okay no now it's

2292
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,080
the

2293
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,600
now it's a new context where right is

2294
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,000
better so it doesn't necessarily unlearn

2295
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,280
the original uh counts

2296
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,199
it instead sort of infers now i'm in a

2297
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:56,640
new state and i need to accrue

2298
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,880
different counts for that state um and

2299
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,080
that requires more complex

2300
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,719
models which can also be built just but

2301
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,320
couple couple little notes that that's

2302
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,320
kind of like humans using narrative

2303
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,960
to help reset local parameter

2304
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,480
estimations like oh well now it's a new

2305
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,040
day

2306
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,400
so now things that were unlikely

2307
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,560
yesterday now it can be likely today

2308
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:15,840
and also it relates to this question

2309
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,760
about the optimal learning rate in a

2310
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,840
mathematical or an analytical framework

2311
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,040
maybe one or

2312
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,040
some other number is quote optimal but

2313
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,560
then in a realized

2314
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,280
ecological setting it might be actually

2315
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:27,920
not

2316
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,520
the best solution in that setting

2317
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,080
yeah um so i mean yeah typically people

2318
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,679
talk about this in other literature as

2319
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:38,000
being like laden cause inference or leia

2320
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,199
like inferring the latent causes um

2321
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:42,800
behind things there's different latent

2322
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,080
cause it's kind of the same thing as

2323
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,280
saying there's a different context and

2324
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,800
therefore a different likelihood

2325
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,480
um but uh but yeah so so i'll just kind

2326
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,320
of you know go through this here you

2327
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,560
know kind of step by step so

2328
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,440
you know so i so i'm gonna set up right

2329
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,640
so i have

2330
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,679
um i have my big d and my little d

2331
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:05,280
here um and then the next thing i'm

2332
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:05,920
going to do

2333
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,000
is i'm doing this a little bit you know

2334
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,520
condensed is to just

2335
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,560
set the number of states here for each

2336
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,880
state factor so that's going to be the

2337
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,000
length of d1 and the length

2338
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,920
of d2 so this one's going to be the two

2339
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,199
contacts so there's going to be two

2340
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:20,080
states

2341
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,239
and this one's going to be the length of

2342
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:24,560
d2 which is going to be four states

2343
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,320
so at the end of the day this ns thing

2344
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,840
if you look on the right

2345
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,920
is just going to look like that 2 and 4.

2346
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:30,960
just one

2347
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,320
note there for those who are unfamiliar

2348
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:35,440
with matlab so at line 148 where ns

2349
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,440
is you put a little red dot like a stop

2350
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:38,560
sign and then

2351
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,040
you hit run which ran everything that we

2352
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,360
had just discussed from a clean slate

2353
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,840
up to that line and then it halted so

2354
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,440
that's what allowed us to actually

2355
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,120
instantiate all these variables we were

2356
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,239
just talking about

2357
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:52,960
and then you stepped just one line at a

2358
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:53,520
time

2359
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,080
so that you could run this line 148 with

2360
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,080
all of its prerequisites fulfilled so

2361
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,760
it's kind of like a break point in the

2362
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:00,400
program

2363
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:01,920
we took a breath and then we ran one

2364
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,120
line and so now we're going to go step

2365
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,560
by step

2366
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,480
yeah it just allows you to kind of see

2367
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,159
what it's doing step by step which is

2368
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:09,440
yeah it's helpful so sorry

2369
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,520
i should have said what plays and step

2370
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,360
and stuff like that um

2371
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,440
so so now that i've specified that i can

2372
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,960
put this little for loop thing which

2373
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,159
just says

2374
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:20,880
um for that for i equals one to the

2375
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:21,920
number of states

2376
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,880
for factor two um i'm just going to make

2377
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:25,520
it all

2378
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,400
the no hint this is just saying for all

2379
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,520
the matrices

2380
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,800
in a1 to start with um

2381
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,640
everything is just going to generate the

2382
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,719
no hint observation

2383
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:41,360
um so it will end up just looking

2384
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:45,199
like this where uh

2385
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,480
right so i just have so this is just

2386
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,480
saying um and i should say that

2387
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,800
the columns correspond to the first day

2388
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,080
factor so

2389
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,960
left context right context and these

2390
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,159
third the third

2391
01:18:58,159 --> 01:18:59,920
dimension here one two three four that's

2392
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,520
what corresponds to the

2393
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,040
second state factor which is the um

2394
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,480
the behavior so this is saying

2395
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,760
when i'm in the start state one each

2396
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:12,560
context

2397
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,920
is going to generate the no hint

2398
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,480
observation when i'm in the hint stay

2399
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,360
factor

2400
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,719
it's going to generate the no hint

2401
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:20,400
observation and so forth so i'm just

2402
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,760
starting it that way

2403
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,600
for ease to say that they're all that

2404
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,880
way but then what i'm going to do

2405
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,280
is i'm going to define this thing pha

2406
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,560
which is the probability

2407
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,239
of the hint being accurate

2408
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:35,920
and again this is just kind of to make

2409
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,280
things uh

2410
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:40,000
a little bit concise and convenient and

2411
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,360
then i'm going to replace

2412
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:44,080
that a2 because remember a2 means i'm in

2413
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,440
the hint state

2414
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,000
um and so i'm going to say when i'm in

2415
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,600
the hint state

2416
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,719
column one in column one here

2417
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:55,520
i'm gonna observe the machine left hint

2418
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,360
with some probability if i'm in the

2419
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,280
machine left state which is the left

2420
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,640
column

2421
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:04,080
and then one minus that for the no hint

2422
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,040
state

2423
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,600
and again if i'm in the right the right

2424
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,320
better

2425
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:11,040
context so the the right column here

2426
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,400
then it's going to be the reverse

2427
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,239
i'm going to observe the right machine

2428
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:15,840
with some probability

2429
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,480
just one one note on that ryan so people

2430
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,000
might look at this and wonder why didn't

2431
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,760
you just say hint or no hint instead of

2432
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,080
this one minus one equals zero

2433
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,000
and this is because as you've had it it

2434
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,600
generalizes to cues

2435
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,280
that are less than a hundred percent

2436
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,040
accurate so then you could have the

2437
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,800
probability of the hint being accurate

2438
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,480
to being 90 or less or some other value

2439
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,320
and so if you have a probabilistic

2440
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,320
learning task you can model it

2441
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,920
with this exact framework just by

2442
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,520
changing pha equals

2443
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,080
point something rather than reimagining

2444
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,800
the entire

2445
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,719
matrix multiplication which is really

2446
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,159
the hard part

2447
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:52,960
yeah exactly so so if i step through

2448
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,360
that then in this case i've set pha to 1

2449
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,960
which just means the hint is completely

2450
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,159
accurate

2451
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:01,520
so now if i look at a1 again

2452
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,320
then it's going to look like this where

2453
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,040
all the other

2454
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,600
behavioral states so in the start state

2455
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,600
in choosing the left state or choosing a

2456
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,120
left machine and choosing the right

2457
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,560
machine

2458
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,520
they those still generate row one here

2459
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,920
both of both contacts do because the no

2460
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:18,719
hint

2461
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:22,000
but if i'm in state two which is the

2462
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,719
hint behavioral state then if i'm in the

2463
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:25,920
left machine

2464
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,560
or if i'm in the left state then i will

2465
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,440
observe

2466
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,719
the left is better hint um with

2467
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:34,880
probability one and if i'm in the right

2468
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,080
column here the right

2469
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,560
context is better state then i'm going

2470
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,760
to observe

2471
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,199
the right hint observation so the bottom

2472
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:43,840
row here

2473
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,920
with 100 probability so in other words

2474
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,360
if i observe this thing then i'm going

2475
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,719
to know for sure

2476
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:51,360
that i i'm now in the left better

2477
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,480
context

2478
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,840
um but if again if i made this like

2479
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,800
0.8.2.2

2480
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,880
then that would just mean you know

2481
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,800
there's some probability that the hints

2482
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:01,600
gonna

2483
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,280
give me the wrong answer um so that's

2484
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,280
so that's all that is so remember the

2485
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,080
first state factor is the columns the

2486
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,360
second state factor

2487
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:15,040
is going to be the third dimension

2488
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:18,080
that's kind of key

2489
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,719
so now what i'm going to do is i'm going

2490
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:24,400
to define the

2491
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,840
second output modality so this is

2492
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,520
another thing that's important

2493
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,639
is that the uh the number here for a

2494
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:33,120
that's in the braces that corresponds to

2495
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,159
the outcome

2496
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:37,360
modality um so the first

2497
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,880
set of observations i can get is

2498
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,320
no hint machine left hint and machine

2499
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:44,960
right hint

2500
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,880
so that's one set of observations that

2501
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,400
we call like an observation or an

2502
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,000
outcome modality

2503
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,120
um now for a two the second

2504
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,520
observation or outcome modality the

2505
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:56,880
possible observations

2506
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,000
are null loss

2507
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,920
and win um so what this is saying

2508
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,199
is for the first two behavioral states

2509
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:09,280
for i equals one and two

2510
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:13,040
um the uh so being in the start state or

2511
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,480
the hint state is always going to

2512
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:15,199
generate

2513
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:16,960
the null observation so it's not going

2514
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,239
to generate a loss or a win

2515
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:24,880
now after that if i step through here

2516
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,600
i can set what i just called p win so

2517
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,960
the probability of winning

2518
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:32,480
and i set that to be 0.8 and this is the

2519
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,639
part where the actual reinforcement or

2520
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:35,679
reward learning

2521
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:39,520
comes in um because what i can do

2522
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,280
is i can say okay if i'm in

2523
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,639
the left choose the left machine state

2524
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:46,960
so

2525
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:50,560
3 then

2526
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,760
the probability of winning the

2527
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,800
probability of losing

2528
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,000
is 1 minus

2529
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,239
p win and the probability of winning in

2530
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:03,199
the right one

2531
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:04,719
or the probability of losing in the

2532
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:07,280
right one if i choose the right one

2533
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,080
is high right which makes sense right

2534
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,280
because if i'm in the left better

2535
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,320
context

2536
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,719
then if i choose the right column right

2537
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:16,880
if i choose the right

2538
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,280
machine then i'm most likely going to

2539
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,599
lose

2540
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:25,679
in contrast if i'm in the

2541
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:29,679
right better context

2542
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:32,639
and i choose uh if i choose the right

2543
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:34,159
machine and i'm in the right better

2544
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:35,440
context

2545
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,600
then the right column here should

2546
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,040
generate a win

2547
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,880
with high probability this is just

2548
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,560
saying if i choose the right machine

2549
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,199
that's the four and i'm in the right con

2550
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:46,960
right better context which is the right

2551
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,000
column

2552
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,880
then i have a high probability of

2553
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,639
winning

2554
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:54,480
and vice versa up here if i choose the

2555
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,840
left one

2556
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,920
again just to talk about how this is the

2557
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,520
minimal example we're talking about

2558
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,920
two options with the two slot machines

2559
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,360
there could be more options

2560
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,199
we're talking about how much it costs to

2561
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:07,360
get the hint and how much it costs when

2562
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:08,719
you win or how much you receive when you

2563
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:09,120
win

2564
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,800
that's a parameter you can change how

2565
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,480
accurate the hint is you could have a

2566
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,000
perfectly accurate hint that sends you

2567
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:14,960
to the slot machine

2568
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,800
that wins 100 of the time so the

2569
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,080
probability of winning

2570
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,080
can now be changed so then you can say

2571
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,760
okay i'm imagining a situation where

2572
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,600
there's a perfect messenger with a hint

2573
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,360
and then it's free to visit that person

2574
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,280
and then it's 100 likely which slot

2575
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,639
machine is the winning one

2576
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:30,880
or you can imagine these more gray zone

2577
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,880
scenarios where different things are

2578
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,440
associated with each other in a less

2579
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,120
direct way or there's more than two

2580
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:37,679
options

2581
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:39,120
just for those who are like seeing this

2582
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,120
one example for the first time

2583
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,639
this is kind of like the tip of the

2584
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:45,280
iceberg of a big big family of different

2585
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,800
kinds of models that have a lot more

2586
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,880
options and a lot more nuance

2587
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,840
yeah i mean you could have you know 20

2588
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,199
outcome modalities and

2589
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,440
10 state factors if you wanted to it

2590
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:56,880
would just mean that like there'd be a

2591
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,400
fourth dimension for the third state

2592
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,679
factor and a fifth dimension for the

2593
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:01,199
fourth state factor and you know it'll

2594
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:03,280
just get really big really fast

2595
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,960
um but so now that i've done this

2596
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,880
because i set the probability of winning

2597
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:07,920
to 2.8

2598
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,480
um given that you're you know in the

2599
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,280
correct

2600
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:15,199
context then a2 will look like this

2601
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:18,719
so this just says if i choose

2602
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:20,639
if i'm in the start state i don't

2603
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:22,320
observe a i never observe a win or a

2604
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,760
loss if i'm in the hit state

2605
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,199
i never observe a win or a loss um

2606
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:31,199
if i'm if i choose the left option

2607
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,840
the left machine then i will win with

2608
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:34,880
point eight

2609
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,480
and lose with 0.2 and the opposite

2610
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,159
for if i choose the right one right i'll

2611
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:41,600
lose with 0.8 if i

2612
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,080
if i choose the left machine and i'm in

2613
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:44,880
the right

2614
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,280
context and if i choose the right

2615
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,000
machine

2616
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,600
so state 4 here then the probability of

2617
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:52,159
winning

2618
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:55,040
is point eight so the third row here is

2619
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,239
winning right

2620
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:59,760
um and point two and vice versa so this

2621
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,280
is just defining the probability of

2622
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,320
winning

2623
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,480
given your choice given whether it's the

2624
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:08,000
left better or write better context

2625
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,360
um and i know that's a mouthful but uh

2626
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:15,199
yeah um so then finally

2627
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:18,000
um and you know this isn't really all

2628
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,840
that practically interesting

2629
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:22,480
but it's important to include is is that

2630
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,000
what this just says

2631
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,600
um so outcome modality three is just the

2632
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,520
agent's own behavior

2633
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:33,440
so what this means is every single time

2634
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:36,960
it makes a choice it observes itself

2635
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,239
making that choice and all that does is

2636
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:42,320
make the agent completely confident

2637
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,520
about what it did um but you could

2638
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:46,159
imagine

2639
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:48,320
if somebody weren't aware of their own

2640
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,920
decision-making behavior

2641
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,520
you could imagine that might lead to

2642
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,360
decision-making that's not in line with

2643
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:54,880
what you would do if you could observe

2644
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,560
your behavior

2645
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,480
yeah so you know i mean if you if you

2646
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,400
get rid of this then in some cases the

2647
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:00,880
agent

2648
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,400
yeah won't be all that confident what he

2649
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,920
did and so therefore it'll be hard for

2650
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:04,800
him to

2651
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:08,080
uh hard to learn what actions were the

2652
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,199
right one because we won't know like

2653
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:10,639
what it shows basically

2654
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:12,560
uh it'd be like choosing a slot machine

2655
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:15,360
blind um

2656
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,000
i just want to jump in with a question

2657
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:18,800
about my

2658
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,639
motor systems context so for example if

2659
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:22,960
i'm studying sensory motor integration

2660
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,840
and i'm measuring motor cortex signals

2661
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,520
from neurons and motor cortex

2662
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:30,480
and i'm measuring uh outputs such as the

2663
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,360
kinematics

2664
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,199
the kinetic forces that are generated

2665
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:35,600
and the emg signals in the periphery

2666
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,560
i could then use that that context to

2667
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,120
say

2668
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,040
i could specify it as either one one or

2669
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,120
a zero one for example if i didn't

2670
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,360
think that it was a capable observing

2671
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,800
its past history or

2672
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,679
its its decision states in the form of

2673
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:51,760
some kind of a sensory blockade

2674
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:54,320
uh related to my experiments would that

2675
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,080
be a practical application would does

2676
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:56,639
that

2677
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:59,280
have face validity in this context given

2678
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,040
that i'm measuring those signals

2679
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:04,000
uh one thing that just collect with flag

2680
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,840
generally speaking in motor control

2681
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,040
domains you're working with like

2682
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,040
continuous quantities right

2683
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,440
right and that's why you use things like

2684
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,960
kalman filters etc

2685
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,880
as your models um i'm not sure to what

2686
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:17,679
extent

2687
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:19,280
a partially observable markov decision

2688
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,480
process would actually be the

2689
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,760
appropriate generative model for the

2690
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:22,800
situation

2691
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,320
i think it would be if you want to model

2692
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:27,520
like the decision making processes

2693
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,960
observ for motor control

2694
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,560
so am i going to move my arm to left or

2695
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,480
the right that is a discrete decision

2696
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,679
but actually measuring motor control and

2697
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:38,719
a lot of those things that you're

2698
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:40,719
talking about those continuous signals

2699
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:42,960
i'm not actually sure p o mdp is the

2700
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,400
appropriate generative model

2701
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,159
but for example if i thought that i had

2702
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:48,480
a state space that consisted of a

2703
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,800
a fixed point or any kind of you know

2704
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,719
however i'm abstracting those continuous

2705
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:55,920
processes into the realm of you know a

2706
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,360
discrete state

2707
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:00,800
uh just glossing over that

2708
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,520
this kind of model could maybe uh

2709
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:04,880
account for that

2710
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:07,040
or do you usually use in that way in any

2711
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,719
i mean in any case you know where where

2712
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:10,480
signal is technically continuous

2713
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,199
i mean you know to use these sorts of

2714
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,320
models right you're going to have to

2715
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,960
just pick some

2716
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:18,080
quasi-arbitrary or maybe justify in some

2717
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:18,639
sense

2718
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:21,280
a way to kind of bin you know bin time

2719
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,120
right you'd have to desperatize

2720
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,920
time in some in some way um you know the

2721
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,560
signal was

2722
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,360
x for these three milliseconds and now

2723
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,239
it changed to y

2724
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:31,679
these next three milliseconds that'd be

2725
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:33,040
some kind of like funny average or

2726
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,480
something like that

2727
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:37,360
um i guess i guess the you know

2728
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,800
potential concern

2729
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,679
here is also that like like there has to

2730
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:43,600
be some way to to link

2731
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:47,280
the uh the the states as here as you're

2732
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,639
kind of bending them

2733
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:51,600
to some sort of policy selection process

2734
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,880
presumably

2735
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:55,120
um so no i'm not completely sure at

2736
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,480
least i can't imagine

2737
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:57,920
exactly how that would work it's almost

2738
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,600
like this one is about the agent

2739
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,520
deciding which way to walk

2740
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:02,880
and then maybe there's some

2741
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,960
proprioceptive feedback but let's

2742
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,400
think about what this decision making

2743
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,560
example is and then wonder about where

2744
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,239
the motor and where these other

2745
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:11,840
modalities and the continuous signal

2746
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,600
processing also interesting

2747
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,199
let's just walk through this discrete

2748
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:17,679
time discrete opportunity space

2749
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:19,840
model and then we talked about like in

2750
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:20,800
active infrastream

2751
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,880
eight with alec chance about what does

2752
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,320
it look like to move active inference

2753
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:25,440
from a discrete

2754
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,760
into a continuous space so it's the

2755
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:28,880
kinds of things that are

2756
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,880
actively being developed and it sounds

2757
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,760
exciting about the motor example max

2758
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,760
yeah i mean i mean so there are you know

2759
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:36,880
and you know

2760
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:39,040
thomas parr has done you know a bunch of

2761
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,960
this like we use mixed models right

2762
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:41,840
where the top

2763
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:44,000
the top layer is a discrete state space

2764
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,080
markov decision process model like this

2765
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,840
you know deciding left arm right arm but

2766
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,480
then it feeds into a continuous

2767
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:54,159
uh state space below um that actually

2768
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:55,760
controls the dynamics of the movement

2769
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,320
itself based on the decision

2770
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:01,440
um my guess is it would be more uh

2771
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,639
something more like that would be better

2772
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:06,080
you know that being said these sorts of

2773
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,440
these sorts of models are much more

2774
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:08,239
about

2775
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:10,639
you know behavior and choice i mean when

2776
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:12,000
you're talking about neural responses

2777
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
i would think that would come more be

2778
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,679
more useful in these models to

2779
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:18,159
to use them to predict the neural

2780
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:20,239
responses that you would get

2781
01:32:20,239 --> 01:32:22,880
when a person does x versus y and see if

2782
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,480
that matches with

2783
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:27,840
the firing rates that you see

2784
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,679
there's a paper on the mix model thing

2785
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:30,880
there's a paper i think it's called like

2786
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,239
discrete movements

2787
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:33,840
to decisions and back again or something

2788
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:34,960
along those lines it's in your

2789
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:35,760
computation

2790
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:37,760
um yeah i think it deals with all the

2791
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,040
formal issues that kind of arise with

2792
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,080
this

2793
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:43,280
yeah thanks about it okay so

2794
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:46,639
just for the sake of time here um

2795
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:48,400
so so again what i did here and this is

2796
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,920
for the agent observing

2797
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:53,040
their own behavior all i did was i made

2798
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:53,840
it like this

2799
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,400
right so this is just saying when the

2800
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,159
agent chose

2801
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:01,600
uh uh state one

2802
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,440
then it observes the observation

2803
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:04,880
associated with state one

2804
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,840
right row one with a hundred percent

2805
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,159
probability

2806
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:11,360
when it was in the hint state then it

2807
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,199
observes that it was in the hidden state

2808
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:14,400
row two with a hundred percent

2809
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,719
probability and so forth so it's just

2810
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:17,679
providing

2811
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:19,520
maximally precise evidence so that it

2812
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,280
knows what it did

2813
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,960
um so now notice that this was

2814
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,560
big a right so that's the generative

2815
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,000
process

2816
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,520
if i wanted to if we wanted to do reward

2817
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,360
learning right if we wanted it to learn

2818
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:36,000
p when the what the reward probabilities

2819
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:36,960
are

2820
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:40,159
then we'd have to set little a here um

2821
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:42,639
and you might start out just sort of

2822
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:43,760
making big a

2823
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:47,440
making a little a equivalent to big a

2824
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:52,000
um to start with and

2825
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,280
and uh multiplying each of the values

2826
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,880
in little a by a big number like 200

2827
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,800
and what that does is it just makes it

2828
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,800
so

2829
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,400
the agent is really really really

2830
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,400
confident about

2831
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:09,440
um its beliefs um um

2832
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,719
in a in that are associated with big a

2833
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:14,960
um and what that does is it just

2834
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,639
prevents learning

2835
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:19,120
for anything you don't want it to learn

2836
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,400
so if you multiply this thing by really

2837
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,080
big number then it won't learn anything

2838
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,600
even though technically it's learning

2839
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,679
because it's just already too confident

2840
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:28,560
um but then what you could do is for

2841
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,960
anything that you do want it to learn

2842
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,520
you can just redefine those with really

2843
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,560
small numbers

2844
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:37,679
right so you can say a3 here so the

2845
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:39,600
probability of choosing

2846
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,320
uh of winning choose if you choose the

2847
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,600
left machine

2848
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:47,360
you know is 0.5 so just 0.5 is all

2849
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:47,920
around

2850
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,560
right or 0.25 or whatever so this is

2851
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,800
just saying that the agent would start

2852
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:56,000
with uh completely imprecise beliefs

2853
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,080
about whether it would win or lose

2854
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,239
depending on what it chose depending on

2855
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:01,280
context

2856
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:02,960
so it would so this is what you would do

2857
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,719
you'd kind of turn on little a

2858
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:06,239
if you wanted it to learn the reward

2859
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:07,840
probabilities but we're not doing that

2860
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,040
here

2861
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:11,360
so we're just showing this as examples

2862
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,800
and same thing if you wanted to you

2863
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,080
could do the same thing but for

2864
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:17,199
outcome modality one um to have it learn

2865
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:19,199
like the accuracy of the hint

2866
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:20,480
um so again these are just kind of

2867
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,400
commented on examples if you wanted to

2868
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,400
do that kind of thing

2869
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:28,000
um so now we've defined the the

2870
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
likelihood matrix right the a matrix

2871
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,239
like what states generate what outcomes

2872
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:34,480
with what probabilities now we're moving

2873
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:35,360
on into b

2874
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,080
which are the transition probabilities

2875
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:39,760
um

2876
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,520
and remember that there's one of these

2877
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,119
per state factor per action um

2878
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:49,600
so and this is what i showed before that

2879
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:50,480
for b1

2880
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,639
so for state factor one the context

2881
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:54,960
there's only one action quote unquote

2882
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,560
and it's just an identity matrix this

2883
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,719
just says the left better context

2884
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:03,119
never changes within a trial um

2885
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:05,679
and again i showed this before for the

2886
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:07,600
second state factor

2887
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,520
the transitions there's four different

2888
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,280
possible transitions

2889
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,119
transitioning from state one to any of

2890
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:15,040
the other states so just to be clear

2891
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:16,080
here

2892
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,159
these transition matrices the columns

2893
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:19,920
are the states you're in now

2894
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,440
and the rows of the states that you

2895
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,840
would move to so this is saying from any

2896
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:24,639
state

2897
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:27,679
you could move to state one um you know

2898
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:30,159
from any state you could move to state

2899
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:31,679
two et cetera

2900
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,800
um so you end up having you know

2901
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:38,159
one two three four different

2902
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:39,920
actions for that state factor four

2903
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,280
different possible transitions

2904
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,800
so now the next thing that we do is um

2905
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,800
we move to the preference distribution

2906
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,639
so that's c right so this is what the

2907
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:55,840
agent

2908
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,600
wants or what the agent finds rewarding

2909
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,560
and how rewarding the agent finds it

2910
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,280
so to do that initially we just with no

2911
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,000
we just say

2912
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,199
what are the different number of

2913
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:07,280
outcomes for each outcome modality

2914
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,239
and that just looks at the size of the

2915
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:11,440
row dimensions

2916
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:14,719
in a so

2917
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:16,719
if i do that and again this is just

2918
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:18,159
using this you know

2919
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:20,480
size function which is just you know

2920
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:21,920
again to make it

2921
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,719
more uh convenient or generalizable so

2922
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:26,159
if i do that

2923
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:27,760
then no is going to look like that

2924
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,440
that's just saying i have three i have

2925
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:31,040
three different outcome

2926
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:34,480
modalities one is no hair

2927
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:37,520
null no hint and hint one is

2928
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:41,280
null lose and win and one is

2929
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,119
the agent observing its own behavior

2930
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:44,639
right observing action one two three or

2931
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:46,840
four

2932
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:49,280
um many people have asked

2933
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:52,080
in the past weeks about dimensionality

2934
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,199
of

2935
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:54,719
not to go into the markov blanket

2936
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:56,719
discussion but the dimensionality of

2937
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:58,080
observations

2938
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,480
and how we talk about different kinds of

2939
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,360
outcomes

2940
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,840
different kinds of senses for example

2941
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,360
and it's almost looking like

2942
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:08,080
it's just about the way it's specified

2943
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:08,560
so

2944
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:11,440
the hint could be in your ear and the

2945
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:12,960
observation could be visual

2946
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,320
or something and so you could get

2947
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:15,760
philosophical and ask whether there's

2948
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:16,000
really

2949
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,920
one or two different sensory modalities

2950
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:20,080
but in the context of this

2951
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:22,000
inferential model that we're writing

2952
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,360
it's almost like those things don't

2953
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,639
really matter they're just

2954
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:28,320
variables that are observed yeah i mean

2955
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,239
so again we call these modality outcome

2956
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:32,239
modalities so in this case there's three

2957
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,000
right so like you said the hint this

2958
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,520
could be the auditory modality and

2959
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,199
there's three things that could hear

2960
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:39,280
this could be the visual modality and

2961
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,560
it's the three

2962
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,880
whether it wins or loses or hasn't seen

2963
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,880
that yet right this could be visual

2964
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:46,320
and this fourth thing the third one

2965
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,920
could be proprioception right it could

2966
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,000
be observing or feeling what it did

2967
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,280
i mean in this case it's probably also

2968
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:52,560
somewhat visual right it observes what

2969
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:53,520
it does but

2970
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,920
um you get the point yeah so yeah so

2971
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:56,639
there's just a

2972
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:58,960
nice factorized you know dimensionality

2973
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:00,080
for each

2974
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:03,760
modality yeah um

2975
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:07,199
but okay so now i've

2976
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:09,040
what i've done is i've started out by

2977
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,199
just putting zeros

2978
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:14,080
in the c matrix the preference

2979
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:14,880
distribution

2980
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,520
for each outcome modality so this is

2981
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:19,440
just saying for outcome modality one so

2982
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:20,639
the hint

2983
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:23,440
the agent has no preferences and i

2984
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:24,159
should say the

2985
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:26,800
the rows or the observations um for the

2986
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:27,280
you know

2987
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,840
null hint no hint i mean the columns are

2988
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:30,320
time

2989
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:32,800
so this is saying at time one the agent

2990
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:33,760
doesn't care

2991
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,760
whether it gets the hint or not in terms

2992
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,040
of rewardingness

2993
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:38,800
um same thing at time two same thing at

2994
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:41,280
time three and i've just done that for

2995
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,840
all three how come modalities to start

2996
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,760
with

2997
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:47,600
the only thing that we want to add

2998
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:50,159
preferences for

2999
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:53,440
is the win lose observations

3000
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,560
um so in this case so that's c

3001
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:59,199
for outcome modality 2 which is the win

3002
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:00,560
loss thing here

3003
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:01,800
so what i've done again for

3004
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,840
generalizability is i've set this

3005
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:04,639
parameter

3006
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:07,199
la that is called loss of version and

3007
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:09,040
i've set this parameter rs

3008
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:11,600
which is that reward seeking thing which

3009
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,679
i just defined above as rs1

3010
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:14,960
and again that's just convenience so i

3011
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:16,560
don't have to go down here to reset it

3012
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:19,040
every time

3013
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:22,480
so i define these just for again just

3014
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:23,760
for convenience

3015
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,800
and then what i say here is

3016
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,560
so the observations again are no lose

3017
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,159
when so this is at time

3018
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:32,880
zero the agent doesn't care whether it

3019
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,560
observes a null a loss or a win and

3020
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:35,199
that's just because

3021
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:38,320
it can't observe anything but a null

3022
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:41,920
at time two it just prefers losing

3023
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:46,320
with a value of again negative one here

3024
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:49,440
for both time two and time three

3025
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,360
but here's a little bit of a trick is

3026
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,199
that i define

3027
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:56,400
the preference for winning

3028
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:59,679
as rs at time two and remember that rs

3029
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:01,119
is four right now because that's what we

3030
01:41:01,119 --> 01:41:02,960
set it above then at time

3031
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,119
three i set the preference as rs divided

3032
01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:06,560
by two

3033
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:10,239
um so what that ultimately means

3034
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:13,360
is that um

3035
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,800
the this state factor will look like

3036
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:17,199
this

3037
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:19,119
or i mean sorry this this preference

3038
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:20,960
distribution will look like this saying

3039
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,520
it dislikes losing equally at each time

3040
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:24,080
but it

3041
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,000
wants but it gets more reward for

3042
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,360
winning at time two than at time three

3043
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:31,520
um and so that's our that's our

3044
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,280
preference distribution

3045
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:36,320
um and uh this is just all

3046
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,159
that's basically it this is all in how

3047
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:39,520
the details of how

3048
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,760
the sketched out scenario okay four

3049
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,280
dollars but then you got to wait 20

3050
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:44,159
minutes and

3051
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:46,719
however your scenario is this is about

3052
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:47,520
the detail

3053
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:50,560
in matrix form of how the payoffs work

3054
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,000
and so it could be minus one or you

3055
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,760
might ask if another number is

3056
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,119
appropriate there

3057
01:41:55,119 --> 01:41:57,280
but it's kind of like that's the detail

3058
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:59,199
level that's the applications and that's

3059
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:00,080
where we hope to see

3060
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:02,159
a lot of people exploring different

3061
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:03,920
scenarios so that we can understand

3062
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:07,280
better yeah and so and so you'll see

3063
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:09,760
that when we actually do the like

3064
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:10,320
fitting

3065
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,480
like parameter fitting to behavior you

3066
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,159
know one thing we'll do is we'll fit

3067
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:14,639
this

3068
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:16,560
right so for some people rs might be

3069
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,400
like eight and for other people it might

3070
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,679
be like two

3071
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:22,800
um so you you find this value for each

3072
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,320
person that best explains or

3073
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:27,760
reproduces their behavior um

3074
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:29,440
i mean you gave that example last week

3075
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:31,119
right in the substance abuse example

3076
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:32,239
where that actually has really

3077
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:33,119
meaningful

3078
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:34,560
or that parameter has a really

3079
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:37,760
meaningful interpretation

3080
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:40,239
yeah exactly um because it has to do

3081
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:40,960
with

3082
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,119
in the case of an explore exploit task

3083
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:44,800
the lower rs is

3084
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,040
basically means the more people the more

3085
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,560
like someone is

3086
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:50,639
driven to explore you know before they

3087
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:51,600
kind of

3088
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,199
jump to conclusions about which one's

3089
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:55,119
the best and just keep choosing that one

3090
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:57,199
it makes me makes me think about maybe

3091
01:42:57,199 --> 01:42:58,159
in the um

3092
01:42:58,159 --> 01:42:59,920
substance example or another example

3093
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,360
it's like if we're going to have a

3094
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:03,520
society that rewards good behavior and

3095
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:04,159
punishes

3096
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:06,159
negative behavior or something on some

3097
01:43:06,159 --> 01:43:08,000
issue do you go with

3098
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,600
here's how much you get positive and

3099
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,440
here's how much the punishment should be

3100
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:13,679
should be small punishment versus large

3101
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:15,040
these kinds of questions which are

3102
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,800
really important at the individual and

3103
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,159
the group level

3104
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:20,080
not that this is even close to the

3105
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,760
answer but it's almost like it's a way

3106
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,360
for us to start talking about

3107
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:25,360
how much do we value and how much do

3108
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,199
individuals need different blends of

3109
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:28,159
these different

3110
01:43:28,159 --> 01:43:30,719
attributes so really a good way to talk

3111
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:32,239
about this

3112
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:35,679
yeah absolutely um you know and so

3113
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:38,320
like uh oh so one thing that i did want

3114
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:39,440
to clarify here

3115
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:40,960
is you'll notice that you know these are

3116
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,320
supposed to be probability distributions

3117
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:42,960
right

3118
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:45,600
c you know each column here is supposed

3119
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:46,560
to be

3120
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:48,639
something that adds up to to one and

3121
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:49,840
technically we work with log

3122
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,119
probabilities

3123
01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:55,119
um so uh you know negative one and four

3124
01:43:55,119 --> 01:43:57,119
and negative one and two obviously don't

3125
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:58,320
uh aren't

3126
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:01,119
probabilities or log probabilities um so

3127
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:02,560
in practice

3128
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:06,159
um these each column here is softmaxed

3129
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:09,679
and then each element is logged

3130
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:11,360
which is which is how you end up with

3131
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,840
the actual log probability distributions

3132
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,440
that define the preferences when they're

3133
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:18,000
actually used in the code

3134
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,239
and i show that i show an example of the

3135
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:21,520
numbers they turn into in the

3136
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:23,679
in the or we show them in the in the

3137
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:24,560
paper

3138
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,840
um so you know last

3139
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:30,480
kind of really central thing is to

3140
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:31,520
define the

3141
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:34,800
policies so here i'm just going to use

3142
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,119
np here to define the number of policies

3143
01:44:37,119 --> 01:44:38,639
i want to allow

3144
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:41,360
and here the nf thing is just the number

3145
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:43,440
of actual state factors

3146
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:46,639
um and that will just allow me in a

3147
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:48,080
generalizable way

3148
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:51,840
to say that v has

3149
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,639
uh t minus one rows right so it's gonna

3150
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:55,280
be

3151
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:58,400
uh the number of actions minus

3152
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,159
the number of times because you have to

3153
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:01,679
move from time one to time two time two

3154
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:03,600
to time three so there's always

3155
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:06,719
one less action possibility than there

3156
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:07,199
are

3157
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:10,000
times in a trial um and the number of

3158
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,840
policies again is going to be columns a

3159
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,199
number of state factors is going to be

3160
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:14,800
that third dimension

3161
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,639
so i can start by just defining that as

3162
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:17,840
ones

3163
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:21,520
um and i can you know keep it that way i

3164
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,040
just wrote this explicitly so you can

3165
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:23,600
see it

3166
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,440
and this just means again it can only

3167
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,040
choose to stay in the same context every

3168
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,400
time so that's not something the agent

3169
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,239
knows or can control

3170
01:45:30,239 --> 01:45:32,400
whereas for state factor two i can

3171
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,639
define each of these possible policies

3172
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:36,320
stay in the start state take the hint

3173
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,679
and then choose the left

3174
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:39,440
machine you know take the hint choose

3175
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,199
the right machine

3176
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:42,960
choose the left machine and then go back

3177
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:44,320
to start choose the right machine and go

3178
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:45,360
back to start

3179
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,040
and i you know i describe what each of

3180
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,239
those means and this kind of one two

3181
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:49,760
three four five thing down here

3182
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:53,679
um so then if we want to and i'm not

3183
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:54,960
going to do this here

3184
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:58,080
um you could specify e which is the

3185
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:00,320
kind of like habits you know essentially

3186
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,760
it's just a pry over policies that

3187
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:02,560
biases you

3188
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:03,920
towards choosing one thing versus

3189
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:07,040
another and it's just one

3190
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:08,639
is in in the previous active inference

3191
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:10,159
streams we talked about that as the

3192
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:11,600
field of affordances

3193
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:12,960
for those who are connecting it to the

3194
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,760
ecological psychology or to the um in

3195
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:18,320
activism

3196
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:26,880
the prior the prior on what can be done

3197
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:27,360
among

3198
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,760
policies is the affordances of the

3199
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,360
organism in their niche

3200
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,119
so if you don't have the object it's not

3201
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:35,280
going to be a policy under consideration

3202
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:38,560
and so e is this mathematical device

3203
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:42,159
that's going to be weighting policies by

3204
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:45,679
their habit basically excellence is a

3205
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:46,480
habit

3206
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:49,119
that kind of thing

3207
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:52,239
yeah i mean i i guess like i mean

3208
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:53,199
technically

3209
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:55,440
what you're doing is you know like the

3210
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,199
when this makes sense functionally is is

3211
01:46:57,199 --> 01:46:58,800
when you're learning it

3212
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,159
so so what you would do with little e um

3213
01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:04,000
and so this might start out

3214
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,400
you know flat right with just counts of

3215
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:08,960
one for the dirichlet distribution

3216
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:11,840
but if you choose the same policy 20

3217
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,520
times let's say you choose policy 3

3218
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:16,639
20 times then this one this

3219
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:19,920
third one here would become a 20.

3220
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:21,440
and so that just means that you'd start

3221
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:23,119
out with a strong bias now

3222
01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:25,840
for choosing policy three because you've

3223
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:27,920
chosen it a bunch of times before

3224
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:31,600
um and that's um an optimal thing to do

3225
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,639
under the assumption that option three

3226
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:36,480
was the one that continued to have the

3227
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,400
lowest expected free energy every time

3228
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,639
right so if in this model based way

3229
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:42,800
based on minimizing expected free energy

3230
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:44,400
you succeeded over and over again when

3231
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:45,840
you chose option three

3232
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,280
then it makes sense to build up this

3233
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:49,520
kind of bias

3234
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:51,520
so that you don't actually have to work

3235
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:53,360
that hard cognitively to just keep doing

3236
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:54,560
the thing that's right once you build up

3237
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:57,280
a prior that's going to keep being right

3238
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:00,639
so i guess i can see how if you

3239
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:02,800
do the same sorts of things in a given

3240
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,480
niche over and over again then you

3241
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,520
develop priors

3242
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,880
that bias you toward doing the things

3243
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,639
that are successful in that niche and if

3244
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:09,199
something's

3245
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:10,960
if something's never been if somebody's

3246
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,480
ever been observed then

3247
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:14,080
it's unlikely it takes a different mode

3248
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:15,840
of operation outside this script

3249
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,520
if something's never been observed for

3250
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,760
it to be considered

3251
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,840
this is just a basic they know the pop

3252
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,159
that's why you initiate with a non-zero

3253
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:26,800
value because it's something that could

3254
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,159
happen

3255
01:48:28,159 --> 01:48:30,000
yeah yeah yeah no that's true if you set

3256
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,080
a zero anywhere in in e

3257
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:33,760
then it's it's as though they don't have

3258
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:35,199
that option um

3259
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:37,440
yeah that's true um one other thing to

3260
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:39,520
say is just like

3261
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,520
agents can get stuck if you have

3262
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,280
non-stationary environments

3263
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:45,520
so say you have a hundred trials of one

3264
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:46,320
thing

3265
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:49,440
and then you switch contexts

3266
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:52,879
the agent will probably be stuck

3267
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,199
um and so i know it's just useful with

3268
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:56,719
all of these parameters

3269
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:59,119
they have kind of we can have our

3270
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:00,960
favorite interpretations related to like

3271
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,800
ecological psychology or whatever but

3272
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,400
i think it's always useful to kind of

3273
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:06,480
consider them functionally and use them

3274
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:07,920
kind of

3275
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,600
appropriately for this for whatever

3276
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,679
situation it is you're modeling

3277
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:14,239
yeah like that's the thing is you know

3278
01:49:14,239 --> 01:49:16,400
the the most useful places with this and

3279
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:18,239
say like computational psychiatry are

3280
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:18,880
that

3281
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,040
if you have the right set of experiences

3282
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:22,159
in these models

3283
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:24,320
and you get stuck doing what's

3284
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,320
technically base optimal given your past

3285
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:27,360
experience

3286
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:29,840
but that like makes you really really

3287
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:31,360
maladaptive in what you're

3288
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:34,400
doing uh in the new context that you're

3289
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:35,040
you're in

3290
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:36,400
right so you can get stuck in really

3291
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,320
maladaptive places in parameter space

3292
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:39,760
that could lead to

3293
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:41,520
symptoms that look like psychiatric

3294
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,440
symptoms for example

3295
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:46,400
um so i mean this is this kind of idea

3296
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:47,040
you know like

3297
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,800
philip shortenbeck has a paper on this

3298
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:51,599
as like you know uh

3299
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:53,599
optimal inference and sub-optimal models

3300
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:55,520
i think but uh

3301
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:56,639
the whole point is you're doing the

3302
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:58,960
optimal thing but your model is wrong

3303
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:01,599
right um outside the optimal thing under

3304
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:03,360
the assumption that your model is right

3305
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:06,000
just outside of this model stream which

3306
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:06,960
is really

3307
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,040
amazing and i hope it will continue we

3308
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:10,719
would also like to feature these kinds

3309
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:11,199
of

3310
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:12,480
direct discussions about the

3311
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,480
computational psychiatry

3312
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:16,080
so this is awesome with a walkthrough in

3313
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,360
the code it's going to be helpful for a

3314
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:18,960
lot of people who are learning that

3315
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:21,360
and then let's table and find the right

3316
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:22,800
time to talk about these issues because

3317
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:23,760
it's really awesome

3318
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:27,040
what you're describing yeah you know i

3319
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:27,760
mean obviously

3320
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,840
computational psychiatry is what i do in

3321
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,840
practice right so yeah i'd love to

3322
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:34,880
um okay so finally there's a bunch of

3323
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:36,480
kind of additional parameters

3324
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:38,560
right so we talked about learning rate

3325
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:41,440
um which here we're just setting to 0.5

3326
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:44,800
for you know arbitrarily um

3327
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:47,520
beta this is the expected free energy

3328
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:48,719
precision

3329
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:51,119
so it controls essentially how confident

3330
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:52,639
the agent is

3331
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:56,639
in uh its expected free energy estimates

3332
01:50:56,639 --> 01:51:00,239
um so if this value is low or sorry if

3333
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:00,960
this value is

3334
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:04,000
high that means that the agent is really

3335
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
unconfident in its expected free energy

3336
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,280
estimates

3337
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:09,840
and when that's the case then behavior

3338
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:10,880
will be

3339
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:14,080
a lot more random unless the agent has

3340
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,520
strong habits

3341
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,280
if agent has strong habits then having a

3342
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:18,960
high beta value means that the habits

3343
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,719
will have a much stronger influence

3344
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:23,280
on on policy uh ultimate policy

3345
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:24,560
selection

3346
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:27,760
um and we actually show this is the

3347
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:29,440
thing that i was talking about it's kind

3348
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:30,960
of like a

3349
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:33,199
random exploration sort of thing where

3350
01:51:33,199 --> 01:51:35,280
it's actually updated over time

3351
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:36,719
so with each observation the agent

3352
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:38,880
essentially updates its confidence

3353
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:43,280
in its expected free energy estimates um

3354
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:46,080
and then alpha is kind of like a

3355
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:47,280
standard what are called inverse

3356
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,280
temperature parameters

3357
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:50,960
where it just kind of controls

3358
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:52,960
randomness and action selection so once

3359
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:54,880
you've chosen a policy

3360
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,920
then that policy might say this action

3361
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:59,119
is better than that action but

3362
01:51:59,119 --> 01:51:59,920
occasionally the

3363
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:02,480
agent might still choose a different

3364
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:04,239
action kind of randomly

3365
01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:07,840
um and uh this is actually

3366
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:09,119
again this is technically like a

3367
01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:10,639
sub-optimal thing right you want to just

3368
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:12,159
always choose the best thing

3369
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:14,400
but this is actually quite important to

3370
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:16,000
fit in practice because in

3371
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,520
actual human behavior there tends to be

3372
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:21,679
a notable amount of randomness and so

3373
01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:23,119
you need to actually fit something like

3374
01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:23,679
alpha

3375
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:28,000
to get a model that fits behavior well

3376
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:30,960
now these other two things i'll probably

3377
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:32,800
skip over largely because they only have

3378
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:34,239
to do with the neural process theory

3379
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:35,520
primarily

3380
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:38,159
but this erp thing it just controls how

3381
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:39,280
much beliefs

3382
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:42,320
reset at each time point um with respect

3383
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:45,520
to the modeled

3384
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:47,280
firing rate changes so it basically

3385
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:49,520
controls how much priors at one time

3386
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:50,080
point

3387
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:53,760
carry over at the next time point

3388
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:56,000
with respect to the neural process

3389
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,679
theory

3390
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:00,560
and then tau is um basically like an

3391
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:02,080
evidence accumulation rate so it

3392
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:03,679
controls how quickly

3393
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:05,440
um you update your beliefs based on new

3394
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:07,679
observations um

3395
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:11,119
uh as attached to uh the neural process

3396
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:12,480
theory um

3397
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:15,040
yeah anyone digs into the code it's just

3398
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:17,360
a time constant on gradient descent

3399
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:20,800
yeah um

3400
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,880
so and i go through a couple other ones

3401
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,480
here that i explain but i'm gonna kind

3402
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,119
of

3403
01:53:25,119 --> 01:53:28,159
skip over those for now so then that's

3404
01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:28,880
basically it

3405
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:30,960
if we wanted to we could hard code what

3406
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:32,560
the states what the initial states are

3407
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:34,639
and what the observations are

3408
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:37,199
like that by setting sno but typically

3409
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:39,040
what we will do is we won't do that

3410
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,920
we'll just let the generative process

3411
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:44,159
generate the observations itself

3412
01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:46,400
which is probabilistic so it'll generate

3413
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:49,199
with whatever the probability is of d

3414
01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:51,840
over d what states are actually the true

3415
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,199
states in that context and therefore

3416
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:56,159
what observations get generated

3417
01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:57,920
and so last thing and again i already

3418
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:00,080
covered this is you just stick all these

3419
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,679
things you defined into this

3420
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:05,360
mdp right and we allow little d

3421
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:06,719
which means we're going to allow it to

3422
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:08,480
learn whether the left or the right

3423
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:10,239
context is more likely

3424
01:54:10,239 --> 01:54:12,000
we set all these things you know the

3425
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
learning rate and the

3426
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,159
action precision or inverse temperature

3427
01:54:16,159 --> 01:54:17,520
so alpha

3428
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:20,719
etc we're going to leave out

3429
01:54:20,719 --> 01:54:22,639
other things we could have defined like

3430
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:24,239
e or like

3431
01:54:24,239 --> 01:54:26,960
learning a or learning b or learning c

3432
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:27,840
or learning e

3433
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:30,719
etc we're not going to define the states

3434
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:32,080
ahead of time

3435
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:33,199
and we're not going to define some of

3436
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:34,400
these additional parameters that we

3437
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,480
could include um

3438
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:39,920
and then we can just kind of do some uh

3439
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:42,880
nice labeling here just to so we label

3440
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:43,599
what the

3441
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:46,800
contexts uh mean right the semantics

3442
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:49,040
we're laying on it for the figures

3443
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:52,239
um and that's it

3444
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:54,719
and then once we do that then we can use

3445
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:55,360
this

3446
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:57,920
uh little check script here just to make

3447
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,360
sure we didn't mess anything

3448
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:01,280
up in building the model and it'll kind

3449
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:03,280
of nicely tell you or give you a hint

3450
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:04,000
anyway about what

3451
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,599
you might have messed up um and then

3452
01:55:07,599 --> 01:55:10,560
this script that i mentioned before that

3453
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:12,320
we provide is the one that actually runs

3454
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:13,760
the simulation

3455
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:17,199
um and then finally once we have

3456
01:55:17,199 --> 01:55:18,960
these simulations run which will be

3457
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:21,040
stored in this big mdp

3458
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:23,679
then we can use these plotting scripts

3459
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:24,239
to

3460
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:27,360
actually show the results um

3461
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:30,239
and if i set sim equals one then it's

3462
01:55:30,239 --> 01:55:32,320
going to do that it's just going to do a

3463
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:35,599
single trial simulation which i'm going

3464
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:36,320
to do

3465
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:39,280
now um so i'll just let the thing run

3466
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:40,239
the rest of the way

3467
01:55:40,239 --> 01:55:41,840
so i won't i'll get rid of these

3468
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:44,480
stoppers well just to give a quick

3469
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,960
let's give a coding recap just to where

3470
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:48,480
we are at the end of the second

3471
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:50,320
session while you're going through the

3472
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:51,599
stop signs so

3473
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:53,119
in the first session we talked a lot

3474
01:55:53,119 --> 01:55:55,599
about the basis of this paper

3475
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:57,199
and the rationale we talked a little bit

3476
01:55:57,199 --> 01:55:58,560
more about who might be interested or

3477
01:55:58,560 --> 01:55:59,679
what kinds of experiments it was

3478
01:55:59,679 --> 01:56:00,800
adjacent to

3479
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:03,040
and then today that was awesome with the

3480
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:04,880
code because we went through a full

3481
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:07,119
definition and we moved from that sort

3482
01:56:07,119 --> 01:56:09,040
of analytical definitions that we went

3483
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:10,320
through in the first session

3484
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:12,400
into seeing how they're realized in the

3485
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:13,520
code and

3486
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:14,960
for me at least it was really helpful to

3487
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:16,320
see how a lot of these things were put

3488
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:17,119
down

3489
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:18,960
and then we got all the way up to line

3490
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:20,960
631 or something but it could be

3491
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:22,320
different in a little different version

3492
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,159
but we got to the definition of the full

3493
01:56:24,159 --> 01:56:26,400
model and then the call out from that

3494
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:28,000
object to another script

3495
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,599
and then we're going to be storing all

3496
01:56:29,599 --> 01:56:31,520
the outputs in this kind of big

3497
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:34,000
container called mdp so today we went

3498
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:34,880
from

3499
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:37,440
0 to 60 with the code getting all these

3500
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:37,920
things

3501
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:39,920
run through and defined and operated on

3502
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:41,199
now we're going to look at the output

3503
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:42,400
and then it sounds like in future

3504
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:43,679
sessions we're going to be fitting

3505
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:45,440
parameters and maybe doing a few other

3506
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:47,119
things

3507
01:56:47,119 --> 01:56:49,119
yeah and future stuff will i mean it

3508
01:56:49,119 --> 01:56:50,800
sounds like maybe we're going to

3509
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,520
wait to do to show learning next time i

3510
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:54,719
guess depending on the amount of time

3511
01:56:54,719 --> 01:56:55,440
but

3512
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:58,239
um yeah next time then we'd be in a

3513
01:56:58,239 --> 01:56:59,280
position to

3514
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:02,639
do um actual code for learning um

3515
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:04,239
we're planning on covering the neural

3516
01:57:04,239 --> 01:57:06,000
process theory and uh

3517
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,880
building hierarchical models um and then

3518
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,320
the last thing is yeah actually fitting

3519
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:11,280
models to data

3520
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:14,639
um so uh so yeah we'll see how much of

3521
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:15,280
that we can

3522
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:18,159
get through but um okay so just to

3523
01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:18,880
finish here

3524
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:20,480
so i'm i got rid of all my little

3525
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:21,840
stoppers so now i'm just gonna click

3526
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:22,800
continue

3527
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:25,920
and it's going to run same equals one

3528
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:28,880
and what i'm going to get out of this is

3529
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:30,320
a little plot like this

3530
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:32,239
and also there'll be a neural neural

3531
01:57:32,239 --> 01:57:33,520
process there you want under here but

3532
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:34,800
i'm going to ignore this for now because

3533
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:35,920
we're not talking about the neural

3534
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:37,520
process theory right now

3535
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:40,719
um so what this top one here is

3536
01:57:40,719 --> 01:57:44,000
is it's hidden states so contexts um

3537
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,080
now black equals a high probable higher

3538
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:47,679
probability white equals a low

3539
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:49,360
probability and so there's you know the

3540
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:52,159
gray is kind of in between right so this

3541
01:57:52,159 --> 01:57:52,960
is saying

3542
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:55,760
and these are all posteriors over states

3543
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:57,280
at the end of a trial

3544
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,679
so that's important so what this is

3545
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:00,320
saying is

3546
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:03,119
at the end of the trial at time three

3547
01:58:03,119 --> 01:58:05,199
these are the beliefs that the agent has

3548
01:58:05,199 --> 01:58:07,920
about what state it was in across all

3549
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:10,080
these time steps

3550
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:12,159
so saying at the end of the trial the

3551
01:58:12,159 --> 01:58:14,159
agent was completely confident

3552
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:17,199
that it was in the left better context

3553
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:19,520
and these little cyan blue dots here

3554
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:21,199
mean that that's what the true context

3555
01:58:21,199 --> 01:58:21,920
was

3556
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,040
so in other words the agent was right so

3557
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:26,880
this is saying at the end of the trial

3558
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:28,400
the thing was the agent was really

3559
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:29,679
confident it was in the left better

3560
01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:30,960
context

3561
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:32,719
the other state factor is choice states

3562
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:35,199
down here and this is just saying that

3563
01:58:35,199 --> 01:58:37,920
it observed itself go from the start

3564
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:38,400
state

3565
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:40,960
to the hint state and then well sorry it

3566
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:42,239
moved from the start state to the hidden

3567
01:58:42,239 --> 01:58:44,080
state to the choose left state

3568
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:47,199
so those are the states the actions

3569
01:58:47,199 --> 01:58:49,119
correspond to that well so this is

3570
01:58:49,119 --> 01:58:52,000
saying it first chose the hint state

3571
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,960
and then it shows the choose left state

3572
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:56,480
or choose left action sorry these are

3573
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:57,679
the actions

3574
01:58:57,679 --> 01:59:00,960
um this thing in the middle on the left

3575
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:02,000
it's not really important

3576
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,440
it's just kind of depicting what the

3577
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:05,679
different policy options are

3578
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:07,360
kind of arbitrarily based on the numbers

3579
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:09,599
so i just ignored that

3580
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:11,920
down here at the bottom we have the

3581
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:13,599
outcomes and the outcome preference

3582
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:14,960
distributions

3583
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:16,880
so this is just saying it observed null

3584
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:18,639
and then the left hint

3585
01:59:18,639 --> 01:59:21,199
and then null again this uh the third

3586
01:59:21,199 --> 01:59:22,719
one just says it observed

3587
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:24,239
it go to the start state then to hint

3588
01:59:24,239 --> 01:59:25,679
state and then to choose left so just

3589
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:27,360
observed its own behavior

3590
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:29,119
the second one here is the win loss one

3591
01:59:29,119 --> 01:59:30,560
which is the most important

3592
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,840
so you can see that this one actually

3593
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:34,080
has a non-zero distribution over it

3594
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:35,760
which is what means it prefers some

3595
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:38,320
observations over others

3596
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:40,320
and so in this case what it's saying is

3597
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:41,920
it started the null state

3598
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:43,920
at time two it stated in the null state

3599
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:45,679
right because it took the hint

3600
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:49,199
um and then it observed the win um

3601
01:59:49,199 --> 01:59:50,960
so in other words it got the hint it

3602
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:52,320
knew what context it was

3603
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:55,520
it chose left chose left

3604
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:58,159
and so it observed a win so that's what

3605
01:59:58,159 --> 01:59:59,199
that means

3606
01:59:59,199 --> 02:00:01,040
um and then this distribution over

3607
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:02,800
policies here is just saying at the

3608
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:04,480
beginning it wasn't that confident right

3609
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:06,000
so there's a lot of gray across all the

3610
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,199
policy options

3611
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:08,639
but after the hint it became really

3612
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:10,639
confident at time two about what the

3613
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:12,239
right policy was

3614
02:00:12,239 --> 02:00:15,360
um this bottom thing is um part of the

3615
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:17,920
neural process theory it's simulating um

3616
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:20,239
dopamine so dopamine responses quote

3617
02:00:20,239 --> 02:00:21,920
unquote it's the updates in the expected

3618
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:23,920
precision that beta thing

3619
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:27,119
um but that's how you read um these

3620
02:00:27,119 --> 02:00:29,520
plots um and again i won't i won't go

3621
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:30,800
over the neural process theory one

3622
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:31,920
because we're gonna do that next time

3623
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:32,880
hopefully

3624
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:35,119
um but just the last thing to show is if

3625
02:00:35,119 --> 02:00:36,239
you noticed

3626
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:39,599
in that case the agent went to the hint

3627
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:43,119
first right so it went for the hint

3628
02:00:43,119 --> 02:00:45,360
first i'll just do that one more time

3629
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:47,920
so you can see it's very reliable that

3630
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:48,560
it will

3631
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:51,840
um that it will choose the hint um with

3632
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:53,360
a lot of confidence

3633
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:55,920
but now look what happens if i make this

3634
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:56,800
rs value

3635
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:58,560
higher if i make it eight which means

3636
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:00,159
that the thing is uh

3637
02:01:00,159 --> 02:01:01,760
really really really wants to win the

3638
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:03,520
four dollars basically

3639
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:07,280
so in this case it should be risk taking

3640
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:10,480
it should just forego the hint and just

3641
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:12,159
take a guess immediately you can see

3642
02:01:12,159 --> 02:01:14,480
that's what it does

3643
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:17,199
it has a flat distribution has no idea

3644
02:01:17,199 --> 02:01:18,719
whether it should choose the left one or

3645
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:19,920
the right one

3646
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:21,440
but it just takes a chance because it

3647
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:22,960
really wants to win the four dollars and

3648
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:23,360
the

3649
02:01:23,360 --> 02:01:25,280
value of information and the expected

3650
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:27,199
free energy is low

3651
02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:29,599
because the reward value is really high

3652
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:32,560
and so it just takes a guess

3653
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:35,760
and it guesses right and it turns out

3654
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:37,520
that it was in the left context so it

3655
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:38,719
observes that it

3656
02:01:38,719 --> 02:01:41,840
lost um at time two

3657
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:43,679
and because it observed that it lost in

3658
02:01:43,679 --> 02:01:45,679
the first o i must have been in the left

3659
02:01:45,679 --> 02:01:47,360
context as opposed to the right one so

3660
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:49,040
at the end it still knows now that it

3661
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:52,239
was in the left better context

3662
02:01:52,239 --> 02:01:53,599
so that's so that's what that means you

3663
02:01:53,599 --> 02:01:56,400
can see right away that by changing

3664
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:58,400
how much the thing values reward in the

3665
02:01:58,400 --> 02:01:59,599
preference distribution

3666
02:01:59,599 --> 02:02:01,760
changes how information seeking it is

3667
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:04,800
versus how risk seeking it is um

3668
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:07,199
so that's uh so that's the way that that

3669
02:02:07,199 --> 02:02:07,840
works

3670
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:11,119
um so uh do we want to

3671
02:02:11,119 --> 02:02:13,599
end here or do we want or is there time

3672
02:02:13,599 --> 02:02:15,280
to show learning

3673
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:18,159
um we can absolutely go through learning

3674
02:02:18,159 --> 02:02:19,360
if you would like

3675
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:21,440
so the topics that i've written down i

3676
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:22,880
have learning which it sounds like would

3677
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:24,719
be awesome to run through now

3678
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:27,360
then we have actual data hierarchical

3679
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:28,000
models

3680
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,599
neural process theories and then

3681
02:02:29,599 --> 02:02:31,040
computational psychiatry

3682
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:33,760
so that's the stack of topics let's get

3683
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:34,239
to

3684
02:02:34,239 --> 02:02:37,119
learning today and then another time

3685
02:02:37,119 --> 02:02:40,000
another model stream

3686
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:43,840
okay sounds good so learning

3687
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:46,400
um so if you could see i sort of said

3688
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,840
how to do this here i said for to

3689
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:49,440
reproduce figure seven

3690
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:51,840
so for figure nine here which is sim2

3691
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,520
which is the initial learning

3692
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:56,960
i'm gonna first set uh rs to

3693
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:59,199
three um it's just a value that turns

3694
02:02:59,199 --> 02:03:00,719
out it's nice for showing the dynamics

3695
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:02,159
of learning in a way that's

3696
02:03:02,159 --> 02:03:05,840
clear um so because it should start

3697
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:08,000
out being information seeking and what

3698
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,400
we want to show is how it learns to be

3699
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:13,280
more uh confident and therefore starts

3700
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,880
to forego the hint

3701
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:16,639
as it builds up a stronger prior that

3702
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:18,480
the left context is the

3703
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:21,440
one that keeps being the case so now

3704
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:24,560
what i'll do is i'll set sum equals two

3705
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:26,639
but i'll show you what this does down

3706
02:03:26,639 --> 02:03:29,280
when i go to same equals two

3707
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:33,040
um okay

3708
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:36,400
so this is actually incredibly simple um

3709
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:39,040
so when sem equals two is set all i do

3710
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:40,880
is i say okay i want 30 trials so n

3711
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:42,320
equals 30.

3712
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:45,360
um to keep the mdp thing

3713
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:47,840
something that um remains in that just

3714
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:49,440
kind of single structure

3715
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:53,040
um i redefine little mvp as big mdp and

3716
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:55,040
again this is just for convenience

3717
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:58,079
and then i can use this uh deal function

3718
02:03:58,079 --> 02:03:59,599
which is just kind of a nice convenient

3719
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:00,960
function in matlab

3720
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:03,679
which more or less just says repeat the

3721
02:04:03,679 --> 02:04:04,239
mdp

3722
02:04:04,239 --> 02:04:07,679
structure 30 times so now there's mdp1

3723
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:10,880
mdb2 mdp3 and

3724
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:13,199
all those are just the same just

3725
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:14,800
identical as the initial

3726
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:19,040
mdp that we built um so if i do that

3727
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:21,360
then what will happen is it will look

3728
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:23,280
like so okay so i'll do

3729
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:26,880
so i'll do two things one is

3730
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:30,159
so before um so now i just have

3731
02:04:30,159 --> 02:04:33,440
big mdp equals mdp so now big mdp will

3732
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:34,159
look like this

3733
02:04:34,159 --> 02:04:35,920
right there's just a single field for t

3734
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:37,440
v a b blah blah blah

3735
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:40,560
right everything that we set um

3736
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:43,760
now once i run this deal thing

3737
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:46,079
then if i step then all of a sudden mdp

3738
02:04:46,079 --> 02:04:48,079
will now look like this

3739
02:04:48,079 --> 02:04:51,119
um where you can see now that same

3740
02:04:51,119 --> 02:04:51,760
structure

3741
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:56,320
is repeated uh in 30 rows

3742
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:57,679
and this will all start out being

3743
02:04:57,679 --> 02:05:00,079
identical

3744
02:05:00,079 --> 02:05:03,119
so what will happen now though is if i

3745
02:05:03,119 --> 02:05:03,760
run it

3746
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:07,040
through the vbx tutorial script

3747
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:09,440
then and this will take a second it will

3748
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:10,800
run through

3749
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:14,480
the whole thing 30 times and again this

3750
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:15,840
will just take a sec

3751
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:18,000
so wait let me ask something so first

3752
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:18,880
maybe someone's

3753
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:19,840
maybe has a little noise in their

3754
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:22,079
background but it seems like this

3755
02:05:22,079 --> 02:05:25,280
little mdp is like a column that conveys

3756
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:27,840
all the details for a single trial and

3757
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:29,119
then we're making

3758
02:05:29,119 --> 02:05:31,679
a meta matrix we're just generalizing

3759
02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:33,599
the matrix into many dimensions

3760
02:05:33,599 --> 02:05:35,360
and now we're stacking all of the total

3761
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,960
model as like a column

3762
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:40,079
into in this case 30 trials

3763
02:05:40,079 --> 02:05:41,840
but you could do 100 trials in a row or

3764
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:44,560
you could have 20 sets of 10 trials

3765
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:47,360
so it's the idea of concatenating total

3766
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:48,639
model setups

3767
02:05:48,639 --> 02:05:51,040
like a column so that you can do

3768
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:52,159
operations on

3769
02:05:52,159 --> 02:05:55,199
big big potentially hierarchical sets of

3770
02:05:55,199 --> 02:05:56,560
models

3771
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:59,280
in this keys each mdp is a row really

3772
02:05:59,280 --> 02:05:59,920
it's just a

3773
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:01,840
giant model yeah it's just a giant

3774
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:04,239
structure with gp over and over again

3775
02:06:04,239 --> 02:06:06,159
yeah i meant bro sorry good good call my

3776
02:06:06,159 --> 02:06:08,320
r centrism i'm always like thinking in

3777
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:10,400
column

3778
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:13,840
yeah all right but okay so now i ran it

3779
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:16,239
i ran the mdp with all those different

3780
02:06:16,239 --> 02:06:17,840
repeated

3781
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:19,599
repeated rows repeated models through

3782
02:06:19,599 --> 02:06:20,880
this mdp

3783
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:25,040
script here and now

3784
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:27,280
what you'll see is now the mdp structure

3785
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:29,360
will look a little different

3786
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:31,839
um

3787
02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:35,119
so now in addition to how the stuff in

3788
02:06:35,119 --> 02:06:35,599
it

3789
02:06:35,599 --> 02:06:38,960
had before it's also now going to have

3790
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:42,079
um all this

3791
02:06:42,079 --> 02:06:46,159
this thing is like bin

3792
02:06:46,719 --> 02:06:48,079
now it's going to have all this other

3793
02:06:48,079 --> 02:06:49,840
stuff it's going to have

3794
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:52,079
the free energy f it's going to have the

3795
02:06:52,079 --> 02:06:53,599
expected free energy g it's going to

3796
02:06:53,599 --> 02:06:54,960
have the total free energy h

3797
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:57,040
it's going to have the actions u it's

3798
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:58,239
gonna have the free energy

3799
02:06:58,239 --> 02:07:01,920
for the uh learned parameters d

3800
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:04,320
um a bunch of other stuff and we have a

3801
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:06,400
whole table in the in the tutorial that

3802
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:08,000
says what each of these fields mean so

3803
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,840
you can interpret them

3804
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:11,199
they don't all matter enough for me to

3805
02:07:11,199 --> 02:07:13,679
go through them right now um

3806
02:07:13,679 --> 02:07:16,800
but so then once i have that then

3807
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:20,400
i can generate a plot

3808
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:21,760
with this little game underscore

3809
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:24,400
tutorial script that i

3810
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:26,400
for plotting multiple trials that we put

3811
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:27,679
together

3812
02:07:27,679 --> 02:07:31,040
and i can run that

3813
02:07:31,119 --> 02:07:34,480
and it will generate a multi-trial

3814
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:37,920
behavior um so so what this is showing

3815
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:39,599
is the first action on each

3816
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:42,800
trial um so here what you can see is

3817
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:43,520
that in the

3818
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:45,119
start and the colors are the probability

3819
02:07:45,119 --> 02:07:46,880
so dark equals higher probability and

3820
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:48,560
the the blue circles are the actual

3821
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:50,159
chosen actions

3822
02:07:50,159 --> 02:07:51,760
um so you can see for the first several

3823
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:54,000
trials the agent kept taking

3824
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:57,599
the hint but after a while because the

3825
02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:00,159
left one if the left context kept being

3826
02:08:00,159 --> 02:08:01,679
the one the the one that

3827
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:04,159
it thought it was in at the end it

3828
02:08:04,159 --> 02:08:06,480
starts to be confident around trial 9

3829
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:08,719
10 here that it's always just gonna be

3830
02:08:08,719 --> 02:08:10,560
the left one so it just immediately

3831
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:14,320
chooses the uh the left arm or the left

3832
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:17,760
machine um but now what you can see is

3833
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:18,639
is that

3834
02:08:18,639 --> 02:08:20,719
it gets one wrong right because the it's

3835
02:08:20,719 --> 02:08:22,560
only eighty percent right that the left

3836
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:24,239
one is going to be the right one

3837
02:08:24,239 --> 02:08:29,360
um and uh once um

3838
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:30,960
could a dog be metered or is that yours

3839
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:33,440
yes it is it is a dog wanting to

3840
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:35,520
want to be in my lap if the dog is a

3841
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:37,360
contributor then absolutely

3842
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:41,679
welcome to speak yes

3843
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:43,920
but uh but anyway so it starts to get

3844
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:45,440
one wrong here around trial

3845
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:48,239
12 right because 13 because again it's

3846
02:08:48,239 --> 02:08:49,679
only even when it's in the left better

3847
02:08:49,679 --> 02:08:51,360
context it still will lose 20

3848
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:53,840
of the time right and so once it loses

3849
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:55,280
it says okay actually i'm not confident

3850
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:56,159
anymore so it starts

3851
02:08:56,159 --> 02:08:57,840
taking the hint again and that happens a

3852
02:08:57,840 --> 02:08:59,280
couple of times

3853
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:02,880
um and so it starts kind of going uh

3854
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:06,000
bouncing around um and also note that

3855
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:06,639
this uh

3856
02:09:06,639 --> 02:09:09,760
this is under um an alpha value

3857
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:11,440
right like the action precision value

3858
02:09:11,440 --> 02:09:13,119
that's not that high

3859
02:09:13,119 --> 02:09:15,360
so its behavior is a little random right

3860
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:16,800
there's a little bit of randomness in it

3861
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:19,679
like what a real human would do

3862
02:09:19,679 --> 02:09:22,639
um and so this next column this next

3863
02:09:22,639 --> 02:09:24,800
plot here below is just green is a win

3864
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:27,199
black is a loss and the um you can see

3865
02:09:27,199 --> 02:09:28,480
when it loses

3866
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:32,959
the uh negative free energies are larger

3867
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:35,679
and again this i won't go through these

3868
02:09:35,679 --> 02:09:36,480
last uh

3869
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:38,320
these two here just part of the neural

3870
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:40,639
process theory they're like the expected

3871
02:09:40,639 --> 02:09:43,280
uh erps and expected dopamine responses

3872
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:44,000
the model

3873
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,079
that the theory would predict and then

3874
02:09:46,079 --> 02:09:47,679
this bottom one is just kind of the

3875
02:09:47,679 --> 02:09:49,840
evolution of the agent's priors about

3876
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:51,119
whether it's going to be the left wing

3877
02:09:51,119 --> 02:09:52,880
or the right-wing context

3878
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:56,079
um so that's how to read this

3879
02:09:56,079 --> 02:09:59,280
so it learns and then but

3880
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:01,360
look what happens if i instead make the

3881
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:03,440
thing a little bit more

3882
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:07,360
uh risk seeking so i make the the value

3883
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:10,079
of the the subjective value of winning

3884
02:10:10,079 --> 02:10:11,679
four dollars more

3885
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:16,000
um and i do that just by setting

3886
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,679
rs to four instead of three in this case

3887
02:10:19,679 --> 02:10:23,920
um so now

3888
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:26,880
by the way it's awesome that basically

3889
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:29,040
by hitting play on this script it seems

3890
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:30,400
like even with minimal

3891
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:32,639
tweaking people can reproduce this in

3892
02:10:32,639 --> 02:10:33,599
their own

3893
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:35,920
setup start to play with some of the

3894
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:37,040
variables

3895
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:39,040
and it's just really an awesome toolkit

3896
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:40,960
this is pretty cool

3897
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:43,040
yeah no thank you yeah we we definitely

3898
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:44,400
tried to make it as

3899
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:47,199
easy as uh user-friendly as possible for

3900
02:10:47,199 --> 02:10:48,320
you know people who have minimal

3901
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:49,920
background so i'm glad if you guys think

3902
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:50,800
so

3903
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:53,520
um but okay so so in this case right i

3904
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:54,480
set the

3905
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:56,239
uh risk seeking parameter and the

3906
02:10:56,239 --> 02:10:58,000
preference distribution to be a higher

3907
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:58,800
number

3908
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:01,760
um so now if you look the agent is now

3909
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,440
it takes the hint twice and then just

3910
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:06,480
sticks with the left every single time

3911
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:08,719
even if it loses a couple of times it

3912
02:11:08,719 --> 02:11:10,960
just continues to be risk seeking

3913
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:14,639
um and again everything else is

3914
02:11:14,639 --> 02:11:16,800
basically the same except the um the

3915
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:18,960
predicted dopamine responses and erps

3916
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:20,400
and things like that are different

3917
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:24,000
um but but so that

3918
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,840
is what it looks like when you just do

3919
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:28,000
like a normal learning

3920
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:29,840
um just where it says the same the

3921
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:31,840
context is the same across trials and

3922
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,920
the last thing i'll show you guys

3923
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:36,239
is if i set it to three then we

3924
02:11:36,239 --> 02:11:38,480
engineered this kind of this reward

3925
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:39,280
learning

3926
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:43,840
um or this reversal learning version

3927
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:45,360
right so reversal learning is for the

3928
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:47,360
first several trials the left context is

3929
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:48,000
better

3930
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,599
so it's going to build up a prior that

3931
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:51,199
the left context is better

3932
02:11:51,199 --> 02:11:52,719
but then it's going to switch to the

3933
02:11:52,719 --> 02:11:54,400
right context being better and we're

3934
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:57,199
going to see how the agent does

3935
02:11:57,199 --> 02:11:59,119
now i'll show you how we do that which

3936
02:11:59,119 --> 02:12:00,719
is also very simple

3937
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:03,040
here we're going to set n to be 32

3938
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:04,079
trials

3939
02:12:04,079 --> 02:12:07,599
do the same kind of you know deal thing

3940
02:12:07,599 --> 02:12:10,880
but now what i did is i just said for

3941
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:14,320
one two uh the number of trials divided

3942
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:15,440
by eight

3943
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:18,639
we're going to make big d one zero this

3944
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:20,079
is saying the true neural process

3945
02:12:20,079 --> 02:12:22,159
or the true degenerative process is

3946
02:12:22,159 --> 02:12:23,440
going to be the left one

3947
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:26,079
but then i say in the mdp for n divided

3948
02:12:26,079 --> 02:12:27,199
by eight plus

3949
02:12:27,199 --> 02:12:30,560
one day plus one to n so basically one

3950
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:31,679
after this number

3951
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:34,639
to the end then it's going to now be

3952
02:12:34,639 --> 02:12:36,159
switched to the generative process as

3953
02:12:36,159 --> 02:12:38,639
the right context

3954
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:40,560
so in this case it just means the fir

3955
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:42,159
the first eight trials

3956
02:12:42,159 --> 02:12:44,000
are left better and the rest of the

3957
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,599
trials up to 32 are going to be the

3958
02:12:45,599 --> 02:12:47,119
right better context

3959
02:12:47,119 --> 02:12:48,880
so that's literally it then you just run

3960
02:12:48,880 --> 02:12:51,199
the same thing through the same vbx

3961
02:12:51,199 --> 02:12:52,639
function and you plot it with the same

3962
02:12:52,639 --> 02:12:54,800
plotting script so that's really very

3963
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:57,840
very simple so if i do that

3964
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:01,679
with risk seeking of 3 then

3965
02:13:01,679 --> 02:13:05,119
what we'll see happen is

3966
02:13:05,119 --> 02:13:08,239
um then you know

3967
02:13:08,239 --> 02:13:09,920
give it a second to cook here just to

3968
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:12,079
give one though on that software design

3969
02:13:12,079 --> 02:13:14,800
instead of having five scripts called

3970
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:17,040
simulation one simulation two simulation

3971
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:17,920
three

3972
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:20,239
it's that there's a common core and then

3973
02:13:20,239 --> 02:13:21,280
the simulation

3974
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:23,440
scenarios are defined basically like

3975
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:24,320
variables

3976
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:27,520
down here in the 600s lines and then

3977
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:30,719
by changing which simulation is in play

3978
02:13:30,719 --> 02:13:32,560
at the very top it seems like ryan is

3979
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:34,000
being able to change which simulation

3980
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:34,960
we're in

3981
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:37,119
very uh fluidly so we can change the

3982
02:13:37,119 --> 02:13:38,719
simulation look at a variable change a

3983
02:13:38,719 --> 02:13:39,280
variable

3984
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:42,840
go back up change the simulation go back

3985
02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:44,159
in

3986
02:13:44,159 --> 02:13:46,719
yeah i mean it's basically it's just

3987
02:13:46,719 --> 02:13:47,280
it's just an

3988
02:13:47,280 --> 02:13:49,440
if then function it just says if same

3989
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:50,400
equals three then

3990
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:53,360
do this or else if sem equals four do

3991
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:53,760
this

3992
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:55,040
yeah i mean it's just a very simple

3993
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:57,360
if-then statement um

3994
02:13:57,360 --> 02:14:00,639
but uh but okay so in this case um

3995
02:14:00,639 --> 02:14:04,800
so i set rs equals three

3996
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:08,000
um and what you can see is is in this

3997
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:08,480
case

3998
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:10,159
the agent just continued to take the

3999
02:14:10,159 --> 02:14:12,159
hint the entire time

4000
02:14:12,159 --> 02:14:15,199
um because it was never

4001
02:14:15,199 --> 02:14:18,079
it was never confident enough and the uh

4002
02:14:18,079 --> 02:14:19,280
you know it happened to get the first

4003
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:20,960
one wrong in this case which is part of

4004
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:22,320
what drove that

4005
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:25,520
um but so if the if the actual

4006
02:14:25,520 --> 02:14:26,639
observations i got were a little

4007
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:27,920
different let's actually try that again

4008
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:28,960
and see

4009
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:33,360
uh what um

4010
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:35,599
what i would get here but this

4011
02:14:35,599 --> 02:14:37,520
characterizes all these interesting

4012
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:39,040
things like a um

4013
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:42,159
perhaps over or under eagerness to

4014
02:14:42,159 --> 02:14:43,840
ask for hints or acquire more

4015
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:45,840
information it's showing how the model

4016
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:47,520
this one is not trying to fit human

4017
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:49,040
behavior we're really playing with the

4018
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:49,920
bare bones

4019
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:51,760
but already we're seeing that's kind of

4020
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:53,199
pathological hint

4021
02:14:53,199 --> 02:14:55,679
behavior but it never goes when it knows

4022
02:14:55,679 --> 02:14:56,719
and so now something else

4023
02:14:56,719 --> 02:14:59,280
yeah well it's just it's parameter play

4024
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:00,159
but it's going to

4025
02:15:00,159 --> 02:15:02,320
play out differently yeah so like in

4026
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:03,840
this case where it does take the hint

4027
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:05,199
every time it does

4028
02:15:05,199 --> 02:15:07,599
kind of start you can see on trial five

4029
02:15:07,599 --> 02:15:09,280
here it starts to have a little bit of

4030
02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:10,800
like ah maybe i should just choose the

4031
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:12,719
left choose the left one immediately

4032
02:15:12,719 --> 02:15:14,320
but then it gets a couple wrong and then

4033
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:15,760
the context changes

4034
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:17,280
you can see in context learning here it

4035
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:19,040
starts out oh i think the left one's

4036
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:20,480
better and then it starts switching and

4037
02:15:20,480 --> 02:15:21,520
then around trial

4038
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:24,000
11 and 12 now it starts to become more

4039
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:25,119
and more confident that it's in the

4040
02:15:25,119 --> 02:15:26,159
right win

4041
02:15:26,159 --> 02:15:29,280
context so now last thing i'll

4042
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:32,159
show you is what happens under that same

4043
02:15:32,159 --> 02:15:32,719
thing

4044
02:15:32,719 --> 02:15:36,000
but when i set rs equal to four so it's

4045
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:39,840
a little more risk seeking

4046
02:15:40,239 --> 02:15:43,520
um because this actually gets

4047
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:46,000
a little more fun so the risk seeking is

4048
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,840
like a multiplication

4049
02:15:47,840 --> 02:15:50,079
on the money so it's like one to two

4050
02:15:50,079 --> 02:15:51,520
dollars versus one million to two

4051
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:53,440
million like how high the stakes are

4052
02:15:53,440 --> 02:15:54,800
because it sounds like you're kind of

4053
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:57,119
tuning up whether the agent wants the

4054
02:15:57,119 --> 02:15:59,040
big wins or what is it really conveying

4055
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:00,159
in this model

4056
02:16:00,159 --> 02:16:01,920
it's just it's just essentially the

4057
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:04,239
precision of the preference distribution

4058
02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:06,320
so it's just it's just how big the

4059
02:16:06,320 --> 02:16:07,760
number is

4060
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:11,360
uh over win at time step

4061
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:14,320
two uh but that's really all it is it's

4062
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:16,159
just how high the probability is for a

4063
02:16:16,159 --> 02:16:16,880
win

4064
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:18,960
um in the agent's model which just

4065
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:21,760
encodes how strongly they prefer winning

4066
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:24,079
um you could think about it as like four

4067
02:16:24,079 --> 02:16:26,560
dollars for them subjectively being like

4068
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:28,320
the value of ten dollars or something

4069
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:29,920
like that but

4070
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:31,679
but all it ends up doing in practice is

4071
02:16:31,679 --> 02:16:33,120
it ends up saying

4072
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:36,718
the uh reward value component of

4073
02:16:36,718 --> 02:16:38,160
expected free energy

4074
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:40,240
has a higher weight than the information

4075
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:41,840
value component

4076
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:44,638
um is is all it ends up being in

4077
02:16:44,638 --> 02:16:45,519
practice

4078
02:16:45,519 --> 02:16:48,160
um so here you can see that the behavior

4079
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:49,519
is actually you know again it's more

4080
02:16:49,519 --> 02:16:50,558
interesting

4081
02:16:50,558 --> 02:16:52,240
so you can see it takes a hint twice and

4082
02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:53,519
all of a sudden it's like all right i'm

4083
02:16:53,519 --> 02:16:55,519
confident enough i'm going to go for

4084
02:16:55,519 --> 02:16:57,920
choosing left immediately right it does

4085
02:16:57,920 --> 02:16:59,519
that for a few trials

4086
02:16:59,519 --> 02:17:01,519
and then the context switches you know

4087
02:17:01,519 --> 02:17:03,200
so it trilate it switches to being the

4088
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:04,318
right context

4089
02:17:04,318 --> 02:17:05,760
and then it's like oh nope i'm going to

4090
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:07,200
start taking the hint again and then it

4091
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:08,959
observes the right one

4092
02:17:08,959 --> 02:17:10,799
uh a bunch of times and then it's like

4093
02:17:10,799 --> 02:17:12,638
okay now i'm confident it's the right

4094
02:17:12,638 --> 02:17:13,040
one

4095
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:14,638
and then it starts choosing the right

4096
02:17:14,638 --> 02:17:16,000
one without taking a hit a bunch of

4097
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:16,879
times now

4098
02:17:16,879 --> 02:17:17,920
the behavior is quite a bit more

4099
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:19,519
interesting because it becomes confident

4100
02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:20,959
it loses confidence and then it switches

4101
02:17:20,959 --> 02:17:22,558
to being confident again in the other

4102
02:17:22,558 --> 02:17:23,760
thing

4103
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:26,799
it gets one wrong around 23 it gets a

4104
02:17:26,799 --> 02:17:27,679
wrong one

4105
02:17:27,679 --> 02:17:29,359
and then it does one hint and it's like

4106
02:17:29,359 --> 02:17:31,040
nope i'm on the right track i just lost

4107
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:31,679
one time

4108
02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:35,040
it's all good yep exactly

4109
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:38,478
um so so that's that's the way the

4110
02:17:38,478 --> 02:17:40,000
learning works and if i show you you

4111
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,599
know like i mean i'm plotting this here

4112
02:17:41,599 --> 02:17:42,000
but like

4113
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:45,120
literally in the mvp like

4114
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:47,920
it will just be if i go to the things

4115
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:48,638
learning d

4116
02:17:48,638 --> 02:17:52,000
right so if i go to little d

4117
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:55,040
trial one

4118
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:57,840
um

4119
02:17:59,359 --> 02:18:02,519
then you know it observes you know it's

4120
02:18:02,519 --> 02:18:04,799
0.75.25 because it observed left the

4121
02:18:04,799 --> 02:18:05,519
first time

4122
02:18:05,519 --> 02:18:09,200
right and then at you know say like

4123
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:11,439
trial eight

4124
02:18:11,439 --> 02:18:15,200
it's two point two

4125
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:19,359
two point two uh so it didn't make

4126
02:18:19,359 --> 02:18:21,280
it's because that's what it's considered

4127
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:22,879
it was flat still but that's because it

4128
02:18:22,879 --> 02:18:24,638
got something wrong that's when it was

4129
02:18:24,638 --> 02:18:26,799
confused

4130
02:18:26,799 --> 02:18:30,398
yeah and then but if i go down to say

4131
02:18:30,398 --> 02:18:31,200
like

4132
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:33,439
you know at the end say like trial i

4133
02:18:33,439 --> 02:18:35,599
don't know 31 or something

4134
02:18:35,599 --> 02:18:39,040
then all of a sudden um it's

4135
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:41,840
2 versus 13 right so it's way more

4136
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:43,679
confident it's added a lot more counts

4137
02:18:43,679 --> 02:18:44,879
to

4138
02:18:44,879 --> 02:18:48,160
it being the right context that's better

4139
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:51,760
um and that's you know that's really it

4140
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:52,718
um

4141
02:18:52,718 --> 02:18:54,799
so and that's literally all the learning

4142
02:18:54,799 --> 02:18:55,760
is and um

4143
02:18:55,760 --> 02:18:58,879
you know like uh uh

4144
02:18:58,879 --> 02:19:00,879
chris showed you the equation for

4145
02:19:00,879 --> 02:19:02,478
learning um

4146
02:19:02,478 --> 02:19:06,318
a but you know in the um in the tutorial

4147
02:19:06,318 --> 02:19:07,280
paper

4148
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:11,120
we also show it for um for learning

4149
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:15,120
d which is even simpler it's just uh

4150
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:16,799
see if i can get to it real quick here

4151
02:19:16,799 --> 02:19:19,119
um

4152
02:19:19,599 --> 02:19:22,718
learning process theory

4153
02:19:22,718 --> 02:19:25,439
learning uh yeah it's literally just

4154
02:19:25,439 --> 02:19:26,160
this

4155
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:28,558
so d for the next trial is d for the

4156
02:19:28,558 --> 02:19:29,439
previous trial

4157
02:19:29,439 --> 02:19:32,478
plus eta times whatever the posterior

4158
02:19:32,478 --> 02:19:33,359
states were

4159
02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:36,959
for the previous trial um that's

4160
02:19:36,959 --> 02:19:41,839
you know that's literally it um

4161
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:44,558
although i'm realizing uh that should be

4162
02:19:44,558 --> 02:19:46,000
a minus not an equals i think

4163
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:49,680
but um a little typos here and there

4164
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:51,760
um but anyway that's you know that's

4165
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:53,359
really it

4166
02:19:53,359 --> 02:19:57,200
um so it's not uh it's not complicated

4167
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:57,760
at all

4168
02:19:57,760 --> 02:19:59,600
it's just add account based on what your

4169
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:01,200
posterior was over states at the end of

4170
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:02,319
the last trial

4171
02:20:02,319 --> 02:20:05,840
um so i mean that's

4172
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:07,280
you know if we're stopping at the end of

4173
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:09,040
of basic learning then then that's

4174
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:09,760
really it

4175
02:20:09,760 --> 02:20:12,479
um uh like i said four and five have to

4176
02:20:12,479 --> 02:20:14,240
do with estimating parameters based on

4177
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:16,319
data and then

4178
02:20:16,319 --> 02:20:19,200
recovering parameter estimates and

4179
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:20,640
fitting behavior to data and things like

4180
02:20:20,640 --> 02:20:21,120
that so

4181
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:23,920
we'll cover that at another time awesome

4182
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:24,880
well just

4183
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:27,520
to um catch our breath at the end of

4184
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:28,319
this really

4185
02:20:28,319 --> 02:20:31,200
fascinating and very appreciated stream

4186
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:31,920
um

4187
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:33,600
and if anyone wants to put any last

4188
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:34,880
comments in the live chat they'll have

4189
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:36,560
just a couple minutes to do so

4190
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:40,240
let's just each take a final recap

4191
02:20:40,240 --> 02:20:43,680
or a final thought what do we want to

4192
02:20:43,680 --> 02:20:45,520
remember from this time what are we

4193
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:47,040
gonna take forward into next time what

4194
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:48,479
are we looking forward to

4195
02:20:48,479 --> 02:20:51,200
learning more about so whoever wants to

4196
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:51,840
go first

4197
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:54,720
maybe christopher any remarks on ryan's

4198
02:20:54,720 --> 02:20:55,760
presentation

4199
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:58,000
and then on the code and also like your

4200
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,600
role or which parts had you

4201
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:01,200
done i was just curious about that with

4202
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:03,280
all those things for the last

4203
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:06,640
um so no i think i agreed with

4204
02:21:06,640 --> 02:21:07,680
everything that was said there

4205
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:11,359
uh one thing to just say very

4206
02:21:11,359 --> 02:21:13,439
when when you really get your hand get a

4207
02:21:13,439 --> 02:21:15,600
handle on building these models

4208
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:18,080
it will take i think for the most time

4209
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:19,359
i've ever spent

4210
02:21:19,359 --> 02:21:21,120
building these models once we'd actually

4211
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:22,800
figured out the model structure

4212
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:25,280
was a couple of days like you you might

4213
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:26,080
spend a very

4214
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:27,680
very long time figuring out the model

4215
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:28,800
structure but once you've figured out

4216
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:30,160
the model structure everything falls in

4217
02:21:30,160 --> 02:21:31,760
place and it's super easy

4218
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:33,600
um so it's kind of interesting in the

4219
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:34,880
sense that i have some friends do like

4220
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:36,399
neural network or modeling with like

4221
02:21:36,399 --> 02:21:37,760
spiking neural nets

4222
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:39,520
and they can spend like weeks building

4223
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:41,520
these models

4224
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:43,840
um

4225
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:46,319
the the hard work here is really

4226
02:21:46,319 --> 02:21:48,640
conceptual um

4227
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:50,479
and then do you ask like what part of

4228
02:21:50,479 --> 02:21:52,640
the tutorial i wrote or versus ryan

4229
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:54,880
um was that the question not a uh

4230
02:21:54,880 --> 02:21:56,479
partitioning just which parts were

4231
02:21:56,479 --> 02:21:59,600
your background drawing from or just how

4232
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:02,960
how do you see similar differently i

4233
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:04,800
wrote them generally speaking i wrote

4234
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:06,479
the mathematical appendices and then did

4235
02:22:06,479 --> 02:22:06,800
like

4236
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:08,720
first drafts of a lot of the techie

4237
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:10,800
sections but that was kind of like my

4238
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:12,960
i really really asked ryan to do that

4239
02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:14,479
just because i wanted to kind of get a

4240
02:22:14,479 --> 02:22:15,600
better understanding of

4241
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:19,120
myself um and send ryan kind of

4242
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:21,120
wrote a lot of the broader sections that

4243
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:22,720
was kind of how that stuff worked out

4244
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:27,359
um yeah i mean i mean

4245
02:22:27,359 --> 02:22:29,120
yeah i wrote i mean i wrote the the code

4246
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:30,479
we're going through now

4247
02:22:30,479 --> 02:22:33,040
was was you know i took the first pass

4248
02:22:33,040 --> 02:22:34,560
of it um

4249
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:38,000
chris wrote uh the um

4250
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:41,680
the hierarchical modeling code um

4251
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:43,600
which uh another another day you'll see

4252
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:45,040
in a lot of the neural process

4253
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:49,040
uh simulation uh code um or the

4254
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:50,960
kind of custom one uh the the ones i was

4255
02:22:50,960 --> 02:22:51,920
showing you now are just kind of like

4256
02:22:51,920 --> 02:22:53,840
carl standard the ones that are in spm

4257
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:56,479
but uh chris made some way way cooler

4258
02:22:56,479 --> 02:22:58,160
ones for the the hierarchical

4259
02:22:58,160 --> 02:23:01,760
neural process simulation stuff um so um

4260
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:03,280
but yeah i mean a lot of this was fully

4261
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:04,399
collaborative you know i wouldn't

4262
02:23:04,399 --> 02:23:05,920
necessarily say

4263
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:07,600
you know one person did anything more

4264
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:08,960
than the other um

4265
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:11,280
so yeah every anyone who's like written

4266
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:12,640
a scientific paper knows like

4267
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:14,720
it's after the first draft has been

4268
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:16,240
written it's kind of hard to tell

4269
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:18,319
the finished product because when you

4270
02:23:18,319 --> 02:23:21,200
have heavy backwood and fold editing it

4271
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:24,640
yeah i totally agree it's a great

4272
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:26,479
perspective so also thanks for

4273
02:23:26,479 --> 02:23:28,479
sharing that so maybe now let's have our

4274
02:23:28,479 --> 02:23:29,760
last little

4275
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:32,800
round maybe max or we'll each take a

4276
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:33,200
last

4277
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:36,399
step yeah i'm just uh you know to

4278
02:23:36,399 --> 02:23:38,560
as a lead into next week i'm excited to

4279
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:40,319
hear about the neural process theory and

4280
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:40,960
really

4281
02:23:40,960 --> 02:23:42,560
about you know looking at those dopamine

4282
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:44,800
traces and it's cool to see the spiking

4283
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:45,520
that you

4284
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:47,200
are able to reproduce with this kind of

4285
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:49,120
a model structure that does reflect

4286
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:52,160
you know kind of how the exact phone

4287
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:54,399
neurobiological processes might look

4288
02:23:54,399 --> 02:23:55,920
um one thing i'm really keen to hear

4289
02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:57,600
about is um the

4290
02:23:57,600 --> 02:24:00,160
you know the link function between your

4291
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:01,120
your gradient

4292
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:04,960
um on free energy and your dopamine

4293
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:06,800
expression or simulated dopamine

4294
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:08,000
expression levels

4295
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
and the the postulated link between um

4296
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:11,439
you know precision

4297
02:24:11,439 --> 02:24:13,040
insofar as i mean i mean these are

4298
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:14,720
things that i'm just it's a little out

4299
02:24:14,720 --> 02:24:15,920
of my realm but um

4300
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:17,520
i think it's really interesting because

4301
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:19,120
fundamentally that's that's such an

4302
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:19,840
elegant

4303
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:22,560
uh mechanism if it's that gradient only

4304
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:24,240
um from a mathematical standpoint that

4305
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:26,160
it's really cool to tie that

4306
02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:28,560
from the math and theory into empirical

4307
02:24:28,560 --> 02:24:30,160
observation and using that to validate

4308
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:32,560
the model

4309
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,319
cool christopher definitely we're

4310
02:24:36,319 --> 02:24:38,640
excited we're excited to show you

4311
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:40,880
nice do either of you want to make any

4312
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:42,479
last comments

4313
02:24:42,479 --> 02:24:44,479
no uh this has been really fun thanks

4314
02:24:44,479 --> 02:24:46,720
