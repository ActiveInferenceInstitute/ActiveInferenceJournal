1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,559
and we are live

2
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,599
hello everyone and welcome to active

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,560
inference lab

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,600
this is the third part in a four part

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,240
series

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,920
it is model stream 3.0 and today we are

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,279
here with ryan smith

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,000
and christopher white and max murphy and

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,519
we're going to be having a really

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,119
interesting discussion so thanks

before we go to points of process and

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,160

awesome thanks everyone for joining for

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,560
our panelists and the authors for max

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,920
for contributing your

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
experience and also for everybody who's

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,760
going to be live and in replay

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,880
asking us questions this is the third in

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,880
a four-part series that is going to be

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
highlighting different perspectives and

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,720
addressing questions related to

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,360
the active inference tutorial paper of

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,000
smith

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,479
at all from uh i guess you could say

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,240
2020 but it's been versioned several

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,960
times

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,640
and that tutorial is called a

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,240
step-by-step tutorial on

41
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,320
active inference and its applications to

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,600
empirical data

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,280
so if you have any questions during the

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,360
live stream you're more than welcome to

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,960
type it in the live chat and we'll try

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,920
to get to it

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,680
if you have questions after this live

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,520
stream just leave a comment and we're

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,600
gonna try to address it as well

50
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
to learn more and to find out about

51
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,640
participating

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,159
check out activeinference.org that's all

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,799
so for today in our third session we're

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,799
going to be picking up with just a brief

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,640
overview even shorter than the second

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,560
parts overview and then we're going to

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,759
be diving into two main sections today

58
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,479
ryan is going to be leading a section on

59
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,560
the neural process theory

60
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,080
and then christopher is going to be

61
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,800
leading a section on hierarchical models

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,440
so two very interesting topics let's

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,400
just start with

64
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,520
one warm-up introductory question before

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
we go to the neural process theory

66
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,360
and my question would be let's say

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,560
somebody were sent

68
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,879
just this third part of this four part

69
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,080
series

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,400
what would you say is the summary of the

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,840
first two parts that we can catch them

72
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,680
up with right now before we jump into

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,360
these next two parts so what happened in

74
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,400
the first two parts

75
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,560
that led us to want to talk about the

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,760
neural process theory and the

77
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,959
hierarchical modeling today

78
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,280
um okay well i can try to start to take

79
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,120
a stab chris feel free to add anything

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,280
but it's obviously a lot to summarize in

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,640
uh just a couple

82
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,920
uh seconds here but in session

83
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,640
one primarily we went over the kind of

84
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:00,959
like

85
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,959
broad um broad stroke sort of

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,800
description of active inference

87
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,519
um the ideas of how you can do

88
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,440
approximate bayesian inference to solve

89
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,959
problems with perception and learning

90
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,400
and decision making

91
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,120
using uh free energy minimization and

92
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,239
expected free energy

93
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,120
energy minimization um where exact

94
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,560
bayesian inference just becomes

95
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,280
intractable

96
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,000
for most kind of real world problems

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,080
when you're trying to

98
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,319
do something cognitive or perceptual

99
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,599
and then we went over how to build

100
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,319
specific

101
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,599
task models um and specifically

102
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,760
we used an explore exploit a simple sort

103
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,360
of explore exploit model

104
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,680
um similar to any you know a kind of

105
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,440
behavioral task that you might use

106
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,159
in an empirical study and we just showed

107
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,599
how

108
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,640
at the level of matrices and vectors and

109
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,920
things like that how you specify a

110
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,760
generative model

111
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,680
in order to simulate behavior on that

112
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,239
kind of task

113
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,120
and that's more or less what we've

114
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
covered so far so

115
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,480
the kind of general mathematics and

116
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,480
motivation of active inference

117
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,599
and how to apply it to um to

118
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,120
model tasks but that was all

119
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,720
like i said at the kind of computational

120
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,519
and algorithmic level of description

121
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,079
um whereas one of the really nice things

122
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,320
about active inference is that

123
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,720
you have not only the computational

124
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,000
algorithmic level but you

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,160
also have an attached what's called a

126
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,759
neural process theory

127
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,080
which more or less corresponds to a

128
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,000
specific hypothesis

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,400
about ways that neurons and neural

130
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,800
populations can be connected up

131
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,360
in plausible ways to implement the

132
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,120
active inference algorithms

133
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,800
and specifically the variational

134
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,680
updating algorithms that are used

135
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,720
to solve the sorts of tasks

136
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,240
that you use to model with active

137
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,000
inference so that's kind of where we're

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,120
picking up is

139
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,639
now that we've got the now that we can

140
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,919
build models and understand their

141
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:00,960
background

142
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,039
and motivation you know how can we

143
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,199
actually move this into neuroscience and

144
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:05,840
make

145
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,720
um make uh trial by trial predictions

146
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,400
about what neural responses you ought to

147
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,960
see

148
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,039
which you could for example feed in um

149
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,280
to like an fmri experiment

150
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,560
to see if you can actually find

151
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,720
correlates of those uh predicted trial

152
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,600
by trial responses

153
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,680
and just kind of add to that i think the

154
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,199
general way that you would

155
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,280
feed it into an fmri experiment would

156
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,639
just be the standard way that people

157
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,080
usually do this stuff so you just put it

158
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,600
in and add it as a regressor

159
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,440
in um into a glam yeah

160
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,960
and as you'll as you'll see we can also

161
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,120
do it's not just fmri you can also do it

162
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,160
i mean we

163
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,400
the the most direct predictions it makes

164
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,360
are about earpiece

165
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,039
and eeg so and we're going to talk about

166
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,000
what the erp is and the biology of it a

167
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,120
little bit along the way

168
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,800
and other frameworks for how people have

169
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,320
interpreted it but yes

170
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,680
as we've kind of looked at a few

171
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
different times there's the observables

172
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,960
which are the behavior

173
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,160
or the neural imaging whether it's fmri

174
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,240
or eeg or some other type of measurement

175
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,520
technique and then there's the

176
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,800
measurement of behavior

177
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,479
and we're talking about models that

178
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,319
start from those observables

179
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,639
and then do some interesting generative

180
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,919
modeling under the hood

181
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,000
and that's where the power arises from

182
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,919
so any other comments on that max before

183
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,479
we jump

184
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,240
into part one with the neural process

185
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,560
theory

186
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
no i'm just uh like i said last time i'm

187
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,680
excited to hear about

188
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,840
um tying and relating specifically you

189
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,120
know gradients

190
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,160
on you know variational free energy to

191
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,840
you know dopamine expression and just

192
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,120
hearing about like the links between

193
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,680
those

194
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,880
and why that might be an elegant way um

195
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,680
to um kind of express things in terms of

196
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,039
the neural process theory

197
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,880
and what we know about the connectivity

198
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,120
of these regions and things like that

199
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,039
sounds good then ryan take it away

200
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,080
okay so let me just

201
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:03,840
share my screen here

202
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,280
um okay so just um

203
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,400
as a kind of very brief um you know sort

204
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,199
of just

205
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,960
catch people up a bit um

206
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,720
um so we we started out

207
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,240
you know like describing active

208
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,319
inference um like i said at the level of

209
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,840
generative models

210
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,880
um and those uh sorry i'm trying to find

211
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,560
the right

212
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,000
figure here yeah

213
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,840
um and those have

214
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,319
this particular sort of graphical

215
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,080
structure

216
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,520
and just focusing on the one on the

217
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,879
bottom right here which is the full

218
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,160
generative model

219
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,280
you have a particular set of

220
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,520
observations over time this 010203 thing

221
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,039
and then you have particular hidden

222
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,919
states so beliefs about what's going on

223
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,800
out in the world

224
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,199
outside of the brain and so you have

225
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,800
your beliefs about what happened at time

226
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,280
one

227
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,759
and then time two and then time three

228
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,000
and this a matrix thing

229
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,960
um is what encodes the likelihood

230
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,879
mapping or the belief about what

231
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,919
outcomes

232
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,800
will be present if particular states out

233
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
in the world

234
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,199
are the case um and then you have

235
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,400
beliefs about how

236
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,599
in this b matrix thing here about how if

237
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,440
you're in particular states at time one

238
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,800
how that's going to transition into

239
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,080
different states at time two

240
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,120
um and so forth and uh this d

241
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,599
thing is just an initial prior um about

242
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,839
what states are going to be at time one

243
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,200
um and then you have policies pi up here

244
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,360
which control which allow the agent to

245
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,640
control some of the

246
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,519
transitions between states um so for

247
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,120
instance the transition of

248
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,519
moving my leg up versus down right would

249
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,839
be something that the agent could

250
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,560
control

251
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,839
and then policies are selected based on

252
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,680
this g thing which is the expected free

253
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,600
energy which is a function of

254
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,839
c which is your preferences so the

255
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,640
outcomes that you prefer over others

256
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,200
so policies are selected that are gonna

257
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,600
transition between states that generate

258
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,680
outcomes or observations that are as

259
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,880
close to preferences

260
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,080
as possible um and then policies

261
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,200
are also um in part controlled by e

262
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,600
which is a prior over policies that acts

263
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,640
as a kind of

264
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,680
influence of habits and this gamma thing

265
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,760
which will be important in the neural

266
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,600
process theory i'll talk about

267
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
which is um it's essentially it's like a

268
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,640
temperature parameter more or less

269
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
on like a dynamically updated

270
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,480
temperature parameter that

271
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,760
basically controls um how much

272
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,360
the expected free energy contributes to

273
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,880
policy selection so it's basically

274
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,600
saying if i don't trust my model very

275
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,480
much

276
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,320
then policy selection is going to be

277
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,640
influenced by expected free energy less

278
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,000
and by habits uh more um and the way the

279
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,200
gamma is updated is

280
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,320
through this hyperparameter beta

281
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,200
which again i'll uh i'll uh you know we

282
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,480
covered this a little more detail last

283
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,600
time but i'm just kind of reminding the

284
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,720
reader about

285
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,360
the elements that are going to

286
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,240
correspond

287
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,640
to different aspects of the of the

288
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,320
neural process theory

289
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,519
um so it just might only happen

290
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,360
my only comment on this is again think

291
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,720
about incremental

292
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,560
layers of complexity in the model on the

293
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,720
top left is static perception

294
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,800
hidden states observable states and

295
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,000
you're doing inference on the hidden

296
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,399
states s given your prior d so

297
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,920
instantaneous

298
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,079
hidden state inference given observables

299
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,839
bottom left you're talking about hidden

300
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,560
states

301
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,160
changing through time with the inference

302
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,600
of a b matrix

303
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,320
top right you introduce the idea that pi

304
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,120
policy

305
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,279
is going to intervene into how states

306
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,320
change through time

307
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,240
and that that policy is selected by a

308
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,760
preference c

309
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,680
that gets transmuted into a free energy

310
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,000
g and then the bottom right is the full

311
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,200
fleshed-out skeleton where we also see e

312
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,279
gamma and beta as described by right so

313
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,560
just start top left

314
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,120
bottom left top right bottom right and

315
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,160
that's adding up

316
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,000
one more thing for each layer of the

317
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,120
model and then now we're going to be

318
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,519
working with the bottom right model

319
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,079
yep and um and the the last sort of

320
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,519
important thing is is about the

321
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,680
the underlying way so each of these

322
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,880
equations

323
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,959
um on the at each of these boxes

324
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,640
um the the way that you infer beliefs

325
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,120
about

326
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,079
states based on observations is through

327
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,560
a set of equations that correspond to

328
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,000
approximate bayesian inference through

329
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,240
minimizing free energy and expected for

330
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,600
energy

331
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,640
so the idea is more or less how the

332
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
system how in the neural process theory

333
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,640
does the system settle on

334
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,279
a set of posterior beliefs over states

335
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,240
through free energy

336
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,680
free energy minimization and how in the

337
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,160
brain um that's going to correspond to

338
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,600
the neural process theory

339
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,680
to minimizing particular types of

340
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,880
prediction errors

341
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,279
um now but i want to be clear though the

342
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,040
these sorts of prediction errors are not

343
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,839
identical

344
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,519
right this is not the same process

345
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,800
theory as what's associated with

346
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,040
predictive coding and perception

347
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,720
where predictive coding is a continuous

348
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,560
state-space model as opposed to the

349
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,079
discrete state-space models we're

350
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,000
talking about that have categories

351
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,600
right you can only be in state one state

352
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,000
two state three as opposed to

353
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,760
these sorts of continuous state spaces

354
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,440
associated with things like

355
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,480
brightness for example um

356
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,040
so so this is this has a similar kind of

357
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,959
prediction or minimization flavor

358
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,639
to predictive coding models but it's not

359
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,959
the same thing um

360
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,079
so now um

361
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,519
to start with um kind of abstractly

362
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,000
the the way to see how prediction errors

363
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,760
come in really naturally

364
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,440
is just to remember that free energy

365
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,839
right one one decomposition that we've

366
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,000
talked about in previous sessions

367
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,839
is you can think of free energy as to be

368
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,320
being decomposed into a complexity term

369
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,680
minus an accuracy term um where accuracy

370
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,000
just

371
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,800
means basically how close your predicted

372
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,600
outcomes are

373
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,880
to um the observed outcomes

374
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,920
and complexity corresponds to basically

375
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,839
how much you have to move your beliefs

376
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,680
um from prior beliefs to posterior

377
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,120
beliefs so

378
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,680
minimizing free energy means coming to

379
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,959
the beliefs that

380
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,120
um change your beliefs as little as

381
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,240
possible while also maximizing accuracy

382
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,360
um so so that's the kind of idea and a

383
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,519
very kind of intuitive way to think

384
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,560
of free energy

385
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,839
and so given that definition

386
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,360
you can think of the gradients or the

387
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
way that free energy changes

388
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,639
with respect to these approximate

389
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,079
posterior beliefs that we're trying to

390
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,120
come to

391
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,360
right these can always be expressed as a

392
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,839
particular mixture of prediction errors

393
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:54,959
and you think about this is pretty

394
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,279
intuitive because complexity like i said

395
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:57,600
is

396
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
just the average difference between

397
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,680
posterior and prior beliefs

398
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,880
so minimizing that difference can be

399
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,839
seen as a type of prediction error

400
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,399
and minimizing and then accuracy is

401
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,160
similarly just the difference between

402
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,240
predicted and observed outcomes

403
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,320
so minimizing that difference can also

404
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,519
be seen as a

405
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,959
as a type of prediction error so

406
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,199
active inference can be implemented then

407
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,079
um

408
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,440
as this kind of prediction error

409
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,000
minimization that just corresponds to a

410
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,279
minimization of these two

411
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,560
differences at a computational level of

412
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,399
description as opposed to an algorithmic

413
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,040
or neural

414
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,399
level description so the

415
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,120
the kind of standard and fairly daunting

416
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,639
looking figures that you'll typically

417
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,199
see

418
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,040
in active inference papers associated

419
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,800
with the neural process theory

420
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,519
looks something like this so on the left

421
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,519
you have a bunch of initially pretty

422
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,120
scary um you know equations

423
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,199
that correspond to the the actual kind

424
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,880
of dynamics that a neural system is

425
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,320
going to have to implement

426
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,440
um and then on the right these kind of

427
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,399
little

428
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,199
fun kind of schematic ball neuron setups

429
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,800
where you have particular

430
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,120
layers that are supposed to kind of um

431
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,720
you know kind of heuristically perhaps

432
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,920
correspond to different

433
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,440
um different layers of neurons and

434
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,959
cortical columns

435
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,160
um and each of these layers of neurons

436
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,519
are sort of proposed again very just

437
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,279
kind of like schematically

438
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,759
to correspond to different variables in

439
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,519
the equations over here

440
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,920
and the synaptic connections correspond

441
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,120
to particular

442
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,320
mathematical operations so

443
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,759
um so here kind of the easy way to think

444
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,040
about it is that

445
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,440
these uh red connections here are

446
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,600
excitatory or excitatory just means

447
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,399
addition

448
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,639
in the equations whereas these

449
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,759
inhibitory

450
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,720
uh blueish purple connections with the

451
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,360
balls at the end instead of the arrows

452
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,199
are inhibitory which just means

453
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,519
subtraction in the equations

454
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,839
whereas the green modulatory connections

455
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,680
um that just corresponds to

456
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,360
multiplication um

457
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,199
in the update equations on the in the

458
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,720
other side of the panel so the idea is

459
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,279
that

460
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,800
you can use this kind of using this kind

461
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,199
of scheme you can just follow along

462
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,519
you know just follow the synapses and

463
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,839
the ball neurons that correspond to the

464
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,440
particular variables

465
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,399
um and you can kind of get a sense of

466
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:26,959
how

467
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,320
you can just connect up neurons like

468
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,240
this to

469
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,920
solve the equations that need to be

470
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,639
solved to implement active inference

471
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,720
just say one thing about this i think

472
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,639
makes it a little bit more intuitive

473
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,199
so because all of the updates are done

474
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,639
in log space

475
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,079
addition and um face click adding or

476
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,519
putting probability distributions

477
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,880
together is just addition and

478
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,120
subtraction

479
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,880
which is nice thinking about in terms of

480
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,040
this scheme and then generally speaking

481
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,639
the modulatory connections will

482
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,639
correspond to some precision parameter

483
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,720
which will modulate the precision of a

484
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,559
distribution if that makes sense

485
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,679
so that's kind of how you can think

486
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,520
about the rule or i find that helpful in

487
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,959
thinking about the relationship between

488
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,720
something like this

489
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,799
and the actual update equations

490
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,640
themselves

491
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,559
yeah no absolutely uh yeah thanks for

492
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,000
adding that it's almost like

493
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,640
the anatomy of the model we're doing a

494
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,520
schematic

495
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,760
neuroanatomy that's simplified or

496
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,679
abstracted based upon the actual

497
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,439
patterns of neural connections

498
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,840
and then we're looking at the anatomy of

499
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,039
this computational

500
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,120
model and thinking about how it could be

501
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,720
plausibly carried out on

502
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,440
neural uh systems neural processes but

503
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
also it stands alone and so this is just

504
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,679
another way that we can look at it

505
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,320
yeah so so another thing that i really

506
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,039
want to be

507
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,799
clear about is that active inference per

508
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,200
se

509
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,160
isn't committed to this particular

510
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,440
implementation

511
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
there's there's quite a few different

512
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,280
ways that you could come up with

513
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,360
to connect a bunch of neurons together

514
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,039
to solve these equations

515
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,080
so there's there's not kind of a

516
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,160
one-to-one mapping between

517
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,640
the way that the equations look and the

518
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,320
way that neurons could solve those

519
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,919
equations

520
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,960
so this is an example but ultimately

521
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,000
it's a separate empirical

522
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,600
question what way uh the brain is

523
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,559
actually set up

524
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,400
to solve these equations even if those

525
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,640
equations are what are being solved

526
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,840
um yeah exactly and even if so then we

527
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,640
can also

528
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,080
let's say it turns out variational

529
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,679
message passing or like marginal message

530
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,799
passing is just a really bad

531
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,240
metaphor well that's fine because we've

532
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,440
got all sorts of other things like

533
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,400
belief propagation blah blah blah

534
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,760
and they can all i think

535
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,320
the main thing is that you're minimizing

536
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,160
variational free energy

537
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,799
and expected free energy the rest is

538
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,280
part of

539
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
specific parts of a process theory that

540
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,440
we can

541
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,080
hopefully falsify or at least more

542
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,120
realistically

543
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,160
not find useful anymore yeah so let's

544
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,760
just sorry one more note on that you

545
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,440
brought up how there's the computational

546
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,039
and the algorithmic levels and we're in

547
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,799
the process theory realm so for those

548
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,160
who might not be familiar with process

549
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,799
theory or

550
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,559
mars levels of analysis the

551
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,640
computational level is like the function

552
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,559
like you have to sort a list from the

553
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,840
biggest to the smallest

554
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,240
you can't falsify that idea it's

555
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,160
computational it's functional

556
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,080
then you go one layer down into the

557
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,760
algorithm so you say i have a sorting

558
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,039
algorithm there's many

559
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,960
sorting algorithms but this is the

560
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,160
implementation as

561
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,400
it's actually going to be written in a

562
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,760
certain pseudo code

563
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,600
so that's one of many possible

564
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,880
algorithms that do a certain

565
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,799
computational task like sorting

566
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,640
and then the process theory is like the

567
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,880
specific program you can think of

568
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,760
it's the actual implementation now as to

569
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,440
whether it's actually being implemented

570
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,160
that way

571
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,080
you might be right or wrong so that's

572
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,919
what we're talking about with the false

573
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,559
falsification of the process theory but

574
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,160
at the computational level

575
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,080
it's what christopher just said it's the

576
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,520
imperatives that there's a free energy

577
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,880
minimization happening

578
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
and now we want to be building up

579
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,799
specific plausible examples to work

580
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,000
within that framework

581
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,120
for just to jump in real quick it sounds

582
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,720
like in the next stream we might be

583
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,400
discussing more of these empirical

584
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,799
examples and instantiations but just to

585
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:11,440
say

586
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,360
that from the bio biological standpoint

587
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,880
of what's going on for example when we

588
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,760
talk about a

589
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,480
modulatory layer or that that could

590
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,799
happen in a multitude of different ways

591
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,679
um in in terms of you know changing what

592
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,919
the membrane potential of the cell is

593
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,360
and making it more responsive or

594
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,679
receptive to being activated

595
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,120
or it could happen through you know

596
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,520
gradual um plastic processes that

597
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,000
recruit

598
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,960
more receptors to the um to the surface

599
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,640
and cause it to become more responsive

600
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,799
to any individual message so it's really

601
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,400
going to be context specific

602
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,200
and depend on the experiment and what um

603
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,600
circuit we are specifically studying

604
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,679
uh yeah absolutely and i mean the the

605
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,440
thing you mentioned about plasticity

606
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,280
uh makes an important point that i yeah

607
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,480
i should make sure that

608
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,320
i you know i might have forgot to

609
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,919
mention but but so

610
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,080
in the context of inference right over

611
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,520
the shortest time scales

612
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,760
we're just getting observations right

613
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,600
and based on the way that these

614
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,880
the current weights of all these

615
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,039
connections the system is just going to

616
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:09,840
settle

617
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,159
on a free energy minimum right like a

618
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,760
predictionary minimum

619
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,640
and then the the activation patterns in

620
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,600
these neurons

621
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,360
specifically these ones at the top here

622
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,640
the s pi t and

623
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,679
s or s pythau and s tau are gonna be the

624
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:24,640
posterior

625
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,400
beliefs about what states you're in um

626
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,039
and uh but that's again just given a

627
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,720
fixed set of synaptic connections that

628
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,840
corresponds to

629
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,039
your generative model now um

630
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,440
but with learning like we discussed last

631
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,600
time when we shift learning simulations

632
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,640
learning corresponds to slowly changing

633
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,280
the synaptic the strength of the uh each

634
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,640
of these synaptic connections

635
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,520
themselves um so you also over slower

636
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,320
time scales

637
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
minimize expected free energy and

638
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,919
variational free energy

639
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,520
um through um through changing these

640
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,880
connection strengths

641
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,679
um again over slower time scales via

642
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,000
kind of synaptic plasticity processes

643
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
um like long-term potentiation and

644
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,919
long-term depression for example

645
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,480
um as a way of improving the accuracy of

646
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,840
your generative model

647
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,679
um so so just to kind of reiterate

648
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,280
inference corresponds to changing

649
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
activity levels whereas learning

650
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,720
corresponds to changing synaptic

651
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,840
strengths

652
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,840
um so if that's if that's uh helpful

653
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,640
um so so again yeah i mean like like

654
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,840
they were saying you have

655
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,200
basically three different levels of

656
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,960
hypotheses to test one is

657
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
at the computational level does the

658
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,559
brain uh

659
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,400
minimize free energy and expected free

660
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,760
energy or at least

661
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,559
is it helpful to describe it as doing

662
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,280
that

663
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,440
um and then second question is given

664
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,200
that that first one is true

665
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,120
which of several different algorithms is

666
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,400
the brain using

667
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,000
and then question three is given that

668
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,799
it's using a given a specific algorithm

669
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,679
how are the how is the brain set up to

670
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,000
uh

671
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,679
implement that algorithm so there's kind

672
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,200
of a one-to-many mapping between each

673
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,080
level

674
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,799
um and a final point to make is actually

675
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,320
some people talk about these different

676
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,840
you know are called quote unquote marion

677
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,799
levels

678
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,520
of computational level algorithmic level

679
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,880
and implementation level

680
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,159
people talk about them as though they're

681
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,240
entirely independent um but they're

682
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,960
actually

683
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,360
not necessarily independent in all cases

684
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,559
because sometimes

685
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,600
the algorithm can depend a bit that can

686
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,039
be dependencies

687
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,080
between the algorithm and the

688
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,400
implementation because some of the

689
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,280
things that the

690
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,960
algorithm is going to have to compute

691
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,480
are things about for instance like

692
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,080
energy costs

693
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,840
which are going to depend on the

694
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,440
implementation um

695
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,520
so anyway just as kind of a side point

696
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,799
um

697
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,000
but um but in general um just to kind of

698
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,279
you know walk you through

699
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,880
you know a sense here so you might start

700
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,159
out with these observations at the

701
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,200
bottom

702
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,559
right and these are going to go up

703
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,400
through these excitatory connections

704
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,880
to this pink layer 3 here which is going

705
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,559
to correspond to the state prediction

706
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,279
error

707
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,960
we'll talk about so these excitatory

708
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,279
connections are going to drive increases

709
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,360
in activity in these pink guys

710
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,200
and those are going to be inhibited by

711
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,039
prior beliefs about states at this

712
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,480
higher level

713
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,799
which jointly right is going to lead

714
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,400
this uh

715
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,240
this level to decrease

716
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,039
while the system finds states up here at

717
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:23,440
the

718
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,440
level above that best account for

719
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,799
um or predict those observations um

720
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,720
so these red arrows going up here um

721
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,919
can correspond to interactions between a

722
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,760
and o in these equations um

723
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,679
and so you can kind of you can walk your

724
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,440
way through kind of step by step and we

725
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,799
do this kind of step by step in the

726
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:47,600
paper

727
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,120
where each of these interactions

728
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,320
corresponds to elements in the equations

729
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,440
so for instance like to get states

730
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,960
to get states up here right that

731
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,480
corresponds to this

732
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,960
fourth equation down and that's by

733
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,080
multiplying

734
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,799
policies um by states given policies

735
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,919
right so pi here

736
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,840
multiplying the

737
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,880
the s's and the t's here that are added

738
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,520
so

739
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,400
we'll lead to the posteriors over states

740
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,000
just as one example

741
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,320
um and then another thing that's

742
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,200
important to

743
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,279
um to stress is a lot of times you'll

744
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,360
you'll notice in these uh diagrams that

745
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,320
there are kind of

746
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,039
multiple uh rows kind of going back

747
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,720
right so there's like these three

748
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,080
pink ones and then these three other

749
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,000
pink ones behind them um

750
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,440
and that's because um each of these

751
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,520
uh posterior beliefs over states the

752
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,200
system is trying to come to

753
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
um are with respect to a particular

754
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,240
policy

755
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,880
so the thing is actually calculating

756
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,360
what its beliefs would be

757
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,200
under each of many policies where each

758
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,960
of these rows corresponds to

759
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,640
a policy and that's what allows it to

760
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,440
then infer a distribution over policies

761
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,960
based on the states

762
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,880
that are expected under each policy and

763
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,320
the outcomes that they would are

764
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,720
expected to generate

765
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,279
so so again i'm not going to kind of do

766
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,320
this for you

767
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,480
now just because it would take forever

768
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,400
but if you just kind of look at each of

769
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,080
these equations

770
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,600
you know where addition is where

771
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,520
multiplication is etcetera then you'll

772
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,240
find

773
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,320
um that these connections um

774
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,960
you know basically reiterate or or show

775
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,440
how

776
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,559
uh uh how this can implement

777
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,720
uh how the neural connections can

778
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,840
implement each of these equation

779
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,039
equations

780
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,320
um but um

781
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,440
to uh to kind of go into certain

782
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,960
aspects of how this would work and where

783
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,720
the neural processor really really comes

784
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,159
in in terms of making

785
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,279
um empirical predictions just

786
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,520
just just to jump in real quick um for

787
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,360
the sake of moving forward um just to

788
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,640
help me thinking about

789
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,720
what the biology is as we start to talk

790
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,000
about the neural process theory

791
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,960
here you have um pie and you have kind

792
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,520
of like

793
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,279
you know connections that are inhibitory

794
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,880
excitatory um

795
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,640
sometimes when i think about phenomena

796
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,919
in in the biology

797
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,320
you know you have an emergent concept

798
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,760
that that's the result

799
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,799
of kind of a population of cells in this

800
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,840
case would it be

801
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,760
um better to think of this uh like a

802
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,279
policy as the actual

803
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,960
like you know the activation i'm looking

804
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,799
at a single neuron or am i going to be

805
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,520
thinking about

806
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,320
that like at a you know a layer or a

807
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,520
population level

808
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
oh yeah yeah very very good point i mean

809
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,960
like i said these are very schematic and

810
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,720
in any active inference paper you'll see

811
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,080
that you know the statement as the

812
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,360
cheese balls is supposed to correspond

813
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,039
to a population of neurons

814
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,520
okay right so a population where i mean

815
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,640
just as one example

816
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,039
right like one subset of neurons in a

817
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,559
given population might encode the

818
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,159
expected free energy of

819
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,279
each policy right so activation across

820
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,960
the population of neurons would code

821
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,440
for instance a distribution over um all

822
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,960
the policies being considered

823
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,480
um or something something along those

824
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,080
lines so yeah no no no one's

825
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,080
no one's thinking about this as uh each

826
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,919
of these being you know single neurons

827
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,679
that are solving um all this i mean that

828
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,399
would be

829
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,600
um uh really it'd be a really vulnerable

830
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,640
system

831
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,640
very little damage that system would uh

832
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,480
would knock the whole thing out

833
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,679
um so um so so yes definitely they're

834
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:22,399
they're

835
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,919
supposed to correspond to populations

836
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,600
but a lot of the details of that is

837
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,080
really um kind of underspecified in the

838
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,600
in the theory as stated it's still

839
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,640
fairly abstract

840
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,360
um kind of at the level i'm showing here

841
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,720
um

842
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,240
so uh so is that is that

843
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,520
that helpful yeah yeah that does

844
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,120
okay um so okay

845
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,200
so the first ones here to focus on the

846
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,480
left are

847
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,320
so this epsilon pi tau thing

848
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,000
um and this is what's called state

849
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,360
prediction error

850
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,559
um and more or less what this does

851
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,880
is by minimizing this we end up with a

852
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,880
posterior over states

853
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,480
um and then the actual variational free

854
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,840
energy for each policy is just

855
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,039
calculated

856
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,279
based on beliefs about states and that

857
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,640
error signal

858
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,480
um so and this corresponds to

859
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,159
layer three um and layer two here

860
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,279
um in the um in the uh

861
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,480
schematic on the on the right um

862
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,760
so to um to give you a sense so in the

863
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,919
paper we show a specific example like a

864
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,679
worked example of calculating this kind

865
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,039
of prediction error

866
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,799
um and so what this says so this is the

867
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,159
prediction error for each

868
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,559
policy for each time point tau

869
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,480
and the the first part here this one

870
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,480
half ln

871
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,080
b pi tau s pi tau minus one et cetera

872
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,039
all the way over

873
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,039
the whole thing here with the b's that

874
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,240
are multiplied

875
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,399
by one half you can think of this whole

876
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,360
entire thing

877
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,880
as your prior expectation so

878
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,240
b from pi tau minus one um

879
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,880
this is saying what do i expect about my

880
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,000
current state

881
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,919
given the state that i was just in

882
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,200
before

883
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,840
um whereas this one is something a

884
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,120
little more interesting

885
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,360
it's saying um this is saying sort of

886
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,320
beliefs about

887
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,799
um expectations that come from the

888
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,760
future

889
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,559
so you know what are my beliefs about a

890
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,320
state at a given time

891
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,159
given my beliefs about the state after

892
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,919
that um

893
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,679
and um you know this this might seem a

894
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,159
little bit counterintuitive but um

895
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,440
it allows for uh retrospective inference

896
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,799
um which is something that humans

897
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,799
definitely do so think about think about

898
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,799
a case where you're sitting in a room

899
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,200
and it's dark and you don't know whether

900
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,960
the room is the green room or the red

901
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,120
room um

902
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,559
and but you sit there for like five

903
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,240
minutes and then all of a sudden you

904
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,120
turn on the light

905
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,519
and you see that the room is red you

906
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,840
don't just infer i'm in a red room now

907
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,919
you infer i've been in a red room the

908
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,519
whole time

909
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,519
so your beliefs about the past are

910
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,200
updated based on your

911
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,880
beliefs about the current time point so

912
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,760
what this this second be here so

913
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,880
expectations

914
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,440
propagating from the future to the past

915
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,120
allows you to come

916
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
to beliefs about the states you were in

917
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,880
at earlier times based on beliefs about

918
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,240
later times

919
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,120
um and um and so so it's important to

920
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,640
also reiterate here that

921
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,760
each of these s's um s for pi you know s

922
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,000
pi

923
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,360
tau minus one um these beliefs about

924
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,640
each s at each time point are updated

925
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,679
at every time point so at time three i

926
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,360
can observe something and update my

927
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,559
belief about

928
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,360
the state at time one um so this is kind

929
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,159
of being

930
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,519
recomputed at each time point with a new

931
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,159
observation but about each time point

932
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,840
um you know in both the past and the

933
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,519
future um

934
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,799
as well as the the present so

935
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,799
so broadly then this whole thing this

936
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,000
one half times

937
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,760
both of these b's and s's is your prior

938
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,840
expectation

939
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,519
and then that gets added to the

940
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,720
likelihood function here which is so a

941
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,120
um times o which is the actual

942
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,240
observation

943
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,960
um at a given time and so this is like

944
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,679
your

945
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,200
uh this thing together is like your

946
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,960
likelihood um

947
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,399
so this again is very similar um

948
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,480
to uh just kind of another form of

949
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,919
representing uh

950
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,600
bayes theorem where you have priors and

951
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,440
you have a likelihood and you're trying

952
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,399
to come to

953
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,760
something that will inform your

954
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,799
posterior beliefs over states

955
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,679
and then that whole thing is subtracted

956
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:46,159
from

957
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,240
beliefs about the current state at that

958
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,760
moment

959
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,399
and more or less if you just kind of run

960
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,399
this over and over again

961
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,480
you'll settle on a set of beliefs about

962
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,919
states that minimizes

963
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,799
um this thing um and just to show an

964
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,240
example of that

965
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,279
um we specify here um

966
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,279
you know what a could look like right so

967
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,480
in this case

968
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,880
um state one versus state two the two

969
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,880
columns state one would generate

970
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,159
say observation one um with point

971
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,919
eight um whereas state two here

972
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,360
right and the right column would

973
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,919
generate outcome one with point 0.4

974
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,080
and so forth so that would be your

975
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,720
likelihood

976
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,360
now b here like i said before this is

977
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,559
your prior from

978
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,640
based on the previous time point and

979
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,679
here we're just saying

980
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,039
column again here is state at time

981
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,039
tau and rho is at time tau minus one or

982
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,480
uh you know from tau minus one or

983
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,159
this is basically this is saying given

984
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,080
that i was in a given that i

985
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,880
was in a state at time tau what is my

986
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,480
belief about the state i'll transition

987
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:54,880
to

988
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,440
so this is saying i believe if i'm in

989
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,080
state one

990
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,600
i'm most likely staying at state one

991
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,360
but there's a point two probability that

992
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,039
i could move to state two um

993
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,719
whereas the um be pi tau

994
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,159
is point three point three and point

995
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,760
seven point seven which means no matter

996
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,679
what i expect it's more likely i'm gonna

997
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,679
move to state two

998
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,199
um and then what i actually observe is

999
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:26,000
outcome one um and my prior beliefs

1000
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,280
are just 0.5.5 so i have no

1001
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,199
i didn't have a strong prior either way

1002
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,399
to start with

1003
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,839
um and this v thing is um just a

1004
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:36,960
depolarization

1005
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,359
uh variable which doesn't come into this

1006
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,719
uh predictionary equation

1007
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,800
well so i'll just kind of leave that for

1008
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,760
below

1009
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,639
but so this is just an example of how if

1010
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,320
you plug in

1011
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,480
each of these things into this equation

1012
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,399
then just kind of follow along with the

1013
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,000
numbers eventually

1014
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,760
you'll end up with this prediction error

1015
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,920
this negative point two two three one

1016
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,119
negative point nine nine

1017
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,839
nine one six three um and uh

1018
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,560
and you can think about so then if we

1019
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,200
move

1020
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,560
uh here

1021
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,960
then we can take this v which is your

1022
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,920
initial

1023
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,200
kind of depolarization um uh

1024
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,920
level in a given neuron then you add the

1025
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,680
prediction error to that

1026
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,920
um so the depolarization depolarization

1027
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,920
level changes

1028
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,280
so this would be a change in the

1029
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,040
activity level of the neuron in terms of

1030
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,720
depolarization

1031
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,680
but then posteriors over states then

1032
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,599
correspond to

1033
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,160
normalizing putting a softmax over this

1034
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,440
depolarization

1035
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,119
which then turns it into your actual

1036
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,359
posterior over states

1037
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,520
so this is b so this ultimately says my

1038
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,200
posterior belief is that

1039
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,200
i'm more likely in state one you know

1040
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,240
0.66767

1041
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,560
then in being in state two point three

1042
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,760
through three three

1043
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,400
um and this then would correspond to the

1044
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,599
firing rates

1045
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,400
um in the process theory um associated

1046
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,040
with

1047
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,079
um uh each possible state

1048
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,280
so v is to be your depolarization

1049
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,599
um and s is going to be the resulting

1050
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,800
firing rates

1051
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
yeah just add something to this so

1052
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,400
generally thinking

1053
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,079
e here or sorry not e epsilon yeah

1054
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,119
yeah a little epsilon is a free energy

1055
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,040
gradient

1056
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,839
um it is a variational free energy

1057
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:32,560
gradient

1058
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,880
and then this also what would what we

1059
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,720
end up doing here when we're adding

1060
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,960
essentially when we have v when we're

1061
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,000
plussing our free

1062
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,359
our negative friendship gradient we're

1063
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,200
essentially just doing a gradient

1064
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,920
descent

1065
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,520
on variational free energy that's

1066
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,280
exactly what this is actually

1067
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,480
and that's how it's implemented in the

1068
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,720
code the only difference between this

1069
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,079
and what we're doing in the code is that

1070
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,200
we have little steps

1071
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,240
have a little step thing so we divide

1072
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,599
our epsilon by like two or whatever our

1073
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,640
time constant for gradient descent is so

1074
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,119
when

1075
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,880
you know tying it back to that previous

1076
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,640
uh schematic that we had

1077
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,240
where we had the arrows that were

1078
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,480
excitatory and here we're adding this on

1079
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,440
to the

1080
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,359
putative you know membrane potential

1081
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,119
that we have described here that might

1082
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,119
reflect these kind of probabilities

1083
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,880
then if we have this kind of perhaps

1084
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,960
this if this were an excitatory

1085
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,000
interaction that we were looking

1086
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,320
at then maybe if that excitatory

1087
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,359
interaction from

1088
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,760
one particular layer to another was

1089
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,880
representing that

1090
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,839
uh variational free energy gradient we

1091
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:32,960
might expect to see this kind of

1092
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,560
response and we might measure that in

1093
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,320
terms of some kind of related

1094
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,680
you know uh bio like biomarker

1095
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,880
um of interest is that more or less than

1096
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,839
just

1097
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,560
yeah i mean so well i mean just to go

1098
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,000
back to the kind of schematic here

1099
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,160
like where this is happening is like

1100
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,000
right here right so you have b

1101
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,760
from time one right which is this purple

1102
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,480
guy

1103
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,720
so s through b from the previous time

1104
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,520
point

1105
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,160
adds on to the prediction error at the

1106
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,520
current time point

1107
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,640
and s from the future

1108
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,520
belief about the future also adds here

1109
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,480
whereas

1110
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,640
the likelihood a um

1111
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,640
yeah is added from from oh uh

1112
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,119
there's this inventory thing here um

1113
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,760
anyway i mean so that's that's the uh

1114
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,960
i have to walk through a little bit to

1115
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,119
figure out where this uh

1116
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,880
inhibitory what this inhibitory one is

1117
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,000
coming from um

1118
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,880
oh this is the minus ln yeah the current

1119
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,599
state

1120
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,960
yeah um yeah okay but anyway so that's

1121
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,000
that's kind of as an example um but

1122
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,280
uh but yeah so

1123
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,760
so by doing that you get this posterior

1124
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,359
over states that gives you

1125
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,240
both uh predicted depolarization levels

1126
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,640
in cells and predicted firing rates

1127
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,000
um that being said um

1128
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,400
those and of themselves are not that

1129
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,200
easy to

1130
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,960
to measure empirically unless you're

1131
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,480
doing like single cell recording or

1132
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,240
something like that

1133
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,920
so the idea that gets taken sort of from

1134
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,800
here

1135
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,560
is how you can get from these predicted

1136
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,240
firing rates to something that you can

1137
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,119
measure

1138
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,160
um like event related potentials in um

1139
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,680
doing eeg or electroencephalography

1140
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,119
where you have a bunch of electrodes

1141
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,599
basically attached to somebody's scalp

1142
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,720
and you're measuring

1143
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,200
changes in neural activity changes in

1144
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,280
potentials

1145
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,000
through the scalp from the brain when a

1146
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,359
person is exposed to a particular

1147
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,440
stimulus

1148
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,280
and the uh the neural process theory

1149
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,200
uh the kind of prediction is that um the

1150
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
erps are gonna correspond to the rate of

1151
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,119
change um

1152
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,000
um in beliefs uh which is gonna be the

1153
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,079
rate of change in um

1154
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,800
where's this slide

1155
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,119
the rate of change in um in v very i've

1156
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:03,920
changed this

1157
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,520
depolarization thing which is going to

1158
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,760
be the prediction error

1159
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,119
so so just to show an example of this

1160
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,680
um that me and chris uh published

1161
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,800
recently

1162
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,000
um in the uh literature on the um on

1163
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,680
visual consciousness

1164
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,920
um you know there's a big interest in in

1165
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,200
what erp's

1166
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,319
um are specific to having conscious

1167
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,520
experience

1168
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,040
um and an example of an erp that

1169
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,400
in the past has been linked to conscious

1170
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,520
experience but

1171
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,760
more recently there's been some sort of

1172
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,960
controversy because it looks like you

1173
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,160
can get

1174
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,880
these p3 potentials in a way that's

1175
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,920
not specific to conscious experience um

1176
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,200
and so we're interested in seeing

1177
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,040
whether the neural process theory

1178
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,160
would allow us to kind of show um where

1179
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,480
this is coming from and could reconcile

1180
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,520
these sorts of results and so it was

1181
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,880
based on this really kind of simple

1182
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,000
paradigm

1183
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,720
where you start out the person starts

1184
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,720
out looking at a stimulus like this

1185
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,480
where there's just these red discs and

1186
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,720
these um kind of slanty lines

1187
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,839
um and then in some trials

1188
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,119
what will happen is they'll kind of

1189
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,160
transiently be a little square here

1190
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,400
that comes up um in the midst of these

1191
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,599
slanty lines

1192
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,720
um then it'll go away um

1193
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,760
and basically what what um what the

1194
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,880
manipulation is

1195
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,520
is in some cases you have the person you

1196
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,200
know focus specifically on these red

1197
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,720
discs on the outside to see if they

1198
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,800
change color

1199
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,960
and then you ask at the end you know did

1200
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,800
you ever notice

1201
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,160
these square things that pop up um

1202
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,000
and there are cases when um

1203
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,839
when they do see the square in cases

1204
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,920
when they don't and you're looking for

1205
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,760
differences in erps corresponding to

1206
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,280
when they do versus they don't

1207
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,560
under conditions of different sorts of

1208
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,960
attention um

1209
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,720
and so what so what we were trying to do

1210
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,240
is to see whether um when you built

1211
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,440
um a an active inference model

1212
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,240
that um that corresponded to this

1213
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,119
particular

1214
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,160
um attention uh

1215
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,040
task um that's called an intentional

1216
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,920
blindness task

1217
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,640
um you know could we reproduce the the

1218
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,520
p3 pattern so this kind of in red here

1219
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,960
this extra um

1220
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,079
dip um in uh

1221
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,280
neural activity as measured by eeg that

1222
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,440
um looks like it typically only happens

1223
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,960
when a person consciously experiences

1224
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,599
something

1225
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,000
but with these recent exceptions where

1226
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,760
it looks like it depends just on whether

1227
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,880
a stimulus is a

1228
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,680
task relevant or not um and chris

1229
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,720
actually i think you know this was

1230
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,079
primarily your work so

1231
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,680
so maybe you could describe this in a

1232
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,920
little more detail yeah yeah so first of

1233
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,520
all i think that just

1234
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,880
give a shout out because we've got to

1235
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,720
reference it on the slides is um this

1236
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,280
paradigm was designed by michael pitts

1237
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,800
um and he has done a lot of really

1238
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,280
incredible empirical work on um visual

1239
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,880
consciousness so

1240
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,800
just kind of important to acknowledge

1241
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,480
that anyway um

1242
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,000
so generally they speak there's three

1243
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
phases in this experiment so phase one

1244
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,280
is they're not told there's going to be

1245
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,599
a square kind of self-assemble

1246
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,119
and they're asked just to monitor the

1247
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,720
disks on the outside

1248
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,040
and then there's a huge literature on

1249
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,079
this but generally speaking in

1250
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,520
intentional blindness when you have a

1251
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,000
setup

1252
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
that's kind of analogous to that about

1253
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,440
50 percent of people

1254
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,920
are intentionally blind to whatever your

1255
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,359
manipulation is

1256
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,280
so i think the really famous one is like

1257
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,480
a group if you ask

1258
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,200
people like monitor um how many times a

1259
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,400
basketball is being passed back and

1260
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,520
forth between a group of people a

1261
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,000
gorilla can walk past and wave at people

1262
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,200
and about 50 of them um don't report

1263
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,720
seeing it

1264
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,760
um so the idea here is just kind of

1265
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,960
operationalize that a little bit more

1266
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,920
carefully

1267
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,160
um and then in phase two is after

1268
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,520
everyone's kind of been because like

1269
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,960
literally when you ask people after

1270
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,400
phase one hey did you see a square

1271
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,760
you're kind of alerting to them the fact

1272
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,839
that there was a square present there

1273
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,440
but it's still not top the square's

1274
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,359
still not task relevant so in phase two

1275
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,720
they just do exactly the same tasks

1276
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,880
monitor the external disks

1277
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,119
um and in phase three the manipulation

1278
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:15,920
is they

1279
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,680
then say okay well we now want you to

1280
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,440
count how many times like hit a button

1281
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,960
whenever the square appears

1282
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,880
and so the idea was was that if you kind

1283
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,720
of see here when we say percent scene we

1284
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,160
basically said a hierarchical model

1285
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,760
which we're going to look at in a minute

1286
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,640
and we just had it kind of report what

1287
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,520
type of trial

1288
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,560
it thought it was in did it see a line

1289
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,040
or not

1290
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,200
where a line was like this categorical

1291
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,240
variable

1292
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,160
or did it see a square um

1293
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,240
and essentially we just in the same way

1294
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,079
that you might in psychophysics like

1295
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:46,960
titrate

1296
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,040
the stimulus or the contrast of a

1297
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,079
stimulus or whatever

1298
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:51,920
until people see it 50 of the time

1299
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,079
basically what we did was we titrated it

1300
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,400
until the model saw it 50 of the time or

1301
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,560
titrated the precision of the a matrix

1302
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,480
kind of corresponding to contrast or

1303
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,079
whatever and then

1304
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,839
we just manipulated attention where

1305
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,000
attention corresponds to basically

1306
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,040
how precise the model's a matrix was

1307
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,200
um and what we showed was that when

1308
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,040
attention which we operationalized was

1309
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,640
basically like we had two steps of

1310
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,640
attention we had focal attention

1311
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,680
and um like

1312
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,079
super precise task relevant attention

1313
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,599
when there was just the focal attention

1314
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,359
condition the model reported seeing the

1315
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:25,760
thing

1316
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,480
99 of the time so basically all the time

1317
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:28,880
and

1318
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,480
when there was precise like task

1319
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,079
relevant detention the model reported

1320
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,599
seeing 100 of the time again

1321
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,440
but we see a dissociation between the

1322
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,720
presence of the p3

1323
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,720
in line with empirical results and so

1324
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,319
the idea so i can actually just

1325
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,599
highlight this since i'm the one with

1326
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:42,720
the cursor

1327
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,800
so so in this first condition so this is

1328
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,040
when uh like chris said the

1329
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,599
you know the thing had no expectation

1330
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:50,880
right that it was gonna that there's

1331
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,560
gonna be any square there

1332
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,880
and um and the precision of the a matrix

1333
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,200
was low because there was no attention

1334
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,480
um so as a result the erp is totally the

1335
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,880
simulated erp is flat

1336
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,960
and similarly this uh the second

1337
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,800
the second dip here which is what would

1338
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,480
correspond to a dip here

1339
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,400
is absent and here at the bottom

1340
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,640
are the simulated firing rates so in the

1341
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,400
first level basically when black at the

1342
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,680
bottom changes to

1343
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,119
black at the top that just means it

1344
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,440
starts to believe the upper row is a

1345
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,640
belief that the

1346
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,880
square was present and the bottom is the

1347
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,720
belief that the square was absent

1348
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,720
so basically what this means is when it

1349
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,480
goes from black at the bottom to black

1350
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,280
at the top

1351
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,599
that the belief changes so it's more

1352
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,359
likely that the stimulus was

1353
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,359
uh present um and then

1354
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,520
but you can see because the a matrix is

1355
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,200
uh imprecise

1356
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,280
then um which corresponds to like a low

1357
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,640
stimulus strength and this

1358
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,839
um then this is not very uh

1359
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,839
you know it's still pretty blurry and

1360
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,119
then at the second level

1361
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,200
these are beliefs about sequences that

1362
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,119
are what's actually gonna in other words

1363
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,920
did it go from no square to square and

1364
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,280
back to no square

1365
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,599
um and you can see that the beliefs

1366
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,520
remain really imprecise

1367
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,040
um because it's not uh it's not

1368
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,920
attending to it it's not task relevant

1369
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,280
um in this case though

1370
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,920
like chris was talking about you can see

1371
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,920
that even though it's not task

1372
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,640
relevant the beliefs at the higher level

1373
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,960
ultimately do converge onto this top row

1374
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,319
which is the one where

1375
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,960
the square was present but you can see

1376
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,079
that the beliefs change pretty gradually

1377
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,400
whereas when attention was precise

1378
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,400
because it was task relevant

1379
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,119
then you can see that the belief changes

1380
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,559
from being kind of flat

1381
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,359
over these two possible top states to

1382
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,160
being

1383
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,200
black fully confident that the square

1384
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,480
uh turned on and off and that

1385
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,520
really quick change in beliefs is what

1386
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,280
corresponds to

1387
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,599
the strong erp and in this case because

1388
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,200
of the higher level it's a kind of late

1389
00:47:59,200 --> 00:47:59,760
erp

1390
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,040
corresponding to the p3 so really what's

1391
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,880
going on is the prediction of the neural

1392
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,319
process theory

1393
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,079
is that it's going to be the rate of

1394
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,720
change in in beliefs

1395
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,800
basically that is what's going to be

1396
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,960
measured as as an erp

1397
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,760
um you have anything further you want to

1398
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,040
say about that chris

1399
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,640
no no not at all i mean one thing i just

1400
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,160
want to highlight is like the the only

1401
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,440
difference between phase one and phase

1402
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,040
two is a very slight difference in the

1403
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,680
precision

1404
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,359
of the a matrix that we um took to

1405
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,520
basically be the addition of some uh

1406
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,319
some slight focal attention

1407
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,559
um and but you can see like just looking

1408
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,200
at the figures like it really made very

1409
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,040
a very minor difference but it still

1410
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,599
bumped it up enough

1411
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,920
above the threshold just enough for it

1412
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,280
to basically go from 50

1413
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,480
report to basically 100 report just

1414
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,839
also one point on the erp or the event

1415
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,680
related potential it's defined on the

1416
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,359
bottom left of the slide

1417
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,599
it's like a population level measure of

1418
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,599
the electromagnetic activity

1419
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,640
in populations of cells in the brain

1420
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,800
and so it's kind of like on the left if

1421
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,800
something's passing under the radar

1422
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,000
the population is not changing in

1423
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,720
broad strokes but then when there's this

1424
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,559
event that's task relevant

1425
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,640
it transiently synchronizes the

1426
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,720
population to be doing certain things in

1427
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,680
a certain timing

1428
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,920
and then that's reflected by changes in

1429
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,640
the population level

1430
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,319
electromagnetism patterns reflected by

1431
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,240
what are called erps but there's a whole

1432
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,079
literature with fristen and many others

1433
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,000
on this topic

1434
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,599
yeah so basic erps are just

1435
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,440
depolarization of

1436
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,400
dendritic trees

1437
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,800
yeah which corresponds to the prediction

1438
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,240
error yeah which corresponds to

1439
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:44,960
prediction

1440
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,440
yeah cool so basically as prediction

1441
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,319
error

1442
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,680
initially goes up and then goes back

1443
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,000
down then that would be

1444
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,200
the uh the predicted erp

1445
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,640
um so um

1446
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,680
and this um is kind of related to

1447
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,599
uh you know pretty standard neural mass

1448
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,520
models um that are used

1449
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,680
in the in the literature that make

1450
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,599
pretty similar assumptions

1451
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:10,960
right they assume that the average

1452
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,119
firing rate of a population can be

1453
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,839
treated as

1454
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,280
a sigmoid function so a function that

1455
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,520
looks like this

1456
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,960
of the average membrane potential um

1457
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,040
and you can do things like for instance

1458
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,160
shift

1459
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,680
this function to the left or the right

1460
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,760
based on things that uh control the uh

1461
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,640
the firing rate threshold um you know

1462
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,760
which could relate to inhibitory

1463
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,280
interneurons or you know there's a bunch

1464
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:33,599
of

1465
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,359
different neural mechanisms involved but

1466
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:36,720
basically this

1467
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,440
the point is just that um this idea

1468
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,880
about where you get

1469
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,480
um firing rates um from average membrane

1470
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,720
potentials is is not kind of out of

1471
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,839
nowhere it's

1472
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,079
something that's kind of used as a

1473
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,040
standard assumption

1474
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,880
in um in uh these sorts of

1475
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,200
models and one interesting note is the

1476
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,880
soft max that sigma

1477
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,960
that we use to kind of renormalize

1478
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,319
probability

1479
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,800
it's actually utilized in artificial

1480
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,559
neurons in neural networks

1481
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,040
as also a probability renormalizing

1482
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:09,760
trick

1483
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,920
so we're thinking about it in kind of

1484
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,640
like the intersection of the physical

1485
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,559
thing and the instrumentalist approach

1486
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,319
realism and instrumentalism

1487
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,079
and we're sailing our active inference

1488
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,839
ship together through there

1489
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,400
yeah so so that's and and you know later

1490
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,359
chris will show

1491
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:32,400
specific simulations based on an actual

1492
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,319
task that will produce

1493
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,640
predicted erps that are consistent with

1494
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,000
existing literature

1495
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,760
um when he goes through the code um in

1496
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,520
the second part of this uh

1497
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,720
this session um but so i'm gonna

1498
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,079
sort of stop talking about the state

1499
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,440
prediction errors at this point which

1500
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:47,839
again

1501
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,880
chris will pick up um in his part the

1502
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,839
second thing

1503
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,920
that's kind of commonly talked about as

1504
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,440
part of the neural process theory

1505
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,640
in inactive inference is this idea

1506
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,680
of expected free energy precision um

1507
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,640
being associated with dopamine so let's

1508
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,160
say right from the start that

1509
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,680
to be technically correct we call this

1510
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,440
expected for energy precision

1511
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,440
in the literature it's often just called

1512
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,079
policy precision

1513
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,440
but that can be slightly confusing

1514
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,800
just because the precision

1515
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,480
of the actual posterior distribution of

1516
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,960
our policies right this bolded pi

1517
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,640
here corresponds not just to

1518
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,880
the precision of expected free energy g

1519
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,680
here

1520
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,960
but also to f and to e um

1521
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,280
so there are ways in which the expected

1522
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,119
free energy precision this gamma thing

1523
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,559
that scales g

1524
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,240
um you know could be precise or

1525
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,480
imprecise while the actual posterior

1526
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,079
distribution of her policies could still

1527
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:46,400
be

1528
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,400
precise or imprecise in a way that

1529
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,760
differs from um

1530
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,160
the precision of g yep so you can be not

1531
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:52,960
sure what to do

1532
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,359
but have very clear understanding of two

1533
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,040
policies and their implications it's two

1534
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,800
separate levels of uncertainty

1535
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,640
no it's not quite that it's my life yeah

1536
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,960
it's not yeah like like so so a good a

1537
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,960
good example would be for instance so

1538
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,400
um in the um you know in uh

1539
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,160
you know the paper uh you know that i

1540
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,079
wrote with casper um

1541
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,040
and others on the on deeply felt alpha

1542
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,440
so deeply felt affect so the idea about

1543
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,839
um changes in emotional states or

1544
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,040
affective states

1545
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,040
um relates specifically to this uh beta

1546
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,119
term here that controls the expected for

1547
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,480
energy precision

1548
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,640
um now when expected free energy

1549
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,319
precision goes down

1550
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:35,440
um then that will often correspond to

1551
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,200
right a negative or when expected for

1552
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,640
energy goes up sorry then that will

1553
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,640
correspond to a decrease

1554
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:45,118
and expected for energy precision um

1555
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,480
but uh or a difference between f and g

1556
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,920
um but uh but there will be cases where

1557
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,880
gamma will go down meaning the the model

1558
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,559
becomes less confident

1559
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,520
in its beliefs about uh its ability to

1560
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,800
minimize expected free energy

1561
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,040
essentially it decreases its beliefs

1562
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,760
its confidence in its action model but

1563
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,359
there are cases when that can happen

1564
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,599
despite the fact that the actual

1565
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,280
posterior additional distribution over

1566
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,599
policies becomes really precise

1567
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,920
so so a kind of nice example of this

1568
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,720
would be

1569
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,920
you know say you're kind of walking

1570
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,920
around in the woods and at the moment

1571
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,520
you're really confident in the

1572
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,079
walking around policy right so there's a

1573
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:25,839
precise distribution

1574
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,720
over you know i should be walking around

1575
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,200
um

1576
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,040
but now you unexpectedly see a bear um

1577
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,680
now immediately you're going to switch

1578
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,760
to having a very precise poster

1579
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,000
posterior distribution over the runaway

1580
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,040
policy so

1581
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,720
you're going to have two policies two

1582
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,079
distributions of our policies that are

1583
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,920
both very precise

1584
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,040
but they also but they change rapidly

1585
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,680
so the the policy that the that the

1586
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,520
model was confident in before is very

1587
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,960
different than the policy

1588
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,280
that the model was confident in after so

1589
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,319
despite that the

1590
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,240
posterior distribution is still over

1591
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,920
policies is still precise

1592
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,640
that things very confident what to do um

1593
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,680
gamma will still go

1594
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,200
down um so the thing will feel negative

1595
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,799
like in motion despite being very

1596
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,400
confident and running away

1597
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,599
so the thing that the thing that's

1598
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,520
driving that is f i think that's

1599
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,720
important to put in

1600
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,839
or to say

1601
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,079
if you want to cash it out ryan oh well

1602
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:25,520
i mean yes i mean just in the sense

1603
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,920
so f is f is going to be so based on a

1604
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,880
new observation

1605
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,079
f is the um is the kind of evidence for

1606
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,599
each policy

1607
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,400
at the time of the new observation so if

1608
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:36,720
f

1609
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,240
strongly contradicts g then that means

1610
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,760
that the distribution is going to change

1611
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,480
in a way

1612
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,720
that suggests that you ought to have

1613
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,680
less confidence in g

1614
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,839
and um and we can we can i'll show a

1615
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,079
specific example of that below

1616
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,480
um when we actually show simulations of

1617
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,760
the um

1618
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,559
you know postulated dopamine responses

1619
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,119
but

1620
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,480
so the idea here is is that dopamine

1621
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,760
phasic dopamine responses correspond to

1622
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,319
changes in this parameter beta which

1623
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:09,359
controls

1624
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,119
gamma which is the expected free energy

1625
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,880
precision um

1626
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,520
and the way that these updates in beta

1627
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,400
so

1628
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,839
this equation here just corresponds to

1629
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,680
the initial beta

1630
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,359
so the non-bolded one here plus

1631
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,280
this thing so the posterior distribution

1632
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,559
of our policies

1633
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,079
minus the prior distribution of our

1634
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:32,079
policies so basically how much did

1635
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,160
beliefs about policies change

1636
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,880
and then dotted with the negative

1637
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,240
expected free energy

1638
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,799
um that was that you know that

1639
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,319
correspond to that trial

1640
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,359
and then minus the previous uh beta

1641
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,400
which allows this thing to just

1642
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,480
continually iterate um

1643
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,119
but because the change from posterior

1644
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,319
release or policies

1645
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,240
from prior beliefs or policies um

1646
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,119
just adds f basically the prior over

1647
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,720
policies we don't show it here is just

1648
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,720
ln e minus gamma g

1649
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,680
so the f only comes in to turn the prior

1650
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,040
over policies into a posterior policies

1651
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,799
um and so this change is driven by f

1652
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:16,000
um and so the more that f

1653
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,040
is consistent versus inconsistent with g

1654
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,160
um is what uh is what controls

1655
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,920
the the agent's sort of changes in

1656
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,319
confidence about

1657
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:29,520
about its g estimates um

1658
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,760
and so changes in that are what are

1659
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,720
expected or

1660
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,480
proposed to correspond to phasic

1661
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,079
dopamine responses

1662
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,400
and then the kind of tonic level of beta

1663
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,440
is also

1664
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,079
proposed to be associated with tonic

1665
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:42,720
dopamine

1666
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,040
levels so if i can just very briefly say

1667
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:45,760
something

1668
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,000
um so essentially gamma is a

1669
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,520
gamma is a a rate or bright beta sorry

1670
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,720
is a rate parameter from a gamma

1671
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,160
distribution

1672
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,040
and essentially we get you get this

1673
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,119
derivation so beta dot

1674
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,119
that that technically that's a that's a

1675
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,400
temporal derivative right

1676
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,160
and so this isn't exact it's a little

1677
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,559
misleading kind of because this

1678
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:11,599
actually is a variational derivative

1679
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:14,799
of gamma

1680
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:17,359
with respect to variational free energy

1681
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,200
if that makes sense so the idea is is

1682
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,040
that updates or changes

1683
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,440
in essentially this beta value will

1684
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,000
minimize variational free energy

1685
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,319
and if you want to see like the so the

1686
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,000
actual um

1687
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,680
the actual derivations of that get kind

1688
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,040
of kind of gnarly

1689
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,480
but if you're interested if anyone's

1690
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,640
interested i would just say

1691
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,000
um go and read and the appendix of

1692
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,400
ann sales paper that's in plus

1693
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,760
computational biology

1694
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,799
on the locus cerealia cyrillus and

1695
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:50,400
um learning rate and prediction error um

1696
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,960
where they show motivations yeah ana's

1697
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:53,680
yeah anna's

1698
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,359
anna's the appendix and this paper is

1699
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,040
like actually really great for this

1700
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:57,920
because

1701
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,200
plus cb uh basically like required

1702
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,200
it looks like that she spell like every

1703
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,559
little detail about

1704
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,640
deriving everything um in active

1705
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,599
inference so it

1706
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:08,960
has a really great paper both in the

1707
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,880
main text and in the appendix for

1708
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,240
showing kind of exactly where you get

1709
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,000
each of these things um

1710
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,720
uh yeah like pretty much as clearly as

1711
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,200
i've seen it

1712
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,640
anything else to add on the neural

1713
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,319
process front because there's some

1714
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:23,520
questions and then we'll head into the

1715
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,359
second section but this is awesome

1716
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,319
uh there's a lot more actually let's

1717
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:29,359
keep going then

1718
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:30,880
then so yeah we'll do more neural

1719
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,400
process theory however much

1720
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,760
and then we'll be taking questions we'll

1721
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,760
have a intermission with a few questions

1722
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,880
that are really nice and then

1723
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,760
christopher will

1724
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,119
launch into the hierarchical modeling

1725
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,920
so so to actually give examples here

1726
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:44,880
because you know everything we've said

1727
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,200
about the about dopamine and beta

1728
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,000
updates is

1729
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,280
um still pretty abstract um so

1730
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,359
you know in the in the tutorial we give

1731
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:55,040
specific numerical examples of this as

1732
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,000
well

1733
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,960
um um to show and give a kind of like

1734
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,839
geometric actually um intuition

1735
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:04,880
um about this um and um

1736
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,280
so here you can see so so here we show

1737
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,119
right that the prior over policies this

1738
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,160
pi zero

1739
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,720
like i said is just the soft max of ln e

1740
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,240
minus gamma g

1741
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,559
and then the posterior is the softmax of

1742
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:17,599
lne

1743
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:20,160
minus f minus gamma g which we showed

1744
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,119
before

1745
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,799
and so and these are the equations for

1746
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:27,920
quote unquote dopamine phasic dopamine

1747
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,040
responses

1748
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,000
um and so if you just take a specific

1749
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,599
really simple example

1750
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,280
so let's say there's no hat so let's say

1751
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,880
that beta 0

1752
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,520
and therefore gamma 0 and the initial

1753
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,359
beta posterior those are all just one so

1754
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:42,480
we're just starting out

1755
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,880
you know totally flat basically um

1756
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,920
and and we'll say that the agent has no

1757
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:50,799
habits

1758
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,880
um so there are two possible policies

1759
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,640
here i should say so the agent has no

1760
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,880
habit so it's just one and one

1761
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,240
for counts over uh policies

1762
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,440
now let's say that g

1763
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,480
is 10 and nine so in other words there's

1764
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,799
slightly higher expected free energy for

1765
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:12,000
the first policy then the second policy

1766
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,640
so now let's say that f the agent gets a

1767
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,160
new observation

1768
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,240
and the free energy for each policy

1769
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,400
corresponds to 20 and one

1770
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,799
so as you can see this is still

1771
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,400
consistent with

1772
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,480
um the 10 and 9 right it's not like

1773
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,319
contradicting the um

1774
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:31,359
the you know policy one still has higher

1775
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:34,559
uh free energy than policy two um

1776
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:37,760
so when you calculate uh pi zero

1777
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,280
using this equation and these numbers up

1778
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,880
here you end up

1779
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,359
initially having a probability over

1780
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:46,400
policies of 0.218 and 0.728

1781
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,880
so policy 2 is the one that

1782
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,319
is has is uh more likely uh given the

1783
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:56,000
expected free energy because it's lower

1784
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,160
right expected for energy is nine

1785
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,440
um now the posterior policies after

1786
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,039
we put in f just ends up being zero one

1787
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:07,440
um and so if you take the difference

1788
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,200
here so we're just called pi diff so pi

1789
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,640
minus pi 0

1790
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:15,440
that ends up being negative 0.218.218

1791
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,960
and then if you do this a dot pi diff

1792
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,599
with negative g um and these two betas

1793
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:22,880
just cancel out because it's just one

1794
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:23,839
minus one

1795
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,960
and so you end up with 0.22 and then

1796
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,480
if you compute the update

1797
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,680
then uh the yeah what the change will be

1798
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,720
then gamma ends up equaling 1.28 which

1799
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,000
went up from one um which means that

1800
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:40,720
you'd have a

1801
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,440
positive uh phasic dopamine predicted

1802
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,599
positive physic dopamine response

1803
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,680
um and a way to kind of think about it

1804
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,039
geometrically is

1805
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,880
um whether or not the vectors

1806
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,240
corresponding to

1807
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,160
uh pi diff so the difference between pi

1808
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,640
and pi zero point in the same direction

1809
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,160
as negative g

1810
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,359
um because that implies that they're uh

1811
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:03,359
consistent with one another that implies

1812
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:05,359
that essentially the

1813
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:08,960
g was on track um and that's worth a

1814
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,359
a re-run so what is this geometric space

1815
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:14,799
and then what would it mean if the

1816
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:16,960
vectors were totally correlated and they

1817
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,440
were like

1818
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,680
pointing the same exact direction versus

1819
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,599
here they're almost at 90 degrees or

1820
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,119
what would it mean for different arrows

1821
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,280
to be pointing in different directions

1822
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,520
so these are the vectors corresponding

1823
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,280
to

1824
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,039
the vectors here in g and the vector

1825
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,319
um that corresponds to pi minus pi zero

1826
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:39,359
one so this is so this is and i should

1827
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,119
say that these are scaled

1828
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,319
um so that they're similar lengths

1829
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:45,760
but the same directions because

1830
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,760
otherwise one arrow would be way

1831
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,680
way longer than the other and the kind

1832
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,359
of point isn't clear

1833
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:54,640
wouldn't be clear but so basically pi

1834
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,760
diff right is negative 0.218.218 so it's

1835
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,680
pointing left and up so negative x

1836
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,280
positive y um whereas g is

1837
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,359
um negative g would be negative 10

1838
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,920
negative 9 so it will be

1839
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,599
down and left um and so the

1840
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:16,480
the general kind of um intuition that's

1841
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,920
supposed to be given is that

1842
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,680
um when these two vectors point in the

1843
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,440
same direction where that just means

1844
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,720
that the angle is less

1845
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,400
than 90 degrees um then uh

1846
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,200
the gamma update will be positive um

1847
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:29,920
whereas

1848
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,920
if for instance instead we do a

1849
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,119
different example

1850
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,400
now the only thing we're going to do

1851
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,760
here is we're going to change f we're

1852
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,319
going to change off from 20 and one

1853
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:42,319
to or no sorry we're gonna change

1854
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:46,160
g so g is going from 10 to nine

1855
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,960
to only being one and nine so in other

1856
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:49,760
words

1857
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,559
while in this case the first policy at

1858
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,480
higher expected free energy

1859
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,760
now the first policy has lower expected

1860
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,760
free energy

1861
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,160
now if you run through the exact same

1862
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:02,960
set of steps

1863
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,039
to solve the equations you're going to

1864
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:07,440
end up with a gamma of 0.14

1865
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,960
which means there's going to be a

1866
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,480
negative

1867
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,880
there should be a drop in dopamine in

1868
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,319
other words the agent should become less

1869
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:15,039
confident

1870
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:18,160
in its uh g estimates

1871
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,240
and you can see that if you look at

1872
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,680
where the vectors are pointing in this

1873
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,480
case

1874
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,960
um then they're then the angle

1875
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,079
difference is 128.66 degrees so

1876
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,680
more than 90 degrees so therefore they

1877
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,200
point in different directions

1878
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,200
therefore they provide evidence against

1879
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,039
g um

1880
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:38,799
if uh if that uh makes sense

1881
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:40,720
yep let me try with the dopamine so

1882
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,319
we're thinking of dopamine

1883
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:45,200
as a tracker of confidence it has many

1884
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,280
roles and colombo and others have

1885
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,039
talked about pluralism in dopamine so

1886
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:50,319
we're not this is not a lecture on

1887
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:52,079
dopamine we're thinking about dopamine

1888
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:53,440
as like confidence and

1889
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,359
we're headed in a direction we're on our

1890
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:57,039
road trip and the dope means coursing

1891
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:57,760
through our brain

1892
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,280
and we want to know how confident we are

1893
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,039
that we're on the right path as new

1894
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:02,880
observations are coming in

1895
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,720
now as we've seen from the earlier

1896
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,240
sections we're doing a lot of

1897
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,520
matrix math and just like a vector

1898
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,520
is a simpler version of a matrix and a

1899
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,280
tensor is a more complicated version of

1900
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,200
a matrix they're all kind of in the same

1901
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,400
math space and a given vector

1902
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,079
from computer science it's like two

1903
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:21,680
numbers that are in a column

1904
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,920
but also a vector has this arrow

1905
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:24,880
interpretation

1906
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,880
so if someone says the coordinate 3

1907
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,440
comma 3 it's like a vector from 0 0

1908
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,400
pointing to 3 3. so lists of numbers

1909
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,240
like a computer science vector

1910
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,880
is basically the same thing as a vector

1911
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:37,760
with a

1912
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,240
star and a head at the at the end so

1913
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,760
it's physics and computer science

1914
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,119
and we're thinking about vectors and

1915
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:44,880
matrices and tensors

1916
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,119
and then we're laying out after scaling

1917
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:48,559
and renormalizing

1918
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:51,039
which direction these different vectors

1919
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:52,079
are pointing

1920
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:53,920
and then it's kind of like it are we

1921
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,240
headed on the basically the same path

1922
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,640
is the the vector of the evidence sort

1923
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,720
of pointing us in a similar direction

1924
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,480
that we're already believing in

1925
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,720
or is the new evidence coming in like a

1926
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,079
tailwind or a headwind

1927
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,839
that's kind of surprising us and it's

1928
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:09,599
not in line it's not headed in the same

1929
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:10,799
direction as what we're already

1930
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:11,520
believing

1931
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,160
and then this meta with a gamma the

1932
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,200
hyper parameter

1933
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,680
is about how much reliance we're putting

1934
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:18,640
in to g

1935
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,240
versus our observations yeah so i mean

1936
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,200
another kind of

1937
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,480
a nice a nice thing here is that so as

1938
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,960
as gamma goes down right so if you look

1939
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,559
if you look at this posterior

1940
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:31,839
you know distribution of our policies

1941
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:34,640
equation as this gamma value gets lower

1942
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,480
right so as the agent becomes less

1943
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,920
confident in its

1944
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,240
in its action model more or less it's

1945
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,079
less confident that its model

1946
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:44,079
will be good at minimizing expected free

1947
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:46,400
energy right as that goes down then g

1948
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,760
contributes less

1949
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,319
which means that f and e contribute more

1950
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:50,960
so

1951
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,079
if an agent has built up really strong

1952
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:55,119
habits

1953
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,680
um then its beliefs in its model will

1954
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,160
control

1955
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,720
action if gamma is high but if gamma's

1956
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,520
really low

1957
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,440
then the agent will just kind of choose

1958
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:04,559
whatever it's

1959
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:06,400
uh habitually chosen in the past so

1960
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,920
habits will kind of take over

1961
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,960
if it's not confident in its model um

1962
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,640
which is kind of a nice way to think

1963
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,400
about it has some kind of analogs to

1964
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,399
like model based versus model free

1965
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:19,040
um uh algorithms and reinforcement

1966
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:19,520
learning

1967
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,640
for example that um again we could think

1968
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,158
about in terms of actually

1969
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:26,158
making decisions based on you know

1970
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:27,679
explicitly simulating what's going to

1971
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:28,560
happen in the future

1972
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,319
if i make one choice versus another

1973
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,080
versus just doing what's typically

1974
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,839
worked in the past

1975
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:36,640
um is another kind of way to think about

1976
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,439
what gamma is

1977
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:40,158
arbitrating um did you uh do you want to

1978
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,439
say anything else chris

1979
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:42,799
no i was just going to say there's some

1980
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:44,960
really nice numerical results um

1981
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,439
so i think i've forgotten i'm sorry if

1982
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:48,880
i've gotten the name um i think it's

1983
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,000
thomas fitzgerald

1984
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,880
is the lead author on this but um they

1985
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:53,759
have some stuff

1986
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,399
just showing that related schemes i

1987
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:57,920
think that the equations have changed a

1988
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,198
little bit since then but they're

1989
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:02,560
pretty much the same um that this scheme

1990
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,198
gives very very similar

1991
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:06,560
answers as something like temporal

1992
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,158
difference learning which is a very

1993
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:09,600
simple model-free algorithm in

1994
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,640
reinforcement learning

1995
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,198
um and that's also i think the the gold

1996
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:15,279
standard model of dope phasic dopamine

1997
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:17,520
at the moment ryan correct me on that

1998
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,359
but no i mean yeah i mean it's like

1999
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:20,080
temporal the

2000
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,479
temporal difference account of of uh

2001
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:23,759
reward prediction error is definitely

2002
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:24,319
yeah

2003
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,960
treating phasic dopamine responses as

2004
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,560
reward prediction errors in temporal

2005
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,920
difference learning models is

2006
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,520
definitely a very standard and kind of

2007
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,040
like widely supported

2008
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,560
view um and this i mean the idea is that

2009
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,120
this

2010
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:40,399
this can um this sort of um

2011
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,080
this sort of active inference model of

2012
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,080
dopamine um

2013
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,359
is kind of saying something different

2014
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:46,880
it's not saying it's a reward prediction

2015
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,000
error

2016
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
but it's something that will have the

2017
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,600
same kind of dynamics as reward

2018
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,640
prediction error

2019
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,199
because if you think about it so say you

2020
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:56,800
know i'm walking along and i'm not

2021
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,560
expecting a reward

2022
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,199
and then all of a sudden i get a cue

2023
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:01,600
that

2024
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,159
makes it so now that i expect now i

2025
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:04,880
expect

2026
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,400
um reward um so you know for instance

2027
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:08,880
like

2028
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,320
or say like in like a simple kind of

2029
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,239
like experiment like a like

2030
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:13,840
auburn condition experiment conditioning

2031
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,280
experiment with like a rat or something

2032
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,960
you know it learns

2033
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,880
that every time it sees a light it's

2034
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,040
going to get a reward in five seconds

2035
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,560
um then the reward prediction area story

2036
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,440
would say

2037
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,560
oh you're going to get a real word

2038
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,159
prediction error when the rat sees the

2039
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:30,159
light because now

2040
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:31,360
it's going to get it knows it's going to

2041
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,560
get a reward that it wasn't expecting

2042
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,280
um so in this case though you'll get

2043
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,400
something kind of similar but for a

2044
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,520
different reason

2045
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,040
where you can think about the rat

2046
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,800
initially just kind of wandering around

2047
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,480
not being super confident

2048
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,840
you know in in any particular policy

2049
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,760
but then it gets that cue that it's

2050
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,120
going to get rewarded

2051
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,800
you know if it goes up and pushes the

2052
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,400
the lever right as a standard way this

2053
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,199
works

2054
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:58,080
um so so instead of it being a reward

2055
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,040
prediction error

2056
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,800
what would be happening is the queue is

2057
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,400
actually um

2058
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,880
unexpectedly making the rat a lot more

2059
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,480
confident in what to do

2060
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,239
right a lot more confident in the policy

2061
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:09,920
of going and pushing the lever

2062
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,560
um so you're going to get something that

2063
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,600
looks just like

2064
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,440
a reward prediction error at least in

2065
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,719
that sort of setup

2066
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:18,320
um but actually has to do with an update

2067
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,360
and confidence about what to do

2068
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,480
so so that's kind of in part

2069
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:25,760
that's one kind of intuitive way to

2070
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,159
think about um you know where

2071
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:31,679
similar looking dynamics come from but

2072
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:33,600
but i should also kind of be be clear

2073
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,520
that i mean this is

2074
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,120
definitely not meant

2075
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,480
necessarily to be kind of a universal uh

2076
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,679
unifying account of dopamine you know at

2077
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:46,239
least

2078
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:48,640
at least as far as um you know i can

2079
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,000
tell a present there's lots of

2080
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,040
other things that dopamine does that you

2081
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,159
know look like they couldn't be

2082
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:55,679
explained by

2083
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,400
just this sort of model but this sort of

2084
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:58,960
model

2085
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,520
um looks like it's decent as a contender

2086
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,480
for

2087
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,080
making sense of things like um why

2088
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,440
dopamine doesn't just respond for

2089
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,880
prediction errors but also responds for

2090
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,480
events that are salient

2091
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:12,480
um for example um this kind of saliency

2092
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,920
versus word prediction or sort of thing

2093
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,120
there's a couple others but

2094
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,440
but um this is not necessarily meant to

2095
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,159
be a

2096
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:21,280
you know this is all dopamine does um

2097
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,640
but anyway um so

2098
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,640
uh so just making that clear um

2099
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,960
so now the kind of last thing to show

2100
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,239
and this is the actual figure in the

2101
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:33,760
paper that just shows both of these

2102
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,640
things

2103
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,120
is that um if you do the actual

2104
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,320
variational updating

2105
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,280
where just beta continually changes then

2106
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,880
the uh the actual kind of

2107
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,120
gradient like that the changes look like

2108
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,640
this where the thing would start out for

2109
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:47,760
instance

2110
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,760
at um around at a certain value

2111
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,640
um and then for for this case right so

2112
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,760
it starts at

2113
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,480
um you know down coming from one and

2114
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,360
then it will

2115
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:02,640
gradually go up and converge um after

2116
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,800
uh 16 iterations is the what's set in

2117
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,080
the code um

2118
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,400
to that posterior value over what gamma

2119
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,280
ought to be

2120
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,760
whereas in this case it will drop coming

2121
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:12,640
up from one

2122
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,120
down and then converge over those

2123
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,800
iterations onto

2124
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,760
um this value of 0.14 so it's not as

2125
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,920
though in the neural model this is

2126
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,760
kind of happening with one little step

2127
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,199
it's it's kind of a

2128
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,920
it's a you know it's a convergence um

2129
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,600
that you can think of as related to a

2130
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,120
kind of prediction error

2131
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,719
um essentially kind of like an expected

2132
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:34,400
free energy prediction error uh some

2133
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,679
people have talked about it that way

2134
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:38,480
um in previous papers and for those

2135
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,840
following along in the code would this

2136
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,120
be in the efe precisionupdating.com yeah

2137
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,600
yeah yeah thanks so yeah there's a yeah

2138
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,360
to play around with this exact

2139
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,080
this this exact example um as well as

2140
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,000
ones where you can specify

2141
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,480
uh bigger policy spaces so like like

2142
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,080
when the agent has like five policies to

2143
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,679
choose from instead of one

2144
01:13:57,679 --> 01:13:58,960
um you know which is a little more

2145
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,880
realistic it's just um

2146
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,080
it's hard to show uh vectors um

2147
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,440
sorry to illustrate those in like five

2148
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,280
dimensions um so we went with two for

2149
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,719
this simple examples

2150
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:11,040
um but yes um in that efe precision

2151
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:11,840
updating

2152
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,880
you can reproduce these results and then

2153
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,440
try changing like private beta values or

2154
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,840
changing g and f um to see to get more

2155
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,080
of an intuitive sense of the dynamics

2156
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,920
um and so like in the um

2157
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,719
in the eq in the the um what you might

2158
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:29,199
call it

2159
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:31,040
when we were showing in the explore

2160
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,120
exploit test model last time

2161
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,600
um these sorts of simulated simulated

2162
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,880
behaviors

2163
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,400
right where the agent either chooses to

2164
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,320
take the hint and then go left or right

2165
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,159
to get a reward oh it just makes

2166
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:43,920
or it's just rick's risk seeking and

2167
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,960
just goes left versus right

2168
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,640
automatically instead of taking the hint

2169
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,520
first

2170
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,159
um in in the previous session we went

2171
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:51,280
over this

2172
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,280
and but we kind of ignored this bottom

2173
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,960
right section on expected

2174
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,199
uh free energy precision and these

2175
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:58,719
dopamine plots

2176
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:00,480
but now that we've kind of walked

2177
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,000
through that a little bit

2178
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,600
um you know we can kind of come back to

2179
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,760
that and see that in this case

2180
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,120
um the agent started out

2181
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,719
in the beginning and it chose to take

2182
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,520
the hint um and then it knew

2183
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,199
um whether to choose left

2184
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:18,719
uh choose the left machine or choose the

2185
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:20,400
right machine so you can see what

2186
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,280
happens here is

2187
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,320
when it takes the hint then it becomes a

2188
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:27,280
lot more confident about what to do

2189
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,960
and so it's at that point that you

2190
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,520
simulate a big jump in dopamine

2191
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,800
right so in this case it's not because

2192
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,239
it's got a reward immediately it's

2193
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:35,360
because it got a

2194
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,360
cue where it learned what to be able to

2195
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,800
do to get a reward

2196
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,440
um so then it chooses left and then it

2197
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,280
observes a win here at the third

2198
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,560
uh time point or this third column um

2199
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,760
so so this is kind of an example um

2200
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,600
and then in the learning simulations

2201
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,960
that we showed last time as well

2202
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,400
before we leave that slide could i just

2203
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,920
jump in real quick and i had a quick

2204
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,199
clarification about that

2205
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:03,360
figure um so in that middle panel for

2206
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,440
win lose and you look at that matrix

2207
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,159
it actually looks like if that's the

2208
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:09,920
expected probabilities for

2209
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,960
win loss at any given uh time

2210
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,159
epoch one two and three um he actually

2211
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:17,760
it actually looks like in this

2212
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,760
case the way that the simulation goes

2213
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,760
it's more confident about winning

2214
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,679
on this time step when it knows to take

2215
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,840
the hint and then after it's taken a

2216
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:26,800
hint

2217
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,679
um it becomes less confident about

2218
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:30,159
winning

2219
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:33,120
is or is that it's actually to do with

2220
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,880
the fact that those aren't so they're

2221
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,560
probabilities but they're not

2222
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,600
probabilities

2223
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,120
in the way that the rest of the modulus

2224
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,719
probabilities so these are

2225
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:42,880
these are preferences where we model

2226
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,159
preferences as a probability

2227
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,440
distribution

2228
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:48,239
i see i see so that has to do with more

2229
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:48,800
of the

2230
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,280
you know it's had more update it's had

2231
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,880
more observations at time

2232
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,960
three and so as you're going since

2233
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,560
you're it's an accumulator

2234
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,520
um in that optimization process is that

2235
01:16:59,520 --> 01:16:59,840
no

2236
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,679
it's just it's just so when you're

2237
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:02,960
trying to encode essentially what's

2238
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,880
rewarding for the agent

2239
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,880
right you're just setting you're just

2240
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,880
saying that

2241
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,360
it has a particular distribution over

2242
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,040
each possible set of outcomes for each

2243
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,560
outcome modality and that distribution

2244
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,159
just encodes

2245
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:19,040
which observations are more preferred

2246
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:19,360
than

2247
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:23,040
others and formally that's just a fixed

2248
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,360
uh probability distribution over the

2249
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,040
different observations you might get

2250
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,640
where the higher the probability is

2251
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,400
quote unquote the more the agent prefers

2252
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,840
that observation

2253
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,800
um so this is so this is just saying

2254
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,320
like for the first output modality it's

2255
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:36,880
just all

2256
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,040
gray here because the agent doesn't

2257
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,480
prefer a hint or

2258
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:43,120
not a hint um and then the third one

2259
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,880
here observed action it doesn't

2260
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,040
prefer innately to observe itself do one

2261
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,400
action or another

2262
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,480
but in this middle one observing wins

2263
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,239
versus losses versus null

2264
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:55,280
just not observing an outcome yet um at

2265
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,760
the first time point so the first column

2266
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:58,960
it just does it doesn't have any

2267
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,520
preferences at the second

2268
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,840
time point so this middle column the

2269
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,679
thing has a strong preference for

2270
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:07,760
wind so this black one which corresponds

2271
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,199
to high probability

2272
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:11,120
it has a strong preference against

2273
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,520
losing observing a loss which is a very

2274
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,800
low probability

2275
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,080
and then the null state is just this

2276
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,760
kind of like intermediate thing it's not

2277
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,239
like

2278
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:19,760
it's not bad like a loss but it's not

2279
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,920
good like a win and so the person that

2280
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:22,880
shows the null

2281
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,480
there or there is is because it shows a

2282
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,719
hint because of the epistemic value of

2283
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:27,440
the hint

2284
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,880
i should say yeah so it so basically

2285
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:31,199
what's

2286
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:33,840
happening is if you remember that the uh

2287
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,760
this distribution is a little

2288
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,880
lighter at time two because the value of

2289
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,080
winning is higher

2290
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,080
at the second time step than the third

2291
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,000
remember because it can win four dollars

2292
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,159
if it tries to get us it just chooses

2293
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:47,440
one right away

2294
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,440
but at the third time point this is a

2295
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,800
little less

2296
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,480
precise it's a little flatter which is

2297
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,800
like looks darker gray because the black

2298
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,199
here

2299
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,880
only corresponds to winning two dollars

2300
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,960
instead of four um so the difference

2301
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,640
between winning and losing isn't quite

2302
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,440
as

2303
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,880
stark i think okay yeah um

2304
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,719
so but the point is it's not actually

2305
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,560
getting a big bump in dopamine when it

2306
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,440
wins

2307
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,880
you know it's getting a big bump in

2308
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,480
dopamine when it observes the hint

2309
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:13,199
because that's

2310
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,960
when it becomes confident in what to do

2311
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,480
to get the win

2312
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:20,400
um and that's to re-emphasize that we're

2313
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,120
doing this trajectory of policy which is

2314
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,880
what ties it to the path integral as

2315
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,440
well

2316
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,280
so at each time point that it's being

2317
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,199
evaluated at it's in the past and in the

2318
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:30,560
future and it's conditioned

2319
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,120
on policy so it's almost like the reward

2320
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,800
if you always expect the envelope has

2321
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,520
the paycheck

2322
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,360
if you get it and then you open it it's

2323
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,199
like neutral with respect to what you

2324
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:40,880
already believed about the way the world

2325
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:41,440
worked

2326
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,199
and you'd get a negative if it was less

2327
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:44,800
than expected and a positive if more

2328
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:45,679
than expected

2329
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:48,719
and so in that way the reward of what is

2330
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,560
initially just pure stimuli that could

2331
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,239
be rewarding or thought of in that way

2332
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:54,800
gets moved up that's kind of like re

2333
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,320
reinforcement learning or reward

2334
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:56,880
learning

2335
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,800
and that's why we're in this area of

2336
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,800
thinking about stimuli and policy and

2337
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,199
rewards and risks

2338
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:04,719
yeah i mean the idea is just that in in

2339
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:06,400
that context

2340
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,560
uh these dopamine responses the

2341
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:09,920
simulated dopamine responses here

2342
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:10,800
corresponding

2343
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,719
to changes in confidence about what to

2344
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:14,960
do or changes in confidence

2345
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,480
that your model will give you the right

2346
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,960
answer about what to do

2347
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,320
and uh and that will look that will have

2348
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,600
the same dynamics

2349
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,040
as a reward prediction error

2350
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,080
from a queue that predicts reward

2351
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,760
so so the dynamics will look like a

2352
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,280
reward prediction area even though

2353
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,120
in these models it corresponds to

2354
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,719
something different

2355
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:39,920
um so it's kind of like in behaviorism

2356
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,600
everybody can agree on the behavior we

2357
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,360
agree that if we train up the animal it

2358
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,800
learns to do this after

2359
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,600
x um experimental paradigm is carried

2360
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:48,080
out

2361
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,280
and then now we're talking about

2362
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,800
internal we're thinking either at a

2363
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,719
neural process level like which regions

2364
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:53,520
of the brain or

2365
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,920
computationally like what is happening

2366
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:56,560
and then

2367
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,560
here there's a common trunk with the

2368
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,080
predictive processing the reward

2369
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,760
prediction error all of that

2370
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,280
and the active inference models we're

2371
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,120
talking about which is and reinforcement

2372
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,080
learning which is that

2373
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,960
over time the reward gets moved up to be

2374
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:09,760
associated

2375
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,600
apparently more with the queue than with

2376
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,520
the actual stimulus delivery

2377
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,679
but we're taking a point of divergence

2378
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,600
in that we're adding in a few

2379
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,199
different pieces that differentiate an

2380
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:21,920
active inference free energy

2381
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,880
gradient descent driven policy selection

2382
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,600
from

2383
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,560
just q association even though they do

2384
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,920
have some similarities

2385
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,159
this is like a generalization or a much

2386
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:33,840
more nuanced way to approach similar

2387
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,000
situations

2388
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
yeah and you know ultimately right the

2389
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
hope is to find situations

2390
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,840
where active inference and reinforcement

2391
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,199
learning models are going to be going to

2392
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:44,239
make different predictions

2393
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:47,360
right about what dopamine will do um

2394
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,120
and uh because that's where you can

2395
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,960
actually say you know which model has

2396
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:51,520
more

2397
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,199
you know empirical support um and um

2398
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:56,719
yeah thomas fitzgerald i think it was

2399
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:58,000
the paper that chris was talking about

2400
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,520
before you know he did show

2401
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,600
there are interesting findings where

2402
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,719
when you

2403
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:04,480
get rid of dopamine when there's

2404
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,239
dopamine depletion there's some kind of

2405
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:08,080
lack of dopamine in the system for one

2406
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,280
reason or another

2407
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:12,639
um that doesn't actually get rid of

2408
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:14,560
uh reward learning like an agent can

2409
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,040
still learn about rewards despite

2410
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,320
um the dopaminergic function being

2411
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,800
impaired um you know which makes it look

2412
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,400
as though um

2413
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,639
you know dopamine uh might not be

2414
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:28,320
serving this reward prediction error

2415
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,920
function at least if you think that

2416
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:30,800
reward prediction

2417
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,840
is necessary for reward learning um

2418
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,320
and um and so there was he showed some

2419
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:37,679
simulations again with a slightly

2420
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:39,679
different formalism than the current one

2421
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:41,520
showing how you can get the same

2422
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,199
dopamine responses

2423
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:45,840
um as you would expect in a

2424
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,600
reinforcement learning model

2425
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,920
but it explains why you don't need

2426
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,400
dopamine to do the reward learning

2427
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,960
um but uh but like i mentioned the

2428
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,800
formalism isn't exactly the same as it

2429
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:57,040
is

2430
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,480
now because that was a slightly older

2431
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,320
paper um so

2432
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:01,600
you know i think there's just a lot more

2433
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,120
kind of empirical work to do to try to

2434
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,000
kind of

2435
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,239
find uh you know differential support

2436
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:07,920
for one model of dopamine or another

2437
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,920
here

2438
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:13,280
very uh any other any other uh comments

2439
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,239
chris

2440
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,159
um no i think just looking at the time

2441
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:17,840
um do you want to kind of speed through

2442
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,480
the slides and then you can get onto the

2443
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,360
stuff yeah

2444
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:23,840
okay so yeah i mean i can skip i can

2445
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,199
skip or to skim over a lot of this i

2446
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:26,320
mean the last thing i was going to talk

2447
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,280
about is

2448
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,400
that this isn't used as much um because

2449
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,600
it's not actually implemented in this

2450
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,719
way in the code

2451
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:34,719
but carl has made this point that you

2452
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:37,120
can also implement

2453
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,679
minimizing expected free energy i'm

2454
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:40,960
using a different kind of prediction

2455
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:43,040
error called an outcome prediction error

2456
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:46,000
and that just corresponds to the

2457
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,040
different elements

2458
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,920
in expected free energy so which is here

2459
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:50,480
just

2460
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:53,840
um here is just minimizing

2461
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,520
the expected difference between the

2462
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,520
preferred outcomes c

2463
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,600
and the outcomes that you expect under a

2464
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,560
policy

2465
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,840
right so um under some policy uh

2466
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,840
for under some policy the state for that

2467
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,199
pi um

2468
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:09,199
multiplied with a will give you the

2469
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:11,440
expected outcomes of a policy

2470
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,280
so you're just trying to um this

2471
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,639
prediction error minimizing this

2472
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:15,920
prediction or just corresponds to

2473
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,360
finding the policy that

2474
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,600
min or that minimizes the the difference

2475
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,280
between basically what you want and what

2476
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,080
you expect

2477
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,800
given what you choose to do and the

2478
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,000
second term

2479
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,440
is the ambiguity or information seeking

2480
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,080
term and it effectively you can think

2481
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,520
about it as the expected difference

2482
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,480
between

2483
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,800
beliefs about states before and after a

2484
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,080
new observation

2485
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:41,760
so you're trying to find basically um

2486
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,760
a difference that like uh the state that

2487
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,239
maximizes how much information you gain

2488
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:48,560
about what state you're in um but

2489
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:49,840
formally it's the

2490
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,199
it's the entropy of the likelihood

2491
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:53,120
distribution for a state or how kind of

2492
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,920
flat or uninformative the distribution

2493
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:56,560
is

2494
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,400
of expected outcomes given that you're

2495
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,159
in one state versus another

2496
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:03,120
um and in the paper we um we uh go

2497
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:03,840
through

2498
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:07,040
uh numeric numerical examples of um

2499
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,400
computing these sorts of outcome

2500
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,159
prediction errors as well

2501
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:12,480
um but the the basic point again i won't

2502
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,400
go through them in detail is just

2503
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,040
if you have some policy that is going to

2504
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,560
generate the state

2505
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,639
uh state one with probability point nine

2506
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:22,960
and state two probability point one

2507
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,719
and your preference is perfectly precise

2508
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:29,920
over observing outcome one um and that's

2509
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:31,760
your likelihood mapping

2510
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:35,440
then um policy whereas policy two

2511
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:38,960
is gonna is expected to um just

2512
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:42,080
uh generate 0.5.5 over states

2513
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:45,360
um then um and the outcomes

2514
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,960
that are associated with those states

2515
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,480
look like this

2516
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,520
then what you're going to get is

2517
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:55,280
a policy one is going to end up if you

2518
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,000
just

2519
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,800
do the math um out policy one is going

2520
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,719
to have a value of 2.4

2521
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:04,560
for that for that term whereas policy 2

2522
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,440
is going to have a value of 7.3 so this

2523
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,360
difference is going to be a lot bigger

2524
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,639
and therefore there's going to be more

2525
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:12,480
outcome prediction error and so the the

2526
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,600
policy that

2527
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,880
the first policy that's going to

2528
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,960
generate the outcomes that are closer to

2529
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,080
what you want

2530
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,679
is going to minimize that prediction

2531
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,280
error more

2532
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,960
and so again we just show examples we

2533
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,400
also have some examples of

2534
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,639
of this part but the basic idea here is

2535
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:28,639
if this is your likelihood function

2536
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:31,040
then state one here is kind of imprecise

2537
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,480
in what it predicts right it predicts

2538
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,480
one outcome with 0.4 and another outcome

2539
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,679
with 0.6

2540
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:37,760
whereas state 2 has a more precise

2541
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,960
distribution

2542
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,880
it generates outcome 1 with 0.2 and

2543
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,400
outcome 2 with 0.8

2544
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,239
so the agent would learn more if it

2545
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:45,440
moves to state 2

2546
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,639
because the outcomes are more

2547
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:48,960
informative

2548
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,280
and so basically these work examples

2549
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,800
just show how

2550
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,480
um the agent should to minimize outcome

2551
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,760
prediction or the age shouldn't the

2552
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:58,800
agent should be

2553
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,000
driven to uh choose to move to state two

2554
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,840
um and so um finally and i'm not going

2555
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:06,639
to go into this

2556
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:10,000
at all but we also show this um

2557
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,560
panel here that corresponds to another

2558
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,440
kind of element

2559
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,280
um that's been proposed in the neural

2560
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,440
process theory that has to do with

2561
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:20,400
model reduction and sleep and the basic

2562
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,000
idea is that sleep

2563
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,320
allows you to search for other models

2564
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:29,199
that you might you might entertain that

2565
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:30,800
can produce the same experiences you've

2566
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,480
had during the day but can do so in a

2567
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,400
simpler way

2568
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,639
so it's finding so sleep is basically

2569
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:38,719
still trying to minimize free energy

2570
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:40,800
but not with respect to new observations

2571
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,800
but just with respect to

2572
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,639
your model based on the experiences that

2573
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:47,199
you already had earlier

2574
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:50,320
and that corresponds to

2575
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,320
internal dynamics that can essentially

2576
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,159
prune away or reduce

2577
01:27:54,159 --> 01:27:56,000
the weights of synaptic connections that

2578
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,920
are contributing less

2579
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,760
to explaining um what you did so

2580
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,520
essentially kind of noise

2581
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,280
uh like like if there's a bunch of kind

2582
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,120
of coincidental

2583
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,400
um uh you know connections between

2584
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,520
different things you observe then

2585
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:10,719
there's some kind of noise in what

2586
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:11,920
you've learned

2587
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,360
and so you can during sleep you can

2588
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,960
reduce that um

2589
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,199
and here's just a few papers that have

2590
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:18,639
talked about that and shown

2591
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:21,199
simulations um in case people are

2592
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:22,239
interested

2593
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:25,679
um but so now

2594
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:27,920
moving on to what chris is going to talk

2595
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,199
about

2596
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:32,560
are hierarchical models and the idea

2597
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,639
here is you can just take

2598
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:37,280
the same exact structure of the model

2599
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:37,679
here

2600
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:40,719
that we've shown before um but instead

2601
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:41,440
of

2602
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,080
um but put a layer kind of below it

2603
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:45,600
that's the same kind of thing but

2604
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,840
instead of the observations being

2605
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,080
actual outcomes the observations are

2606
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,360
just whatever

2607
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,719
the states the beliefs over states are

2608
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:57,760
at the lower level or the observations

2609
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,280
the observations for the second level

2610
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,679
are just the posteriors over states

2611
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:04,719
at the first level and so that

2612
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:08,159
just looks like this where you see here

2613
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:09,920
that you still are selecting policies at

2614
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:10,880
the higher level

2615
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,400
although you can also select policies at

2616
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,320
the lower level but

2617
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:17,760
states at time two here just generate

2618
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,760
states at time one and states at time

2619
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,040
one or states of

2620
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,840
sorry states at level one act does the

2621
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:24,880
observations

2622
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:28,400
for level two

2623
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,320
as you can see necessarily these operate

2624
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,719
over a slower time scale as well

2625
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:36,320
so for instance at time one level two

2626
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,400
the first state state of time one is

2627
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:39,840
gonna generate

2628
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,040
the uh first state

2629
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:46,159
at time one at the lower level but then

2630
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:49,199
the lower level is gonna move to its

2631
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:50,960
beliefs at state two

2632
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:54,000
over a faster time scale

2633
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,679
and so this whole thing is going to

2634
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:57,440
repeat at the lower level so the thing

2635
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,440
is going to infer posteriors over states

2636
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:00,719
based on two

2637
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:03,840
observations at fast time scales

2638
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,760
and then the posterior beliefs over

2639
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,360
states at the lower level are then going

2640
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,360
to propagate up and act as

2641
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,480
the observations um for

2642
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,440
state one at time one at the higher

2643
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:16,239
level

2644
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:17,520
and then that's going to transition

2645
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,280
through a second level b matrix

2646
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:22,400
to beliefs over states at time two

2647
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:23,920
which then is just going to provide

2648
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,440
priors

2649
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:28,080
to a second trial to the start of a

2650
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,000
second trial

2651
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,199
at the lower level which again operates

2652
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:34,800
over a faster time scale so essentially

2653
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,480
this whole lower level model

2654
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,760
completes its belief update um before

2655
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,840
the higher level transitions to its next

2656
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,280
state um

2657
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,280
and in the neural process theory it

2658
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,199
really just involves taking

2659
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:49,679
the first level just kind of tacking on

2660
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:51,600
another level of neurons on top

2661
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,400
and making the observations of the

2662
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,840
second level the things that drive the

2663
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,360
prediction error

2664
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:00,480
and the states as just the posteriors

2665
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,159
over states at the first level so it's

2666
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:04,480
just kind of repeating the same thing

2667
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:08,000
but at a higher level in treating the uh

2668
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,760
the interactions between the second and

2669
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,440
the first level the same way that

2670
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,840
observations feed into the first level

2671
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,639
um and so if i raise a question on this

2672
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:17,199
slide

2673
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:20,080
from the chat someone asked can you

2674
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,600
please explain the relationship or

2675
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,600
difference between models based upon

2676
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,360
deep active inference versus

2677
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:26,960
sophisticated inference

2678
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:28,560
and how is that related to the current

2679
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,239
discussion around

2680
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:31,920
dopamine signaling whether it's phasic

2681
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,440
or non-basic so

2682
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:36,639
two questions one is what is deep

2683
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:38,880
active inference and how is that related

2684
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,639
to sophisticated active inference and

2685
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:41,440
how are those

2686
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,440
related to what we're discussing now

2687
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:46,000
about dopamine and i have i thought if

2688
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
but you can go ahead i can answer all

2689
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,520
these very quickly

2690
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:52,560
this is perfect answer go for it so

2691
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,840
deep active inference can kind of

2692
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:56,320
correspond to two things uh you can talk

2693
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,239
about it in terms of using deep neural

2694
01:31:58,239 --> 01:31:59,360
networks to

2695
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,920
parameterize your your essentially your

2696
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,040
a's and b's

2697
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:06,480
a and b matrices or your policies uh

2698
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:07,679
that would be kind of like a machine

2699
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:09,679
learning application in when i

2700
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:11,360
say deep active inference what i

2701
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,480
generally and what other people have

2702
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:13,920
talked about like the paper that first

2703
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,679
came out called like deep whatever

2704
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:17,040
the impact of inference it was just one

2705
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,800
of these hierarchical models whereas

2706
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,560
deep in the sense that there's this

2707
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:23,040
uh temporally deep uh or temporally

2708
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,159
thicker

2709
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:26,800
one could say uh time time scale stacked

2710
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:27,520
on top

2711
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:31,199
and so then in terms of sophisticated

2712
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:32,719
active inference that's just to do with

2713
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:33,679
policy selection

2714
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:36,159
um and where you're essentially doing

2715
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:37,040
something that

2716
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:40,080
looks more like a tree search

2717
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:43,760
um so i would just say i don't know it's

2718
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,440
equivalent to backward induction and

2719
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,960
reinforcement learning

2720
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,400
so you essentially instead of saying

2721
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,440
kind of propagating forwards on a tree

2722
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,360
you start at your terminal node and then

2723
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,600
you propagate backwards

2724
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,400
so you say given where i want to go how

2725
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,440
do i best get there

2726
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:02,400
and then propagate backwards uh and then

2727
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,840
i don't really know what the

2728
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:07,040
phasic non-phasic thing means uh

2729
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,440
yeah yeah i'm not i'm not aware of

2730
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:10,080
anybody

2731
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,880
sort of saying anything about um if

2732
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,120
there's any change in the dopamine story

2733
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:18,080
in sophisticated active inference um in

2734
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,040
that

2735
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,400
sophisticated act of inference you're

2736
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,639
still you're still obviously updating

2737
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:24,080
beliefs about policies when you make a

2738
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,520
new observation

2739
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,159
um but uh but yeah i mean the main

2740
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:29,440
difference like chris said is just it's

2741
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,000
just

2742
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,480
how you come to post your beliefs over

2743
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:33,520
policies

2744
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,960
by doing this sort of more thorough

2745
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,800
research where you have this

2746
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,040
additional element where you say you

2747
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,719
know given that i observe a thing

2748
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:43,199
at time two at a given branch and a tree

2749
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:45,679
what will my beliefs be at time two

2750
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:48,560
um and like like chris said it's

2751
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,159
equivalent to backward induction

2752
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:53,679
um and uh it's it's um

2753
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:56,960
anyway yeah so i without without again i

2754
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,159
don't think anyone's talked about this

2755
01:33:58,159 --> 01:33:58,800
much but

2756
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,880
presumably you still make new

2757
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,719
observations that update your beliefs

2758
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:05,199
over policies as you move through time

2759
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:07,760
um and so i don't necessarily see how

2760
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,600
the dopamine story would need to change

2761
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,719
um but uh but yeah um

2762
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:15,040
and i will say in addition to what chris

2763
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,320
said um

2764
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:20,239
they're really um two kind of related

2765
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:22,560
uh meeting meanings um independent of

2766
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:23,840
the kind of machine learning deep neural

2767
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,679
network thing that chris talked about

2768
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:27,040
one is and like you said the standard

2769
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,400
one is talking about deep temporal

2770
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,040
models

2771
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:32,239
yes and that's just exactly what i am

2772
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:35,440
was showing here where the second level

2773
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,760
necessarily operates at a slower time

2774
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,840
scale than the first level

2775
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,920
because the first level has to kind of

2776
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,400
complete all of its time steps

2777
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,440
um before it can provide an observation

2778
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:48,880
to the higher level

2779
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:51,119
and then the higher level so basically

2780
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:52,480
each higher level state

2781
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:55,360
corresponds to a whole lower level trial

2782
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:55,920
um

2783
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,119
you know so if you wanted to you could

2784
01:34:57,119 --> 01:34:58,719
make a lower level trial have ten time

2785
01:34:58,719 --> 01:34:59,679
steps

2786
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:01,679
but the posterior beliefs at that lower

2787
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:03,199
level at the end of this whole time step

2788
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:04,400
all those time steps

2789
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,280
would be you know what the observation

2790
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:07,679
um

2791
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:09,440
is that you know provides evidence for

2792
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,119
the first state at the first

2793
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:13,199
the state at the first time point at the

2794
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:14,480
second level

2795
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,719
so and then second level states

2796
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:17,760
transition

2797
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,840
and then the second level state so that

2798
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,119
basically one trial

2799
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:23,520
at the higher level with a two time

2800
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:24,719
points

2801
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,119
each of those time points corresponds to

2802
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:29,119
providing priors for a whole

2803
01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:31,280
trial at the lower level so you're going

2804
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:32,239
to have

2805
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:34,320
as many trials at the lower level as you

2806
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:36,080
have time steps in one trial at the

2807
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,239
higher level

2808
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:40,960
so so that's what deep temporal models

2809
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:41,280
means

2810
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,119
it's just that the second level operates

2811
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:44,560
at a slower time scale than the first

2812
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:46,320
and provides priors for

2813
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:49,280
initial states at the first level um

2814
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,000
another

2815
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,920
another meaning that some people use

2816
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,440
like in the deeply failed affect paper

2817
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,679
is just d parametric models

2818
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:58,000
which basically just means the first

2819
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:58,880
level

2820
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,719
out things that happen at the first

2821
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:02,320
level can be used as evidence for

2822
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,119
updating

2823
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:06,400
hyper parameters for the higher level um

2824
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,239
and like in the deeply filled effect

2825
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:09,920
paper basically we had second level

2826
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:11,760
states that corresponded to

2827
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,960
valence um but those were updated not by

2828
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,719
first level beliefs but by changes in

2829
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:17,920
beta

2830
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,400
at the lower level so when gamma updates

2831
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,440
were positive

2832
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,679
right when the confident and expected

2833
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:25,040
free energy went up

2834
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,199
there was a ascending signal that then

2835
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:29,280
updated beliefs at the second level

2836
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:32,159
that corresponded to feeling better

2837
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:34,080
right so positive valence

2838
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:37,119
um and those also that state could also

2839
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:38,080
act as

2840
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:41,679
a prior on um what the beta update

2841
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:43,840
should be right how confident the agent

2842
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,119
should be um

2843
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:46,719
at the lower level as trials go forward

2844
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:48,560
so it can also have to do with

2845
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:52,080
with um with uh and it's quote unquote

2846
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:52,639
deeper

2847
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:55,119
parameters um as opposed to just deeper

2848
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:56,000
uh

2849
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
deeper uh levels that control priors

2850
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,280
over states at the lower level

2851
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,480
um but that's not as commonly

2852
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:04,400
used um by far the most common is just

2853
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,320
deep temporal models

2854
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,360
do you have any more to add on the

2855
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:09,360
neural process or can we do our switch

2856
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:10,400
over

2857
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,600
um no neural process is pretty done um

2858
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:14,639
the only thing

2859
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:17,760
is is that before chris starts

2860
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,239
because what we're simulating when we're

2861
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:21,119
doing this

2862
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:22,960
example in the code of a hierarchical

2863
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,360
model the example we're using

2864
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,840
is an empirical task called a local

2865
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:28,639
global

2866
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:31,920
or oddball paradigm so chris is just

2867
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,600
gonna i'm just putting up this slide so

2868
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:34,320
that chris can

2869
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:38,159
walk us through the um the uh

2870
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:41,280
design of this task so just before we

2871
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,600
cross over just while we take a breath i

2872
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,880
want to make one

2873
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:48,159
ultra rapid summary for um just contrast

2874
01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:50,719
and then ask one question from the chat

2875
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:52,080
so the brief summary is

2876
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,920
we're dealing with the active inference

2877
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,080
framework we are within free energy

2878
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:57,360
principle we're talking about active

2879
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:58,560
inference that's why it's active

2880
01:37:58,560 --> 01:37:59,520
inference lab

2881
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:00,639
now we've heard about a couple of

2882
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:03,199
adjectives deep sophisticated

2883
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:05,920
affective and even inactive inference

2884
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,199
and those have been in the titles of

2885
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:08,639
papers or they've been the titles and

2886
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:09,280
models

2887
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:12,639
we heard about just very um concisely

2888
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:13,840
about what deep can mean

2889
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,600
whether deep neural networks or deep

2890
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,760
time and then there's a third definition

2891
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:18,880
of deep meaning like

2892
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,239
fully or radically parametric and that

2893
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:24,320
is interpreted within within the affect

2894
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,600
of valence framework

2895
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,040
within the paper that ryan just

2896
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,560
mentioned so that's deep and affective

2897
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:29,520
which are related

2898
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,280
then sophisticated is related to this

2899
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:33,119
tree surge counterfactual

2900
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:35,600
policy and state estimation we talked

2901
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:36,320
about the

2902
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,080
sophisticated inference in a previous

2903
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,840
stream and an active

2904
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:42,400
is highlighting more from an ecological

2905
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,159
or even a philosophical perspective

2906
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:46,639
about the embodied and enacted aspects

2907
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:47,600
of cognition

2908
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,360
so that's just a summary about a few of

2909
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,639
the flavors

2910
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:52,880
under the umbrella of active inference

2911
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:53,760
and

2912
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,840
they don't necessitate a renaming of the

2913
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,520
lab because they're like variants or

2914
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:58,639
paper titles

2915
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:00,400
but this is the total umbrella that

2916
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:01,760
we're working under

2917
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,360
and then the general question from the

2918
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,760
chat which i hope that set it up for

2919
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:06,960
and then we'll address this question

2920
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,960
each person give a very you know short

2921
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,159
response that we launched into

2922
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:13,119
chris's when preparing a model for

2923
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:13,840
exploring

2924
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,760
free energy principle active inference

2925
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:18,080
in matlab do you often sketch out

2926
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:18,800
equations

2927
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:20,800
with sample bayesian calculations for

2928
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,639
each term to help clarify your thinking

2929
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:24,000
and track what will happen

2930
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,239
or in other words how do you go from

2931
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:28,400
thinking or specifying the generative

2932
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,440
model of even

2933
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:32,159
a experiment into what you do when

2934
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:32,800
you're

2935
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,400
talking like you go from this behavioral

2936
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:35,840
example to the code

2937
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:39,440
how do you do that um i mean

2938
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,760
so for me honestly like when i'm

2939
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:42,960
actually setting up

2940
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:46,320
a model for a task um i don't really

2941
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,480
think about the equations hardly at all

2942
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,400
because you don't need to right i mean

2943
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,239
what you need to what you need to focus

2944
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:52,480
on

2945
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:55,360
is just what the necessary elements are

2946
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,679
in terms of states and observations

2947
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:01,040
um and policies um

2948
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,960
that are just in a task right so you

2949
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:04,320
have to think okay

2950
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:07,360
in a task what are the observations

2951
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:10,800
that the participant has right is there

2952
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:11,119
just

2953
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:13,920
one possible observation modality they

2954
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:15,679
either observe this or that

2955
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:17,679
or are there multiple observation

2956
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:19,920
modalities like maybe they observe a cue

2957
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:22,400
and then they observe a reward right and

2958
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,159
so then you need two observation

2959
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:25,360
modalities

2960
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,040
um right you think about how many in

2961
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:28,719
each modality right is it just q

2962
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:31,040
or no queue you know is it just reward

2963
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:32,800
or no reward or is it

2964
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:36,400
no reward reward or loss

2965
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,920
you know so you just think okay what are

2966
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:40,080
the different types of observations

2967
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:41,760
and how many observations within each

2968
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,679
type just you know what does the actual

2969
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:45,280
participant observe

2970
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:46,560
um and then you have to think about the

2971
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:48,560
states right what are the what is the

2972
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:50,480
participants beliefs what is the minimal

2973
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,159
set of beliefs they need

2974
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:55,040
to be able to make a decision right

2975
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:55,760
about

2976
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:58,239
how to get reward if it's a reward task

2977
01:40:58,239 --> 01:40:59,040
um

2978
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:01,520
you know so that might be beliefs about

2979
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:02,960
what uh trial type

2980
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,440
it is right or might be beliefs about

2981
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:06,480
what are the different

2982
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,800
choices i might make um right like

2983
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:11,040
moving into the state of choosing

2984
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:14,239
say option one versus option two um

2985
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:15,679
you know and then you have to think okay

2986
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:17,920
what are the different action sequences

2987
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:18,960
right like

2988
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:21,199
does the agent just push a button and

2989
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:22,400
get lucky you know

2990
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,960
reward or no reward or you know does the

2991
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,400
agent have to

2992
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,400
you know make a couple choices in a row

2993
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:29,600
you know just what are the actual

2994
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:30,719
options

2995
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:32,560
right and so i mean that's that's really

2996
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:34,000
what it boils down to is just

2997
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
figuring out what things do the

2998
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,360
participant observe

2999
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,520
you know what beliefs do they need to

3000
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:40,400
make choices

3001
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:43,520
what choices are available um you know

3002
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:43,840
and

3003
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,280
i mean it kind of it kind of builds

3004
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:47,440
itself beyond that um i mean you have to

3005
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,679
you have to realize that the the update

3006
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:51,199
equations in active inference you know

3007
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:52,960
we've actually been showing

3008
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:55,360
are are very general right they don't

3009
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,239
change at all

3010
01:41:56,239 --> 01:41:57,440
depending on what task you're

3011
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,719
implementing so you're not changing the

3012
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:00,560
equations all you're doing

3013
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,199
is using the exact same update equations

3014
01:42:03,199 --> 01:42:04,960
on a generative model

3015
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:08,719
that can successfully simulate behavior

3016
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:12,320
on a task so i i mainly think you just

3017
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,600
have to think about matrix and vector

3018
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,600
structure

3019
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,280
so i can actually answer this question

3020
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,360
just by building or showing how you get

3021
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:20,080
from this

3022
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,960
task structure to the code in question

3023
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,320
perfect

3024
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,920
um and so just to basically build on

3025
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,000
that um all that you think that's

3026
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,440
is the structure of the generated model

3027
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:31,280
because the update equations are totally

3028
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:32,080
generic

3029
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,000
and unless you're doing something like

3030
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,920
fairly advanced

3031
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,080
where you actually do need to specify

3032
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,080
some type of

3033
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:42,000
addition to the generative model use a

3034
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
new type of distribution whatever

3035
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,280
then you would need to rederive the

3036
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:47,119
update equations and you're going to

3037
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:47,520
have

3038
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,000
some time on your hands using taking all

3039
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,239
the functional derivatives and setting

3040
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:54,080
setting it setting the result equal to

3041
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:56,639
zero and figuring out what the answer is

3042
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:58,239
but i have never had to do that

3043
01:42:58,239 --> 01:43:00,239
personally and i think very very few

3044
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:01,520
people in the active infants literature

3045
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:04,159
have had to do that

3046
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:08,080
okay so in terms of

3047
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,880
this task this is a local global or

3048
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,880
basic like auditory modified auditory

3049
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,480
oddball paradigm

3050
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,239
um it was kind of i think this was the

3051
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:17,600
first paper that used it although i'm

3052
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:19,199
not completely sure about that

3053
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:22,560
but basically they just have play you a

3054
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,080
series of tones

3055
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:26,239
and there are four possible conditions

3056
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:27,760
and what they're trying to manipulate

3057
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:31,040
is your level of or the the time scale

3058
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:34,320
over which your expectations operate

3059
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:35,600
because they're trying to get at

3060
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,440
expectations at different levels of the

3061
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:38,960
cortical hierarchy

3062
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,199
and so the idea is is that you can have

3063
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:43,040
regularities at two time scales

3064
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:44,639
so the first time scale is the local

3065
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:46,159
time scale and that is just

3066
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:49,199
the series of five tones say so it might

3067
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:49,840
be

3068
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,520
and these tones can be two different

3069
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:53,199
frequencies so it might be beep beep

3070
01:43:53,199 --> 01:43:53,679
beep

3071
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:55,840
beep beep beep beep beep beep that type

3072
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,360
of thing

3073
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:00,880
um and the idea is is that

3074
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:04,080
let's say you violate an expectation on

3075
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,000
this local time scale this might be

3076
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,360
something like the bottom row here

3077
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:12,000
um this would be beep beep beep beep

3078
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:12,800
beep beep

3079
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,760
beep beep beep beep and if that happens

3080
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,679
80 percent of the time or 80

3081
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:19,520
of the trials you would have like a

3082
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:22,639
global expectation or expectation over a

3083
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:24,159
long time scale

3084
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:26,320
that there would be a violation on the

3085
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:27,760
four on the fifth

3086
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:30,800
um beep if that makes sense but on a

3087
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,960
local time scale for neuronal processes

3088
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,880
say in primary auditory cortex or

3089
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:35,520
wherever

3090
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,360
that are operating over this very rapid

3091
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,760
time scale they are blind

3092
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:42,800
to this more global regularity and so

3093
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:43,440
you will get

3094
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,679
essentially what this will give you is

3095
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:47,280
global

3096
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,440
expectations and violations of global

3097
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:50,880
expectations particularly

3098
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,840
give you a p300 so essentially that is a

3099
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:54,320
large

3100
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,280
positive potential over kind of like

3101
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:59,280
fronto-central electrode sites

3102
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:01,040
and that corresponds to a violation of

3103
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:02,800
global

3104
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,440
regularities whereas a mismatch

3105
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:06,400
negativity

3106
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:09,360
correspond which is kind of a negative

3107
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:09,840
uh

3108
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:12,159
i think i actually haven't i'm not an

3109
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:13,600
auditory neuroscientist so

3110
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:14,960
i'm sorry about this if i get it wrong

3111
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,960
but broadly speaking

3112
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:19,119
it's kind of over association cortices

3113
01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:20,480
in like all the tree association

3114
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:21,840
courtesies

3115
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:23,280
not a hundred percent about that though

3116
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:24,960
sorry i should look that up

3117
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:27,840
um anyway and that will correspond

3118
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:30,159
that's a negative going potential that's

3119
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:32,320
corresponds to violations of local

3120
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:33,679
expectations

3121
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:35,840
and so kind of i just the reason we use

3122
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:37,119
this is because it's kind of the

3123
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:39,040
simplest possible model

3124
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,199
that gives you some type of realistic

3125
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:42,080
dynamics

3126
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,679
and also kind of highlights the face

3127
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:45,440
validity of

3128
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:46,880
this computational framework if that

3129
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,679
makes sense um so any any questions

3130
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:50,960
would you like to add anything ryan

3131
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:51,440
before i

3132
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:52,800
pull out the code i mean i guess you

3133
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,480
know just just because i'm the one in

3134
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,000
control of the slide and the pointer

3135
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,280
here i mean i just just want to make

3136
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:58,960
sure that people understand exactly what

3137
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:01,520
what's corresponding to what you say so

3138
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,360
so basically the idea is just that

3139
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:05,199
at each short time scale right you could

3140
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:06,960
have each green one corresponds to a

3141
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,480
beep and the red one corresponds to a

3142
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:09,280
boop

3143
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,520
right so at the fast time scale you

3144
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:14,239
could be surprised that there's a boop

3145
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:17,520
at the end of four beeps um for instance

3146
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:18,000
if

3147
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,840
if most of the time for example it was

3148
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,600
just bpp beep

3149
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:24,080
then whenever there's a bbb boop then

3150
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:25,280
that's unexpected

3151
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:27,280
right so that's an expectation violation

3152
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:29,600
at a low fast time scale

3153
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:33,040
um but um what chris is saying is

3154
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:35,280
is that um you can also have a long time

3155
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,480
scale thing which is like

3156
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:39,840
how many times in a row is it bpb boop

3157
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:41,199
versus bbb beep

3158
01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:43,440
right so one longer time skill pattern

3159
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:44,239
would be

3160
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:47,440
four bpp beeps in a row um

3161
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,840
and so if you come to expect four bpp

3162
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,199
beefs in a row

3163
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:53,520
then if you hear a bbb boop then your

3164
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:56,080
belief about the expected sequence

3165
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:58,320
you know of these four trials um is what

3166
01:46:58,320 --> 01:46:59,440
would be violated

3167
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:02,000
or or not so at the fast time scale you

3168
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:02,480
can have

3169
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:06,080
violations for each series of bpp beeps

3170
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:07,760
at the higher time scale you can have i

3171
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:10,239
expect expectation violation

3172
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:13,840
about the sequence of bpp beeps

3173
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,600
um so that's so that's the idea is you

3174
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,119
can have long time skill violations and

3175
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:18,880
short time scale violations

3176
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,320
where the short test time scale ones

3177
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:21,760
correspond to the low level and the

3178
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:22,400
highest

3179
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:26,000
high uh the high level

3180
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,199
the second level of the model

3181
01:47:27,199 --> 01:47:28,960
corresponds to the beliefs about the

3182
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:29,520
sequence

3183
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:32,639
of ppp beeps um so anyway so that's

3184
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:34,159
what's called global regularity versus

3185
01:47:34,159 --> 01:47:35,440
local regularity

3186
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,840
yeah just for simplicity i just

3187
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:39,920
simulated the local deviation global

3188
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,760
standard condition

3189
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:44,400
so that would be um if you kind of look

3190
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:45,679
the third from the bottom

3191
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:48,239
on the right hand side of the screen

3192
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:51,440
imagine that um

3193
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:55,679
and the local standard global deviation

3194
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:58,800
um so that might be yeah exactly

3195
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:01,119
which is the very top um on the right

3196
01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:02,480
hand side of the screen

3197
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:05,280
and so i'll just pull out the code um

3198
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:05,760
sorry

3199
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:10,239
okay so now we gotta switch screens yep

3200
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:16,719
cool nice very interesting so far thanks

3201
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:17,440
a lot

3202
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:20,239
everyone and great questions too so can

3203
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:22,080
everyone see my screen

3204
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:25,040
yeah it looks good it's coming let's see

3205
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:25,440
cool

3206
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:28,480
okay let me just okay

3207
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:31,040
cool um so i now cannot see the chat or

3208
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:32,800
any of the anything so if you need to

3209
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,000
get my attention just like you'll have

3210
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,480
to shout out

3211
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:39,679
cool okay or just ask us periodically

3212
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:42,880
yeah yeah yeah so at the first level um

3213
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,719
so there's two levels this model

3214
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:46,560
and at the first level it's very simple

3215
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:47,920
the model there are

3216
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,679
there is one hidden state factor and it

3217
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:52,080
has two mutually exclusive states

3218
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:55,760
um high and it just corresponds to the

3219
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:57,840
tone of the stimulus and just high

3220
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:01,840
or low

3221
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:05,360
then in terms of we then separate the

3222
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:06,719
generative model from the generative

3223
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:07,280
process

3224
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:08,800
here like we talked about in the

3225
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:12,000
previous code walkthrough

3226
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:16,239
and then as we're going through kind of

3227
01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:18,159
in terms of the likelihood mapping it's

3228
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:20,080
again really simple

3229
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:22,639
uh it's just an a matrix so the a matrix

3230
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:24,400
is just an identity mapping

3231
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:26,159
where sorry these just to go through it

3232
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:28,480
very briefly to revise a bit

3233
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:31,280
the columns correspond to hidden states

3234
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:32,800
and the rows correspond to the

3235
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,400
observations so this is saying when you

3236
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:34,639
are

3237
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:38,480
in uh hidden state high tone

3238
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:39,920
you what is the probability that you

3239
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:41,520
will see a high tone well it's an

3240
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,920
identity matrix so it's probability one

3241
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:46,480
um when you're in state low tone what is

3242
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,080
the probability that you'll see a low

3243
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:50,320
tone and it's again hidden state one

3244
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:52,239
we can then separate the generated model

3245
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:53,679
from the generative process

3246
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:55,440
and the reason we do that is because

3247
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:58,320
this idea of there being uh

3248
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:01,119
so the generative process it is going to

3249
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:03,119
be the probability of a high tone

3250
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:04,800
hidden state or high tone state out

3251
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,880
there in the world giving rise to a

3252
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:09,920
high toned observation is is probability

3253
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,400
one

3254
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:13,280
but our generative model is noisy and if

3255
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:14,800
you want to actually simulate have an

3256
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:17,360
insular co-brain that's at all realistic

3257
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:19,280
you need to have some level of noise in

3258
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:21,280
that so what i did what we do there is

3259
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:22,880
we just run it through a soft max

3260
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:23,760
function

3261
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:25,440
run the a matrix through a softmax

3262
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:27,679
function

3263
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:29,440
with a temperature parameter that will

3264
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:31,280
very slightly

3265
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:34,800
turn down the precision so if i just

3266
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,000
kind of

3267
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,840
i'll just run all this

3268
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:44,239
and then if we just open up little a

3269
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:46,880
we see that's now not a perfect identity

3270
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:50,239
mapping but it's something pretty close

3271
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,159
by the way so the reason i do that is

3272
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:54,159
because one it's realistic but

3273
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:55,840
also if you want to get erps at all

3274
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:57,440
where erps are essentially changes in

3275
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:58,159
belief

3276
01:50:58,159 --> 01:51:00,080
if you have a perfect identity mapping

3277
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:01,840
you'll never get erps because the agent

3278
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:02,560
is 100

3279
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:06,480
confident all the time

3280
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,320
so you never have to change your beliefs

3281
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:10,239
if you've got perfect beliefs

3282
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:14,560
um okay then in terms of transitions

3283
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:18,159
um this is just the bees it is again

3284
01:51:18,159 --> 01:51:21,119
a identity mapping so that's just saying

3285
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:22,080
these

3286
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:25,440
that's perfectly stable uh high tones

3287
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,960
don't turn into low tones low tones

3288
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:28,719
don't turn into hype tones

3289
01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:31,119
and at this first level of the model

3290
01:51:31,119 --> 01:51:33,040
this is now we essentially plug all

3291
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:35,119
those variables into our mdp structures

3292
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:37,679
that we saw last time

3293
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:39,280
and at the first level of the model the

3294
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:40,800
thing that we need to specify

3295
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:43,920
is this t how many time steps are going

3296
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,119
to be at the first level

3297
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:47,599
per time steps at the second level and

3298
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:49,280
we only want there to be one so i'm just

3299
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:51,119
going to set that to one here

3300
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:54,719
and again erp we need to set that to one

3301
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:56,080
this is essentially a resetting

3302
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:58,880
parameter mdp.erp

3303
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,719
is the extent to which you reset your

3304
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:02,000
beliefs at each hidden

3305
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,080
after each time step at each new time

3306
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:06,239
step and the reason so say you are

3307
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:07,280
modeling a

3308
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:09,599
human being wandering through a maze

3309
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:12,320
where your time steps correspond to say

3310
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,639
a couple of seconds in between things it

3311
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:16,080
actually you actually should to be

3312
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:16,800
realistic

3313
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,719
or to be kind of have a realistic model

3314
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:20,000
you should have a little bit of

3315
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,199
resetting in your

3316
01:52:21,199 --> 01:52:24,800
posterior expectations if however

3317
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:26,800
in this case there's uh where on the

3318
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:28,960
scale of seconds or milliseconds

3319
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:30,560
then it makes absolutely no sense to

3320
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:32,000
have resetting going on in your

3321
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,320
posterior expectations so we set erp

3322
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:35,679
equal to one

3323
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:38,800
and um

3324
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:40,080
that will yeah the only thing the only

3325
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:42,080
thing i'll say here is this is this is

3326
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:43,199
something that you got to kind of watch

3327
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:44,159
out for because

3328
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:46,560
for whatever reason the default in the

3329
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:48,880
uh standard routines in the vbac the

3330
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,560
spm underscore mdp underscore vb

3331
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:52,560
underscore x script

3332
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:55,360
default is the default is four the

3333
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:56,960
default value for erp is four

3334
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:59,360
if you don't specify it and so you'll

3335
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:00,080
get

3336
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:04,000
pretty funny probably inaccurate um

3337
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,199
simulations for erps if you don't set it

3338
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:09,199
back to one explicitly

3339
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:11,920
so there's a time scaling factor for how

3340
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:13,159
things are playing out at the

3341
01:53:13,159 --> 01:53:15,119
neurophysiological versus the behavioral

3342
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:16,480
time scale

3343
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:18,159
well i mean it affects behavior too it's

3344
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:19,440
just saying it's just saying basically

3345
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:20,000
like

3346
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,679
yeah like chris said it's just how much

3347
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:24,080
do your beliefs go back to baseline

3348
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,400
um could compare to your posterior

3349
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,159
beliefs about that time about the

3350
01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:29,360
you know like after the first

3351
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:31,520
observation um

3352
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,280
so like you could be just as surprised

3353
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:35,119
or more surprised at time step two

3354
01:53:35,119 --> 01:53:37,280
even if your beliefs at time step one

3355
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,560
already favored what was going to happen

3356
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:41,040
in time step two yeah

3357
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:42,320
in a lot of cases you just don't want

3358
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:46,000
that you want priors to carry over

3359
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:49,280
so just in terms you could have

3360
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:50,800
something like complete resetting which

3361
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,159
would be completely ridiculous but you

3362
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:53,599
could do it if you wanted to

3363
01:53:53,599 --> 01:53:55,199
or you could have no resetting at all

3364
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:56,400
which is what makes sense in this

3365
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:57,840
situation because we want there to be

3366
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:58,800
complete carryover

3367
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,560
you can do model fitting on empirical

3368
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:02,000
data and ask whether it's a better

3369
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:02,800
fitting model

3370
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:06,000
to have a empirically a 0.6 or a 1 or a

3371
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,840
1.5

3372
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:09,920
could you could fit this you could you

3373
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:10,880
treat this as

3374
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:12,880
a parameter that you fit as well yeah

3375
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:14,400
yeah if you were fitting to like match

3376
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,239
erp waveforms or something yeah

3377
01:54:16,239 --> 01:54:19,199
yeah i would definitely fit it um okay

3378
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:21,040
so this is now this this next part is

3379
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:21,520
where

3380
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:23,599
there are two key points in this where

3381
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:25,119
we kind of there is a

3382
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:28,320
separation from how we would do

3383
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,760
a first level model or what a single

3384
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:31,520
level model so

3385
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:33,920
we need to clear so essentially usually

3386
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:35,599
you'll just clear all of your a's b's

3387
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:36,880
and d's because you're going to reuse

3388
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:40,239
those matrices at the second level

3389
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:43,360
and then you'll save your mdp structure

3390
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:45,040
and run it through this little mdp check

3391
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:46,320
thing which should give you some nice

3392
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:46,880
little error

3393
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,320
like very usually pretty helpful error

3394
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:49,679
messages telling you if you've got some

3395
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:51,599
weird shaped matrices or i don't know

3396
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:54,400
if i uh if i just have a zero here and

3397
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:55,520
ran it for example

3398
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:57,360
it would tell me hey your b matrix

3399
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:59,119
doesn't make any sense

3400
01:54:59,119 --> 01:55:02,159
um so then

3401
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:04,159
you'll then generally clear this mdp

3402
01:55:04,159 --> 01:55:05,679
structure and

3403
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:08,800
save the mdp1 into this little mdp

3404
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:12,239
this other mdp structure here so then

3405
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:13,520
moving on to

3406
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:16,719
the slower time scale or second level

3407
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:18,560
beliefs so this is where things get a

3408
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:21,599
little bit more complicated

3409
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
and so there are three hidden state

3410
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,560
factors where these are all independent

3411
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:29,920
probability distributions the first

3412
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:33,040
is sequence type and so this

3413
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:34,719
this is essentially there are three

3414
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:36,320
sequence types

3415
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:39,760
where this corresponds to sequences of

3416
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:41,920
tones at the first level so there can be

3417
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:43,199
a whole sequence

3418
01:55:43,199 --> 01:55:46,480
where it's just there's no boobs

3419
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:48,719
and so that would be all high there

3420
01:55:48,719 --> 01:55:50,960
could be all low so it's all boots

3421
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:53,199
there could be a high and then a low for

3422
01:55:53,199 --> 01:55:54,080
example

3423
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:55,840
and there could be a low and then a high

3424
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:57,920
so this would be does that kind of all

3425
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:00,080
make sense and this correspond where

3426
01:56:00,080 --> 01:56:01,920
this corresponds to

3427
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:05,199
different sequences of hidden states at

3428
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:07,919
the first level

3429
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:12,239
got it not all of them have to be used

3430
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:13,679
in each experiment but that's the whole

3431
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:14,800
state space

3432
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:17,679
yep exactly then this is this is

3433
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:19,679
actually where things get interesting so

3434
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:22,320
you have to specify when you build this

3435
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:23,599
type of models

3436
01:56:23,599 --> 01:56:26,239
you have to specify a time in trial

3437
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:28,080
hidden state factor which is essentially

3438
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:30,080
the agent's beliefs about how things

3439
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,679
evolve over time

3440
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:33,360
and there's actually some really it

3441
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:34,960
seems kind of

3442
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:37,119
like when i first ryan first taught me

3443
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:38,480
how to build these things i kind of just

3444
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:39,760
just had the assumption like oh yeah

3445
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:40,960
this is just like a

3446
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:42,320
this is something that you need to build

3447
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,080
for the model to work but it doesn't

3448
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:46,000
it's just kind of a bit of formal

3449
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,280
machinery that doesn't track what the

3450
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:48,239
brain's doing

3451
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:50,560
to my delight and surprise there

3452
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,920
actually is quite a bit of

3453
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,599
neurophysiological evidence

3454
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:54,960
that there are factorized

3455
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:57,199
representations of task phase in both

3456
01:56:57,199 --> 01:56:58,719
medial temporal lobes

3457
01:56:58,719 --> 01:57:01,840
and lateral prefrontal cortex which is

3458
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:05,440
really cool but essentially this would

3459
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:06,719
be something like

3460
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:09,440
the time in trial that so i'm at time

3461
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:10,000
point one

3462
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,159
regardless of what stimulus there is i'm

3463
01:57:12,159 --> 01:57:13,679
at time point two regardless of what

3464
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:15,520
stimulus there is i'm at time point

3465
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:18,239
n or i'm in the final time point where i

3466
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:20,560
have to give a response

3467
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:22,400
um regardless of what my response will

3468
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:24,159
actually be does that kind of all make

3469
01:57:24,159 --> 01:57:26,480
sense

3470
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:29,679
cool and then the last hidden state

3471
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:31,520
factor is just the agent's response

3472
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:34,480
so we make the to make this interesting

3473
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:35,760
so we could have just set this up as a

3474
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,280
hidden markov model and not had the

3475
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:38,800
agent give responses

3476
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,239
um which would have been fine just would

3477
01:57:40,239 --> 01:57:41,840
have been a very passive

3478
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:44,080
model and just kind of to make this

3479
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:44,960
interesting and then

3480
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:46,400
so that people can read it and then

3481
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,840
build their own more sophisticated

3482
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:49,440
models and see how you would specify

3483
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,960
policies in a deep model

3484
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:53,760
i basically had the agent at the last

3485
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:55,440
time step so the sixth

3486
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:59,599
time step just say whether the last

3487
01:57:59,599 --> 01:58:01,280
beep or boop in the trial was the same

3488
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:05,199
as or different from the previous

3489
01:58:05,199 --> 01:58:08,480
the previous beeps or boobs

3490
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:12,480
is that all clear so far yep

3491
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,159
yeah and then so the idea is is that

3492
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:16,239
these sequent types the agent has no

3493
01:58:16,239 --> 01:58:18,239
prior expectations over all of them it's

3494
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:19,440
totally flat

3495
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:21,840
so when this gets when this d first d1

3496
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:23,520
gets run to a softmax function this will

3497
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:25,679
just be a completely flat vector

3498
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:28,159
now but the agent always has a perfect

3499
01:58:28,159 --> 01:58:28,960
prior belief

3500
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:32,400
that it is in state one

3501
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:34,400
and it also has the perfect prior belief

3502
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:36,639
that it doesn't know or it's just not

3503
01:58:36,639 --> 01:58:39,360
it doesn't have any response prepared in

3504
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,080
terms of

3505
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:43,119
what report it will make

3506
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:45,520
again and what we do here is essentially

3507
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:46,880
we separate the generative model from

3508
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:48,159
the generative process

3509
01:58:48,159 --> 01:58:49,920
so just put little d2 just so it's kind

3510
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:51,360
of not to confuse people with

3511
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:55,199
these different levels and we multiply

3512
01:58:55,199 --> 01:58:57,040
what's this is actually really crucial

3513
01:58:57,040 --> 01:59:00,560
so when you specify a d and separate it

3514
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:02,560
there's a little flag in the vbx script

3515
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:04,400
or the model inversion script that

3516
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:08,000
tells it okay you are now learning d

3517
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:09,520
and you'll get updates to d but

3518
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:10,719
sometimes you don't actually want to

3519
01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:12,239
simulate learning

3520
01:59:12,239 --> 01:59:13,920
you want in the very same way that you

3521
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,280
want to like simulate

3522
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:17,840
some process outside of learning or some

3523
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:20,159
process independent of other things

3524
01:59:20,159 --> 01:59:21,520
in a lab when you actually run

3525
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:22,719
experiments sometimes you just want to

3526
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:24,639
isolate one process and simulation

3527
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:27,199
so to essentially turn off learning you

3528
01:59:27,199 --> 01:59:29,280
just make the concentration parameters

3529
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:31,520
in these which are concentration

3530
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:33,119
parameters from dirichlet distribution

3531
01:59:33,119 --> 01:59:35,840
like really massive and so the

3532
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:39,040
difference between say

3533
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:42,880
100 and if adding one adding a count of

3534
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:44,000
one will essentially do

3535
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,320
nothing to the agent's behavior then if

3536
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:47,679
the concentration parameter is already

3537
01:59:47,679 --> 01:59:48,400
at 100

3538
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:52,239
which is why we specify this way

3539
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:53,840
yeah so if you think about it i mean

3540
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:55,840
depending on the type of task

3541
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:58,000
if if the thing thinks that learning is

3542
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,760
going on because you're separating the

3543
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:00,960
generative model from the generative

3544
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:01,840
process

3545
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:03,760
then if you have low concentration

3546
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:05,040
parameter values

3547
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:08,320
then the uh then the epistemic value for

3548
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:11,280
parameter exploration will will make a

3549
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:12,000
big difference

3550
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,360
right the thing will actually be driven

3551
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:15,679
to move to states

3552
02:00:15,679 --> 02:00:17,840
that will help it learn something about

3553
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:19,599
what those concentration parameters

3554
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:22,639
should be um so it can affect behavior

3555
02:00:22,639 --> 02:00:25,840
in ways that kind of um uh

3556
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:27,920
cause problems for the kind of tasks

3557
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:29,440
that you're trying to model

3558
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:32,800
um so so one thing yes is that

3559
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:34,639
having them at really high values means

3560
02:00:34,639 --> 02:00:36,480
that the agent just isn't going to do

3561
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:36,880
any

3562
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:38,719
seeking information about parameters

3563
02:00:38,719 --> 02:00:39,920
because it just thinks it already knows

3564
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:40,400
them

3565
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:44,000
really well um but also it still

3566
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,599
is going to add counts to those

3567
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:47,840
distributions after each observation

3568
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:50,719
so like you know changing a distribution

3569
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:52,960
from like 100 to 100

3570
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:57,119
2 100 to 101 the actual distribution

3571
02:00:57,119 --> 02:00:59,520
is like still basically the same whereas

3572
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:00,239
if it was like

3573
02:01:00,239 --> 02:01:02,080
one and one and you add a count so it's

3574
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:03,280
not one and two

3575
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:04,480
that's a very big change in the

3576
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:06,480
distribution um

3577
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:07,840
so both of those things together just

3578
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:10,239
kind of make it as though

3579
02:01:10,239 --> 02:01:12,400
it doesn't think it it's learning

3580
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:14,799
anything

3581
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:20,159
cool okay um is that cleared everyone

3582
02:01:20,159 --> 02:01:20,800
all good to

3583
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:23,840
move on

3584
02:01:24,239 --> 02:01:27,199
yep so okay so then the next thing so i

3585
02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:27,679
think

3586
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:29,360
the hardest part of doing active

3587
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:30,880
inference or building these models is

3588
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:32,960
factorizing the a matrix so these are

3589
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:34,880
all independent distributions

3590
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:38,719
right but they interact in the a matrix

3591
02:01:38,719 --> 02:01:40,080
and so you have to that you have to

3592
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:42,159
think about that when you're specifying

3593
02:01:42,159 --> 02:01:42,639
it

3594
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:44,480
and so what this one what this matrix

3595
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:46,400
says is so remember that

3596
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:49,040
our first hidden state is uh sequence

3597
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:49,520
type

3598
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:51,520
so this is just and our first outcome

3599
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:53,360
modality is just the stimulus

3600
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:54,880
and i'm just going to quickly dip down

3601
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:56,639
to see how these how this level is

3602
02:01:56,639 --> 02:01:58,480
connected to the bottom level

3603
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:00,000
we have to specify something called a

3604
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,239
link function and this will just be a

3605
02:02:02,239 --> 02:02:03,760
little matrix or a vector depending on

3606
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:04,000
how

3607
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,679
many states hidden state modalities you

3608
02:02:05,679 --> 02:02:07,599
have at the first and second level

3609
02:02:07,599 --> 02:02:11,199
where the rows in this matrix correspond

3610
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:15,840
to lower level hidden state factors

3611
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:19,360
and the columns correspond to high level

3612
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:21,520
uh outcome modalities and so all that

3613
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:23,360
we're saying and so when you specify

3614
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,560
these things you actually need to be

3615
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:25,760
careful

3616
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:29,199
that say the number of even states

3617
02:02:29,199 --> 02:02:31,920
you have at the higher level well sorry

3618
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:33,119
the number of outcomes

3619
02:02:33,119 --> 02:02:34,159
that are possible in your outcome

3620
02:02:34,159 --> 02:02:36,719
modality match the number of hidden

3621
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:38,080
states that you have

3622
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:41,119
in your first level

3623
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:45,520
at the first level does that make sense

3624
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:46,159
because

3625
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:48,080
your second level of your model is

3626
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:50,080
treating those first level hidden states

3627
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:53,040
as observations

3628
02:02:56,239 --> 02:02:59,199
so here the two observations are high

3629
02:02:59,199 --> 02:03:01,119
tone or low tone and all this is saying

3630
02:03:01,119 --> 02:03:01,920
so this this

3631
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:04,400
first column is high tone second column

3632
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:04,960
is

3633
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:08,159
or high sequence second column is low

3634
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:08,800
sequence

3635
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:11,840
third column is high then low

3636
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:14,800
and last one is high is low than high

3637
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:15,360
this is

3638
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:17,520
and we're specifying this for time step

3639
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:19,280
one to three

3640
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:21,679
so what we're doing here is we are going

3641
02:03:21,679 --> 02:03:22,639
to

3642
02:03:22,639 --> 02:03:24,639
so we have a set up at a matrix where

3643
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:26,560
there's four hidden states

3644
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:29,920
corresponding to sequence type and two

3645
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:32,000
outcomes just to reiterate and then what

3646
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,199
we're going to do is we're going to loop

3647
02:03:33,199 --> 02:03:34,320
over

3648
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:37,679
the six time points in the trial and

3649
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:40,840
loop over the order of states in the

3650
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:42,800
report and so then we're just going to

3651
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:43,360
step

3652
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:46,559
but um

3653
02:03:47,599 --> 02:03:50,159
then basically i'm just going to set set

3654
02:03:50,159 --> 02:03:51,599
set this up so that

3655
02:03:51,599 --> 02:03:53,760
um the time that there's just an

3656
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:54,719
identity mapping

3657
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:56,880
essentially between hidden states and

3658
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:59,440
observations

3659
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:01,119
and i've done this i've looped this over

3660
02:04:01,119 --> 02:04:02,719
all but this is actually not an accurate

3661
02:04:02,719 --> 02:04:04,480
generated model because we want there

3662
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:06,880
to be an oddball at the fourth time step

3663
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:07,599
and so i

3664
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:10,560
just specify that here so i take this i

3665
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:13,040
set which corresponds to

3666
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:15,599
this kind of second hidden state factor

3667
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:17,520
and i set it equal to four

3668
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:18,800
and what you can see here is that

3669
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:20,560
there's now a change in the mapping

3670
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:23,520
so remember this first column is high

3671
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:24,639
second column is

3672
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:27,679
low third column is high low third

3673
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:29,840
and then fourth column is low high so we

3674
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:31,360
now see a change so this is then saying

3675
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:33,040
when you're in a high hidden state

3676
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:36,400
at the fourth time step you'll see

3677
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:38,960
a high tone when you're in a low tone at

3678
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:39,920
the same thing

3679
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:42,400
but it gets interesting or it gets a

3680
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:44,159
change you get a change from the matrix

3681
02:04:44,159 --> 02:04:44,719
above

3682
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:46,719
at the fourth time step because when

3683
02:04:46,719 --> 02:04:48,000
it's in a high low

3684
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,560
at the fourth time step it will it will

3685
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:51,440
hear a low

3686
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:54,800
low tone and at in low high you'll hear

3687
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:56,159
a high tone

3688
02:04:56,159 --> 02:04:59,360
is everyone pretty clear about that

3689
02:05:00,719 --> 02:05:04,000
yes and we're looping over

3690
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,880
all this one what j equals one to three

3691
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:08,480
in both of these is just saying we're

3692
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:10,800
looping over all possible responses

3693
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:12,639
so we're not making that identity that

3694
02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:14,480
mapping between those hidden states

3695
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:15,280
between

3696
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:17,520
the first sequence sequence um first

3697
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:19,520
hidden state sequence

3698
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:23,760
and in any way dependent on the response

3699
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:27,360
so it's independent of that

3700
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:29,280
so then the second outcome modality that

3701
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:31,040
we need to specify is just report

3702
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:31,840
feedback

3703
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:33,840
so with the agent we're going to have it

3704
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:35,520
make an action

3705
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:37,360
or specify a policy allowing it to make

3706
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:38,960
an action at

3707
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:40,960
the fifth time step at the end of the

3708
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:43,119
fifth time step

3709
02:05:43,119 --> 02:05:46,840
so i'm sorry the sixth time step rather

3710
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:48,079
um

3711
02:05:48,079 --> 02:05:51,119
and we then

3712
02:05:51,119 --> 02:05:53,520
need to kind of give the agent feedback

3713
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:54,320
so

3714
02:05:54,320 --> 02:05:56,880
there are three hidden states and this

3715
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:57,760
is no longer

3716
02:05:57,760 --> 02:05:59,520
this feedback modality is not connected

3717
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:01,760
to the first level

3718
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:03,440
and so there are three outcomes null

3719
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:05,199
which is just we don't give the agent

3720
02:06:05,199 --> 02:06:07,040
any feedback so it just has a totally

3721
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:09,119
flat

3722
02:06:09,119 --> 02:06:10,960
preference distribution essentially over

3723
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:12,639
this

3724
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:15,920
over null doesn't care for the first

3725
02:06:15,920 --> 02:06:17,199
five time steps

3726
02:06:17,199 --> 02:06:20,400
and then at the sixth time step we need

3727
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:22,000
to start messing with

3728
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,119
whether it thinks it's going to be

3729
02:06:23,119 --> 02:06:24,719
whether agents thinks it's going to

3730
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:25,360
receive

3731
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:28,400
wrong versus right feedback so

3732
02:06:28,400 --> 02:06:30,960
this would be saying something like okay

3733
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:32,639
so here you report that they

3734
02:06:32,639 --> 02:06:35,920
are the same so this is response

3735
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:39,119
two so j equals two and i

3736
02:06:39,119 --> 02:06:40,719
equals six correspond to the six time

3737
02:06:40,719 --> 02:06:43,040
step so these where these correspond to

3738
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:46,239
what we're indexing into elements of

3739
02:06:46,239 --> 02:06:49,440
these hidden state factors

3740
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:51,520
and then so the idea is then what this

3741
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:53,199
is saying is that

3742
02:06:53,199 --> 02:06:55,360
at hidden state for one and two if you

3743
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:56,880
say they're the same remember this is

3744
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:59,040
all highs all lows if you then say it's

3745
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:00,719
the same you will get correct

3746
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:03,760
feedback and because this is high

3747
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:05,840
low and low high if you say it's the

3748
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:08,320
same will give you incorrect feedback

3749
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:11,040
then we see this is reversed when we say

3750
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:12,800
the agent is going to give the agent the

3751
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:13,920
option to report

3752
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:18,560
different so these two will be incorrect

3753
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:21,920
for high and low sequences and correct

3754
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:25,840
for low high and high low

3755
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:28,400
everyone with me

3756
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:33,280
yep cool okay then again

3757
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:35,360
just like we did before we're going to

3758
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:36,320
reduce

3759
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:39,119
the um constant we're going to separate

3760
02:07:39,119 --> 02:07:40,239
the hidden states in the

3761
02:07:40,239 --> 02:07:43,360
um sorry the uh hidden uh

3762
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:44,639
generative model from the generative

3763
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:46,800
process and reduce the precision

3764
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:48,960
by with a temperature parameter of two

3765
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:50,400
which is super precise it's just not a

3766
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:51,920
perfect identity mapping

3767
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:54,159
and we're then going to disable learning

3768
02:07:54,159 --> 02:07:55,599
again because we're not interested in

3769
02:07:55,599 --> 02:07:58,000
learning at the moment

3770
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,320
um by the way you do get fairly similar

3771
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:01,599
results if you do learning so i'm not

3772
02:08:01,599 --> 02:08:03,280
kind of like uh cooking the books

3773
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:05,360
it's just that in terms of the tutorial

3774
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:06,480
it didn't really make sense

3775
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:08,400
to add an extra several lines on

3776
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:11,679
learning for a fairly simple simulation

3777
02:08:11,679 --> 02:08:13,599
it's awesome and just to highlight that

3778
02:08:13,599 --> 02:08:15,280
is a similar design move

3779
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:17,040
as when you mentioned several times

3780
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:18,639
separating the generative process from

3781
02:08:18,639 --> 02:08:19,360
the model

3782
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:21,360
it allows you to have a cue that isn't

3783
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:22,880
always associated like

3784
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:24,560
high tone is the high tone they hear it

3785
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:26,480
perfectly but now it's a situation where

3786
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:28,159
they can't really tell if it's one shade

3787
02:08:28,159 --> 02:08:29,599
of a color or another so

3788
02:08:29,599 --> 02:08:31,920
it it allows a lot of expressivity and

3789
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:33,520
it will just be really awesome to

3790
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:36,400
in the coming months and years see and

3791
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:37,599
return to the code

3792
02:08:37,599 --> 02:08:39,280
to understand exactly how different

3793
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:41,360
groups are implementing it to model

3794
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:43,040
different specific situations that kind

3795
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:44,800
of just go down these roads that you're

3796
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,239
just pointing out but we're staying on

3797
02:08:46,239 --> 02:08:46,560
the

3798
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:48,159
on the freeway but you're pointing out

3799
02:08:48,159 --> 02:08:49,360
different exits that really are

3800
02:08:49,360 --> 02:08:50,639
interesting

3801
02:08:50,639 --> 02:08:52,639
yeah exactly so there's lots of i mean

3802
02:08:52,639 --> 02:08:53,920
there's quite a few different

3803
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:56,079
like like in previous papers you know

3804
02:08:56,079 --> 02:08:57,040
for instance like

3805
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:58,480
we've modeled things like noisy like

3806
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:00,320
noisy learning right so where for

3807
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:01,679
instance like in the generative process

3808
02:09:01,679 --> 02:09:02,159
it is

3809
02:09:02,159 --> 02:09:03,520
you're always being presented with one

3810
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:05,760
object right and that's like 100

3811
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:08,960
true but the the a matrix and the

3812
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:10,239
generative model

3813
02:09:10,239 --> 02:09:12,079
you know you kind of soft max it with

3814
02:09:12,079 --> 02:09:13,599
some precision parameter like chris was

3815
02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:14,800
doing so it's

3816
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:17,520
it's um not very precise so it's kind of

3817
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:19,040
like for instance like seeing an object

3818
02:09:19,040 --> 02:09:20,719
but having it be blurry

3819
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:23,040
you know or something like that um you

3820
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:24,880
know so it's how well do you learn

3821
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:27,360
uh from stuff even if what you're seeing

3822
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:28,800
is kind of imprecise or like for

3823
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:30,560
instance figuring out where

3824
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:32,400
whether a tone was present in some like

3825
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:34,320
white noise you know like into some

3826
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:36,159
experiments to do that kind of thing so

3827
02:09:36,159 --> 02:09:37,520
yeah i mean these models are incredibly

3828
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:39,599
flexible um for whether you want to do

3829
02:09:39,599 --> 02:09:41,199
just perception or just learning or just

3830
02:09:41,199 --> 02:09:43,040
decision making or decision making with

3831
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:44,400
or without learning

3832
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:46,159
um so it's i mean that's part of why

3833
02:09:46,159 --> 02:09:48,239
they're so why they're so uh

3834
02:09:48,239 --> 02:09:51,199
nice yeah and so then just kind of

3835
02:09:51,199 --> 02:09:52,239
moving on to the transition

3836
02:09:52,239 --> 02:09:53,440
probabilities

3837
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:56,480
um so b b2 this is just

3838
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:58,480
so this corresponds to our first ident

3839
02:09:58,480 --> 02:09:59,520
uh sequence

3840
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:01,920
of tones hidden state factor and this is

3841
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:03,599
an identity matrix

3842
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:05,119
four by four identity matrix because

3843
02:10:05,119 --> 02:10:06,719
there are four hidden steps

3844
02:10:06,719 --> 02:10:08,480
um this is just saying that our our

3845
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:09,840
sequence doesn't change to another

3846
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:11,199
sequence halfway through that makes

3847
02:10:11,199 --> 02:10:12,719
sense right

3848
02:10:12,719 --> 02:10:15,520
um now our things get interesting in

3849
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:17,119
terms of specifying the transition

3850
02:10:17,119 --> 02:10:18,000
functions

3851
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,639
uh when we talk about the second our

3852
02:10:20,639 --> 02:10:21,760
kind of

3853
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:25,199
trial phase uh

3854
02:10:25,199 --> 02:10:28,239
transitions and our policies so the idea

3855
02:10:28,239 --> 02:10:29,360
here is that

3856
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:32,800
we then specify this trial phase

3857
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:36,400
transition function so that

3858
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:39,360
it will kind of deterministically step

3859
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:40,239
through

3860
02:10:40,239 --> 02:10:41,760
all of the phases in the sequence so

3861
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:43,280
this is state one

3862
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:45,679
or row sorry columns r state hidden

3863
02:10:45,679 --> 02:10:46,400
state one

3864
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:49,360
rows are will be kind of hidden state

3865
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:50,480
one hidden state two

3866
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:52,320
so what this is saying is that at time

3867
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:54,560
one a hidden state one transitions to

3868
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:55,440
hidden state two

3869
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:56,960
hidden state two transitions to hidden

3870
02:10:56,960 --> 02:10:59,119
state three and so on and if i wanted to

3871
02:10:59,119 --> 02:11:00,560
if i wanted to

3872
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:02,480
to simulate some infinite number like

3873
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:03,920
it's not actually infinite this is a

3874
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:05,599
finite horizon mdp

3875
02:11:05,599 --> 02:11:08,159
but if i wanted this infinite sum or

3876
02:11:08,159 --> 02:11:09,920
sorry simulate some very large number of

3877
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:11,119
these trials

3878
02:11:11,119 --> 02:11:13,920
i could put the last one so this last

3879
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:15,040
trial

3880
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:17,199
or sorry when it's in the last report

3881
02:11:17,199 --> 02:11:19,119
phase it will transition back

3882
02:11:19,119 --> 02:11:21,199
to the first phase for example but i

3883
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:22,400
don't want to do that i just want to

3884
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:23,920
have the last time step in the trial as

3885
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:25,199
an absorbing state

3886
02:11:25,199 --> 02:11:27,119
that it'll that the simulation will stop

3887
02:11:27,119 --> 02:11:28,800
on and then

3888
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,880
uh simulate each trial as kind of a

3889
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:32,159
separate thing

3890
02:11:32,159 --> 02:11:33,920
but just highlight that in case you

3891
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:35,360
wanted to do it if you wanted to like

3892
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:37,040
simulate um

3893
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:38,800
there are some ways of simulating kind

3894
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:40,639
of heartbeats and things like that where

3895
02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:41,599
you specify

3896
02:11:41,599 --> 02:11:43,760
a transition function that has an orbit

3897
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:46,400
built into it

3898
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:50,320
so then in terms of report this is this

3899
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:52,880
is the controllable hidden state factor

3900
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:55,760
and these it'll will add will now have

3901
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:57,760
like a multi-dimensional matrix

3902
02:11:57,760 --> 02:12:00,480
um where the third dimension in the

3903
02:12:00,480 --> 02:12:02,159
matrix just corresponds to

3904
02:12:02,159 --> 02:12:04,719
basically the control state so this

3905
02:12:04,719 --> 02:12:07,440
would just be uh i am in null and i am

3906
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:09,199
going to stay in null

3907
02:12:09,199 --> 02:12:10,639
i'm not going to do anything the second

3908
02:12:10,639 --> 02:12:12,480
one would be you can get

3909
02:12:12,480 --> 02:12:14,239
from any hidden state you can chorus you

3910
02:12:14,239 --> 02:12:15,840
can transition yourself into reporting

3911
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:16,320
same

3912
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:17,920
and this third one is from any hidden

3913
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:19,599
state you can transition yourself into

3914
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:21,679
reporting different

3915
02:12:21,679 --> 02:12:24,639
then in terms of the policies there are

3916
02:12:24,639 --> 02:12:25,440
six hidden

3917
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:27,440
six time steps so we specify that here

3918
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:29,040
we specify the number of

3919
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:31,199
hidden state factors so remember again

3920
02:12:31,199 --> 02:12:34,079
there's uh sequence type

3921
02:12:34,079 --> 02:12:37,440
uh time and trial and report modality so

3922
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:41,280
three then we've got two policies so

3923
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:42,719
these are the number of options that the

3924
02:12:42,719 --> 02:12:44,320
agent will have

3925
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:46,560
and then these are deep policies so the

3926
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:48,400
agent which is consistent throughout the

3927
02:12:48,400 --> 02:12:51,040
whole trial and so basically

3928
02:12:51,040 --> 02:12:53,360
or this is to say the agent will be

3929
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:54,320
computing these

3930
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:57,199
over the course of the whole trial if

3931
02:12:57,199 --> 02:12:58,480
that makes sense

3932
02:12:58,480 --> 02:13:00,639
um and so all this is saying is that the

3933
02:13:00,639 --> 02:13:03,119
agent stays in state hidden kind of

3934
02:13:03,119 --> 02:13:05,040
action one which is just null it doesn't

3935
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:06,239
do anything it doesn't do anything it

3936
02:13:06,239 --> 02:13:07,760
doesn't do anything can't do anything

3937
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:10,000
and at the last time step we allow it to

3938
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:10,480
choose

3939
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:12,000
and that just corresponds to kind of you

3940
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
can imagine not actually presenting the

3941
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:14,960
participant with

3942
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:16,719
in a psychophysics experiment or

3943
02:13:16,719 --> 02:13:18,079
whatever not

3944
02:13:18,079 --> 02:13:20,239
presenting it with an option to actually

3945
02:13:20,239 --> 02:13:21,599
move change the key

3946
02:13:21,599 --> 02:13:22,800
hit a keyboard or anything like that

3947
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:26,239
until the last time step of the trial

3948
02:13:26,239 --> 02:13:29,440
um okay so last bit uh any questions so

3949
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:31,839
far

3950
02:13:32,239 --> 02:13:35,920
no looks pretty good though thank you

3951
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:37,920
um then okay so then we've got the first

3952
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:38,960
c matrix

3953
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:42,239
this will just be a two by t

3954
02:13:42,239 --> 02:13:46,079
or two by six matrix

3955
02:13:46,079 --> 02:13:48,400
of zeros so if i just kind of hit go on

3956
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:51,500
this we can take a look at it

3957
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:54,539
[Music]

3958
02:13:56,840 --> 02:13:58,000
whoops

3959
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,679
i'm going to hit run at some point soon

3960
02:13:59,679 --> 02:14:02,320
we can check out everything

3961
02:14:02,320 --> 02:14:03,920
but this is just what the c matrix looks

3962
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:06,480
like so it this is the preference

3963
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:07,920
for the agent's preference for hearing a

3964
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:09,360
particular tone so this is just saying

3965
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:11,119
agent doesn't care at all it has no

3966
02:14:11,119 --> 02:14:13,839
preference for tone

3967
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:17,679
then our report hidden state this is

3968
02:14:17,679 --> 02:14:19,679
again it's going to be completely flat

3969
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:21,679
essentially except for at the last time

3970
02:14:21,679 --> 02:14:24,239
step when it receives feedback

3971
02:14:24,239 --> 02:14:26,000
it has a preference for not being

3972
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,440
incorrect and

3973
02:14:27,440 --> 02:14:31,599
a uh preference for being correct

3974
02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:33,679
um so i just uh just i just want to make

3975
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:35,119
sure people understand that that

3976
02:14:35,119 --> 02:14:37,840
so the uh the brackets um you know we

3977
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:38,960
went over this last time but the

3978
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:39,599
brackets

3979
02:14:39,599 --> 02:14:41,440
cor like are what say what outcome

3980
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:43,679
modality corresponds to what a matrix

3981
02:14:43,679 --> 02:14:47,040
oh yeah so like c2 brackets two means

3982
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:48,400
that that corresponds to the

3983
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:49,840
observations

3984
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:54,560
in uh the a matrix uh with brackets too

3985
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:57,360
right so so that's how you that's how

3986
02:14:57,360 --> 02:14:58,000
you know

3987
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,480
that this is the one that corresponds to

3988
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:01,440
observing

3989
02:15:01,440 --> 02:15:03,920
feedback um whereas the first one is the

3990
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:05,360
one that corresponds to just observing

3991
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:05,840
tone

3992
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:07,360
so just just to make it clear that you

3993
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:09,440
use the bracket numbers to assign

3994
02:15:09,440 --> 02:15:12,480
to the outcome modalities yeah

3995
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:14,079
and then so then that's basically we've

3996
02:15:14,079 --> 02:15:15,840
built our mdp so we're just going to

3997
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:17,840
specify it so we've we've now got our

3998
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:20,000
earlier mdp structure if we remember

3999
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,880
so this is mdp one and this is the thing

4000
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:24,800
that we specified all the way back when

4001
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:27,040
we were talking about level one

4002
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:29,760
um and we then plugged that into our new

4003
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:30,239
mdp

4004
02:15:30,239 --> 02:15:33,520
structure so we'll have mdp.mdp so this

4005
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:33,920
is the

4006
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:36,239
the markov decision process at the lower

4007
02:15:36,239 --> 02:15:37,119
level

4008
02:15:37,119 --> 02:15:39,920
we then plug it into this our new mdp

4009
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:41,520
structure

4010
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:44,960
or this will just be a subordinate mdp

4011
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:46,719
and we have to specify a link function

4012
02:15:46,719 --> 02:15:48,079
we talked about that before but just to

4013
02:15:48,079 --> 02:15:49,520
reiterate

4014
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:54,719
rows here are or sorry i'll start with

4015
02:15:54,719 --> 02:15:57,520
rows are lower level hidden state

4016
02:15:57,520 --> 02:15:58,239
factors

4017
02:15:58,239 --> 02:16:01,599
and columns are higher level observation

4018
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:04,000
modalities so all that we're saying here

4019
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,560
is that we want the low level

4020
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:08,079
observation modality or

4021
02:16:08,079 --> 02:16:10,239
low level hidden state one to plug into

4022
02:16:10,239 --> 02:16:11,440
observation modality

4023
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:14,639
one so the hidden states the first level

4024
02:16:14,639 --> 02:16:16,320
will be treated but as observations at

4025
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:19,040
the second level

4026
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:20,880
um okay then we just plug in all of our

4027
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:22,320
variables that we saw before

4028
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:24,400
time our likelihood mapping the

4029
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:25,360
generative

4030
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:28,560
model for our likelihood mapping um etc

4031
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:29,440
etc

4032
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:32,718
and so c's these and our v which is

4033
02:16:32,718 --> 02:16:35,439
our policies and then again we need to

4034
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:36,318
reset our

4035
02:16:36,318 --> 02:16:41,599
decay reset parameter to number one

4036
02:16:41,599 --> 02:16:44,478
then in terms of mdp that we can just

4037
02:16:44,478 --> 02:16:45,679
specify names

4038
02:16:45,679 --> 02:16:47,519
for our outcome modalities and our

4039
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:48,799
transition functions which will just

4040
02:16:48,799 --> 02:16:49,679
kind of make

4041
02:16:49,679 --> 02:16:51,040
interpreting the plots a little bit

4042
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:53,280
nicer and then lastly

4043
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:54,799
you just plug the whole thing this whole

4044
02:16:54,799 --> 02:16:56,558
mdp structure into spm

4045
02:16:56,558 --> 02:16:58,318
mdp check thing which will again give

4046
02:16:58,318 --> 02:17:00,160
you some nice informative error messages

4047
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:02,080
which are extremely helpful

4048
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:05,840
um i still use that thing all the time

4049
02:17:05,840 --> 02:17:09,200
um and then we can just run it

4050
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:12,398
and so let's do that right now and by

4051
02:17:12,398 --> 02:17:14,318
the way so i i do have a lot

4052
02:17:14,318 --> 02:17:17,679
of uh i'm just going to run it and kind

4053
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:18,879
of show you what it looks like and then

4054
02:17:18,879 --> 02:17:20,478
i'm going to go through how i simulated

4055
02:17:20,478 --> 02:17:22,240
each of the specific conditions

4056
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:23,840
because we did something similar to how

4057
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:26,840
we simulate ryan simulated learning

4058
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:29,840
um

4059
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:42,879
okay

4060
02:17:42,879 --> 02:17:44,879
cool so i'm gonna hide this stuff for

4061
02:17:44,879 --> 02:17:46,799
now um

4062
02:17:46,799 --> 02:17:49,759
slight spoiler

4063
02:17:50,318 --> 02:17:53,519
um okay and so this is just i'll just

4064
02:17:53,519 --> 02:17:54,840
look at one of them

4065
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:57,679
sorry just so we get an idea of what's

4066
02:17:57,679 --> 02:17:59,280
going on

4067
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:01,599
um so this is just hidden state sequence

4068
02:18:01,599 --> 02:18:02,879
the sequence is the same

4069
02:18:02,879 --> 02:18:04,318
the agent believes it was the same

4070
02:18:04,318 --> 02:18:06,000
throughout the whole trial great that's

4071
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:06,879
true

4072
02:18:06,879 --> 02:18:09,120
uh time in trial transition to the next

4073
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:10,718
point just as we expected it

4074
02:18:10,718 --> 02:18:12,879
and then at the last time step because

4075
02:18:12,879 --> 02:18:15,280
this was a

4076
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:19,280
um all kind of uh all high

4077
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:21,359
it just said they would um they were the

4078
02:18:21,359 --> 02:18:22,318
same

4079
02:18:22,318 --> 02:18:23,840
and so then would it got the answer

4080
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:25,439
right and

4081
02:18:25,439 --> 02:18:27,760
i think it's only sharing your uh it's

4082
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:29,120
only yeah it's only showing

4083
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:31,359
the matlab window we don't see that we

4084
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:32,398
don't see the

4085
02:18:32,398 --> 02:18:36,080
plots oh really

4086
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:39,359
uh um okay

4087
02:18:39,359 --> 02:18:42,879
let's see if i can goddamn it

4088
02:18:42,879 --> 02:18:44,959
if you if you dock if you dock them you

4089
02:18:44,959 --> 02:18:47,359
might you might be able to pull it up

4090
02:18:47,359 --> 02:18:50,398
yep slide into the ide

4091
02:18:50,398 --> 02:18:53,760
i can try um or share

4092
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:56,398
a whole spring one can you see the

4093
02:18:56,398 --> 02:18:57,120
screen

4094
02:18:57,120 --> 02:18:59,439
now yep yes now yes okay thanks now we

4095
02:18:59,439 --> 02:19:00,318
get to the plot

4096
02:19:00,318 --> 02:19:02,080
yeah sorry i was just like talking to

4097
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:03,840
myself then that sucks

4098
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:07,359
it was fun um yeah okay

4099
02:19:07,359 --> 02:19:10,160
um so this again this is the stable

4100
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:11,760
hidden state

4101
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:14,718
hi this is our trend this is our kind of

4102
02:19:14,718 --> 02:19:15,040
time

4103
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:17,120
time and trial thing stably

4104
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:19,200
transitioning from one point to another

4105
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:20,959
and this is our report hidden state

4106
02:19:20,959 --> 02:19:22,718
which just says at the second time step

4107
02:19:22,718 --> 02:19:24,000
the agent reported

4108
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:27,760
same and then it got feedback that it

4109
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:30,318
was correct

4110
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:33,920
cool so then i'm just going to quickly

4111
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:36,398
go through

4112
02:19:37,359 --> 02:19:39,200
essentially how i simulated all the

4113
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:40,799
conditions because remember we want to

4114
02:19:40,799 --> 02:19:42,718
simulate local deviation and global

4115
02:19:42,718 --> 02:19:44,240
standard and local standard

4116
02:19:44,240 --> 02:19:47,280
global deviation that makes sense so i'm

4117
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:49,280
going to simulate 10 trials where that's

4118
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:51,040
10 collections of

4119
02:19:51,040 --> 02:19:55,120
beeps or big boops in a row

4120
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:59,680
um and what we want to do

4121
02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:03,840
is essentially have the agent where it

4122
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:05,439
is going to be doing some learning it's

4123
02:20:05,439 --> 02:20:07,920
going to be learning a prior expectation

4124
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:11,040
over what sequence it should be in

4125
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:14,160
if that makes sense and so yes

4126
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:15,439
just to make sure they understand this

4127
02:20:15,439 --> 02:20:17,840
so go back up to the diddy's

4128
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:21,359
so if you notice he's only multiplying

4129
02:20:21,359 --> 02:20:22,880
d2 and d3

4130
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:26,319
by a hundred yeah

4131
02:20:26,399 --> 02:20:28,880
d2 brackets one the first the first up

4132
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:30,479
the first state factor

4133
02:20:30,479 --> 02:20:33,600
is still just one one one so

4134
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:35,600
which allows it to learn one but not

4135
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:37,600
learn stay factor two and say factor

4136
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:38,479
three

4137
02:20:38,479 --> 02:20:42,240
yeah exactly um and so what we should

4138
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:44,399
have at the end of our local deviation

4139
02:20:44,399 --> 02:20:45,439
thing for example

4140
02:20:45,439 --> 02:20:48,000
so we have two oh sorry wrong part of

4141
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:48,880
the code

4142
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:50,880
okay so for our local deviation global

4143
02:20:50,880 --> 02:20:52,240
standard manipulation

4144
02:20:52,240 --> 02:20:53,920
or simulation what we're going to do is

4145
02:20:53,920 --> 02:20:55,920
just the first nine trials

4146
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:59,359
will all be a

4147
02:20:59,359 --> 02:21:02,960
high low so it will be

4148
02:21:04,319 --> 02:21:07,439
boop and then the global so then our

4149
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:09,120
tenth trial however

4150
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:13,359
is going to be a um

4151
02:21:13,359 --> 02:21:14,880
is going to be the same because it's a

4152
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:16,960
global standard so the global standard

4153
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:17,520
is

4154
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:20,399
the bbb boop but we should get a kind of

4155
02:21:20,399 --> 02:21:22,240
local deviation and we should always get

4156
02:21:22,240 --> 02:21:23,680
a mismatch negativity

4157
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:25,600
because there's the last one deviates

4158
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:27,200
from the kind of the local temporal

4159
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:29,200
regularity if that makes sense

4160
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:31,359
then in our local standard global

4161
02:21:31,359 --> 02:21:32,720
deviation we're going to invert that

4162
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:33,920
structure

4163
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:36,880
so the first nine trials are all high

4164
02:21:36,880 --> 02:21:38,319
low

4165
02:21:38,319 --> 02:21:41,760
so again we've got bbb boops

4166
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:44,640
but at the last time it's time step

4167
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:45,040
there

4168
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:48,560
is a beep beep beep

4169
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:51,760
and when we do that what we we won't get

4170
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:54,240
a um we won't get any type of mismatch

4171
02:21:54,240 --> 02:21:56,399
negativity or first level erp to that

4172
02:21:56,399 --> 02:21:57,120
last

4173
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:59,600
kind of surprise response that last at

4174
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:00,960
the last time step

4175
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:05,040
we will however get a a global deviation

4176
02:22:05,040 --> 02:22:06,880
because the second level is now really

4177
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:08,640
surprised that there wasn't

4178
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:12,000
a deviation at the first level does that

4179
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,680
all kind of make sense

4180
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:16,160
nice cool and basically what we do is

4181
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:17,040
we'll just specify

4182
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:19,359
n equals 10 this number of trials we'll

4183
02:22:19,359 --> 02:22:21,439
put our we'll get our mdp structure that

4184
02:22:21,439 --> 02:22:22,399
we kind of

4185
02:22:22,399 --> 02:22:24,479
put together before we'll put it into

4186
02:22:24,479 --> 02:22:25,840
our mdp deal

4187
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:27,840
so that will just be give us 10 mdps

4188
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:29,600
which are to start with

4189
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:31,439
all identical and then we're just going

4190
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:33,920
to choose to select the 10th one

4191
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:37,040
and change either have

4192
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:38,640
and mess with the hidden state factor so

4193
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:40,080
here we're not actually changing it's

4194
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:40,720
the same as

4195
02:22:40,720 --> 02:22:43,439
the first 10 uh the first nine but in

4196
02:22:43,439 --> 02:22:45,120
the second example we're changing it

4197
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:48,399
we're changing it from a

4198
02:22:48,399 --> 02:22:51,439
local deviation to a local standard

4199
02:22:51,439 --> 02:22:54,720
or um which will give rise to a global

4200
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:56,720
deviation and so now if i just

4201
02:22:56,720 --> 02:22:59,280
i've then kind of i'm actually not going

4202
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:00,640
to for the sake of time i'm actually not

4203
02:23:00,640 --> 02:23:02,479
going to go through all of the code for

4204
02:23:02,479 --> 02:23:03,680
kind of just plugging this stuff in

4205
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:04,880
because this is literally just putting

4206
02:23:04,880 --> 02:23:06,160
our structures into a

4207
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:08,880
plotting script and here things get more

4208
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:09,760
interesting

4209
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:11,760
here is where i make some custom erp

4210
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:13,920
plots which i think are kind of cool

4211
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:16,000
but again i actually don't think walking

4212
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,280
through the code is particularly helpful

4213
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:18,479
i think it's just the type of thing like

4214
02:23:18,479 --> 02:23:20,000
the way i learned this was i just spent

4215
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:21,840
like a day or

4216
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:24,479
half a day just reading through uh

4217
02:23:24,479 --> 02:23:25,439
someone else's code

4218
02:23:25,439 --> 02:23:28,240
and figuring it out um so the the only

4219
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:29,680
thing that i would

4220
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:33,200
make sure is that so when you um

4221
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:36,720
when you're doing this uh u1 underscore

4222
02:23:36,720 --> 02:23:37,760
one

4223
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:40,080
i'm sorry like it's just these are ways

4224
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:41,760
of indexing and pulling

4225
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:45,359
the uh the actual simulated um

4226
02:23:45,359 --> 02:23:50,080
firing rates and erps um out of the spm

4227
02:23:50,080 --> 02:23:51,760
out of the mdp structure after you run

4228
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:53,520
it through the vbx code

4229
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:55,439
yeah so these are this is just

4230
02:23:55,439 --> 02:23:57,520
representing uh kind of the

4231
02:23:57,520 --> 02:23:59,680
the most straightforward way of pulling

4232
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:01,520
those similar simulation results out of

4233
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:02,960
particular

4234
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:06,399
cells in the um in the mdp structure

4235
02:24:06,399 --> 02:24:08,080
after it's run

4236
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:10,560
and we have a table in the tutorial i

4237
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:12,000
think it's table three

4238
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
that explains the structure of each of

4239
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:15,840
those cells and where each of those

4240
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:18,720
um each of those uh simulation results

4241
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:19,600
are

4242
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:21,040
yeah exactly and so then i'm just going

4243
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:23,359
to hit run or kind of walk through what

4244
02:24:23,359 --> 02:24:24,160
this stuff looks

4245
02:24:24,160 --> 02:24:29,840
what these plots look like together um

4246
02:24:33,439 --> 02:24:36,479
nice cool okay

4247
02:24:36,479 --> 02:24:40,560
so these are my custom erp plots

4248
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:45,600
on the right and so i'm going to start

4249
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:47,200
start there actually because i think

4250
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:57,600
they're kind of nicer

4251
02:24:57,600 --> 02:25:01,040
okay so

4252
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:10,319
cool so far left we have a

4253
02:25:10,319 --> 02:25:13,520
or top top left sorry we have a

4254
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:15,439
global standard versus a global

4255
02:25:15,439 --> 02:25:16,720
deviation

4256
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:18,319
and the way you calculate the mismatched

4257
02:25:18,319 --> 02:25:20,960
negativity is you just subtract

4258
02:25:20,960 --> 02:25:23,359
the global step the global deviation

4259
02:25:23,359 --> 02:25:24,000
from the global

4260
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:25,680
standard and then you get this nice

4261
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:27,920
that's what we have on our top right

4262
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:29,760
we have this nice kind of negative going

4263
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:31,840
erp that looks exactly

4264
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:33,680
i mean i'm not going to show you this

4265
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:35,200
but if you want to satisfy yourself with

4266
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:35,680
this

4267
02:25:35,680 --> 02:25:37,359
it this looks like kind of for such a

4268
02:25:37,359 --> 02:25:38,479
simple model this is it's kind of

4269
02:25:38,479 --> 02:25:39,760
shocking how much this looks like a

4270
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:43,040
standard mismatched negativity

4271
02:25:44,240 --> 02:25:47,520
so that's really cool then on our second

4272
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:49,600
one here this is our two this is our

4273
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:50,720
global standard

4274
02:25:50,720 --> 02:25:52,160
which is in blue and our global

4275
02:25:52,160 --> 02:25:53,760
deviation which is in red

4276
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:55,439
and then we can subtract them from one

4277
02:25:55,439 --> 02:25:57,520
another and what we can we can just look

4278
02:25:57,520 --> 02:25:57,920
at

4279
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:02,560
kind of the um the

4280
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:05,200
we get a nice large positive going

4281
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:06,080
potential

4282
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:11,200
that looks a lot like a p300

4283
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:14,880
so then in terms of

4284
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:16,800
our i'm just going to show you a couple

4285
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:18,840
of the local deviation local standard

4286
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:23,120
things um sorry i'm gonna close these

4287
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:27,520
and these just kind of clean up the

4288
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:31,200
screen it's nice though that someone can

4289
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:32,960
just download this and also

4290
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:35,280
an important note is installing all of

4291
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:36,319
the spm

4292
02:26:36,319 --> 02:26:38,160
prerequisites maybe we could do a

4293
02:26:38,160 --> 02:26:39,520
standalone in the future but

4294
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:41,680
once the packages are installed someone

4295
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:43,600
can just run the script and have

4296
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:46,560
also all of these figures be spit out

4297
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:48,080
and then it looks like there's enough

4298
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:50,640
commentary and hopefully these videos

4299
02:26:50,640 --> 02:26:51,920
are enough of a

4300
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:53,439
walk through at least of early versions

4301
02:26:53,439 --> 02:26:55,040
of the code where you can tweak

4302
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:56,640
different things and start seeing how it

4303
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:58,640
plugs into other

4304
02:26:58,640 --> 02:26:59,760
things you might want to explore with

4305
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:01,439
the model but all these figures just

4306
02:27:01,439 --> 02:27:03,520
come out in one batch and

4307
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:04,720
just fighting them away over there

4308
02:27:04,720 --> 02:27:07,040
christopher yeah exactly

4309
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:08,560
so i guess one thing to say is one

4310
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:10,080
reason why i'm not particularly

4311
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:11,600
motivated to

4312
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:14,640
make a big standalone kind of thing is

4313
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:16,479
by the time even if i were to do that

4314
02:27:16,479 --> 02:27:18,080
which i don't want to do but even if i

4315
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:18,880
were to do that

4316
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:20,960
by the time i'd written all rewritten

4317
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:22,640
all of the functions i would essentially

4318
02:27:22,640 --> 02:27:23,840
have a package

4319
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:26,960
that is as cumbersome to download as spm

4320
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:29,120
but spm is written in a really nice way

4321
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:30,000
and it's super easy

4322
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:33,120
to install um and so it would actually

4323
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:34,160
be a lot easier

4324
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:35,920
it's just a lot easier to install spm

4325
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:37,920
that would be to go to my github say

4326
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:39,600
and put all of this stuff onto your

4327
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:41,439
laptop make sure all the paths work nice

4328
02:27:41,439 --> 02:27:44,319
because they've automated

4329
02:27:44,319 --> 02:27:46,720
a future supplement could just be start

4330
02:27:46,720 --> 02:27:47,840
with a virtual machine

4331
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:49,840
and let's just install the prerequisites

4332
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:51,439
and just actually do a full

4333
02:27:51,439 --> 02:27:52,960
clean installation could be a good point

4334
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:54,800
of reference but thanks for that

4335
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:56,640
point continue yeah i mean it's i mean

4336
02:27:56,640 --> 02:27:58,080
it's really very it'd be very

4337
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:59,920
short and sweet to do i mean downloading

4338
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:01,280
spm like is

4339
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:03,359
you know it's freeware i mean it doesn't

4340
02:28:03,359 --> 02:28:04,479
just takes a couple of minutes to

4341
02:28:04,479 --> 02:28:06,640
download and really all you have to do

4342
02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:08,240
is just once you download it is just go

4343
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:10,080
into matlab and set the path like that's

4344
02:28:10,080 --> 02:28:12,399
it yeah

4345
02:28:14,319 --> 02:28:15,439
i think there's a function called

4346
02:28:15,439 --> 02:28:17,439
install spm so you go into matlab and

4347
02:28:17,439 --> 02:28:17,920
run the

4348
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:21,280
run the function install sp

4349
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:24,479
um okay but returning to this so

4350
02:28:24,479 --> 02:28:26,319
each of these points kind of everyone

4351
02:28:26,319 --> 02:28:28,800
see my my pointer i'm hoping yes yes yep

4352
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:30,560
each of these pointers this is all a

4353
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:32,399
time step at the first level

4354
02:28:32,399 --> 02:28:34,960
and so this is kind of local standard

4355
02:28:34,960 --> 02:28:35,520
and

4356
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:38,800
a global deviation right

4357
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:41,520
um so this will be we see there's a

4358
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:43,040
little erp each time there's new

4359
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:44,479
stimulus presented

4360
02:28:44,479 --> 02:28:45,840
but there's not not a major one that

4361
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:47,600
makes sense because it's the same

4362
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:50,800
um and our this is trial 10 by the way

4363
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:52,800
i should say this is trial 10 so i i

4364
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:54,160
have trial one

4365
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:56,479
versus uh maybe i'll just maybe i'll

4366
02:28:56,479 --> 02:28:58,240
just contrast all the trial tens because

4367
02:28:58,240 --> 02:29:01,680
otherwise things get messy okay

4368
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:06,399
cool this is trial ten um

4369
02:29:06,399 --> 02:29:08,640
and so this is trial 10 for local

4370
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:10,080
standard

4371
02:29:10,080 --> 02:29:12,880
global deviation and so we see kind of

4372
02:29:12,880 --> 02:29:13,439
no

4373
02:29:13,439 --> 02:29:16,160
first level erps really all no enhanced

4374
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:18,000
erps they're all the same

4375
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,640
but this last one because it this last

4376
02:29:20,640 --> 02:29:21,439
or sixth

4377
02:29:21,439 --> 02:29:25,040
erp right because it disconfirmed

4378
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:28,399
a prediction essentially there is

4379
02:29:28,399 --> 02:29:32,240
a enhancement in higher level beliefs

4380
02:29:32,240 --> 02:29:34,080
when the model suddenly changes from

4381
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:35,439
thinking it was a

4382
02:29:35,439 --> 02:29:38,640
high high low high high low

4383
02:29:38,640 --> 02:29:43,280
to a high high if that makes sense

4384
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:44,479
and then if you compare that second

4385
02:29:44,479 --> 02:29:46,560
level erp to this one over here which is

4386
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:48,080
this local deviation

4387
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:51,600
global standard it's smaller

4388
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:54,720
that p300 there is smaller amplitude

4389
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:58,160
but at this first level because it kind

4390
02:29:58,160 --> 02:29:59,920
of confirmed that there was a deviation

4391
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:01,200
at this first level you see this first

4392
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:01,920
level there's this

4393
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:05,120
massive like deviation response in

4394
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:08,800
um so does that all is that all fairly

4395
02:30:08,800 --> 02:30:09,920
clear because i think that's just about

4396
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:10,960
all i have to show

4397
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:13,040
um i i do think this stuff is really

4398
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:14,479
cool it's kind of nice to chat about it

4399
02:30:14,479 --> 02:30:16,720
um

4400
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:19,600
so just to i want to be very clear that

4401
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:20,640
i'm understanding

4402
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:23,359
with the um event-related event-related

4403
02:30:23,359 --> 02:30:24,560
potentials that you're

4404
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:26,080
showing that you superimposed and you

4405
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:27,600
got

4406
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:30,560
based off your hierarchical model um you

4407
02:30:30,560 --> 02:30:32,240
could then superimpose those

4408
02:30:32,240 --> 02:30:35,520
uh erps which are related

4409
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:37,840
to gradient descent on the variational

4410
02:30:37,840 --> 02:30:40,000
free energy which is related

4411
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:43,040
to dopamine expression and as we showed

4412
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:46,319
uh way at the beginning of this video

4413
02:30:46,319 --> 02:30:47,840
that relationship between membrane

4414
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:49,840
voltage and

4415
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:51,680
expected firing rate mean population

4416
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:53,439
firing rate and we're taking all of

4417
02:30:53,439 --> 02:30:54,800
these things together

4418
02:30:54,800 --> 02:30:57,359
to provide the superimposed traces of

4419
02:30:57,359 --> 02:30:59,359
the local fuel potentials at any given

4420
02:30:59,359 --> 02:31:00,399
instant

4421
02:31:00,399 --> 02:31:02,640
um and we're showing how this oddball

4422
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:04,000
paradigm

4423
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:07,200
could play out uh conceivably by

4424
02:31:07,200 --> 02:31:09,359
re you know with a simulated version of

4425
02:31:09,359 --> 02:31:11,040
this model how it could be realized is

4426
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:11,760
that

4427
02:31:11,760 --> 02:31:14,000
yeah exactly the only thing i would say

4428
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:15,200
is that this

4429
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:16,960
these these simulations have like

4430
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:18,479
nothing to do with the dopamine stuff

4431
02:31:18,479 --> 02:31:19,840
yeah i was i was about to say the same

4432
02:31:19,840 --> 02:31:20,640
thing inside

4433
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:22,720
okay with the exception of like dopamine

4434
02:31:22,720 --> 02:31:23,840
having to do with how you choose

4435
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:25,040
policies

4436
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:27,439
so if we just like blew up the dopamine

4437
02:31:27,439 --> 02:31:28,080
receptors

4438
02:31:28,080 --> 02:31:30,240
or sorry this like in silico dopamine

4439
02:31:30,240 --> 02:31:31,520
and just made it like

4440
02:31:31,520 --> 02:31:33,359
we could make the agent behave totally

4441
02:31:33,359 --> 02:31:35,600
randomly or we could make it behave in a

4442
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:37,600
super precise impulsive way

4443
02:31:37,600 --> 02:31:39,840
um or something something along those

4444
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:40,640
lines

4445
02:31:40,640 --> 02:31:42,080
sorry i shouldn't have said that uh

4446
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:43,920
impulsivity is a bit complicated

4447
02:31:43,920 --> 02:31:47,359
um but we could make the um agent behave

4448
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:48,720
in a totally random way and choose

4449
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:50,399
random actions which would again

4450
02:31:50,399 --> 02:31:52,160
have effects on the sensory sense on the

4451
02:31:52,160 --> 02:31:53,680
sensations that the agent would receive

4452
02:31:53,680 --> 02:31:56,000
so it would indirectly affect erps

4453
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:57,680
but there's nothing about like that

4454
02:31:57,680 --> 02:32:00,319
gamma term that would affect

4455
02:32:00,319 --> 02:32:02,880
uh state prediction error which is there

4456
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:04,319
so the primary could effectively turn

4457
02:32:04,319 --> 02:32:04,800
off

4458
02:32:04,800 --> 02:32:07,439
you could just turn off gamma right and

4459
02:32:07,439 --> 02:32:07,920
like

4460
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:09,520
and it wouldn't yeah it wouldn't make

4461
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:11,680
any difference to this exactly

4462
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:14,080
so so then just so that i'm getting it

4463
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:14,960
correct

4464
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:16,720
the more important thing then would be

4465
02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:18,640
the membrane voltage which is related to

4466
02:32:18,640 --> 02:32:19,120
the

4467
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:22,000
free energy minimization and your

4468
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
schematic diagram of those excitatory

4469
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:25,840
imputative inhibitory connections that

4470
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:27,680
you're realizing in this model

4471
02:32:27,680 --> 02:32:29,520
exactly yeah it's just it's just about

4472
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:31,120
rate of change and posteriors over

4473
02:32:31,120 --> 02:32:32,160
states

4474
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:34,080
okay totally so i'm just going to stop

4475
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:36,640
showing my screen at this point um

4476
02:32:36,640 --> 02:32:39,120
so hopefully you guys can no longer see

4477
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:39,760
my screen

4478
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:42,800
nope we're back to just just you

4479
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:45,920
know cool well wow what a fun and

4480
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:47,439
interesting

4481
02:32:47,439 --> 02:32:50,720
session let's uh

4482
02:32:50,720 --> 02:32:53,040
first just really appreciate everyone

4483
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:54,240
for coming on because these are

4484
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:55,120
extremely

4485
02:32:55,120 --> 02:32:58,000
didactic and it's really just something

4486
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:59,920
else to be walking through the code and

4487
02:32:59,920 --> 02:33:01,840
seeing how many degrees of freedom there

4488
02:33:01,840 --> 02:33:03,359
could be and also how

4489
02:33:03,359 --> 02:33:04,960
real it can be when we actually specify

4490
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:07,920
it so any closing thoughts

4491
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:11,120
or and what can people look forward to

4492
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:13,439
for part four which is the final part

4493
02:33:13,439 --> 02:33:14,319
before the

4494
02:33:14,319 --> 02:33:17,680
semester begins for some of us

4495
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:20,080
yeah no i mean uh like i said i mean the

4496
02:33:20,080 --> 02:33:21,600
last the last one is just the last

4497
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:23,439
section of the of the tutorial which is

4498
02:33:23,439 --> 02:33:24,560
kind of where we're

4499
02:33:24,560 --> 02:33:27,120
building to this whole time right is how

4500
02:33:27,120 --> 02:33:28,000
to actually

4501
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:29,680
apply this stuff to empirical data and

4502
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:31,040
do real experiments

4503
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:33,439
uh can i ask a question on that is

4504
02:33:33,439 --> 02:33:34,319
someone asks

4505
02:33:34,319 --> 02:33:36,640
can we use this tutorial to construct a

4506
02:33:36,640 --> 02:33:37,600
generative model

4507
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:40,399
of metacognitive control of attention or

4508
02:33:40,399 --> 02:33:41,680
meta awareness

4509
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:44,000
i.e modeling task-free conditions say

4510
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,080
while doing meditation for example so we

4511
02:33:46,080 --> 02:33:47,600
talked a lot about task modeling

4512
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:50,560
how does this generalize yes i mean you

4513
02:33:50,560 --> 02:33:51,520
kind of have to

4514
02:33:51,520 --> 02:33:53,439
so i mean uh you know the first question

4515
02:33:53,439 --> 02:33:54,880
is just how do you make that

4516
02:33:54,880 --> 02:33:58,319
you know like really concrete right

4517
02:33:58,319 --> 02:34:01,359
so i mean there's there's very easy ways

4518
02:34:01,359 --> 02:34:03,120
you know like i've published a couple of

4519
02:34:03,120 --> 02:34:05,280
papers and so has um

4520
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:08,399
you know several other people um doing

4521
02:34:08,399 --> 02:34:11,280
something like cognitive actions

4522
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:13,120
selecting cognitive policies as opposed

4523
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:14,880
to behavioral policies

4524
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:16,560
and these are things like where you like

4525
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:18,479
selectively choose what to pay attention

4526
02:34:18,479 --> 02:34:19,280
to

4527
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:21,840
um you know or selectively choosing you

4528
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:23,680
know what to kind of hold in working

4529
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:24,720
memory

4530
02:34:24,720 --> 02:34:26,640
or you know like things things along

4531
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:28,080
these lines that don't involve any kind

4532
02:34:28,080 --> 02:34:28,880
of like over

4533
02:34:28,880 --> 02:34:32,000
observable behavior but involve um

4534
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,720
selecting cognitive fully internal

4535
02:34:34,720 --> 02:34:35,520
actions

4536
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:36,960
right like something like selecting ways

4537
02:34:36,960 --> 02:34:38,640
of manipulating lower level

4538
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:40,800
representations things like that

4539
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:42,960
um so that's certainly possible but what

4540
02:34:42,960 --> 02:34:44,000
you would need to do then

4541
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:47,120
is say okay you know what does

4542
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:49,520
uh meditate what does a meditative

4543
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:50,560
action look like

4544
02:34:50,560 --> 02:34:52,080
right like it could be something like

4545
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:53,760
for instance making a

4546
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:55,680
like choosing a policy at a higher level

4547
02:34:55,680 --> 02:34:57,200
that say like for instance like

4548
02:34:57,200 --> 02:34:58,960
really really really reduces the

4549
02:34:58,960 --> 02:35:00,880
precision of like

4550
02:35:00,880 --> 02:35:02,720
an a matrix or something right if you

4551
02:35:02,720 --> 02:35:04,479
wanted to completely

4552
02:35:04,479 --> 02:35:06,479
you know like cease to attend to

4553
02:35:06,479 --> 02:35:08,800
anything like in the external world

4554
02:35:08,800 --> 02:35:11,680
you know for example um you know or for

4555
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:12,000
instance

4556
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,520
maybe the opposite right maybe like

4557
02:35:13,520 --> 02:35:16,000
mindfulness you know has to do with

4558
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
actually paying really really precise

4559
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:19,600
attention to the present

4560
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:21,920
but like making your uh transition

4561
02:35:21,920 --> 02:35:22,640
matrices

4562
02:35:22,640 --> 02:35:25,120
super imprecise so essentially it's all

4563
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:26,720
about the present and like you're not

4564
02:35:26,720 --> 02:35:28,319
thinking about anything in the past or

4565
02:35:28,319 --> 02:35:29,600
the future

4566
02:35:29,600 --> 02:35:31,439
you know or i mean i could i could think

4567
02:35:31,439 --> 02:35:32,960
of lots of different ways you might do

4568
02:35:32,960 --> 02:35:34,160
something like that but

4569
02:35:34,160 --> 02:35:37,840
to really make it you have to turn it in

4570
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:41,439
to something task ish right you have to

4571
02:35:41,439 --> 02:35:42,800
define actions

4572
02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:44,240
you know even if they're fully internal

4573
02:35:44,240 --> 02:35:45,520
actions you have to define the way they

4574
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:47,040
relate to perception the way they

4575
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:49,359
manipulate the processing perception

4576
02:35:49,359 --> 02:35:51,600
um you know i guess like you have to

4577
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:52,880
ultimately boil it down to something

4578
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:54,319
really concrete with an exact

4579
02:35:54,319 --> 02:35:55,439
quantitative structure

4580
02:35:55,439 --> 02:35:57,439
but all the resources are certainly

4581
02:35:57,439 --> 02:35:58,479
there to do it

4582
02:35:58,479 --> 02:35:59,760
if you're creative enough to come up

4583
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:02,080
with a regenerative model so i have a

4584
02:36:02,080 --> 02:36:03,680
yeah i have two things to add to that so

4585
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:05,280
first is that i think there's a really

4586
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:07,040
there's a really cool kind of like early

4587
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:08,240
pre-print i'm not sure if it's been

4588
02:36:08,240 --> 02:36:09,439
published anywhere it's just called

4589
02:36:09,439 --> 02:36:11,120
towards a formal neurophenomenology of

4590
02:36:11,120 --> 02:36:12,479
metacognition

4591
02:36:12,479 --> 02:36:15,840
um lars sandoval smith is first author

4592
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:18,240
maxwell ramstead who i think has been on

4593
02:36:18,240 --> 02:36:20,160
the podcast before right there he's the

4594
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:21,120
he's the senior

4595
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:23,200
um they actually do try and model

4596
02:36:23,200 --> 02:36:24,560
metacognition and

4597
02:36:24,560 --> 02:36:26,240
specifically in meditation and

4598
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:28,000
meditation context

4599
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:31,600
um i would just say one thing that i am

4600
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:34,240
personally skeptical about um i

4601
02:36:34,240 --> 02:36:35,600
encourage everyone to do this kind of

4602
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:36,720
work but this is just

4603
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:40,000
this probably highlights my biases but

4604
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,319
i think if something is hard to study

4605
02:36:42,319 --> 02:36:44,399
empirically that is to say

4606
02:36:44,399 --> 02:36:47,600
it's very hard to study in terms of

4607
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:48,399
urine imaging

4608
02:36:48,399 --> 02:36:50,560
for example how are you in creating like

4609
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:52,000
an event related design

4610
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,680
where you can get precise time locking

4611
02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:56,240
to neuro between neuronal responses

4612
02:36:56,240 --> 02:36:59,200
and cognitive processes for example if

4613
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:00,319
something's hard to do that in an

4614
02:37:00,319 --> 02:37:02,080
experimental context

4615
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:04,240
it's going to be extremely difficult if

4616
02:37:04,240 --> 02:37:05,439
not more difficult

4617
02:37:05,439 --> 02:37:07,439
to do it meaningfully in terms of the

4618
02:37:07,439 --> 02:37:09,439
generative model because i think

4619
02:37:09,439 --> 02:37:10,880
these generative models are only

4620
02:37:10,880 --> 02:37:12,880
meaningful and helpful to the extent to

4621
02:37:12,880 --> 02:37:14,080
and other people are free to disagree

4622
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:16,080
with this um this is just very much

4623
02:37:16,080 --> 02:37:17,520
you're going off on my own kind of

4624
02:37:17,520 --> 02:37:20,000
tangent that's just to say it's almost

4625
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:21,920
like you need to get more rigorous it's

4626
02:37:21,920 --> 02:37:23,600
no longer just like well this one thing

4627
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:25,040
happened with this one setup

4628
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:27,040
it actually demands a higher standard

4629
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:28,720
but things that it lets

4630
02:37:28,720 --> 02:37:30,680
above that higher standard are very

4631
02:37:30,680 --> 02:37:33,120
cross-referenceable very interoperable

4632
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:36,160
so very nice very nice statement

4633
02:37:36,160 --> 02:37:38,000
yeah i mean i should i should say that

4634
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,080
like like i guess you can think about

4635
02:37:40,080 --> 02:37:42,479
these models as you know beyond the kind

4636
02:37:42,479 --> 02:37:44,000
of more specific applications we've been

4637
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:44,880
talking about

4638
02:37:44,880 --> 02:37:47,600
is doing kind of two you know doing like

4639
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:49,760
a couple of like broader things

4640
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:52,880
one is is that you can use them for kind

4641
02:37:52,880 --> 02:37:53,760
of

4642
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:57,120
theory making theories precise

4643
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:59,680
right so for example like um so a lot of

4644
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:01,280
my past work like

4645
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:03,280
i focus a lot on like like theories of

4646
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:05,120
like emotion and emotional awareness and

4647
02:38:05,120 --> 02:38:05,920
how that light still

4648
02:38:05,920 --> 02:38:08,080
relates to like you know psychiatric you

4649
02:38:08,080 --> 02:38:09,040
know like clinical

4650
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:12,080
contacts and things like that um but

4651
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:14,319
you know prior to doing a lot of this

4652
02:38:14,319 --> 02:38:15,600
modeling stuff

4653
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:17,600
um it kind of comes out of these like

4654
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:19,840
fairly hand wavy conceptual review

4655
02:38:19,840 --> 02:38:21,520
papers right where it's like boxes and

4656
02:38:21,520 --> 02:38:22,720
arrows and

4657
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:24,800
you know like it's and sometimes in

4658
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:26,640
those cases it's hard to

4659
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:28,560
go from kind of the theoretical boxes

4660
02:38:28,560 --> 02:38:29,760
and arrows

4661
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:31,840
um you know even if you assign say

4662
02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:34,560
neural regions or systems to them

4663
02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:36,319
it's hard to to make those things really

4664
02:38:36,319 --> 02:38:38,560
precise so that like

4665
02:38:38,560 --> 02:38:41,200
it's very clear that one empirical

4666
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:43,120
result would actually confirm or just

4667
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:44,319
confirm it

4668
02:38:44,319 --> 02:38:47,439
um whereas so you can take you know like

4669
02:38:47,439 --> 02:38:50,000
a kind of conceptual you know somewhat

4670
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:51,680
hand-wavy model like that and then turn

4671
02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:52,960
it into an exact

4672
02:38:52,960 --> 02:38:55,680
generative model which can just make

4673
02:38:55,680 --> 02:38:57,760
your theory really precise you know so

4674
02:38:57,760 --> 02:38:59,280
so like one day you know it'd be really

4675
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:01,040
cool if instead of like review papers

4676
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:02,800
it's like review paper plus

4677
02:39:02,800 --> 02:39:05,200
actually here's a model you know like a

4678
02:39:05,200 --> 02:39:06,319
precise quantitative

4679
02:39:06,319 --> 02:39:08,800
model that we think comes out of

4680
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:10,640
unifying all the results

4681
02:39:10,640 --> 02:39:13,840
as opposed to um less precise

4682
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:17,280
um theories one one other nice thing you

4683
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:18,560
can do with these models is just like

4684
02:39:18,560 --> 02:39:19,280
have a

4685
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:21,040
total proof of principle someone someone

4686
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:22,720
might make a radical claim like there is

4687
02:39:22,720 --> 02:39:24,479
no way that you can conceivably do

4688
02:39:24,479 --> 02:39:26,479
x and then the response that is here is

4689
02:39:26,479 --> 02:39:27,520
a model that does

4690
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:31,040
x um and that's useful right

4691
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:32,880
that might not be it might even not be

4692
02:39:32,880 --> 02:39:34,720
an empirically tractable example like i

4693
02:39:34,720 --> 02:39:35,920
think the dark room problem is an

4694
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:37,120
example of this right

4695
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:38,640
like you could say there is no possible

4696
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:39,920
way of designing an active inference

4697
02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:40,399
model

4698
02:39:40,399 --> 02:39:42,720
that will escape the dark room and then

4699
02:39:42,720 --> 02:39:44,800
you can build a model and say

4700
02:39:44,800 --> 02:39:46,720
active inference agent escaping the dark

4701
02:39:46,720 --> 02:39:48,080
room like

4702
02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:49,520
that would be a really shitty boring

4703
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:52,240
experiment to run i hope one

4704
02:39:52,240 --> 02:39:54,960
but it's a argument about argument by

4705
02:39:54,960 --> 02:39:56,160
construction

4706
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:57,920
but especially when people have these

4707
02:39:57,920 --> 02:39:59,680
edge cases or perceived to be edge cases

4708
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:01,200
but that's how philosophy

4709
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:03,439
is at the fringe and at the border and

4710
02:40:03,439 --> 02:40:05,520
expanding and critiquing and improving

4711
02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:06,960
all these different metaphors that have

4712
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:07,760
come up

4713
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:11,200
in discussing like 14 was what is the

4714
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:11,840
dialogue

4715
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:14,960
between science and the modeling and the

4716
02:40:14,960 --> 02:40:15,840
actual

4717
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:17,680
quantitative components of it and the

4718
02:40:17,680 --> 02:40:18,960
empirical work and

4719
02:40:18,960 --> 02:40:20,720
philosophy so it's really just we're

4720
02:40:20,720 --> 02:40:22,399
coming at that same question from a

4721
02:40:22,399 --> 02:40:23,680
little bit of a different angle

4722
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:26,080
so i think this has been a great length

4723
02:40:26,080 --> 02:40:26,960
and a great

4724
02:40:26,960 --> 02:40:29,359
session ryan christopher max really

4725
02:40:29,359 --> 02:40:30,720
appreciate all of you for

4726
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:32,479
coming on so that's going to be it for

4727
02:40:32,479 --> 02:40:34,000
today but it will be

4728
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:37,520
our final session next friday

4729
02:40:37,520 --> 02:40:40,640
at the same time at 9 00 a.m pacific

4730
02:40:40,640 --> 02:40:43,760
on february 5th is going to be

4731
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:46,240
number four so thanks everyone for

4732
02:40:46,240 --> 02:40:48,560
watching live and replay thanks again

4733
02:40:48,560 --> 02:40:51,040
to authors and participants so peace out

4734
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:52,479
everyone

4735
02:40:52,479 --> 02:40:56,880
yeah thank you bye thanks
