foreign

2
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,800
okay i think we're live okay yes the

3
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,480
screen was blocked out for a second but

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,599
hello everyone

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,399
welcome to the active inference lab this

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,440
is february

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,559
5th 2021 and we are here in

8
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,079
model stream 4.0 with ryan smith and

9
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,200
christopher white

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,600
i'm daniel friedman i'm a postdoctoral

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,399
researcher

12
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,719
in california and a participant in

13
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,719
active inference lab

14
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,079
maybe the two of you can just briefly

15
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,320
reintroduce yourself

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,559
um yes for anybody who hasn't you know

17
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,920
been watching the previous

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,640
sessions i'm ryan smith i'm a

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,920
investigator at the

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,840
laureate institute for brain research in

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,479
tulsa oklahoma

22
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,920
yeah hi i'm christopher white i'm a phd

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,600
student at the mrc cognition brain

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,799
sciences unit in cambridge england

25
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,759
awesome well we are here today in part

26
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,479
four

27
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,560
which will be the last section on this

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,479
paper hopefully not the last time we

29
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,960
get to speak together on any stream but

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,320
it's part four of four

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,520
on this paper a step-by-step tutorial on

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,680
active inference and its application to

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,920
empirical data you can find the link to

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,079
the most updated version of that

35
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,640
resource

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,439
in the video descriptions and as far as

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,360
points of process if you have any

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,000
questions or

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,600
comments or thoughts during the live

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,439
stream you can type it into the live

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:43,920
chat

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,360
and we'll address it when the time is

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,600
right if you have questions arising

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,040
after this live stream or you're

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,720
watching it after it's occurred

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,560
feel free to leave a comment and we'll

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
try to address it in future

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
sessions because the model stream never

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,320
ends so to learn and participate

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,560
and learn about how to participate go to

51
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,799
activeinference.org

52
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,920
that's where you'll find more

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,079
information on active inference lab

54
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,318
so today in our fourth session it's

55
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,598
going to be pretty exciting because

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,200
we've covered a lot of the groundwork

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,599
and

58
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,160
daniel are you crying ryan yeah you're

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,760
we're not hearing anything daniel

60
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,120
oh um

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,840
give me one sec okay do you hear me now

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,360
no yeah yeah you you froze

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,560
all right give me a second

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
it's all good this is how it happens

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,560
sometimes when

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,840
live streaming let me go back to the

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,519
event

68
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,040
and i will rejoin the event

69
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,839
all right

70
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,440
cool waiting this is just how it is

71
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,040
welcome to live streaming everyone

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,760
cool look at that ghost daniel friedman

73
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,519
he can be kicked out you're really quiet

74
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,120
again okay okay okay yes

75
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,239
device settings

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,720
okay yes thanks microsoft

77
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,560
teams for facilitating these

78
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,840
conversations

79
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,920
i it's still live and happening it's

80
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,120
just a little

81
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,040
a little hiccup with teams that now

82
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,239
we've gotten that out of the way

83
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,959
so it's fixed but thanks ryan and i

84
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,480
don't know if this other person can be

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,200
kicked out

86
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,519
but take it away we're all good though

87
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,599
thank you

88
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,000
okay uh maybe um

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,720
which one are you the ghost of daniel's

90
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
past

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,120
it's okay it will auto drop them um

92
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,280
like after you share and unshare but

93
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,959
it's all chill okay okay

94
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,080
perfect okay

95
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,879
i think that that worked okay so we are

96
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,360
still

97
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,159
we are still alive and going yep okay

98
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,599
all right so uh so i should just start

99
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,640
or is there anything else you were kind

100
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,159
of in the middle of saying something

101
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,200
just um if we could start with some

102
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,120
recap for those who probably have seen

103
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,640
the first three

104
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,279
sessions just where did we get to as of

105
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,040
today and then where does that take us

106
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,279
into the future

107
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,320
um okay so yeah just as a quick

108
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,680
recap um as daniel said the the kind of

109
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,720
whole purpose

110
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,759
of this tutorial that we

111
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,120
put out was to try to make methods for

112
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,479
actually building active inference

113
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,040
models

114
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,479
and applying them to experimental data

115
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,479
we wanted to try to make those methods

116
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,360
more accessible to a broader audience

117
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,240
um because up until now it's been fairly

118
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,199
difficult

119
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,240
to find sort of clear resources for

120
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,440
beginners

121
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,160
to start learning these sorts of methods

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,880
and so

123
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,240
the whole kind of the whole you know

124
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
point of what we've covered so far has

125
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,080
kind of been building to this section

126
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,440
um if the focus again is on b

127
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,039
being able to actually use these models

128
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,600
for experiments

129
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,680
so obviously the earlier sections could

130
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,440
be useful on their own if you want to do

131
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,680
simulation work and there's lots of

132
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,880
papers

133
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,759
reporting simulation work but in terms

134
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,800
of

135
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,880
then applying the models and simulation

136
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,919
work that you do

137
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,360
to um to actual experiments to actually

138
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,400
fit it to

139
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,039
um task behavior with participants and

140
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:33,520
you know

141
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,120
predict things about like neural

142
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
responses and fmri studies and all that

143
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,039
kind of stuff

144
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,720
then it all kind of boils down to what

145
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,160
we'll talk about today

146
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,000
um so in earlier sections we kind of

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,600
covered the basics of active inference

148
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,639
you know what free energy

149
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,080
what variational free energy is what

150
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,680
expected free energy is

151
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,520
what the motivation is for doing active

152
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,800
inference what the

153
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
potential benefits are over

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,280
traditional reinforcement learning

155
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,680
models um you know things

156
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,199
things like things like that just kind

157
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,639
of the nuts and bolts and then we

158
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,479
covered how to

159
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,800
build um active inference partially

160
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,479
observable markup decision process

161
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,080
models um and um as an example

162
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,120
um we built a um a simple kind of

163
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,400
explore exploit model

164
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,560
which i will uh or exploit what task

165
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,720
model should i say

166
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
as a just kind of a concrete example of

167
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
how you would build a model

168
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,600
um and we showed some simulations both

169
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,400
for

170
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,160
perception and decision making and for

171
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,759
learning um

172
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,039
with that model um and so

173
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,319
and then we also kind of um uh

174
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,240
took a took a break from that we're

175
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,680
going to return to that now but we also

176
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,039
took a break from that a little bit

177
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,080
to um cover um hierarchical models

178
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,360
and the neural process theory um

179
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,960
but now we're going to come back to

180
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,880
using the explore exploit task model

181
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,840
because it's

182
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,960
um simpler and more straightforward in

183
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,840
terms of

184
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,599
what you do with participant behavior

185
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,000
and and how you fit it

186
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,080
um so so all that like i said is

187
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,759
building up to

188
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,919
using the task model we built as an

189
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,120
example for

190
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,639
fitting it to data um so christopher i

191
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,360
don't know

192
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,440
yeah great summary christopher what

193
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,360
would be your perspective or what was

194
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,400
something that stood out to you

195
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,120
from the previous sessions yep because

196
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,520
you're

197
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,680
you're so both deep in the game and

198
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,639
actually producing

199
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,280
this artifact that it's been fun for us

200
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,360
and for the audience just to be

201
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,000
kind of talking through it because it so

202
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,199
what what does it

203
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,440
leave upon somebody who's been involved

204
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,360
in the generation of this artifact

205
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,160
now to be talking about

206
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,080
interesting question i suppose um

207
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,919
i thought i think it has made and i'm

208
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,319
just so this is kind of in

209
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,720
for context i have i started my phd four

210
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,599
months ago

211
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,120
so this is all kind of in the context of

212
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,720
figuring out

213
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,120
not just how to build these models kind

214
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,800
of for myself

215
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,360
um or sorry how to teach other people

216
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,879
how to build these models rather

217
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,000
but actually how to build these models

218
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,599
for myself and apply my own research

219
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,039
questions

220
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,199
um and so i actually have never fitted

221
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:13,919
them to data

222
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,440
all of the stuff that i've done so far

223
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,039
has been theory

224
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,560
essentially just i've done a lot of

225
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,039
simulation work but no um

226
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,400
no data fitting so

227
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,720
i don't know i think that's actually the

228
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,080
the frontier in active inference at the

229
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,599
moment is actually figuring out how to

230
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,199
get these models to hit the road

231
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,039
um and there's a really one one really

232
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,799
tricky thing is most the people who work

233
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,760
on active inference

234
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,799
in a real way are neuro images

235
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,559
so i for i for example i'm in your

236
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,919
imaging department

237
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,640
um i know ryan you work in your imaging

238
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,680
as well

239
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,519
um it's actually challenging to test

240
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,800
these models in the domain of

241
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,920
neuroimaging

242
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,160
neuroimaging is really hard um actually

243
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
i think many of the clearest predictions

244
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,839
actually in terms of neural process

245
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,360
theory are actually things that you

246
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,000
could test

247
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,760
really quite easily with optogenetics

248
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,440
not optogenetics or anything like that's

249
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,320
easy

250
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,000
but say predictions about micro

251
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,160
circuitry in pfc

252
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,040
which active inference certainly makes

253
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,440
um

254
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,880
can very much be tested easily in

255
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,040
a rodent model but it's really difficult

256
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,000
to test it in

257
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,839
a human and so i think

258
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,240
the point that i'm trying to in a rather

259
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,440
rambling way get to

260
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,519
is i think we need to think very deeply

261
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,600
about when we build models

262
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,279
about what it actually is that we're

263
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,279
trying to solve do we just want a

264
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,760
directional hypothesis

265
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,680
in which case you don't necessarily need

266
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,200
to fit these things to data

267
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,560
you're just saying a's b a will be

268
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,000
bigger than b which is still better than

269
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,880
most psychology

270
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,480
let's let's be honest um

271
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,560
yeah it's it's really interesting the

272
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,240
neuroimaging case

273
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,560
has a few specific difficulties massive

274
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,920
amounts of data

275
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,399
in a system that has massively complex

276
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,040
internal

277
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,079
and external dynamics like the brain and

278
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,079
you're making a ton of data with a very

279
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,880
complex error profile and in the spm

280
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,920
textbook

281
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,160
it's chapters and chapters of

282
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,320
normalization and re-warping and all

283
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,079
these different kinds of ways to deal

284
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,000
with these very complex data sets

285
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,839
and now we've almost built out that

286
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,440
framework and now just like you said

287
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,800
where it's hitting the road

288
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,560
is in being applied to empirical data

289
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,000
and it's a little bit of a surprise

290
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,920
at least to me and probably others that

291
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,680
maybe neuro imaging although that's the

292
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,079
home

293
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,240
of spm we're seeing it applies to

294
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,519
systems beyond

295
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,360
neuroimaging and even there's other

296
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,720
systems that help inform

297
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,560
our neuro imaging quest so pretty

298
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,279
interesting stuff

299
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,279
um okay so should we just get started

300
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,040
then sounds good and anyone in the live

301
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,760
chat just

302
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,279
drop a question and we'll get to them

303
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,959
thanks a lot

304
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,079
okay so one brief thing

305
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,640
that i did want to mention um is that a

306
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,320
couple times ago

307
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,880
we um we talked about we covered

308
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,480
learning um

309
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,440
but since then um just wanted to let

310
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,959
people know we actually

311
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,920
caught a little a small error in the

312
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,959
learning section

313
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,399
um in the previous version that we've

314
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,040
now corrected and it has to do with the

315
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,480
way that you

316
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,519
calculate the um the novelty term and

317
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,399
expected free energy that gets added to

318
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,040
um it gets added to expected free energy

319
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,560
when you're doing learning so it's what

320
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,040
drives the parameter exploration

321
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,200
um term expected free energy it

322
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,240
basically drives an

323
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,440
agent to seek out policies that will

324
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,640
tell it more about in this case what the

325
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,000
a matrix looks like

326
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,920
so tell it more about what the

327
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,440
relationship is between states and

328
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,880
observations

329
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,320
and there's equivalent terms that could

330
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,279
be added if you're trying to learn

331
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,880
transition beliefs or

332
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,519
other matrices and vectors in the model

333
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,240
but um

334
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,079
so now just to kind of make that clear

335
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,800
we actually have added two different

336
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,320
additional worked examples

337
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,440
of how um of how to calculate

338
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,200
the uh the novelty term just to make

339
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,800
sure that's clear

340
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,279
so um if if anybody doesn't happen to

341
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,279
have the kind of most updated version

342
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,000
and you're interested in kind of knowing

343
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,600
the kind of rigorous details

344
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,800
about how learning works um in the uh

345
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,279
in the formalism then um you know i it

346
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,399
might be helpful

347
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,320
um to download the updated version so

348
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,440
that you can

349
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,279
have additional work examples to to get

350
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,880
a better sense of how that works

351
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,920
um so i just wanted to um make that

352
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,839
uh clear like i said it wasn't it's not

353
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,760
like a big error but it's a small error

354
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,880
that if you

355
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,920
were to read it it could be confusing um

356
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,240
so

357
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,920
i just wanted to make well just wanted

358
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,760
to highlight that for people

359
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,279
um but today like i mentioned

360
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,200
the focus is going to be on actually

361
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,680
building task models

362
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,399
so and applying them to data and there's

363
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,360
actually

364
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,639
you know it's probably you know this

365
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,560
doesn't this isn't necessarily like

366
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,160
the only way you could break it up but

367
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,920
i've broken this up into kind of six

368
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,720
steps

369
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,800
that um are probably a good kind of

370
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,839
heuristic

371
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,639
um you know road map or or whatever you

372
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,480
want to call it

373
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,839
for doing this kind of work so the first

374
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:12,560
thing

375
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,160
is that you have to have a task and you

376
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,760
have to have participants perform that

377
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,839
task

378
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,040
the second thing is you have to build

379
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,320
one or more models of that task so

380
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,720
one or more models in this case

381
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,240
partially observable markup decision

382
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,360
process models

383
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,560
in the active inference formulation

384
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,440
that can reproduce or generate um

385
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,000
simulated behavior for that task

386
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,040
um and so once you do that

387
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,639
then the next thing you need to do is

388
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,199
you need to find somehow find parameter

389
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:45,920
values

390
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,360
in each of those models that you

391
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,279
construct construct

392
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,000
that can best reproduce each

393
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,800
participant's behavior

394
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,639
so for instance under one model you

395
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,160
might find that

396
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,320
the first participant the model can

397
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,760
reproduce the first participant's

398
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,360
behavior the best

399
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,560
if it has a particular um

400
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,360
say value for how much they want the

401
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,440
reward so for instance like the value of

402
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,800
the um

403
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,880
or the think about it as a precision of

404
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,519
the preference distribution

405
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,680
or you might find that for another

406
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,560
participant

407
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,079
you need a lower value for that to

408
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,279
reproduce their behavior well

409
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,440
and but they need something like a

410
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
higher learning rate

411
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,040
or a lower action precision value

412
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,000
right there's all these different

413
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,079
parameters in these models we've been

414
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,040
covering

415
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,320
and different values for those

416
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,120
parameters are going to

417
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,760
be better different parameter value

418
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,199
combinations and these models can be

419
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,120
better at reproducing one person's

420
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,839
behavior versus another on the task

421
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,959
um and so what that requires is having

422
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,959
some kind of estimation algorithm

423
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,959
um something that basically searches

424
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,399
through in some way

425
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,639
different combinations of parameters and

426
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,320
checks how well

427
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,360
it reproduces um a given participant's

428
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,480
behavior

429
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,800
um and so and so like i said those are

430
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,560
called parameter estimation algorithms

431
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,639
and there's a few there's several

432
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,320
different um

433
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,880
types that you can use um i'll briefly

434
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,839
mention a few

435
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,079
and then we'll go into detail on the one

436
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,560
that is probably most consistent with

437
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
um the general kind of theme of active

438
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,079
inference models

439
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,720
which is a scheme called variational

440
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,639
base

441
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,959
so once you've found for each model

442
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,199
the parameter values that best describe

443
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,639
each participant

444
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,480
then you want to know okay well which of

445
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,959
those models is the best model

446
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,880
and so in that case you need some kind

447
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,639
of way of comparing

448
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,160
how well um each model on average can

449
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,680
reproduce the behavior

450
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,199
of the whole group of your participants

451
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,120
so each model is going to have their

452
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,600
best fit parameters for each participant

453
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,759
but still the best fit parameters for

454
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,639
one model

455
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,720
might still do a better job than the

456
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,480
best fit parameters for another model

457
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,519
and again we'll go into this

458
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,160
and then once you've identified what the

459
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,800
the best model is

460
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,720
then and this is something that might

461
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,959
not be obvious but it's really important

462
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,600
is you have to somehow confirm that the

463
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,399
parameters in the best model

464
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,040
are recoverable so you can either talk

465
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,399
about this as whether the

466
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,399
the model is identifiable or that the

467
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,759
parameters in the model are

468
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,880
recoverable and that's something that

469
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,399
again i'll expand on

470
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,040
but the but the basic idea is more one

471
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
one kind of simple way to think about it

472
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,320
is um what if it's the case

473
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,560
that two different combinations of

474
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,320
parameter values

475
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,519
are equally good at reproducing or

476
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,560
explaining

477
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,519
a given participant's behavior if that

478
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,120
were the case then there isn't any

479
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,800
unique

480
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,360
combination of parameter values that is

481
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,079
kind of

482
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,199
the best set of parameter values

483
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,480
and what that means is that

484
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,880
you could take one set of parameter

485
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,919
values

486
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,599
generate behavior with it but when you

487
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,280
ran estimation on that

488
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,520
you could get a very different set of

489
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,439
parameter estimates

490
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,439
and if that's the case then the

491
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,119
parameter estimates that you're actually

492
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,079
getting for that model for a participant

493
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,919
aren't necessarily a reliable or

494
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,679
uniquely best

495
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,039
description and so that means that

496
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,880
parameters aren't recoverable or there's

497
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,919
no kind of

498
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,200
uniquely best set of parameters under

499
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,760
that model

500
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,480
so you need to do that to make sure

501
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,559
that's true for the winning model

502
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,400
and if it's not then you might move down

503
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,919
to say the second best model and see if

504
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,120
that's the case

505
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,320
right so you want to find the best

506
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,039
fitting model ideally

507
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,320
you want to find the the best fitting

508
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,080
model that is also

509
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,240
clearly recoverable that has clearly

510
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,520
recoverable parameters

511
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,039
finally once you have identified

512
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,000
the winning recoverable model um

513
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,160
you have this set of parameter estimates

514
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,840
that describe each person so these are

515
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,679
individual difference variables right

516
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,600
one person has higher action precision

517
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,520
than another one person

518
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,039
has a more precise preference

519
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,360
distribution than another

520
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,960
and at this point you can take these up

521
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,400
to the group level and you can say okay

522
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,280
you know for instance does a healthy

523
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,160
group

524
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,080
have different parameter values on

525
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,280
average than

526
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,360
say a group with depression or a group

527
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,960
with anxiety

528
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,160
or you can say you know do parameter

529
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,799
values predict something on a continuous

530
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,360
you know in a continuous way right maybe

531
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,520
higher anxiety levels are associated

532
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:53,919
with

533
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,200
lower action precision

534
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,760
or something like that and so i'll show

535
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,520
you guys examples of this kind of thing

536
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,720
as well

537
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,000
um so first and you know we've kind of

538
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,200
already covered this in previous

539
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,320
sessions

540
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,559
or just examples of it but there are

541
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,480
lots of different kinds of tasks that

542
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,200
you can

543
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,320
model which is kind of a nice perk of

544
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,000
active inference models

545
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,520
is that they're not just about decision

546
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,440
making as a main component you can also

547
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,320
use them to model

548
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,320
kind of simple perceptual tasks so

549
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,399
christopher in a previous session

550
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,600
showed how you could build a model of a

551
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,760
simple perceptual oddball or local

552
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,720
global

553
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,160
task which is almost entirely about

554
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,080
perception

555
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,480
you won't get necessarily interesting

556
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,000
individual differences in behavior in

557
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,720
these tasks

558
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,000
but you can show differences in say

559
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,240
simulated event related potentials and

560
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,840
eeg studies

561
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,200
and in principle you could fit the erps

562
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,039
to find the best parameters for a person

563
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,240
but you can also do um inferential or

564
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,840
inferential or prospective decision

565
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,679
making tasks like where you

566
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,760
plan for the future and make a decision

567
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,360
based on what you expect future outcomes

568
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,400
to be

569
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,919
um which is the kind of thing um uh

570
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,360
kind of like what i'll be showing you um

571
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,240
or with the explore exploit task um but

572
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,679
the explore exploit task

573
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,840
that we'll be showing is is kind of very

574
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,120
similar to a standard kind of

575
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,799
reinforcement learning task it just

576
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,159
requires that you

577
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,400
seek out information before you can

578
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,320
really know or even learn

579
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,480
what the right reward values are

580
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
and then lastly you could combine this

581
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,159
with neuroimaging

582
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,400
in the context of predictions from the

583
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,679
neural process theory which is what

584
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,720
we've talked about

585
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,120
and what we covered in relation to the

586
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,880
hierarchical model that christopher

587
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,120
covered

588
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,840
so i should say that this is kind of a

589
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,440
fairly new emerging

590
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,720
field and so there's not that many

591
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,120
papers um empirical papers that do this

592
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,400
kind of thing

593
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,799
um you know it's it's something that my

594
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,720
lab has kind of been trying to

595
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,640
make more common uh practice

596
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,000
which is again part of the motivation

597
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,919
for this tutorial is so that

598
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,039
a larger number of researchers can do

599
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,480
this kind of thing

600
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,520
um but so you know i mainly work in

601
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,600
computational psychiatry

602
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,240
um and so you know we've this has been

603
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,159
used to show say for instance

604
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,039
less uh less precise um lower action

605
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:35,679
precision

606
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,039
and substance use disorder and also um

607
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,720
slower learning rates for negative

608
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,080
outcomes and substance use disorder

609
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,039
you know we've shown things like that

610
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,360
greater decision uncertainty

611
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,679
is associated with uh people with

612
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,679
depression anxiety and substance use in

613
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,480
the context of

614
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,159
approach avoidance conflict tasks

615
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,960
most recently we also used kind of a

616
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,840
simpler

617
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,720
bayesian perception version of an active

618
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,799
inference pmdp to show

619
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,080
differences in the sensory precision in

620
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,240
an interceptive context so for instance

621
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,400
when people

622
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,039
how how precisely or accurately people

623
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,440
perceive their own heartbeats

624
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,159
and interesting differences there

625
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:22,960
between

626
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,880
again clinical multiple clinical groups

627
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,280
and healthy participants

628
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,320
and then lastly and you know one of the

629
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,159
first papers using this kind of approach

630
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,240
was actually philip fortenbeck's

631
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,360
paper where they looked at

632
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,400
predictions about mid-brain mid-range

633
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,679
dopaminergic responses um

634
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,320
and uh changes in the expected free

635
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,760
energy precision

636
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,840
term that we had talked about um in

637
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,440
previous sessions

638
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,480
and was able to show nice relationships

639
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,440
between

640
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,720
these expected precision updates and um

641
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,320
and uh what and neural responses using

642
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,280
fmri

643
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,520
in a region of the midbrain that is

644
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,480
known to

645
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,159
be rich in dopamine neurons um

646
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,320
so this is just kind of these are recent

647
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,919
examples um

648
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,200
that you know we're hoping other

649
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
researchers can can you know

650
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,360
build on um on that neuro slide

651
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,120
these examples we're seeing a couple

652
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,280
examples of different technologies

653
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
like fmri but we also heard it goes

654
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,960
beyond neuroimaging the scope of these

655
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,600
methods

656
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,039
and we're also seeing a couple of

657
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,360
biological questions or

658
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,640
conditions um related to your clinical

659
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,600
experience

660
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,000
let me complement those two axes of

661
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,600
variation with the methods in the

662
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,880
biological question

663
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,679
with this algorithmic dimension and

664
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,279
there's a question in the chat that says

665
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,039
what kinds of tasks

666
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,960
reflect the relationship between dynamic

667
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,799
programming and active inference

668
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,960
for example bellman optimal state action

669
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,799
policies thanks for the elaboration

670
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,919
so how do we connect some of these

671
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,320
biological and methodological

672
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,880
uses and axis of variation to some of

673
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,320
the algorithmic questions about

674
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,360
optimization dynamic programming so

675
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,200
um yes i mean it's a great question we

676
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,120
actually have a recent um

677
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,440
pre-print that uh lance decosta's first

678
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,240
author on

679
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,919
um um where he was able to come up with

680
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,480
some proofs to show when active

681
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,600
inference

682
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,279
is and is not bellman optimal um and

683
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,600
in terms of what the the conclusion was

684
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,559
in terms of

685
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,000
one-step policies um active inference

686
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,799
is bellman optimal in the context where

687
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,679
um

688
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,159
the uh precision of the preference

689
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,159
distribution is maximal uh

690
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,919
it's maximally precise over whatever the

691
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,520
reward outcome is

692
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,840
um active inference models in the kind

693
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,720
of simple md

694
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,400
pomdp scheme we've been talking about

695
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,799
here um they're not belmont optimal

696
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,760
or they're not guaranteed to be um in

697
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,919
the context of uh multi-step so like

698
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:56,400
deep

699
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,600
temporal policies um but um

700
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,400
whereas the um more recent uh

701
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,760
sophisticated active inference

702
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,799
algorithms

703
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,000
um are uh bellman optimal um for deep

704
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,880
policies

705
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,080
uh that's because they more or less

706
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,080
correspond to backward induction

707
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,600
um so um that's that's um

708
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,840
the probably shortest answer i could

709
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,760
give to that

710
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,960
christopher did you have something to

711
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,279
add there

712
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,760
uh no i yeah i was just going to point

713
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,679
to the lane slot to costa paper

714
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,080
great i posted the cost of papers that i

715
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,000
think are relevant in the chat so

716
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,880
thanks for that question and continue

717
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,279
okay

718
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,880
so just to be clear this is a very

719
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,720
specific paper

720
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,039
that you know lance and i and nora and a

721
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,120
few other people put out as a preprint

722
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,159
just a couple of months ago um so so i'm

723
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,400
talking about one particular paper

724
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,919
of lance's um um so i mean i can

725
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,120
certainly that point that

726
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,360
that specific one out so people know

727
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,480
which one i'm talking about

728
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,840
the relationship between dynamic

729
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,360
programming and active inference the

730
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,200
discrete finite horizon case

731
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,760
with yeah that's the one decosta sajid

732
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,919
par fristen and smith

733
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,279
yep okay cool um

734
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,039
all right so hopefully that helps um

735
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,240
um okay so now i'll kind of be going

736
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,360
through um each of the the steps here

737
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,799
that i was talking about

738
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,039
um kind of one by one right with our

739
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,000
explore exploit test

740
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,520
example so first step one is you have to

741
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,360
have participants perform a task

742
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,279
right so in this case um and i should

743
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,799
say for some of this it's really going

744
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,679
to be assumed

745
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,520
that people were following along with

746
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,720
previous sessions

747
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,120
um the time constraints just really

748
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,559
don't allow us to cover

749
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,200
all the background um so that somebody

750
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,960
could watch this one without having seen

751
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,240
the other ones and fully follow

752
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,000
everything i'll be talking about

753
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,080
um so just just to make that clear if

754
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,840
anything is kind of confusing then the

755
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,679
previous sessions are kind of necessary

756
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,679
we walked through the matrices and some

757
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,880
of the degrees of freedom

758
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,840
in this setup so i think it should be

759
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,279
good check out the other videos if you

760
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,760
haven't already

761
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,880
but but you know as a brief you know

762
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,799
kind of refresher about the task that

763
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,320
we're talking about

764
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,600
um the on each trial the agent starts in

765
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,720
a start state

766
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,640
and then he can either directly choose

767
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,080
one of two slot machines

768
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,520
and if they're right they'll win four

769
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,039
dollars but if they're wrong they'll win

770
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,080
zero

771
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,799
um and they start out not knowing you

772
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,200
know

773
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,000
like just flat prior over whether the

774
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,520
left or the right one is

775
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,960
whether it's the context in which the

776
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,559
left one or the right one is more likely

777
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,600
to win

778
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,080
so it's just 50 50. so it's pretty risky

779
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,399
to just pick one right away

780
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,000
at least before you've learned if one of

781
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,760
them is actually more likely

782
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,720
if the context in which one is more

783
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,120
likely to win is more common

784
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,880
so instead the other thing that the

785
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,559
agent can do is they can choose to get a

786
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,440
hint

787
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,880
and the hint will tell them which um

788
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,640
whether it's a context in which the left

789
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,880
bandit is the one that

790
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,440
is more likely to win and when it's the

791
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,399
right one

792
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,279
um and in each of the contacts in the

793
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:05,840
left

794
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,120
in the context where the left one's

795
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,720
better it will pay out eighty percent of

796
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,600
the time

797
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,200
uh whereas in the context of the right

798
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,120
one uh the right one will pay out eighty

799
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,480
percent of the time

800
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,080
um but the catch is if you choose to

801
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,320
take the hint then you'll only win

802
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,960
two dollars if you get the right one

803
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,240
afterwards

804
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,720
um so this trades off this kind of

805
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,360
reward seeking and information seeking

806
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,000
where if you seek information first

807
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,279
you're more likely to win

808
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,080
but if you choose first right away then

809
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,760
you'll get a higher reward if you're

810
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,480
right

811
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,039
um so it specifically trades off reward

812
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,399
and uncertainty

813
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,559
um and this is where a lot of this is

814
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,760
not going to make sense unless you've

815
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,120
seen the previous sessions

816
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,159
um is that and the second thing is you

817
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,919
have to build one or more models

818
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,960
of the task we just talked about in our

819
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,720
example we'll use two different variants

820
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,520
of the model

821
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,679
one where we're just going to fit the

822
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,120
risk seeking parameter

823
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,080
and an action precision parameter and a

824
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,760
second model where we also assume that

825
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,840
the agent has a learning rate

826
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,960
or that there are differences in

827
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,360
learning right

828
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,080
so for those that don't remember um the

829
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,440
risk seeking parameter

830
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,279
just corresponds to the magnitude of

831
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,039
this rs value

832
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,880
um so what this says is at time two

833
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,799
if the agent observes a win so this row

834
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,720
is a win then

835
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,480
the value of that win will be rs

836
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
and if they instead wait and choose the

837
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,399
hint they'll continue to observe this

838
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,200
start thing

839
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,320
at time two but at time three if they

840
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:38,799
win

841
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,120
then the value they will win will be

842
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,600
this rs value divided by two

843
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,880
um so so whatever rs ends up being

844
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,399
the win at the third time point if they

845
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,240
take the hint is half of that

846
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,600
um so we're going to be fitting for each

847
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,559
person what that rs value is

848
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,960
which again stands for risk seeking

849
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,399
which would be clear to anyone who's

850
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,200
watched the

851
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,679
previous sessions because the higher

852
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,039
this value is

853
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,679
the um the less exploratory drive the

854
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,840
agent will have

855
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,520
and that means that they'll be more

856
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,399
likely to take the risk and just

857
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,799
choose one of the slot machines randomly

858
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:15,600
as opposed to

859
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,039
taking the hint first to be more

860
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,840
confident in which one's right

861
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,600
so the second parameter is this action

862
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,640
precision parameter

863
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,919
alpha and all this basically says

864
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,279
is the precision or the probability of

865
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,559
selecting some action

866
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,919
given an alpha value corresponds to this

867
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,679
um so our corresponds to

868
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,159
whatever the probability is of an action

869
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:40,960
given the

870
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,000
given a policy um scaled

871
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,480
by this alpha thing and then softmaxed

872
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,200
to become

873
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,880
a um just a proper probability

874
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,320
distribution again

875
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,880
um so it just controls how more or less

876
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,880
it controls how precise action selection

877
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,440
is

878
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,880
given the choice of policy

879
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,279
and then finally in the model in the

880
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,559
second model where we're also going to

881
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,640
assume an agent has a learning rate

882
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,760
um other than just the optimal learning

883
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,000
rate of one

884
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,919
then we're also going to be fitting this

885
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,679
thing eta here which is the learning

886
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:14,960
rate

887
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,480
and this just says that your beliefs

888
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,159
about the probability of the context

889
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,279
being

890
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,799
that the left slot machine is better

891
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,399
versus that the right slot machine is

892
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,840
better

893
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,440
just updates based on your beliefs about

894
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,480
whatever the that state whatever the

895
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,440
winning state was

896
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,080
on the previous trial again four times

897
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,919
step one

898
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,799
so basically each trial whatever the

899
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,080
posterior beliefs were

900
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,360
over states um they

901
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,840
the count for that just gets added to

902
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,039
whatever the prior

903
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,919
initial states was um athena is at the

904
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,039
next time point

905
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,399
but it's scaled by this etta thing so

906
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,960
you know if etta is one then it'll

907
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,640
attack on a count of one

908
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,640
again if if it knows with certainty that

909
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,399
it was in say like state one

910
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,720
but if that is 0.7 that only add a count

911
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,760
of 0.7

912
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,480
on each trial given that the posterior

913
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,840
distribution was like one

914
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,200
zero um um so

915
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,720
so that's um the the basic setup is

916
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,399
we're going to fit either just rs and

917
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,760
alpha or we're going to fit both of

918
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,519
those and eta

919
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,360
um one note on that ryan i like this

920
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,679
step

921
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,440
to build one or more models because

922
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,880
we're thinking about

923
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
active inference as like this process

924
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,720
theory it's instrumental

925
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,919
you know the whole instrumentalism

926
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,080
versus realism question we're using it

927
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,200
as an instrument

928
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,039
and that means that we're iterating over

929
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,440
models we're relating our models to each

930
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,200
other in specific ways like make the

931
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,799
simpler one and then make one that just

932
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,399
adds one more variable

933
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,559
and then it's not like you're asking

934
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,799
what is the active inference model here

935
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,720
it's here's the active inference

936
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,840
approach

937
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,279
and we're going to combine our

938
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,120
perspectives and make multiple models

939
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,640
and we'll be comparing models so the

940
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,159
only limiting factor there is

941
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,760
how many models can we think of at the

942
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,080
beginning and how wise can our model

943
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,519
selection process b

944
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,440
so it's just really like a pluralistic

945
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,760
but pragmatic way to go about it

946
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,000
by saying construct one or more models

947
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,440
because then you're never going to fall

948
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,880
in the trap of thinking you're making

949
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,039
the active inference model because there

950
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,799
isn't the model of anything

951
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:23,600
statistically

952
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,039
they're just instruments so it's a

953
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,039
really helpful perspective and so this

954
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,080
isn't just a little

955
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,919
um convenience to make one or more

956
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,360
models it's something that reminds the

957
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,240
scientist

958
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,399
or the modeler that they're actually

959
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,640
making one of many or infinite possible

960
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,840
ways to think about a situation

961
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,679
yeah i mean i mean hopefully you've

962
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,360
really kind of you know thought deeply

963
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,159
about what

964
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,080
the most plausible models are given

965
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,760
current theory and you know current

966
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,240
previous or previous empirical research

967
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,559
right so i mean they should be informed

968
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,480
um but yes so you're just you're trying

969
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,600
to find

970
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,200
the model that has the highest evidence

971
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,960
that the observations or the behavior

972
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,440
provides the highest evidence for

973
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,360
and yes it is always possible that

974
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,559
there's some other model

975
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,760
that you haven't thought of that would

976
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,079
be better um but

977
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,000
you know if you have a model that

978
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,760
explains behavior really well

979
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,119
and it does so better than any of the

980
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,560
other ones you can think of then it's

981
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,440
kind of a good

982
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,399
bet um as at least giving you um

983
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,079
interesting individual differences

984
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,480
to to again bring up to a group level

985
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,760
analysis

986
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,199
um so so okay

987
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,639
so you know to get kind of a little

988
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,000
nitty gritty in terms of the the

989
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,199
code and the matlab structure and

990
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,440
everything um you know the kind of thing

991
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,800
you need to do

992
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,918
is you first so you have a participant's

993
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,359
behavior right like

994
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,639
they chose the hint and then slot

995
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,159
machine one that shows the hint and then

996
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,599
slot machine two okay now they just

997
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,320
chose the whole

998
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,719
machine right away over slot machine two

999
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,679
right away

1000
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,839
um and so forth and those have to be

1001
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:54,800
coded in

1002
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,680
right to each trial in the mvp structure

1003
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,079
which

1004
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,480
which again uh previous sessions will

1005
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,520
explain

1006
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,760
um so the mdp structure in matlab

1007
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,359
um for each so each uh

1008
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,359
each number right inside these

1009
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,560
parentheses here will

1010
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,200
be the trial that you're talking about

1011
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,720
and the dot u here

1012
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,560
is the um the matrix that described that

1013
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,400
encodes the actions that a participant

1014
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
took um

1015
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,440
now if we remember um so row one here

1016
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,359
corresponds to state factor one which is

1017
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,960
the context

1018
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,599
whether left or right is better and

1019
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,359
there is no action for that that's not

1020
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,280
something agent control it's just stable

1021
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,040
within a trial which one it is

1022
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,119
so these just get ones and there is no

1023
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,520
other possible action

1024
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,520
for the second row though so this is the

1025
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,280
state factor that corresponded to

1026
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,200
action selection um two

1027
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,880
you know action two corresponded to

1028
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,320
taking the hint an action three

1029
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,480
corresponded to choosing left

1030
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,560
so if that was what a participant did on

1031
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,680
trial one

1032
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,839
then you would have to feed in two

1033
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:02,720
followed by three

1034
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,920
right they chose the hint and then they

1035
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,920
chose left on that trial

1036
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,680
um and so you just have to iterate that

1037
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,440
over all the trials in the task

1038
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,240
so one to you know end trials um

1039
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,760
whatever they did

1040
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,079
um so that's mdpu and in this case like

1041
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,520
i said there are two actions so two

1042
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,680
columns and there are two state factors

1043
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,200
where only the rows which only the

1044
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,040
second one is control

1045
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,400
um so now mdp o.o

1046
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,520
is the observations um so

1047
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,800
again if you're familiar with the um the

1048
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,240
way we set up

1049
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,200
the model for this task before there are

1050
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,079
three different

1051
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,920
uh outcome modalities three different

1052
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,240
types of observations you can get

1053
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,480
so the first um observation modality

1054
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,760
what a hint or not so in this case

1055
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,200
one is just you're kind of still

1056
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
observing the start observation

1057
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,680
if you observe two that means you get a

1058
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,480
hint

1059
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,839
that the left one is better and if you

1060
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,000
observe a three that's the hint that the

1061
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,200
right one is better

1062
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,119
so in this case they got the observation

1063
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,400
that the left one was better when they

1064
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,240
took

1065
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,240
one two one because after they got the

1066
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,000
hint they just returned back to

1067
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,359
observing kind of the initial

1068
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,320
observation

1069
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,079
for the hint modality um whereas

1070
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,560
um for the second modality here which is

1071
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,119
the wind's losses

1072
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,800
for the first two time steps they just

1073
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,920
observed kind of the starting

1074
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,280
observation here

1075
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,480
because they chose the hint at the

1076
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,240
second time point so there was no win or

1077
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,839
loss

1078
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,920
and then at time point three they

1079
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,119
observed a win so

1080
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,960
win is encoded as a three in this model

1081
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,079
and two or losses is encoded by a two

1082
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,079
um and then uh the final

1083
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,839
outcome modality is just the agent

1084
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,520
observing what it does

1085
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,520
so in this case this just says started

1086
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,640
in start state

1087
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,800
chose to take the hint and then chose

1088
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,480
the left uh

1089
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,359
chose to it observed itself choosing

1090
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,800
the choice of the left slot machine

1091
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,839
so that's it so all you have to do when

1092
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:06,480
you're

1093
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,320
instead of simulating behavior you're

1094
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,240
actually um

1095
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,160
fitting that way you're actually feeding

1096
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,680
in participant behavior

1097
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,079
to uh fit it uh to fit a model to it um

1098
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,160
then you just have to you know sort of

1099
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
translate the behavior and the raw data

1100
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,119
into a form like this that matches the

1101
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,400
action and outcome

1102
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,920
representations in the model um

1103
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,960
and um and so that's it you first feed

1104
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,079
those in

1105
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,119
um and then once you've done that then

1106
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,599
you have to use some kind of estimation

1107
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,560
algorithm

1108
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,000
which basically means the thing is going

1109
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,880
to somehow repeat

1110
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,160
simulating behavior in that model until

1111
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,880
it finds a model that maximizes the

1112
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,599
overlap

1113
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,760
between the probability of choosing the

1114
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,440
participant's action of the probability

1115
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,560
of choosing

1116
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,440
actions and what the uh participant

1117
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,800
actually chose

1118
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,920
right so for instance if it shows hint

1119
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,560
and then left bandit left slot machine

1120
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,839
on trial one

1121
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,960
um it's gonna find a set of parameters

1122
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,119
that apply across all trials that

1123
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,800
maximize the probability

1124
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,880
that the simulated agent also would

1125
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,400
choose the hint followed by

1126
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,760
choosing the left slot machine

1127
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,280
so there are a number of different

1128
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,359
estimation algorithms that

1129
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,560
can be used um you know the

1130
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,400
the simplest possible one is just

1131
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,079
something like a grid search

1132
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,000
so in this case say you just have two

1133
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,839
parameters which this is just arbitrary

1134
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,839
called alpha and beta

1135
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,200
you can kind of divide this up into

1136
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,119
little grids different combinations of

1137
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,200
parameter values so for instance like

1138
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,240
you know parameter 0.2 for alpha

1139
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,160
and parameter value 3 for beta

1140
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,720
and then you can just encode for example

1141
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,280
what the probability

1142
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,240
of the model is given the participants

1143
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,119
actions

1144
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,240
um or um that would be the posterior

1145
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,440
which i'll talk about or just the

1146
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,960
probability of participant behavior

1147
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,319
given the model and those parameter

1148
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,560
values i mean so in this case this

1149
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,119
is kind of clear nice result where this

1150
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,640
value right here

1151
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,079
something like point three and four

1152
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,359
that um is maximally and uniquely

1153
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,800
the best set of parameters for

1154
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,440
reproducing that participant's behavior

1155
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,119
and and in this case you're using

1156
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,280
something called in this case you're

1157
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,400
using something called maximum

1158
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,520
likelihood

1159
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,960
so maximum likelihood estimation

1160
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,480
which just means again you're trying to

1161
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,319
find the

1162
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,040
model and set of parameters for which

1163
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,839
the

1164
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,839
uh probability of the participants

1165
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,880
behavior given that model is highest

1166
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,599
which is a type of likelihood right so

1167
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,960
you're trying to find the maximum value

1168
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,599
for the likelihood

1169
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,200
which you just in this case encode with

1170
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,680
these you know redder colors

1171
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,359
equals higher uh likelihood

1172
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,000
of behavior given the model you can also

1173
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,599
do something

1174
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,800
a little bit um so to be clear what we

1175
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,160
actually would want

1176
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,000
right is there is the inverse of this we

1177
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,160
would want the probability of a model

1178
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,920
given participant behavior which is the

1179
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,240
posterior

1180
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,160
but when you're doing maximum likelihood

1181
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,079
estimation you're just assuming here

1182
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,400
that you have essentially a flat prior

1183
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,800
for what the probability over models is

1184
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,280
so in this if that's the case then the

1185
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,480
probability of the model given

1186
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,680
participant behavior is just

1187
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,160
proportional to

1188
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,200
the likelihood but another thing you can

1189
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,400
do

1190
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,560
is called maximum posterior or map

1191
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,920
estimates

1192
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,000
which is the same thing except it

1193
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,760
doesn't assume that you have a flat

1194
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,800
prior

1195
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,000
um overalls right so if you just start

1196
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,599
out with a prior expectation

1197
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,680
that one model is better than another

1198
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,119
then you can incorporate that

1199
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,000
information

1200
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,160
into um into parameter estimation

1201
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,400
and this is kind of an example of this

1202
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,280
where

1203
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,440
um you might find this distribution in

1204
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,800
terms of just the likelihood

1205
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,240
right the probability of data given the

1206
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,400
model where a parameter combination

1207
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,599
right around here

1208
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,920
would be best but then you might also

1209
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,680
have some reason to have a prior

1210
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,040
expectation

1211
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,839
that models down here right are are

1212
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,839
actually more likely

1213
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,040
and so if you combine those guys

1214
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,880
together you can get a posterior that

1215
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,800
looks a little different

1216
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,839
right like a something very similar um

1217
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,319
a very similar model wins in this case

1218
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:37,920
but that's just because

1219
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,280
the behavior that's driving the

1220
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,520
likelihood here is just already a really

1221
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,599
good fit so it kind of dominates over

1222
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,520
over the influence of priors but that's

1223
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,560
not always going to be the case

1224
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,480
so so those are two approaches um

1225
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,800
and and again you can you can do them

1226
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,960
with a simple grid search

1227
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,079
or you can do something so

1228
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,520
i should say that the grid search kind

1229
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,440
of thing it only really works

1230
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,560
when you have a few parameters we don't

1231
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,920
have very many

1232
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,119
and the reason is because the more

1233
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,040
parameters hat you have the higher

1234
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,400
uh dimensional um this uh parameter

1235
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,680
space becomes

1236
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,680
and it just becomes it it takes sort of

1237
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,880
intractably long

1238
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,200
um to do to search through every

1239
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,880
possible combination

1240
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,720
um so what you do instead

1241
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,640
is you use some kind of gradient descent

1242
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,319
process um

1243
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,880
exactly like the gradient descent on

1244
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,319
free energy that we've been talking

1245
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,960
about

1246
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,119
for how active inference models arrive

1247
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,160
at posteriors

1248
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,960
over states and posteriors over policies

1249
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,560
um so there's a

1250
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,319
really kind of interesting overlap

1251
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,680
between the way that you estimate models

1252
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,599
via gradient descent and the way that

1253
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,119
you actually

1254
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,960
the way that active inference models

1255
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,800
update their beliefs via gradient

1256
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,760
descent

1257
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,359
um so in this case or is a very

1258
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,800
good point and i just want to point out

1259
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,319
one similarity and difference because

1260
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,440
people may have heard about these

1261
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,040
grading descent algorithms for

1262
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,720
descriptive statistics or for fitting

1263
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,079
descriptive models

1264
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,920
so that's from going again from the data

1265
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,119
that's empirical

1266
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,359
to a descriptive model or descriptive

1267
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,040
statistics like regression

1268
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,880
coefficients and if it's a

1269
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,119
multi-variable regression

1270
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,040
you might need to use not just a grid

1271
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,880
search but act that you can do a simple

1272
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,640
maximum likelihood approach like a least

1273
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,400
squares approach or something like that

1274
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,319
you need to use this kind of a complex

1275
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,400
multi-dimensional optimization

1276
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,640
to get to that descriptive statistic and

1277
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,160
then there's this little twist

1278
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,319
where actually in active inference we

1279
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,079
might be using those computational

1280
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,040
techniques

1281
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,880
but we're estimating the parameters of

1282
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,960
an underlying generative model

1283
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,960
and then there's this nice little return

1284
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,480
where actually the generative model is

1285
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,839
implementing that as well

1286
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,880
yeah so so in so in this case

1287
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,240
you you absolutely need

1288
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,599
some kind of prior value because with

1289
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:04,000
gradient

1290
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,599
descent you're not exploring every

1291
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,040
combination what you're doing is you're

1292
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,400
starting at some starting point

1293
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,440
which is just coded by a here um

1294
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,359
and then you're just like when you're

1295
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,040
minimizing free energy

1296
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,400
in in an active inference model you're

1297
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,640
searching neighboring values and trying

1298
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,599
to find a value

1299
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,880
that has a higher

1300
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,960
likelihood or a lower free energy

1301
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,319
and then you just kind of keep doing

1302
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,240
that iteratively

1303
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,599
until you find some value

1304
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,319
that where the likelihood stops getting

1305
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:38,960
bigger

1306
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,480
or free energy stops getting smaller

1307
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,400
and that then corresponds to your

1308
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,720
best estimate or your posterior

1309
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,760
posterior

1310
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,800
estimate for the

1311
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,040
parameters for a given participant

1312
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,560
and so when you're doing this

1313
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,160
with when you're doing it with a

1314
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,920
gradient descent for

1315
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,280
uh free energy then um that ends up

1316
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,400
corresponding

1317
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,720
well to um the actual approach that

1318
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,000
we'll be talking about

1319
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,480
um or actually using in our example

1320
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,400
which is a variational base

1321
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,000
so the variational bays you do exactly

1322
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,240
this you set a prior

1323
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,200
mean value and a prior variance for each

1324
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,960
parameter

1325
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,599
and then you do gradient descent until

1326
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,599
you find a set of parameters

1327
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,800
that minimize free energy

1328
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,599
which is again an approximation to the

1329
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,400
model evidence

1330
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,520
so but but it's important to keep in

1331
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,960
mind some potential limitations of this

1332
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,520
approach which is if you see here

1333
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,880
this parameter space it does look like

1334
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,240
there is a kind of nice

1335
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,599
single right like local minimum right

1336
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,000
the local place where the free energy is

1337
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,640
lowest

1338
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,160
or um where the uh again it would be a

1339
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,000
local maximum be like top of a mountain

1340
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,440
in this if you were talking about the

1341
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:03,920
highest

1342
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,680
likelihood um they typically do

1343
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,119
log likelihoods as opposed to

1344
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,520
likelihoods

1345
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,480
and but one of the issues is this sort

1346
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,760
of

1347
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,880
the parameter space need not have a

1348
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,599
landscape that's quite this clean

1349
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,440
you might end up for instance having a

1350
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,720
landscape just moving to a

1351
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,240
two-dimensional case now

1352
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,680
that looks kind of like this where if

1353
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,920
you start out say with a prior value

1354
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,240
with prior values that um you know like

1355
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,200
this kind of red

1356
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,440
circle up here then if you do gradient

1357
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,480
descent

1358
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,160
you might end up getting stuck in a

1359
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,800
little local minimum like this

1360
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,680
um where you know and then and then the

1361
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,359
gradient descent algorithm would say hey

1362
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,079
you know actually

1363
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,920
you know this seems like the best one

1364
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,160
because if i move in any direction

1365
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,160
then the free energy goes up um

1366
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,480
whereas actually the global minimum the

1367
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,760
one that you would want to get to is

1368
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,960
this different one that's on the other

1369
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,319
side of this little kind of

1370
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:03,440
free energy hill um and so

1371
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,359
you know this is this is an example

1372
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,800
where

1373
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,800
i'm choosing the the right priors is

1374
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,800
important um to get the

1375
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,119
to be able to get the the best parameter

1376
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,079
estimates

1377
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,559
um but also this speaks to the kind of

1378
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:17,920
thing about parameter recovery that i

1379
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,280
was talking about earlier

1380
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,680
because it could be that if you set your

1381
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,359
parameters kind of right on the top of

1382
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,960
this hill thing here

1383
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,920
then even if the parameter combination

1384
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,200
over here is the one that actually

1385
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,359
generated the data

1386
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,040
you could get stuck over in this one in

1387
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,880
which case the estimation algorithm

1388
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,200
would not give you the right parameter

1389
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,960
estimates

1390
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,640
so this is why what i mentioned earlier

1391
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,480
about

1392
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,640
assessing parameter recoverability is

1393
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,880
really important

1394
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,960
so all my way of saying it's important

1395
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,559
to choose good priors

1396
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,880
or to figure out what good priors are um

1397
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,559
and there are there are interesting ways

1398
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:55,440
to try to

1399
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,200
optimize that so there are kind of

1400
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,800
hierarchical bayesian techniques we

1401
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,800
won't talk about these explicitly but

1402
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,119
where you can kind of and these won't

1403
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,800
necessarily solve this problem but where

1404
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,480
you can

1405
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,079
more or less you can think about it as

1406
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,599
it estimates the parameters for each

1407
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:10,640
person

1408
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,040
and then it notices hey you know looks

1409
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,800
like these are all shifted over

1410
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,079
you know the distribution of these looks

1411
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,760
like they're all shifted over say to the

1412
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,400
right

1413
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,720
you know so actually the looks like the

1414
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,720
distribution is more kind of over here

1415
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,079
and so then it might um choose that

1416
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,119
um choose that uh that the kind of mean

1417
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,240
value of that

1418
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,599
um as the new uh priors

1419
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,960
um for uh for redoing the estimates

1420
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,800
um until it finds uh values that um

1421
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,200
that essentially it's it's helping you

1422
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,040
to find whatever the optimal priors

1423
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,000
would be

1424
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,319
um but uh but again that won't um that

1425
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,920
won't always

1426
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,640
solve this sort of problem with a lumpy

1427
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,440
landscape

1428
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,520
you know um one other little thought

1429
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,800
it's actually almost three

1430
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,680
layers with the red dot so there's us as

1431
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,880
agents on a landscape

1432
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,880
we actually need to come up with policy

1433
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,680
as agents in our niche to get around

1434
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,839
local minima like my door's closed i

1435
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,200
need to step away to open the door

1436
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,160
before i can move

1437
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,119
through it then how are we going to fit

1438
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,720
policies for ourself

1439
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,440
under pervasive uncertainty well we're

1440
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,359
doing this state estimation with the

1441
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,319
policy

1442
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,240
so that we can actually come and then

1443
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,760
how are we going to converge on those

1444
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,040
parameters

1445
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,079
using a a little bit like a gradient

1446
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:28,720
descent

1447
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,119
algorithm internally not internally to

1448
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,720
us is just within the agent

1449
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,720
computationally it's just it's very

1450
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,559
interesting because people may have

1451
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:37,920
i'd imagine there's one kind of person

1452
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,440
who sees this and says oh we talked

1453
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,040
about optimization for a year

1454
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,880
in my course so i've heard all about

1455
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,160
non-convex non-complex optimization

1456
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,559
techniques or rugged fitness landscapes

1457
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,079
and there's another group of people for

1458
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,160
whom actually this optimization theory

1459
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,240
might be quite novel because of

1460
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,559
how they've looked at modeling before so

1461
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,000
very interesting

1462
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,440
and to put into the fourth section like

1463
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,839
that really spoke a lot

1464
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,359
so interesting stuff ryan i just want to

1465
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,640
ask christopher you want to add anything

1466
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,839
before we continue with this

1467
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,839
no this really is very much ryan's part

1468
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,760
of the paper oh cool

1469
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,319
yeah yeah i'm just here kind of oh if

1470
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:17,119
anything

1471
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,480
more than welcome to add thoughts or if

1472
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,440
you have any other insights about

1473
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,880
technical aspects

1474
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,319
no no nothing really um i would just

1475
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,480
i might ask some questions if something

1476
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,599
if things come up

1477
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,200
um because i'm gonna be doing this at

1478
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,640
some point in the next couple of months

1479
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,960
but um so yeah

1480
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,040
great thanks okay so

1481
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,480
um so um like i said the the kind of

1482
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,839
detailed example that we are going to

1483
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,839
use is variational days

1484
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,920
um and note that variational message

1485
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,880
passing is

1486
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,400
again what agents are using within

1487
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,440
um within active inference models

1488
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,200
which we talked about before so we're

1489
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,720
using something very very similar to

1490
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,839
this

1491
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,000
or i mean so technically i should say

1492
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,599
now it's using marginal message passing

1493
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:04,000
in the latest

1494
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,839
versions but again we cover this it's

1495
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:08,160
very similar um to variational message

1496
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,280
passing it's just kind of a slight

1497
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,400
improvement

1498
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,599
um but so we're using um the same sort

1499
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:14,640
of approach

1500
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,000
to estimate parameters uh to estimate

1501
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,920
the parameters that people are using

1502
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,599
uh the parameters that are kind of you

1503
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,839
know potentially kind of uh stored in

1504
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:24,480
their brain

1505
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,000
in some sense um so

1506
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
so we're doing gradient descent on

1507
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,920
variational free energy as i mentioned

1508
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,839
and as i mentioned you need to specify

1509
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:36,160
prior means and prior variances for each

1510
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,280
parameter

1511
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,680
and then you just move the prior values

1512
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,400
in the direction

1513
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,760
of increasing action probabilities um

1514
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,240
but what you're doing because it's a

1515
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,760
gradient descent and variational free

1516
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,720
energy

1517
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,920
is you're not technically just trying to

1518
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,319
find

1519
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,079
the maximum likelihood value like you're

1520
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,440
doing with like a grid search

1521
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,400
um instead um what you're trying to do

1522
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,520
is you're trying to

1523
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,440
well i should say that the variational

1524
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,800
free energy part of it

1525
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,119
means that there's a complexity penalty

1526
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,119
um and what that basically means is so

1527
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,800
if people remember from

1528
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,319
variational free energy when we talked

1529
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,040
about it before the simplest way or kind

1530
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,119
of intuitive way to think about it

1531
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,119
is that it's just complexity minus

1532
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:18,480
accuracy

1533
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,200
right and what complexity means is how

1534
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,480
much you have to change your beliefs

1535
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,119
so if you start out with particular

1536
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,400
prior values

1537
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,119
then the farther you have to move those

1538
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,880
move your beliefs from those prior

1539
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,880
values

1540
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,240
the that's going to push a variation for

1541
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,640
energy up

1542
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,200
whereas at the same time free

1543
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,640
variational free energy is going to go

1544
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,119
down

1545
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,960
as the model predicts behavior better

1546
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,400
um so what it means is for instance

1547
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,400
you know if i start out with a prior

1548
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,160
value that's say way down here

1549
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,559
like around like i don't know one and

1550
00:53:58,559 --> 00:53:59,599
three

1551
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,319
then it's going to have to move from

1552
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,000
those prior values

1553
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,359
a pretty long way before it gets to

1554
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,200
a set of parameter values that fit well

1555
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,839
whereas say if i started over here it's

1556
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:17,359
not going to have to move those as far

1557
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,760
but if i were to do that then

1558
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,559
potentially

1559
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,319
instead of the posterior estimate

1560
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,319
posterior parameter estimates actually

1561
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:27,839
settling on this thing that has the

1562
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,200
maximum likelihood

1563
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,000
it might stop say like around this one

1564
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,200
right a little lower than it or

1565
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,400
something like that

1566
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,680
um because that maximizes that leads to

1567
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,000
high

1568
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,079
accuracy while also not having to move

1569
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:41,520
the parameter values

1570
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,359
uh really really far not having to

1571
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:44,960
change beliefs too much

1572
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,480
from what the um uh informed

1573
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,599
prior belief was um so it's you know

1574
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:52,079
it's

1575
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,839
it's important right to think that this

1576
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,280
assumes something that

1577
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,799
that the priors you have that you have

1578
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,799
them for a reason right that they're

1579
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,240
actually based on something

1580
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,599
that they're informing you um so that

1581
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,440
so that it is actually does actually

1582
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,200
make sense not to move them

1583
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,079
too far from prior values and in

1584
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,799
practice the reason this is helpful

1585
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,280
is because one thing that often happens

1586
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,480
when you're just doing maximum

1587
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,319
likelihood

1588
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:21,119
is that um that maximum likelihood will

1589
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,000
be with respect

1590
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,240
to your particular data set right your

1591
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,200
particular

1592
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,319
set of parameters or set of participants

1593
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,400
um but often if you choose just the

1594
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,000
maximum likelihood value

1595
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,640
then that's kind of over fit to just

1596
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,160
those participants

1597
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,000
where if you were to say apply that

1598
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,760
exact same model to a new set of

1599
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,960
participants

1600
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,319
um it might not do as well because

1601
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,720
it was fitting you know specific things

1602
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,240
that were not generalizable about your

1603
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,000
data set in particular

1604
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,119
um so by by um

1605
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,040
by putting this kind of complexity cost

1606
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,119
on it it prevents overfitting which

1607
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:57,920
means that

1608
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,359
the predictions of that model are more

1609
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,440
likely to uh generalize

1610
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,000
to a new set of participants later so it

1611
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,440
prevents overfitting which is a very

1612
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,280
common issue in in just standard

1613
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,760
frequency statistics as well um

1614
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,640
um okay so so that's so that's what

1615
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,920
you're doing with variational base is

1616
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,799
doing this kind of

1617
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,640
complexity minus accuracy thing where

1618
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,079
you're preventing overfitting while also

1619
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,119
maximizing

1620
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,680
the accuracy of model predictions um

1621
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:30,079
okay so then like i mentioned you need

1622
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:32,079
to do model comparison to identify what

1623
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:32,400
the

1624
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,680
best model is um

1625
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,359
now uh uh let's see so i just realized i

1626
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,839
should probably set something in motion

1627
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:44,000
here let's

1628
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,960
see if i need to uh so when we actually

1629
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,480
go into the code here in a minute one of

1630
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,200
these things takes a long time

1631
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,960
um let's see so i set it to store stuff

1632
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,640
i just want to triple check that i

1633
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,880
shouldn't um you know set this thing

1634
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,480
um let's see

1635
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,480
uh yeah i bet i should have double

1636
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,599
checked this beforehand

1637
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:11,980
um

1638
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:15,040
[Music]

1639
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,240
cool though it's really

1640
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:20,160
interesting and christopher you want to

1641
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,839
add anything or maybe just a quick note

1642
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,280
while ryan's figuring out like what is

1643
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,920
it like to be learning these models or

1644
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,760
what kind of skills do you wish you had

1645
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,119
earlier when you were learning the

1646
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,280
models um

1647
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,000
other than of course your own tutorial i

1648
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,660
mean

1649
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:38,000
[Laughter]

1650
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,520
i think everyone who did undergrad

1651
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,119
psychology is probably

1652
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,680
at some point in there i i did cognitive

1653
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,960
science as an undergrad but

1654
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,119
um i took a lot of psychology classes

1655
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:48,720
when you take staff psychology a lot of

1656
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,799
people read this andy field textbook

1657
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:54,319
and he has a chapter on um

1658
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:57,920
uh some type of like esoteric regression

1659
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,920
and introductory sentence is like i've

1660
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,960
never done this

1661
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,920
i don't see myself ever doing it but i

1662
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,280
wrote this chapter about it and if i

1663
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,640
ever need to do it i will be very

1664
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,119
impressed by how much i seem to know

1665
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,200
um so that made that probably will

1666
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,520
describe my experience with um

1667
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,880
this tutorial to a certain extent uh

1668
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,760
okay so yeah so real quick i'll just i'm

1669
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,400
just gonna

1670
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,319
jump to the code and explain why i

1671
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,559
should have started this thing

1672
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,680
is that that so what if you set this

1673
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,359
thing to sim equals 5

1674
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,119
then what it's going to do is it's going

1675
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,240
to actually generate simulated behavior

1676
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,280
for six hypothetical participants

1677
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,440
where each participant has a different

1678
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,200
combination of parameter values that's

1679
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,640
generating

1680
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,119
that simulated behavior and then what

1681
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,160
it's going to do

1682
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,119
is it's going to then apply the

1683
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:50,480
estimation algorithm

1684
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,599
to the resulting simulated behavior

1685
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,160
and it's going to give you a set of

1686
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,839
results

1687
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,319
and then what it will do is it's going

1688
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:03,040
to do bayesian model comparison on those

1689
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,079
to identify what the best model um

1690
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:11,280
is and then i'm going to try to do this

1691
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,200
i'm going to try to set the so i'll just

1692
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,480
say for

1693
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,680
for um for

1694
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,040
the purposes of um you know you actually

1695
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,799
you guys actually doing it

1696
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:26,079
yourself at home um

1697
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,760
i'm going to uh

1698
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,160
i've set this thing to 32 trials for

1699
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:32,880
each

1700
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,119
uh simult for each set of simulated

1701
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:36,880
behavior

1702
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,160
but maybe if i set this to 16

1703
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,359
then it will go faster just to think

1704
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:44,319
about what's happening

1705
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:45,680
people looking through these equations

1706
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,680
every time two matrices or

1707
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,359
two numbers are getting multiplied the

1708
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:50,960
computer has to do something

1709
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,960
so we're kind of nesting matrix

1710
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,240
multiplications

1711
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,160
inside of even bigger ones so if you

1712
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,880
want two time steps for two

1713
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,960
larger time clicks for four models you

1714
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,559
know for four participants it really

1715
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:03,520
starts to balloon

1716
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,880
rapidly especially when there's

1717
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,359
computationally intensive steps

1718
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,040
yeah so here just uh just to show you

1719
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,799
guys what's going on so i just started

1720
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,000
this thing

1721
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,680
and if you look in the matlab window

1722
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,400
here

1723
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,359
it's calculating log likelihood so ll

1724
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:20,880
stands for log likelihood

1725
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,480
over and over again under a particular

1726
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,160
set of parameter values

1727
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,240
and in this case it's negative 31 and

1728
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,839
it's trying to

1729
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:29,440
minimize that or in this case it's

1730
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,440
moving it closer to zero so

1731
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,040
maximizing in a sense but bringing it

1732
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,440
closer to zero so now it moved via

1733
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,119
gradient descent to a second set

1734
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,240
of parameter values and now it's found

1735
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,000
that okay now the log likelihood is

1736
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,760
negative 22. so we're even closer to

1737
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,640
zero

1738
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,000
and again same thing now we're at

1739
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,920
negative 19 and it's going to keep going

1740
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,640
until it settles on a stable value

1741
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,240
and in this graph that will update

1742
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,359
every time which i'll uh

1743
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:00,640
show you here so this is just showing

1744
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,280
ignore i should say these so something

1745
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:03,920
to explain

1746
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,359
is these routines were originally

1747
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:07,599
designed for dcm for dynamic causal

1748
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,280
modeling with fmri

1749
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,640
so um a lot of the a bunch of these

1750
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,559
graphs and also the the sorts of labels

1751
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:15,359
that they have

1752
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:17,200
are don't really apply in this case they

1753
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,799
only apply to dcm

1754
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:21,920
um so you know so ignore a lot of the

1755
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,440
labels but the point here is is that

1756
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,119
each iteration as you go from left to

1757
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:29,680
right is a new estimate

1758
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,119
of the log likelihood for

1759
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,240
every um for the set of parameter values

1760
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,359
it's trying

1761
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:40,720
during gradient descent um and so you'll

1762
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,200
see

1763
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,440
that after a while the thing is just

1764
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,400
going to kind of

1765
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,480
plane out it'll converge onto a value

1766
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:47,680
you see right now is it's

1767
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,200
like 17.35 and now it's like 17.16 so

1768
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,880
the thing is kind of

1769
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:58,160
starting to converge on a stable minimum

1770
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:02,000
log likelihood um so now you know i

1771
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,440
found a set that actually is still at

1772
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,520
16. so the thing is still

1773
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,839
going for a bit to converge and down

1774
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:08,559
here

1775
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,880
these are the posterior deviations and

1776
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,760
again ignore the

1777
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,440
ignore a lot of the units here but the

1778
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,960
way that you can read this

1779
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,839
is just that 0 here corresponds to the

1780
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:20,960
prior values

1781
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,240
that you set um and if it's going

1782
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,960
if the bar here is going down then that

1783
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,160
means that the

1784
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,280
posterior parameter estimate is uh

1785
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,960
is lower at this point it's gone down

1786
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,480
from the prior value

1787
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,319
and the this kind of red pink thing

1788
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,799
around it that's the posterior variance

1789
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:41,680
um so in this case and parameter one

1790
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,079
here

1791
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,200
is uh the action precision and parameter

1792
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,480
two is the

1793
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,920
reward seeker reinforce or risk seeking

1794
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,599
i think i can double check whether those

1795
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,280
are backwards or not um

1796
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,440
but uh which order those are but this is

1797
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,640
just saying that whatever this first

1798
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,000
parameter is

1799
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,680
um the the posterior mean estimate here

1800
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,880
is

1801
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,319
um you know whatever that is that

1802
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:05,920
actually corresponds to the real units

1803
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,200
of the um

1804
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,920
of the uh parameter but it's not very

1805
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,720
confident

1806
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,799
in that posterior immune estimate

1807
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:13,920
whereas here

1808
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,960
the second parameter um it's also this

1809
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,839
negative

1810
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:20,000
posterior at the moment but it's very

1811
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,520
very confident in that posterior

1812
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,480
estimate

1813
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,920
um um so so that's what that means and

1814
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,200
these will update

1815
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,720
with each iteration um but so now you

1816
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,319
can see that actually the thing kept

1817
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:33,520
exploring

1818
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,880
and now it's actually found a set of

1819
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,559
parameter values

1820
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:40,640
that um you know continues to actually

1821
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:41,839
explain the behavior

1822
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:43,119
the simulated behavior quite a bit

1823
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,720
better right so now it's at like

1824
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,000
negative 13.

1825
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,359
so you're gonna see this it almost kind

1826
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:49,039
of converged for a bit but now it's

1827
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,119
actually kind of going back up

1828
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,160
um so eventually eventually it will

1829
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,839
converge but it's just doing really

1830
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:56,559
really well

1831
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:59,760
at finding values that explain behavior

1832
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,119
uh well um one thing i should point out

1833
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,640
though is that the actual values of

1834
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,240
these absolute value of these are not

1835
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,079
really informative because they're

1836
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,480
they're they're basically the sums of

1837
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,480
the action probabilities

1838
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,640
for each trial so these numbers will be

1839
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,200
bigger if the task has more trials

1840
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,039
um so in and of themselves it's only the

1841
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:21,200
relative values that are meaningful

1842
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,520
um this reminds me actually it reminds

1843
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,559
me a lot of

1844
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:27,680
bayesian methods in phylogenetics

1845
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,760
where it's like what is the likelihood

1846
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,520
of this phylogenetic tree

1847
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,559
it it's given some number by a program

1848
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,160
which sounds weird to think about the

1849
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,920
state space of all the possible trees or

1850
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:38,799
something like that

1851
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:41,280
but it turns out by doing this kind of a

1852
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,480
gradient descent

1853
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,400
searching through all the possible trees

1854
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,680
you actually do

1855
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,720
converge on a tree that is

1856
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,400
generative of the kinds of data that are

1857
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,079
observed and so it's just really

1858
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:53,440
interesting to see how this is working

1859
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,880
and it's fun to watch the number

1860
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,400
drop down to so

1861
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,640
so now so in this case it converged for

1862
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,079
the first person

1863
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:04,319
um and you know these were the posterior

1864
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,400
deviations and then here's the simulated

1865
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,079
behavior

1866
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:10,160
of the participant under those

1867
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,280
parameters

1868
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,280
so you can see that you know the

1869
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,480
parameters do

1870
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,480
fit the behavior really well right the

1871
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,319
probabilities are pretty high

1872
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,559
under those parameters for each for

1873
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:21,599
every action

1874
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:22,480
you know there are some little

1875
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,119
exceptions but but it does pretty well

1876
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:27,920
um right so now it's just now it's just

1877
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,359
moving on to the next person

1878
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,200
sorry what oh it might just be helpful

1879
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,960
to describe what the blue dots are

1880
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,440
just for yeah sorry again i'm assuming

1881
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,319
people have

1882
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:38,799
watched video sessions so blue

1883
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:41,359
corresponds to the actual chosen action

1884
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:44,880
um on the first at the first action for

1885
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,359
each

1886
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:47,920
participant um so basically this is

1887
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,760
saying and so black

1888
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,640
means probability one and as it goes

1889
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,880
toward white that means probability zero

1890
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,520
so this is just saying basically 100

1891
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,119
probability under the model

1892
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,039
that the agent would choose the hint and

1893
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:02,559
the blue dot says that's what they

1894
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,480
actually chose

1895
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,319
and so on and so forth so anytime that

1896
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:07,680
there's a

1897
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,160
light gray you know that's on the part

1898
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,599
where the blue dot is that means the

1899
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,200
model didn't really do that well at

1900
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,039
predicting that behavior

1901
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:18,079
um but you can see in this case most

1902
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:19,440
it's pretty dark

1903
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,920
around most of these blue dots so it

1904
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,280
does pretty good

1905
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,480
um is the point um so now like i said

1906
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,079
this is just going to iterate around

1907
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:32,079
for the six agents that i mentioned and

1908
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:33,680
it's just going to compare

1909
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,079
and then it's going to compare the three

1910
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,119
uh the three

1911
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,960
that did have a learning rate and the

1912
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,319
three that didn't have a learning rate

1913
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:41,280
in the model

1914
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,160
is what it will do um and so just to

1915
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,000
kind of summarize what you've said so

1916
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
far so the steps would be something like

1917
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,440
you would actually get your empirical

1918
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,839
task right and think about how

1919
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:55,039
the sub the actions that the subject has

1920
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:56,240
actually got or the participants

1921
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,839
actually going to make relate to what

1922
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,599
the model is going to make

1923
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,359
all the actions available the model you

1924
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:02,960
come up with some mapping

1925
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,839
and then you would then presumably in

1926
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:07,520
this just translate them

1927
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,720
in some way and plug those into your u

1928
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,559
mdp dot u which is the actions

1929
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:15,200
participant shows and mdp.o

1930
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,799
which is the observations that they

1931
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,280
actually saw

1932
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,799
yeah and then you would plug into the

1933
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:22,559
algorithm essentially

1934
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:24,799
yep you plug it into the algorithm and

1935
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,680
um

1936
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,160
and then it just the algorithm just

1937
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,039
repeatedly

1938
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,359
computes the sum of the log likelihoods

1939
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:32,720
for each trial

1940
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,880
um and then and then tries to find a

1941
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:36,400
minimum of that sum

1942
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,000
okay and so in terms of this is a

1943
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,079
something i've wondered about um how do

1944
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:44,079
you choose what the best trials

1945
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:46,240
uh or what the best priors are is it

1946
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,839
okay just to kind of

1947
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,880
in in silico uh

1948
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,400
simulate a bunch of things and just say

1949
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,839
hey this this seems reasonable

1950
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:58,559
um in a lot of cases yes i mean so

1951
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,880
so there's a couple things to do one is

1952
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:01,920
you can

1953
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,240
you can do the kind of modelist or the

1954
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,000
recoverability stuff

1955
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,440
um you know beforehand and try to find a

1956
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,720
set of parameter values

1957
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,079
a set of prior values for which the um

1958
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:15,839
the the parameter estimates are

1959
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:17,679
recoverable right

1960
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,520
so if you set one set of priors then

1961
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,120
maybe the thing does get stuck in local

1962
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,080
minima but if you said

1963
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,560
another set of priors then the

1964
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,238
generative parameters

1965
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:28,080
um actually do end up matching the

1966
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,158
estimated parameters really well

1967
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:33,198
um so so there's a couple different

1968
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:34,479
things so one is

1969
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:35,759
yeah do some of the simulation

1970
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,600
recoverability stuff ahead of time to

1971
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,279
find good priors

1972
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:42,640
another thing is you know if you just

1973
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,799
you know estimate participant behavior

1974
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:46,479
and you start to see

1975
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,880
that the posterior estimates tend to be

1976
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,319
really far away from the priors you're

1977
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:51,198
setting

1978
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:52,799
um that's kind of an indication that

1979
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:53,839
you're probably not setting very good

1980
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:55,120
priors so then you might like try

1981
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,439
setting new priors that look closer to

1982
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:00,238
where everybody's kind of moving um yeah

1983
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:01,759
so we do have we do have a footnote

1984
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:03,520
about this in the paper from memory

1985
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,920
um but it'll be good to kind of make

1986
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,880
that explicit

1987
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,040
another way that i've seen that in the

1988
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,359
field of evolutionary biology is

1989
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:14,799
if you have wildly disparate priors like

1990
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:16,880
the so a fallacy is that the uniform or

1991
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:17,920
the flat prior

1992
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,479
is like unbiased there's so much to say

1993
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:21,279
about that i'm sure

1994
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,040
ryan knows well but like if you have one

1995
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,198
prior that's stacked up against zero

1996
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:26,640
and another prior that's stacked up

1997
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,359
against one and then they both converge

1998
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:30,960
like from kind of multiple sides

1999
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,279
that's a simple example but if different

2000
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,040
families of priors

2001
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,238
and models that are very um paired down

2002
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:40,238
ranging to ones that have very complex

2003
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:41,679
error

2004
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:44,238
models if a lot of different layers of

2005
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:45,679
complexity of the model

2006
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,600
and densities that start stacked up

2007
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,520
versus one end versus another

2008
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,040
then of course that's a difficult thing

2009
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,279
to manage but that at least means that

2010
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,800
given the empirical data you have and

2011
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,719
the task that you're modeling

2012
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,400
you have a really predictive model so

2013
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,920
again we're not realists we're not

2014
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,360
actually getting the truth with these

2015
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,840
recursive and iterative and

2016
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,880
multi-perspectival models

2017
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,960
we're just fitting more and more of the

2018
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,000
variants explained

2019
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,040
in our empirical data yeah

2020
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,880
yeah so just uh just to kind of give you

2021
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,400
guys another example so you can see

2022
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,320
now for this other set of parameter

2023
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,400
estimates you know convergence took way

2024
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,520
less time

2025
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,440
right it just took you know seven

2026
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,960
iterations and it converged really

2027
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:23,920
quickly

2028
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,400
and one reason to see why is that for

2029
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,920
this one it didn't have to move

2030
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,480
values very far from priors because this

2031
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,760
was an agent

2032
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,679
whose behavior was generated by

2033
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,280
parameters very close to priors

2034
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,560
what one other point there though is

2035
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,800
even if it looks flat for ten time steps

2036
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,880
it could still be trapped which is why

2037
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,480
things have to be seated and have really

2038
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,760
good randomness

2039
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,400
because there's no hard and fast rule

2040
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,520
for when you terminate

2041
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,960
so for example in a lot of the

2042
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,960
evolutionary simulations we would do

2043
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,000
you discard the first like 10 000 or

2044
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,040
more

2045
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,440
time steps like burn in you just discard

2046
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,640
them because you think that actually

2047
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,239
it's too much reflecting your prior

2048
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:00,960
estimates

2049
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,239
and then even if it looks like it's

2050
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:04,080
converging or as one of my professors

2051
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,840
called it a fuzzy caterpillar

2052
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,199
because it's kind of like the model was

2053
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:10,000
sampling from the fullest possible range

2054
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:10,960
of variables

2055
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,040
and it was still coming back home that's

2056
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,320
the fuzzy caterpillar

2057
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,840
but even then it could look like a fuzzy

2058
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,679
caterpillar for like a lot of time steps

2059
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:18,880
and then just totally

2060
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,560
hit on a new combination break into a

2061
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,880
new realm so it's really

2062
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,440
hard in a challenge so just so people

2063
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,800
know that's actually not

2064
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,120
true in this case so variational base is

2065
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,760
a is a deterministic in the sense that

2066
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,800
um you you don't do this kind of you

2067
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,120
know

2068
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:38,400
burn in you don't um right variability

2069
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,159
you just deterministically like if i ran

2070
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:41,360
this over and over again it would give

2071
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,960
me the exact same parameter estimates

2072
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,000
each time

2073
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,480
um so there is there is actually no

2074
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,840
variability i mean the kind of thing

2075
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,040
you're talking about is more like monte

2076
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,159
carlo

2077
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,159
yeah it's gonna say sorts of approaches

2078
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:53,440
yeah sorry i didn't mean to say that

2079
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,560
there was a burn-in

2080
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,920
um i agree that was just yeah little

2081
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,640
analogy but thanks for clarifying so one

2082
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,320
advantage of monte carlo like sampling

2083
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,320
methods is that you over

2084
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,320
given infinite time you're guaranteed to

2085
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,679
margin to approach

2086
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,679
the true posterior or to obtain the true

2087
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:10,800
posterior

2088
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,719
uh it's also extremely computationally

2089
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:14,159
expensive

2090
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:18,000
um variational base is really quick

2091
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,199
like you can run this stuff on your

2092
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,840
laptop so um the monte carlo is based

2093
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,600
upon sampling that was the different

2094
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,520
domain that i was um referencing there

2095
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,719
you have to sample

2096
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:28,159
in cases where you don't know some of

2097
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,440
these distributions don't have them

2098
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,960
defined so perfectly

2099
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,199
but when you have access to this level

2100
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:34,560
of specifying

2101
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,239
then there's a whole new range of

2102
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:37,440
techniques which is why it looks more

2103
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,360
like matrix multiplication

2104
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,000
and this sort of like convergence to the

2105
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,800
variational

2106
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,360
free energy estimate rather than just

2107
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,880
sampling endlessly from a landscape

2108
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,159
that's of unknown

2109
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:49,440
you know anything else but yeah thanks

2110
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,199
for that sorry

2111
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:53,120
so so just take i mean show again just

2112
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,560
to give you guys a sense so in this

2113
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,640
so this kind of participant you can see

2114
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,000
that it's pretty kind of

2115
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,560
the distributions are a lot less precise

2116
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,320
and this is a person who has a much

2117
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,960
lower action precision value

2118
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,199
so these were generated by a lower

2119
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:08,480
action precision value

2120
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,960
agent and the model is doing a pretty

2121
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,800
good job just finding a low action

2122
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,640
precision value that kind of spreads the

2123
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,920
distributions

2124
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,480
flat enough around it that it captures

2125
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,159
it provides decent evidence for each

2126
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:21,120
action

2127
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,960
um and so anyway so just just to uh

2128
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,520
again to to give you guys an intuition

2129
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,120
for what's going on

2130
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,960
um but so once this is done

2131
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,600
then what will happen is we'll have

2132
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,159
these

2133
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:39,600
uh the free energies of the winning

2134
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,320
model for each person for each of the

2135
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,679
two models

2136
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,360
um the one with and the one without

2137
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,760
learning rate um and so we want to do is

2138
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,480
we want to do bayesian model comparison

2139
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,800
um which is where you're going to

2140
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,560
compare the free energies for each model

2141
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,920
for each participant

2142
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,280
to find the model with the lowest free

2143
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:00,480
energy across participants

2144
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,520
and the winning model um so the the

2145
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,440
little spm function that you know we

2146
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,480
include here

2147
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,080
it'll spit out several things but the

2148
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,679
one that you want to focus on

2149
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:12,960
um just to keep things simple is um

2150
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,800
the one that has the highest what's

2151
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,920
called the protected exceedance

2152
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,120
probability

2153
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,199
um and this is just the probability that

2154
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:20,239
each model

2155
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:21,840
is the most likely model across all

2156
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,159
subjects while taking into account the

2157
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,760
null possibility

2158
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,360
the differences in model evidence or due

2159
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,120
to chance so

2160
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,360
so it's like i said it's just it's just

2161
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,880
which is the best model

2162
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,440
um when taking into account the null

2163
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,080
model

2164
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,199
um as a possibility um

2165
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:42,400
and i'll um i'll show you that

2166
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,280
um in a second let's see is this thing

2167
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,040
it's still going

2168
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,480
it's uh yeah okay still going

2169
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,400
um hopefully it'll be done soon but so

2170
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,080
i'll keep i'll keep moving through here

2171
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,679
and then we can return to this once it's

2172
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:56,239
done

2173
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:57,760
it's actually going pretty fast since i

2174
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,600
made it so few trials

2175
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,719
um but so so that's you know what we're

2176
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:03,679
doing here

2177
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:07,600
um and uh so now

2178
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,719
you know we've kind of already touched

2179
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:11,600
on this a bit but

2180
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,000
so now is the point where we would

2181
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:14,880
confirm

2182
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,199
that the best model is identifiable you

2183
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:18,480
know or that the parameters are

2184
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,000
recoverable

2185
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,199
and this is so i already mentioned this

2186
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:23,199
a little bit but that you know it's it's

2187
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:24,400
clear that not all models are

2188
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,600
necessarily going to have

2189
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,920
unique parameter solutions right so if

2190
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,760
you have a landscape like this

2191
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,440
you might start out priors at very

2192
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,120
similar places

2193
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,600
and gradient descent would lead you to

2194
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,320
minima

2195
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,480
different minima you know different

2196
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,080
combinations of parameter values that

2197
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,360
are equally good

2198
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:45,679
at reproducing a participant's behavior

2199
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,280
so so you always have to show

2200
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,199
that whatever model you're using and the

2201
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,600
priors that you're using

2202
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,719
will give you the same parameters

2203
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:00,560
that you fed in to generate the data to

2204
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,120
begin with

2205
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,040
and so here um again we've already

2206
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,480
talked about this a little bit but step

2207
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,520
one is

2208
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,440
you would specify multiple sets of

2209
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:12,880
generative parameter values which is

2210
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,080
what we're doing

2211
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,840
um and this is important as you should

2212
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,360
select values

2213
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,000
that are the same or similar to the

2214
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,320
actual parameter combinations

2215
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,159
that you got in your in your true

2216
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:27,520
participants

2217
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,040
um because it can be the case that

2218
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,239
parameter estimates are totally

2219
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:31,600
recoverable

2220
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,239
for certain parameter combinations but

2221
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:36,320
are not recoverable for other parameter

2222
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,920
combinations so you care about the ones

2223
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,040
you're actually getting

2224
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:43,040
for your participants um

2225
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,080
so then you want to simulate behavior

2226
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,239
so generate simulated behavior using

2227
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:49,360
each of those parameter value

2228
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,199
combinations

2229
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:53,360
run that simulated behavior through the

2230
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,400
estimation routine

2231
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,800
just like you would for real data and

2232
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,080
then check whether the

2233
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,679
generative parameters and the estimated

2234
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:02,800
parameters are highly correlated

2235
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:07,520
so when i run this in advance

2236
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,000
you know so without having to run it in

2237
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,080
real time like i'm doing right now

2238
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,560
then for this particular case and bear

2239
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,560
in mind this is when i'm using 32 trials

2240
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,360
not like the

2241
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,080
16 or whatever i put in now um just to

2242
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,560
make things go faster

2243
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,960
this is what i get for it for alpha for

2244
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,719
action precision for the two parameter

2245
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:27,360
model

2246
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,679
so you can see even with only six people

2247
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:31,679
the correlation between the

2248
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:34,320
generative uh action precision and the

2249
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,320
estimated extra precision is pretty good

2250
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,520
it's 0.81 so even with six people

2251
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:44,000
right it's significant um

2252
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,440
whereas for uh

2253
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,679
the only one well anyway i have a i have

2254
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:53,120
a bunch of them i can i can

2255
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:54,880
i can pull uh i could probably pull them

2256
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,640
up um

2257
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,120
let's see that's for a totally different

2258
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,480
thing

2259
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,600
um cool

2260
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,640
that was very tutorial

2261
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,600
interesting uh yes sorry i'm just trying

2262
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:14,480
to find um trying to find the uh

2263
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,920
the figures that i have it's probably

2264
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,679
here um

2265
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,760
well no okay not positive where i put

2266
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,880
them actually

2267
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,400
but if i can't find them here then

2268
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,679
uh it will it will spit them out

2269
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:36,719
um but um but

2270
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:40,159
point point being um these are uh

2271
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:42,080
um in this case even with just six

2272
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,280
values um

2273
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,920
all of the parameters um tend to be

2274
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:46,960
really good

2275
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,040
right in terms of recoverability the you

2276
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,960
know the correlations between generative

2277
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,800
and estimated parameters tend to be

2278
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,600
you know between point seven and one

2279
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,640
point seven and point

2280
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,199
nine something or other um so they're

2281
01:18:59,199 --> 01:18:59,840
they're

2282
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,400
they're good um so then so then finally

2283
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,440
the last thing that we wanna do is once

2284
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,560
we have

2285
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,719
parameter estimates for each person in a

2286
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:11,600
winning model

2287
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,040
that is recoverable then we can take

2288
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,159
those values

2289
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:18,159
and we can put those parameter we can

2290
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:19,920
use those parameters

2291
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,199
as individual difference measures

2292
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:23,360
between subjects um

2293
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,880
you know at that point there's a number

2294
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,640
of things that you can do

2295
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,920
so you know the kind of simplest thing

2296
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,520
you know if you if you want to kind of

2297
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,679
fall back on on frequentist

2298
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:36,560
statistics is you know you can do

2299
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,440
standard you know t

2300
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,280
tests anovas correlations regressions

2301
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,440
etc um

2302
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,840
and um and you know i mean you know

2303
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,280
we've done that before

2304
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,080
it's fine in some cases um if you want

2305
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,360
to kind of stick

2306
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,280
with the more kind of general bayesian

2307
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,280
theme of active inference then you can

2308
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,120
also do things like

2309
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,960
um you know do things more like base

2310
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,760
factor analyses

2311
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,040
and you know both of these are often

2312
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,040
kind of used

2313
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:06,400
or or even used together um

2314
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,880
and just to give you a couple examples

2315
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,239
sorry i'm just going to triple check

2316
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,520
that this thing is not

2317
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,000
done yes still not done just one note

2318
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,760
there is the spm textbook

2319
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,080
has many points of contact between

2320
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:18,880
parametric

2321
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:23,120
and um like standard very classical

2322
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,760
statistical approaches and then very

2323
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,400
bayesian

2324
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,960
approaches and mixed methods and it will

2325
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,880
switch out or show it both ways

2326
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,800
so it really is pretty interesting how

2327
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,520
it comes together here

2328
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,600
so so to kind of show you guys a couple

2329
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,679
examples of how you would use

2330
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:42,000
um these kind of you know use parameters

2331
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,360
at the group level

2332
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,040
um you know this is just i'll give you a

2333
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,280
couple examples from from our papers

2334
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,920
um so in this in this one in journal of

2335
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,920
uh psychiatry and neuroscience

2336
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,400
um what we did is we had a this simple

2337
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,320
kind of approach avoidance conflict task

2338
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,280
where more or less the participant had

2339
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,639
to kind of choose to move this little

2340
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:01,760
avatar guy

2341
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:04,480
closer or farther from one of these two

2342
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,120
ends

2343
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:08,800
of this little kind of runway thing

2344
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,520
and they knew that the closer they were

2345
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,120
to one side the higher the probability

2346
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,719
was that they would get an outcome

2347
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:17,520
associated with symbols on the left side

2348
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,960
and same goes the closer they are to the

2349
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,159
right the higher probability of getting

2350
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:21,520
the outcomes associated with the right

2351
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,320
side

2352
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,320
i mean here a rain cloud means they

2353
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,639
heard like a really aversive sound and

2354
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:28,560
saw like a really aversive picture

2355
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,560
you know like it's like hearing girls

2356
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,000
screaming and seeing a picture of her

2357
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,520
being like pulled into a van

2358
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,199
you know like really negative stuff um

2359
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:39,120
and uh whereas the sun thing here man

2360
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,159
you kind of saw this kind of like

2361
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,480
neutral maybe slightly happy thing

2362
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,520
um and uh you have this kind of red this

2363
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,120
kind of bar thing on the side and the

2364
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:47,520
more

2365
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,480
filled the red bar was the more points

2366
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:51,760
they would win

2367
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,840
um so you have kind of clear cases right

2368
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,280
where it's just if it's just rain cloud

2369
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,080
versus sun

2370
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,239
you should just go to the right if it's

2371
01:21:58,239 --> 01:21:59,440
just sun

2372
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,600
and sun plus some reward you should want

2373
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,120
to go to the right

2374
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,639
and then you have these conflict cases

2375
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:07,199
where it's negative stuff

2376
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:09,120
plus you get some reward negative stuff

2377
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,480
but it gives you plus you get even more

2378
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,239
reward and negative stuff and even more

2379
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:13,600
reward than that

2380
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,239
um and so and so that's how the task is

2381
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:17,440
structured

2382
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,320
and so you can make a pretty simple

2383
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,760
model of this

2384
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,239
where one state factor is beliefs about

2385
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,280
the trial type

2386
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:28,400
right whether it's uh this kind of trial

2387
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,920
this kind of trial this kind of trial is

2388
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,679
controller that kind of trial

2389
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:34,480
um and then you can have a state factor

2390
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,400
corresponding to

2391
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,239
beliefs about the runway position right

2392
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:40,800
so uh beliefs about whether the avatar

2393
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,719
is in position one two three four five

2394
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:43,679
etcetera

2395
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:47,120
that's it and then you just have um

2396
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,040
you set up likelihoods that generate the

2397
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,400
probability

2398
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,760
of um of each position

2399
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,800
generating what sorts of outcomes and

2400
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,880
what sorts of runaway positions

2401
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,840
given beliefs about trial type right

2402
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,760
here ryan so you have it phrased as

2403
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,960
there being five trial types but

2404
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,440
would it be possible to have like a

2405
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,199
model where it was like a state

2406
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,840
estimate left and a state estimate right

2407
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:14,320
for

2408
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,159
the stimuli type and a state estimate

2409
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:17,679
left and say estimate right for the

2410
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:18,800
reward value

2411
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,159
because this frames it in a very

2412
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:21,920
behavioral trial

2413
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:24,800
centric way with doing estimate on which

2414
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,080
one of the five scenarios you're in but

2415
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,199
i'm just trying to think about cases

2416
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:27,600
where

2417
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,120
you might not know which scenario you're

2418
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,320
in or even what the total set of

2419
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,600
scenarios is

2420
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,040
so you're just doing state estimate on

2421
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:36,480
reward and on stimuli

2422
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,040
um yeah i mean i mean yes i mean the

2423
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:39,679
well

2424
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:41,040
well i guess it kind of depends right so

2425
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,199
i mean if you if you were to

2426
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,120
give somebody sort of uncertain cues

2427
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,560
about trial type

2428
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,840
um then um then

2429
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,760
i mean presumably you would just you

2430
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,880
wouldn't need to i mean you would just

2431
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,000
still have

2432
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,800
um if they know what the different trial

2433
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,480
type possibilities are then you could

2434
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,840
just have uncertain cues so they just

2435
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,920
don't have a precise

2436
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,239
belief a set precise prior belief over

2437
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:04,960
the different

2438
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:09,520
over this state factor but if you

2439
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,000
didn't if there wasn't any set beliefs

2440
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,520
about trial types and there's just any

2441
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,360
possible combination

2442
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,840
of you know sun clouds zero points two

2443
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,120
four and six

2444
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,840
then um um i suppose you could do

2445
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,760
something where you just have a kind of

2446
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,440
non-factorized state factor that has

2447
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,000
like

2448
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,280
just every possible combination

2449
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,600
or something like that um you could do

2450
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,280
that i mean it would uh

2451
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,440
um there are reasons to actually build

2452
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,600
like so there are

2453
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,880
obviously time saving and model building

2454
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,400
considerations that mean you should use

2455
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,560
factorized distributions

2456
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,159
um but there are actual empirical

2457
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:47,840
considerations which means that

2458
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,600
i think if you want to build a model

2459
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,520
that's kind of realistically how the

2460
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,400
brain works

2461
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,679
you should tend towards in a lot of

2462
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:57,520
cases you should tend towards factorized

2463
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,560
distributions

2464
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,080
so for example there's good evidence

2465
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,679
that there's a factorized representation

2466
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,360
of task phase

2467
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,560
in pfc and mtl uh there's pretty good

2468
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,280
evidence so

2469
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:10,560
i mean the what versus where streams

2470
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,880
in vision that's a factorized

2471
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,320
representation

2472
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,840
um so very

2473
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,679
yeah so you're kind of using it in like

2474
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:21,199
a coarse graining

2475
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,840
sense to say sometimes you don't want to

2476
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,480
even

2477
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,480
allow for the all by all because it's

2478
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,159
more categorical

2479
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:30,960
how the task is being modeled anywhere

2480
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,080
like fight or flight

2481
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,199
you wouldn't want to have all

2482
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:36,080
combinations of elbow and knee movements

2483
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,199
you're fitting something that's kind of

2484
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:39,679
at the wrong dimensionality

2485
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:41,760
and so for a lot of reasons not the

2486
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,040
least of which it seems like that's what

2487
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,719
organisms would do would be at that high

2488
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:46,400
dimensional manifold or the factorized

2489
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,639
representation

2490
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,960
yeah well and and in this case right i

2491
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,639
mean just we have experimental

2492
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:54,639
the experimental design is such that

2493
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:56,239
they are they do know ahead of time what

2494
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:58,480
the different possible combinations are

2495
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,840
right so i mean they just they just

2496
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,040
already know that there are these

2497
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,480
combinations

2498
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:05,679
um so it's it's consistent with their

2499
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:07,440
beliefs about the generative model that

2500
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,120
we have given them

2501
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:12,719
via the instructions um so

2502
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:16,080
um so so in this case

2503
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:20,480
um you know we had a a pretty uh typical

2504
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,239
you know sort of sort of model graphical

2505
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:24,400
model with two parameters

2506
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,520
we had our the beta here which

2507
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:28,719
corresponds to the

2508
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:32,159
expected for energy precision um here

2509
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:35,280
you know just to be intuitive for the uh

2510
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,840
clinical audience we were going for we

2511
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:40,080
just called this decision uncertainty

2512
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,560
um and then we had a and so that's just

2513
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,280
this is again

2514
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:46,000
this is the rate prior um or rate

2515
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,679
parameter for a gamma distribution

2516
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:50,880
uh over uh over this uh

2517
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:55,120
gamma term um and uh

2518
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:58,159
which again is a uh a thing that

2519
01:26:58,159 --> 01:26:59,199
modulates the

2520
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:01,679
expected free energy estimate over

2521
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:02,639
policies

2522
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:05,360
um so it modulates this g thing um but

2523
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,199
then the other parameter we had

2524
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:10,719
was this uh emotion conflict parameter

2525
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:13,920
which just said basically how much

2526
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:17,600
they uh dislike the negative stimulus

2527
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,080
how

2528
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,440
aversive they expect the negative

2529
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,000
stimulus to be um

2530
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
and so you can kind of show in

2531
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,800
simulation so each one of these uh

2532
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,960
vertical bars here corresponds to

2533
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:29,840
beliefs about

2534
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,600
uh the what state you were in on the

2535
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,199
runway um

2536
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:36,960
so if beta equals one and uh

2537
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,480
the um and uh the emotion conflict

2538
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,679
equals one

2539
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:44,080
then you should expect that if the you

2540
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,159
know good thing is on the uh

2541
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:49,120
oh it is okay and this is a this is a um

2542
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,159
conflict plus

2543
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:53,920
two points uh trial um so basically the

2544
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:54,639
thing will

2545
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:57,199
approach the reward even if it's going

2546
01:27:57,199 --> 01:27:59,280
to see something negative if vc is one

2547
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:02,400
and it will do it deterministically

2548
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,400
whereas if ec is three then it will

2549
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,760
fairly deterministically

2550
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,320
choose to go away from the negative

2551
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,239
stimulus even if they would get

2552
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:14,159
reward whereas if they have higher

2553
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,639
values so more decision uncertainty than

2554
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:18,320
this distribution becomes

2555
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,920
they become a lot less confident in this

2556
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,440
distribution and

2557
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,120
end up choosing these kinds of values

2558
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,800
that are more like in the middle

2559
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,080
um and um

2560
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,239
and uh the likelihood is is you know

2561
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:31,679
pretty clear it's just in each trial

2562
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:32,560
type

2563
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,880
each of the different um each column

2564
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,800
here is a different runway position

2565
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,159
they will just generate the negative

2566
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:40,159
stimulus with an increasing probability

2567
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:41,360
as it goes left

2568
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:42,880
and the positive stimulus with an

2569
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,040
increasing probability as it goes right

2570
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,679
um etc uh the only confusing thing here

2571
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:48,880
is that

2572
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:51,360
white means a higher probability in

2573
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,120
these whereas block it means higher

2574
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,639
probability here but

2575
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:57,040
um but anyway so that's that's it and

2576
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:57,760
just kind of

2577
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,960
etc etc for the five trial types so

2578
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,679
in this case what we found was if you

2579
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:04,159
look at

2580
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,320
healthy controls versus people with

2581
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,000
depression and anxiety versus people

2582
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,120
with substance use disorders

2583
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,520
the emotion conflict is actually

2584
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,880
interestingly higher

2585
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,679
in healthy and lowest in substance use

2586
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:18,320
disorder

2587
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,199
whereas decision uncertainty is highest

2588
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:23,760
in substance use disorder

2589
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,520
and kind of medium and depression

2590
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:26,880
anxiety and low

2591
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,639
and healthy controls and these are

2592
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:30,480
significantly different

2593
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,159
and that's true in a propensity match

2594
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:34,320
propensity match sample and in a

2595
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:37,679
larger sample so this interesting thing

2596
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:38,239
where

2597
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:40,239
it might be more of a what might be more

2598
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:41,920
clinically relevant as this kind of

2599
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,840
uncertainty over options as opposed to

2600
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:44,480
just

2601
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:48,320
being more sensitive to negative stimuli

2602
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,800
um right how would you say how would

2603
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:53,199
that shape just kind of curious if

2604
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:55,360
it doesn't have a if it's not known but

2605
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,320
how would that shape

2606
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:59,600
treatment or conversation or approach

2607
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,560
in a given situation from whichever role

2608
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,320
makes sense like to say oh it's not

2609
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:05,120
actually

2610
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,760
this psychological construct but it's

2611
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:08,480
actually

2612
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:11,839
related to something like this

2613
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:13,840
um i mean in terms of like informing

2614
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,280
treatment or something like that

2615
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:18,960
sure like treatment via any modality

2616
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,719
um yeah i mean so i mean typically the

2617
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:24,320
the main source of things you might want

2618
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,400
to do is you know either talking about

2619
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,280
um

2620
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,920
so say you know at baseline before

2621
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,520
somebody starts treatment

2622
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,960
what their beta value was right

2623
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,800
it might be the case you'd have to study

2624
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,320
to show this but it might be the case

2625
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:38,960
that

2626
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:41,520
given different beta values at baseline

2627
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,159
you know

2628
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:44,000
like people with high beta values might

2629
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,480
respond well to cbt

2630
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,159
cognitive behavioral therapy whereas

2631
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:50,320
people with low beta values might

2632
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:53,199
respond better to act or might respond

2633
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:54,320
better to

2634
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,880
an ssri or you know like something like

2635
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:57,600
that

2636
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,520
so either it's either it's something i

2637
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,280
mean that's kind of the ideal thing is

2638
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,560
you want to say

2639
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,320
can i get this information and it will

2640
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,840
give me information about how to treat a

2641
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:06,880
person

2642
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,760
um but there are lots of other things

2643
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,360
you might do besides that but that's

2644
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,199
that's like a primary kind of

2645
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:15,679
you know like ultimate goal example yeah

2646
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:17,120
it's interesting how there's probably a

2647
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:17,920
lot to be

2648
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:20,719
said and learned about the actual

2649
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:22,320
application of active inference

2650
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,360
clinically

2651
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:26,320
but even here on the beginning of

2652
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:27,280
applying it

2653
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,679
we can use it as just a potential

2654
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:30,719
biomarker

2655
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:32,560
just like a summary statistic related to

2656
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,760
a questionnaire

2657
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,600
or some other thing that's estimated

2658
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,440
from empirical clinical data

2659
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,040
fitting a different kind of underlying

2660
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,400
generative model so instead of doing a

2661
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,840
regression oh people who have

2662
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,600
higher on this end up doing better or

2663
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,280
worse in this kind of a program

2664
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,040
well now we can just do that same kind

2665
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,560
of parameter

2666
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,400
testing in the context of a different

2667
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,320
type of model it's an active inference

2668
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:54,800
generative model so i think that those

2669
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,159
are just some points of contact but it's

2670
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:58,239
really interesting stuff

2671
01:31:58,239 --> 01:32:00,239
yeah definitely i mean you can do lots

2672
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:01,440
of other interesting things with these

2673
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,320
right so this

2674
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,080
this beta parameter if you remember from

2675
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,840
previous sessions is what's associated

2676
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:06,560
with

2677
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,120
um it's proposed to be associated with

2678
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:09,679
um

2679
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:12,880
dopamine dynamics in uh

2680
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:15,600
in the brain and i'll show you briefly a

2681
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:16,400
a study

2682
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,520
um an example study later which

2683
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,880
where philip shorten back like i

2684
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,960
mentioned before actually showed that

2685
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:23,280
the

2686
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,000
trial by trial updates in beta that are

2687
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,440
predicted by the model

2688
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:31,280
um were correlated with a bold signal

2689
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:34,320
in fmri in

2690
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,920
in the midbrain in a midbrain region

2691
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,400
that's associated with dopamine

2692
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,920
you know so whereas whereas the way that

2693
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,120
we're doing this here we just have a

2694
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,920
stable beta estimate for each person

2695
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:47,360
but you might look at um say individual

2696
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,400
differences between

2697
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,800
contrast values in an fmri analysis at

2698
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,000
the group level

2699
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,520
um you know so like people with higher

2700
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,280
beta values have higher

2701
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:58,320
say uh basal ganglia

2702
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,920
uh responses to reward versus no reward

2703
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:02,960
or something like that

2704
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,880
um so you could do that kind of thing as

2705
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:06,960
well so both both individual level and

2706
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,560
group level um

2707
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,159
fmri sorts of approaches as well as

2708
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:14,960
much fancier things but those are just

2709
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,310
two kind of simple examples

2710
01:33:16,310 --> 01:33:17,840
[Music]

2711
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,239
so as another example of doing this in

2712
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:21,280
the in the domain of

2713
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,880
kind of perception instead of decision

2714
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:25,199
making um

2715
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,280
you know we we used uh this is in the

2716
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,719
context of a task

2717
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:31,679
where a person is just told to uh push a

2718
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:32,880
button every time they feel their

2719
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,080
heartbeat

2720
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,679
um and um so in this model uh

2721
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:40,159
we don't even have like an explicit

2722
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:41,840
policy selection part

2723
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,400
um all we do is they start with a

2724
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,840
precise belief that they're in this

2725
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,520
start state at time one

2726
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,840
and then they have prior beliefs about

2727
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,120
whether or not

2728
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:52,639
they're going to transition into a state

2729
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:54,480
of feeling their heartbeat versus not so

2730
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:56,080
probability of no heartbeat probably of

2731
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,360
heartbeat

2732
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:00,400
and those priors are encoded in this in

2733
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:00,880
the

2734
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,960
b matrix here the transition matrix

2735
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,199
where sort of the higher the php is the

2736
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:07,760
more they expect to feel a heartbeat you

2737
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:08,719
know more often

2738
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:11,840
right on each trial um

2739
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,000
and um and then also there's a precision

2740
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,080
value here which corresponds to

2741
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,239
beliefs about how precise the actual

2742
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:19,840
afferent signal is coming up

2743
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:23,040
from the heart um and so we can estimate

2744
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,960
this ip parameters intercept of

2745
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,159
precision and this

2746
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:28,960
prior over heartbeats um i should say we

2747
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,480
also compared this to a model that

2748
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:31,520
included learning

2749
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,360
in this task and in this case the model

2750
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,440
including learning didn't win

2751
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:38,960
um and so what we found here is

2752
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:40,560
and i should say also that they do this

2753
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,239
task three times they do it once when

2754
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:44,000
they're told they're allowed to guess

2755
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,119
once when they're told they're not

2756
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:46,719
allowed to guess and only to press it

2757
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:48,239
when they're sure they felt something

2758
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:50,800
and one where aside from in addition to

2759
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,239
no guessing they're told to hold their

2760
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:53,760
breath which kind of makes it

2761
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,920
um on average easier uh to feel your

2762
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:56,960
heartbeat

2763
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,080
um and um so it kind of like amplifies

2764
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:01,520
the afferent signal makes it more

2765
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:02,639
precise

2766
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:04,639
what we found was that in healthy people

2767
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:06,719
the breath hold actually amplified into

2768
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:08,719
receptive precision a lot

2769
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:10,320
whereas in all the clinical groups

2770
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,320
anxiety depression comorbid depression

2771
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,000
anxiety eating disorders and substance

2772
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,280
use disorders they just stayed flat

2773
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:20,320
low intercepted precision values

2774
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:23,760
so that the actual changing the

2775
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,159
actual precision of the afferent signal

2776
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:27,679
didn't have any effect on their beliefs

2777
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:29,679
about the precision of the signal

2778
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:31,520
um you know so it's something like like

2779
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,119
a rigidity in the way that the brain

2780
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:33,920
treats

2781
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:36,320
uh afferent interceptive signals and

2782
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:37,760
psychiatric disorders trans

2783
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,040
diagnostically

2784
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,119
uh and so again this is just a again

2785
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:42,960
kind of a standard like mixed model sort

2786
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,400
of analysis

2787
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:47,520
um whereas if you compare say

2788
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,920
estimates for prior expectations

2789
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,199
everybody

2790
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:54,000
um showed higher prior values in the

2791
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,440
guessing condition

2792
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,040
than in the other two conditions which

2793
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,119
you would expect

2794
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:01,360
but there were no differences between

2795
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:03,119
healthy and clinical groups so it's kind

2796
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:04,560
of interesting it says hey maybe this is

2797
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,080
more a precision issue than it is a

2798
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,080
prior expectation issue

2799
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:10,400
in terms of clinical significance or

2800
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:12,400
another task or another task has to be

2801
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,280
explored

2802
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:16,000
chris put in a plug how cool that paper

2803
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:16,880
was i think there's

2804
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:20,159
been a lot of conceptual work on

2805
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:22,080
interception active inference and

2806
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,760
there's been a lot of discussion about

2807
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:25,760
whether it's priors or precision or

2808
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,199
anything like that

2809
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:29,520
um and to my knowledge i'm happy to be

2810
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:30,239
corrected

2811
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:32,719
about this by ryan but um that was the

2812
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:33,840
first time that

2813
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,360
it's really been tested empirically

2814
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,360
right uh

2815
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:39,760
yes there's no there's no other there's

2816
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,960
no other

2817
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,480
like actual formal fitting models to

2818
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:45,119
data

2819
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:47,040
um studies that have tried that before

2820
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:48,960
nice epic work

2821
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,320
there are there are papers that have

2822
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,880
tested like more kind of like

2823
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,719
quote-unquote qualitative or just kind

2824
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:56,639
of like go up versus down sorts of

2825
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:57,679
predictions that fall out of

2826
01:36:57,679 --> 01:36:59,119
computational models but

2827
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:01,760
not actually fitting a model yes this is

2828
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:03,440
the first model based analysis of this

2829
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,520
kind of thing right

2830
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,440
yeah and we've um and it's cool we've

2831
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:08,800
actually replicated the results in

2832
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,239
healthy controls in a second

2833
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:11,840
uh sample now so it seems like the

2834
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,760
effect at least the effect in healthies

2835
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:14,800
is pretty robust

2836
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,119
we haven't been able to replicate we

2837
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:19,119
haven't tried to replicate the uh

2838
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:22,159
the lack of uh of an effect

2839
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:24,320
um in uh clinical populations yet but

2840
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,159
that's kind of in the works

2841
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:29,280
um cool so

2842
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,520
so so anyway so this continues this

2843
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:33,119
continues to go here

2844
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:34,639
yeah but it should be i think it should

2845
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:36,159
be almost done

2846
01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:38,639
pretty quick it only does six people i'm

2847
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:39,840
surprised

2848
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,360
an interception question and then one

2849
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:42,960
question from the chat so what other

2850
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:44,320
interceptive

2851
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,719
methodologies might exist so you did a

2852
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:48,080
heart rate

2853
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:50,159
estimation task what other

2854
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:51,920
interroceptive modalities might be

2855
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,360
amenable to this kind of quantitative

2856
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,679
analysis

2857
01:37:55,679 --> 01:37:59,760
um so definitely um definitely

2858
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,960
cardiac interception tasks are

2859
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:06,239
um are uh most common

2860
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:08,960
just because it's it's actually quite

2861
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:11,040
difficult the methodologies is it's

2862
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,080
pretty difficult to

2863
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,560
um you know use so for instance in

2864
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,159
vision right you can like

2865
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,480
very tightly control or in audition you

2866
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:20,239
can really tightly control the timing

2867
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:21,520
and magnitude

2868
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,600
you know of like the of the the input

2869
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,080
signal right whereas it's it's hard to

2870
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:26,719
say

2871
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:30,159
precisely control um changes in

2872
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:31,520
the signals that you're getting from the

2873
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,760
inside of your body um

2874
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:36,159
so so it's um you know it's difficult at

2875
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:36,960
least the heart

2876
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,760
is a kind of like signal that has a rate

2877
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:40,480
and um

2878
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:43,679
and you kind of know precisely when it

2879
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:45,199
sent the signal upward you know and

2880
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:46,159
things like that so they're definitely

2881
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:47,520
the most common there's lots of

2882
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:48,560
different

2883
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,800
ways that people do cardiac there's lots

2884
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,639
of different cardiac

2885
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:56,320
perception tasks a lot of them have come

2886
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:56,800
under

2887
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:59,280
a lot of recent criticism recently um

2888
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:00,480
for various reasons

2889
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,040
um there's been some studies that show

2890
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:03,600
that

2891
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,440
um for instance like standard uh what

2892
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,119
are called heartbeat county tasks

2893
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:08,880
where people are just kind of asked to

2894
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,400
like over a period of a couple of

2895
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:10,880
minutes

2896
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,400
just count every time they feel the

2897
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,080
heartbeat and you just kind of

2898
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,159
look at how close their counts are to

2899
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:18,239
the true number of heartbeats

2900
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:21,520
um there's a there's a number of papers

2901
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:22,960
including our paper actually that show

2902
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,400
that this looks like it's primarily just

2903
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,040
tracking

2904
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:28,239
prior expectations um it doesn't it

2905
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:29,920
doesn't tell you a lot about

2906
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,280
you know what the the way that they're

2907
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,199
actually treating individual signals

2908
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:35,600
um and i mean in ours in ours we

2909
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,360
actually showed this that um

2910
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,440
that if you used a standard heartbeat

2911
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,960
counting measure instead of the

2912
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:41,840
heartbeat tapping

2913
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,119
you know which was our primary measure

2914
01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:45,199
that we fed into the model um prior

2915
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:46,480
expectations in the model

2916
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:49,600
predicted the heartbeat counting uh

2917
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:53,119
like accuracy values like 0.9 something

2918
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:55,199
so so it was it was like a nice

2919
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:56,800
confirmation that yeah this is

2920
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,840
primarily about price

2921
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,199
it points towards having a generative

2922
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:02,880
model that can then be deployed and

2923
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:05,520
modified and corroborated across

2924
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,520
settings because then you could say well

2925
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,440
what would be the task or what would be

2926
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,760
the trial and set structure how many

2927
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,679
participants would we need to resolve a

2928
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:15,760
parametric difference of such and such

2929
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,639
so statistical power down to a lot of

2930
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:19,520
other features would be

2931
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:21,520
influenced okay let me ask this question

2932
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:22,560
from the chat

2933
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,119
so that we do hold on i need to finish

2934
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:26,159
that previous question

2935
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:29,360
um so so but aside from cardiac stuff

2936
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:29,920
there

2937
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:33,199
are a number of other methods um

2938
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:35,600
there's so one that i currently do in my

2939
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,600
lab is something called i'm using like

2940
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,119
breathing uh breathing

2941
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:41,600
resistances so basically you can you

2942
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,880
have these people wear this little kind

2943
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,119
of

2944
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:45,440
darth vader mask kind of thing and you

2945
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,800
can change in really precise subtle ways

2946
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,040
how is how much resistance there is when

2947
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,320
they try to breathe in

2948
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,880
um and you can um and you can get sort

2949
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,280
of individual differences in sensitivity

2950
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:00,080
you know where some people you know feel

2951
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:00,719
uh

2952
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:03,119
that change in like the how hard their

2953
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:05,119
lungs are needing to work basically

2954
01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:07,840
um at different at different loads of

2955
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:09,119
different resistances than

2956
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:11,360
than others um and you can also use it

2957
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,040
as kind of like an anxiety induction

2958
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,639
which is how we use it to try to

2959
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:17,040
you know precisely induce uncomfortable

2960
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:19,440
intercepted states at different uh

2961
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,600
intensities and see how that affects

2962
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,480
things what about muscle there's also

2963
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:26,560
sorry what what about muscular like how

2964
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,560
heavy is this or how what angle is your

2965
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:30,400
arm at

2966
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:31,679
um i mean we don't consider that

2967
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:33,280
interception that's more like

2968
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,480
proprioception or

2969
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:37,520
um or some other sensation um but

2970
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,199
certainly i mean there's lots of tasks

2971
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:40,560
like that out there

2972
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,560
um the kind of thing that that you know

2973
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,800
we mean by interception is things like

2974
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,320
you know feeling what's going on in your

2975
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,560
stomach feeling what's going on in your

2976
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:51,440
you know your heart or your lungs or um

2977
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:52,800
you know like various like

2978
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,639
effects of hormone levels you know like

2979
01:41:54,639 --> 01:41:56,000
stuff going on

2980
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,760
inside cool um so um i mean i should say

2981
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:02,159
i can't talk too much about it

2982
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:04,480
but we have actually developed a method

2983
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:05,199
for

2984
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:07,600
um precisely inducing inducing with

2985
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:08,880
precise timing

2986
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:12,800
um sensations in your stomach um and

2987
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,719
we're currently just finishing up a

2988
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:16,719
paper on this uh using that method with

2989
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:17,840
eeg

2990
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,600
um to test some predictions of the

2991
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,600
neural process theory for uh

2992
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:24,159
uh gastrointestinal intraoception so

2993
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:25,760
that's another thing that's kind of

2994
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:29,119
common looking forward

2995
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:30,880
let me ask the second question if it's

2996
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,719
okay yes

2997
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:33,920
what are the similarities and

2998
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:36,159
differences between the active inference

2999
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:36,719
model

3000
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:39,119
of emotional inference was how it was

3001
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:39,840
phrased

3002
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:42,239
and lisa feldman barrett's approach to

3003
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:43,760
emotion construction so if you don't

3004
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:44,719
know

3005
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:46,719
once i i i just wanted i'm just reading

3006
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:47,810
it off but um

3007
01:42:47,810 --> 01:42:50,849
[Music]

3008
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:52,719
that's probably that's probably a

3009
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:54,239
question for another time i mean for

3010
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:55,440
people who are familiar with

3011
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,760
you know my actual like simulation work

3012
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:58,639
in this area i've

3013
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:01,600
you know i and my group have published

3014
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:02,719
multiple

3015
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:05,040
active inference simulation papers

3016
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,320
specifically about emotion

3017
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:09,679
inference um and um

3018
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:12,880
those uh models to the so i should say

3019
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,239
it's not a straightforward question

3020
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:16,080
because you could build

3021
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:19,199
active inference models that are uh

3022
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:21,199
that would do more or less something

3023
01:43:21,199 --> 01:43:22,400
constructionist

3024
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,080
or you could build an active inference

3025
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:25,840
model that does something

3026
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,560
less constructionist so so it's it's

3027
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,159
actually not as though

3028
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:32,560
um active inference has something really

3029
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:33,920
unique to say about

3030
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,239
whether or not constructionist views of

3031
01:43:36,239 --> 01:43:38,960
emotion are right um

3032
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:42,000
but um but the um but i should say that

3033
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,840
the the most straightforward models

3034
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:46,320
um that have to do with uh

3035
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,000
constructionist views where where what

3036
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,440
you're trying to do is

3037
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:54,638
learn and infer emotion concepts um

3038
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:56,480
those the most straightforward ways of

3039
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,159
doing those are via the sort of

3040
01:43:58,159 --> 01:44:00,320
multimodal

3041
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,639
inference inference process that

3042
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:03,920
definitely has a kind of when those

3043
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,600
mappings between

3044
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,600
emotional concept like emotion state

3045
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,280
concepts and um

3046
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:12,159
lower level you know sorts of like uh

3047
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:13,840
observations like for instance like

3048
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,760
observing your arousal level you know

3049
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,360
observing how negative or positive you

3050
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,639
feel things like that treating those

3051
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:21,119
lower level things as observations

3052
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:24,159
um when the likelihood between those

3053
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:27,119
and um emotion concept states at a

3054
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:28,560
higher level when the mapping is in the

3055
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:29,920
likelihood is uh

3056
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,960
probabilistic then you end up having to

3057
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,719
learn probabilistic mappings that look a

3058
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:35,440
lot like

3059
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,760
constructionist types of inference

3060
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:38,719
stories

3061
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:41,520
um but what's kind of less clear is is

3062
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:42,560
that um

3063
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:44,560
constructionist views say don't say very

3064
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,239
much about

3065
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:49,360
how the kind of states in your body are

3066
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:50,960
generated in the first place

3067
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:53,520
um you know say like you know if i see a

3068
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:55,040
predator or something and i have

3069
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,960
i have this big change in my heart rate

3070
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,320
and like muscle tension and things like

3071
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,119
that

3072
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:01,360
um and then i feel that and i infer

3073
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:02,159
construct

3074
01:45:02,159 --> 01:45:03,600
right some kind of belief about what

3075
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,360
emotion that corresponds to in this

3076
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:07,280
context

3077
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:09,760
there's a you also need a story and an

3078
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:11,040
active inference model for the

3079
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:12,880
mechanisms that generate those responses

3080
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:15,040
before you make sense of them

3081
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:17,199
and you know we've we've talked about

3082
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:18,480
doing things like that with active

3083
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,320
inference models um and it's not

3084
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:22,400
so clear whether or not something like

3085
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,000
that would be consistent or inconsistent

3086
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:24,960
with um

3087
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:27,600
constructionist views um but uh but yeah

3088
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:28,080
anyway

3089
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:30,639
um so hopefully that helps the active

3090
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:31,760
inference doesn't solve the

3091
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:33,440
does it doesn't uh take sides

3092
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,520
necessarily i guess that's my point

3093
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:37,679
really interesting i didn't know about

3094
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:38,560
that um

3095
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,800
theory so it sounds like something where

3096
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,159
we can use active inference

3097
01:45:42,159 --> 01:45:44,159
to construct various kinds of models so

3098
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:45,360
all these orthogonal

3099
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,119
models and we're like looking always at

3100
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:49,520
the two by two on the active stream

3101
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:51,040
is it going to work on this axis and

3102
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:53,440
this axis which debates are

3103
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:55,040
relevant which ones aren't for active

3104
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:56,719
inference and the free energy principle

3105
01:45:56,719 --> 01:45:58,080
so you want to just carry on a little

3106
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:00,960
bit yeah i mean so

3107
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:02,239
i mean just to just to say i mean

3108
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:03,760
because this this actually comes back

3109
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:06,000
very well to the to the actual topic of

3110
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,040
you know today's session um is that to

3111
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:10,400
really solve these questions

3112
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:11,760
what you need to do right is you need to

3113
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,760
construct an active inference model

3114
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:15,520
that looks very constructionist and an

3115
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:16,960
active inference model that

3116
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,679
doesn't look very constructionist and

3117
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:21,199
see which one fits

3118
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:24,320
empirical data better right so um

3119
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,239
see it's more kind of a way of precisely

3120
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:28,080
testing uh different you know

3121
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:29,440
hypotheses of different models as

3122
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:31,360
opposed to you know saying this model

3123
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,360
must be correct theoretically

3124
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:35,360
yeah i think it's kind of important to

3125
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:36,639
when you're thinking about this kind of

3126
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:37,840
stuff people often talk about like

3127
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,440
active inference as a theory

3128
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,360
and as we've said like multiple times

3129
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:42,800
there are multiple process theories that

3130
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:44,000
could fall out of this i think it's a

3131
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,600
very general framework under which you

3132
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:46,800
can build

3133
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:49,920
multiple hopefully competing theories

3134
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:54,560
um so yeah i mean and in addition with

3135
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,880
computational psychiatry stuff

3136
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,239
you could just use you could think

3137
01:46:58,239 --> 01:47:00,639
active inference is literally false

3138
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:02,800
like as a theory but it would still be

3139
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,000
you could still also

3140
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,840
simultaneously think it's an awesome

3141
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:08,080
individual differences all

3142
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:09,920
like that would be an odd set of beliefs

3143
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:11,199
to hold but there's no contradiction

3144
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:12,320
there

3145
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:15,679
yeah um yeah no

3146
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:18,159
for sure uh yeah i mean this comes back

3147
01:47:18,159 --> 01:47:19,600
to the you know like

3148
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,920
uh whether you think of models this kind

3149
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:23,199
of model is getting to like the ground

3150
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:24,639
truth versus just using it

3151
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:27,679
you know instrumentally um but uh but

3152
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:28,480
yes

3153
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:31,520
um so okay so so last kind of thing here

3154
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,800
is is that

3155
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:36,320
um you know in addition to being able to

3156
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,880
do standard you know sorts of like you

3157
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,800
know again like anovas regressions you

3158
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,119
know frequencies approaches or even

3159
01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:46,159
you know base factor analyses um

3160
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:49,360
in place of or in addition to them um

3161
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:52,480
one thing that's really nice about

3162
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:54,000
getting parameter estimates the way

3163
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,159
we've been talking about is you don't

3164
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:58,960
just get um point estimates you don't

3165
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,960
just get posterior means

3166
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,080
which is you know what we've been

3167
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:03,600
talking about you know with like

3168
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,199
analyses like like that

3169
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:08,320
right like this is just you know means

3170
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,840
of posterior means

3171
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:13,840
um whereas um

3172
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:16,880
the active inference to the parameter

3173
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:18,880
estimates in variational bays

3174
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:21,760
also uh correspond to posterior also

3175
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:23,440
have posterior variances

3176
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:24,880
right so it's not just the mean but it's

3177
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:27,280
also the confidence that the estimation

3178
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:30,400
had around that mean um and so that's

3179
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:32,239
actually additional information that's

3180
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:32,719
useful

3181
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:35,440
to incorporate when you're doing group

3182
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:37,760
level analyses

3183
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:41,040
and and

3184
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:43,920
parametric empirical bays which is um

3185
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,040
something that again

3186
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,440
was initially developed and is primarily

3187
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:49,360
used for dynamic causal modeling

3188
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:52,560
um happens to work really well

3189
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:56,320
um with the uh with the the setup for

3190
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,000
getting parameter estimates

3191
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,840
and for the way that we get parameter

3192
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:02,080
estimates again like i said before

3193
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,800
already uses dcm scripts um so you can

3194
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:05,679
actually do

3195
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:07,119
these parametric empirical bayes

3196
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:09,360
approaches that are more or less

3197
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:12,639
general linear models but that also use

3198
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:14,560
the posterior variances

3199
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:18,159
um to get kind of um probably the most

3200
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:18,960
principled

3201
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:20,800
you know way of doing you know like the

3202
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,159
fully bayesian

3203
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:24,800
um group level stuff that you know kind

3204
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:25,920
of thing that you could do

3205
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:27,440
with these individual level parameter

3206
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:28,880
estimates incorporating both the means

3207
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,239
and the variances

3208
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:35,280
um and so uh i think this

3209
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:38,159
is this thing done

3210
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,560
okay this has got to be the last one

3211
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:45,840
but uh but um anyway

3212
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,679
uh i had there is a thing that i can i

3213
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:49,840
can if it takes too long i do have saved

3214
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:51,280
versions of this i just wanted to show

3215
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:51,679
you

3216
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:54,480
uh um i was hoping to be able to show

3217
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:56,880
you the actual model comparison part

3218
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:59,760
um but so you know as an example of

3219
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,599
using parametric empirical bays

3220
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:03,920
in this paper on substance use we did do

3221
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:05,199
this

3222
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:07,199
so in this model in this task it's

3223
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:08,320
pretty simple

3224
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:11,440
all people do is they just um repeatedly

3225
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:15,280
choose option one two or three um

3226
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:17,520
and on each one either a green ball

3227
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:18,880
falls or a red ball falls

3228
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:21,280
green all means green ball means a win

3229
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:23,599
and in advance they don't know

3230
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:26,320
which of the options has the highest

3231
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:27,920
payout probability

3232
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,840
so again it's explore exploit right so

3233
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,280
you have to kind of try out different

3234
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:32,880
ones until they become confident which

3235
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,480
one's best and they kind of keep picking

3236
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,400
it

3237
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:38,480
and in this case we were able to

3238
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:40,560
estimate a number of parameters

3239
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:43,280
we estimated action precision um we

3240
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:44,400
estimated

3241
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,400
that risk seeking parameter that i

3242
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:47,440
mentioned

3243
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:50,000
um we estimated uh separate learning

3244
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:50,639
rates

3245
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:52,960
for um when they had a win versus when

3246
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:54,159
they had a loss

3247
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:55,920
um and we're also able to estimate this

3248
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:57,840
kind of a information sensitivity

3249
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:58,800
parameter

3250
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,719
um it's probably too much to explain at

3251
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:02,080
the moment but it's kind of like a

3252
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:04,400
belief rigidity it's like an initial

3253
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,960
how uh the higher it is the less you

3254
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,159
should think you need to seek

3255
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:09,119
information

3256
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:12,239
um basically um

3257
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:14,719
and what we were able to do with that is

3258
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:16,639
um over here we did standard

3259
01:51:16,639 --> 01:51:18,400
kind of group differences and you could

3260
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,800
see that action precision was a lot

3261
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,320
lower in substance users

3262
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:25,360
and um learning rates for uh

3263
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:29,199
losses were uh lower um but we also did

3264
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:31,040
the pebb version the parametric

3265
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:32,560
empirical base version over here where

3266
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,320
we could get these group level

3267
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,480
uh effects that included the means and

3268
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:37,920
the variances

3269
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:40,400
and um and you could also see that these

3270
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:41,040
effects

3271
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:42,560
were were there and you could actually

3272
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:44,800
show like the posterior probabilities

3273
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:48,320
um and things like that um that were uh

3274
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:50,480
again it's just a it's just a kind of

3275
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:52,320
nicer thing to do that would give you

3276
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,480
um that'll give you additional be able

3277
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:55,760
you'll be able to incorporate additional

3278
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,440
information and keep things fully within

3279
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,960
a bayesian framework

3280
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:02,080
um and um and so

3281
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:07,199
if this thing is still are you done

3282
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:09,520
uh i have another question we can ask if

3283
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:10,560
you wanted to just let it run

3284
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:13,920
on this all right so just curious

3285
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:15,679
christopher said that he'll be using

3286
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:17,280
this in his phd

3287
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:20,000
so what is your phd project or i know

3288
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:20,880
it's

3289
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,400
starting the phd and everything but what

3290
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:24,320
are you thinking about using it um

3291
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,520
that's the first question and then

3292
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,679
there'll be a follow-up part

3293
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:31,920
um so i work in alex wolgar's lab

3294
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:35,520
who's a pi at the mrc cognition brain

3295
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:36,960
sciences unit and her lab studies

3296
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:38,880
cognitive control

3297
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:42,159
so i'm planning on doing a lot of work

3298
01:52:42,159 --> 01:52:43,280
on cognitive control

3299
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:46,480
um at the moment the

3300
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,400
so i don't really want to say too much

3301
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:49,760
about what projects i have

3302
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,679
yeah most because just what questions

3303
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:53,119
are you curious about or what

3304
01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:54,800
do you think are exciting so mostly i'm

3305
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,400
really curious about using

3306
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,400
or using active inference to help us

3307
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,400
think about

3308
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:03,840
and formalize some otherwise kind of

3309
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:06,719
less formal hypotheses in the realm of

3310
01:53:06,719 --> 01:53:07,920
cognitive control

3311
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:09,840
and then using those kind of generate

3312
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,360
some testable predictions

3313
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:14,080
um cool although yeah one thing i should

3314
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:14,800
say is like

3315
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,159
i don't think the active inference is

3316
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:17,760
always the best tool to answer all

3317
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:20,159
questions you might have

3318
01:53:20,159 --> 01:53:21,599
depends on what level of analysis you're

3319
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:22,800
working at i happen to be really

3320
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,159
interested in like algorithmic level

3321
01:53:24,159 --> 01:53:25,440
questions where active inference is

3322
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:26,719
really good

3323
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:27,599
um if you're interested in

3324
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:28,800
implementation level stuff this might

3325
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,560
not be the best tool for you

3326
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:32,560
great and so the second part of the

3327
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:34,400
question was are there any

3328
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:37,280
fep or active oriented supervisors at

3329
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,480
cambridge but

3330
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,400
if there's yes or no that one but more

3331
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,000
generally i'd like to hear both of your

3332
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,280
perspectives on like

3333
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,119
let's say somebody were starting

3334
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:47,199
research as a graduate student

3335
01:53:47,199 --> 01:53:51,199
in a lab that wasn't in this actual

3336
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:53,040
line of research already so what would

3337
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:54,639
you convey to a starting grad

3338
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:57,040
student or starting researcher who was

3339
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,880
looking for a phd mentor

3340
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,800
or who wanted to do a research program

3341
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,320
that was like aligned with a lab that

3342
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,000
was studying something cool

3343
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,679
and interesting but they wanted to take

3344
01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:08,880
an active inference perspective on it

3345
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:10,719
um okay just so just so people know it

3346
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:12,480
is now done yeah

3347
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:14,320
yeah but but go ahead if you want to

3348
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,320
answer that question quickly

3349
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,320
um i was just gonna say i have a couple

3350
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:19,679
things to say i think it just depends on

3351
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:21,520
your personality really

3352
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:24,159
uh are you the type of person who

3353
01:54:24,159 --> 01:54:25,760
doesn't mind doing a lot of things

3354
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:27,760
alone and without much help in which

3355
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:29,840
case you can do something

3356
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,360
that you or other members of your group

3357
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:32,480
aren't doing if that doesn't bother you

3358
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:33,440
then go ahead

3359
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:36,960
this tutorial is a great resource um

3360
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:39,760
if you are working in a lab i i would

3361
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,360
genuinely just try and find a lab that

3362
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:42,719
studies what you're interested in

3363
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:44,080
that's probably the good advice i mean

3364
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:46,400
so one thing to say is like ryan is

3365
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,159
i haven't signed the paperwork yet but

3366
01:54:48,159 --> 01:54:50,320
um he's going to be my associate

3367
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:51,360
supervisor

3368
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:54,400
so i do have someone in my like

3369
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:56,000
supervision group who can actually help

3370
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,599
me with this stuff and so i would always

3371
01:54:57,599 --> 01:54:59,040
say make sure whatever you're doing you

3372
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:01,520
actually have people who can help you

3373
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:02,960
great point and i wonder if in the

3374
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:04,560
remote world

3375
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:07,119
it will be easier to say i i remember it

3376
01:55:07,119 --> 01:55:08,719
was kind of a big thing to have

3377
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:10,080
i didn't even have this but like

3378
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:11,360
somebody who's a committee member from

3379
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:12,000
another

3380
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,920
university so now it might be a little

3381
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:16,320
bit more possible to connect remotely

3382
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:16,800
anyways

3383
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,000
ryan i'd be curious to hear your

3384
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,280
thoughts on that and then we can go back

3385
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:21,440
to the model

3386
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:24,560
um sorry i don't think i fully uh just

3387
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:25,440
suggestion

3388
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,360
a a starting researcher somebody who

3389
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,520
asked to be in your lab but they were

3390
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:30,960
you know there's not room for them in

3391
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,719
your lab or they're in a different lab

3392
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:33,280
already

3393
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:35,599
but they want to do something with

3394
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:36,560
research

3395
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:39,199
in this area oh i say i see yeah i mean

3396
01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:40,639
so that's a very tricky question

3397
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:42,159
i think i mean when you're deciding

3398
01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:43,760
where to go to grad school

3399
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:46,239
i think it's really really important

3400
01:55:46,239 --> 01:55:46,800
that

3401
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,480
you find somebody and that you're

3402
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:50,080
confident you found somebody

3403
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:53,040
um where you uh was a good match between

3404
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:53,679
you and your

3405
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:55,840
and your supervisor um you know i've

3406
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:57,520
seen cases where people

3407
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:00,080
start in labs and it's just a not a good

3408
01:56:00,080 --> 01:56:02,639
match between your supervisor's style

3409
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:06,080
and your own style as a student um and

3410
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:08,000
you know a lot of times that's a recipe

3411
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,080
for either a really tough time getting

3412
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:11,920
through grad school or even deciding

3413
01:56:11,920 --> 01:56:13,040
that maybe you don't want to be in

3414
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,199
science anymore um i've seen

3415
01:56:15,199 --> 01:56:17,280
i've seen that personally you know like

3416
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,719
the case with other people whereas if

3417
01:56:18,719 --> 01:56:20,239
you find somebody who

3418
01:56:20,239 --> 01:56:21,840
you know kind of matches your style

3419
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:23,280
right in terms of like

3420
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:25,119
how much direct micro management

3421
01:56:25,119 --> 01:56:26,560
supervision you want versus how much

3422
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:28,239
independence you want

3423
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:30,239
you know like having a supervisor that

3424
01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:31,679
really allows you to be creative and

3425
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:33,199
come up with your own projects versus

3426
01:56:33,199 --> 01:56:34,159
someone who

3427
01:56:34,159 --> 01:56:35,199
you know would prefer that you're

3428
01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:36,560
working a lot a lot of stuff that's sort

3429
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:37,520
of directly

3430
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:40,159
um sort of more narrowly in line with

3431
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:42,159
what the lab's already doing

3432
01:56:42,159 --> 01:56:44,239
um you know i mean all sorts of

3433
01:56:44,239 --> 01:56:45,199
supervisors

3434
01:56:45,199 --> 01:56:49,678
will have will have

3435
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:52,560
you know types of grad students that

3436
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:53,679
work well with them but

3437
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:55,440
finding the right matches is really

3438
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,280
really important

3439
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:59,280
and part of that you know does also

3440
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:00,960
correspond to common interests

3441
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:03,840
um i mean if the question is you know i

3442
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:06,000
absolutely cannot find somebody

3443
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,719
who does what i want to do that is

3444
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:10,800
really tough um

3445
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:13,199
um but i would say in that case uh you

3446
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:15,440
know what you were mentioning about um

3447
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:18,000
you know kind of uh remote or uh

3448
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,159
co-supervisor sorts of situations where

3449
01:57:20,159 --> 01:57:21,679
as long as you can get

3450
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:23,920
your primary supervisor who's a decent

3451
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:25,280
match to you in general

3452
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:27,440
to be okay with you having some other

3453
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:28,480
supervisor

3454
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:30,960
um or mentor of some sort that will do

3455
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:31,840
the sort of thing

3456
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:33,040
that you want to be doing

3457
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:35,360
methodologically and there's enough kind

3458
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,440
of overlapping interest between

3459
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,040
real you know primary mentor and

3460
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:41,360
co-mentor then i think that can work

3461
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:42,000
well

3462
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,199
um you know in those cases but um but

3463
01:57:45,199 --> 01:57:47,119
if at all possible identifying a primary

3464
01:57:47,119 --> 01:57:48,480
supervisor who does that

3465
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,719
the methods and is associated and has

3466
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:52,239
the same interests um

3467
01:57:52,239 --> 01:57:54,480
is you know definitely the best option

3468
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:56,159
if you can

3469
01:57:56,159 --> 01:57:59,520
um great advice but um

3470
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:02,400
okay so all right so this is now done so

3471
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:03,920
you can actually see what the script

3472
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:06,560
does once it's done um

3473
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:08,719
so you can see so what it will spit out

3474
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:09,599
um

3475
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:11,360
i i should say this is also a new

3476
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:13,440
feature i just added this

3477
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:16,320
to the uh to the to the tutorial script

3478
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:18,639
to this main tutorial script so

3479
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:20,400
if you go to the github and download the

3480
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:22,000
newest version then it will generate

3481
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:22,800
these

3482
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:25,840
these uh scatter plots for you um but

3483
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,719
um so it will show you for instance so

3484
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:31,199
when we only did 16 trials right

3485
01:58:31,199 --> 01:58:33,440
then recoverability for learning rate

3486
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:35,199
for the three parameter model wasn't

3487
01:58:35,199 --> 01:58:37,599
awesome right the correlation between

3488
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:38,960
true and uh

3489
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:42,800
estimated parameters was only 0.58

3490
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:45,760
whereas for risk seeking the correlation

3491
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:48,480
was 0.95 so super recoverable

3492
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:52,080
and for alpha it was um

3493
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:53,920
i don't know it's not showing up but it

3494
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:55,599
was 0.42 so not

3495
01:58:55,599 --> 01:58:58,400
great um whereas for the two parameter

3496
01:58:58,400 --> 01:58:58,800
model

3497
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,880
risk seeking was 0.95 and alpha

3498
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:06,880
was 0.94 so i should say

3499
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:08,960
depending on the values the r and p

3500
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:10,239
values might not show up on those graphs

3501
01:59:10,239 --> 01:59:11,840
so i have it set up but it will print

3502
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:12,960
them out for you here

3503
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:15,440
so alpha recoverability 0.94 p equals

3504
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:17,119
.046 etcetera

3505
01:59:17,119 --> 01:59:18,960
so it will give you all of that it'll

3506
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:21,199
just spit that out for you

3507
01:59:21,199 --> 01:59:24,239
it will also tell you the average log

3508
01:59:24,239 --> 01:59:25,280
likelihood

3509
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:27,199
under the two parameter model and the

3510
01:59:27,199 --> 01:59:28,800
average

3511
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:32,000
action probabilities um of the two

3512
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,440
parameter model and the same thing for

3513
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:34,400
the three

3514
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:37,440
so the fits are actually very similar

3515
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:40,239
in terms of the log likelihoods and the

3516
01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:40,880
um

3517
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:44,400
action probabilities and so

3518
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:46,400
when you actually calculate the

3519
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:48,320
protected exceedance probability

3520
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:52,239
which it also will do for you pxp um

3521
01:59:52,239 --> 01:59:55,119
it will show that the um in this case

3522
01:59:55,119 --> 01:59:56,080
the um

3523
01:59:56,080 --> 01:59:58,159
the second model so the model with

3524
01:59:58,159 --> 01:59:59,760
learning has a

3525
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:02,639
uh has a higher exceedance probability

3526
02:00:02,639 --> 02:00:04,239
than the first model

3527
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:07,040
but this is actually not necessarily a

3528
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:08,639
very clear winner here i mean what

3529
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:10,000
you're hoping for is

3530
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,080
something like one and zero or you know

3531
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:13,840
point point eight point two point nine

3532
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:14,400
point one

3533
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:18,159
something like that um so um

3534
02:00:18,159 --> 02:00:20,320
and again this is just an example this

3535
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:22,000
is not going to be reliable at all

3536
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:22,719
because i did

3537
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:24,960
16 trials right you know if you did a

3538
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:27,280
real task if you just use the 32 trials

3539
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:28,560
that i actually have in the

3540
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:32,320
in the real code on the github um

3541
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:34,960
it will be better than this but you know

3542
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:35,360
most

3543
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:38,480
actual behavioral tasks you know like

3544
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:40,000
for computational modeling studies are

3545
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:40,960
going to have

3546
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:44,639
you know like 100 you know or more

3547
02:00:44,639 --> 02:00:47,119
trials um to really get kind of precise

3548
02:00:47,119 --> 02:00:48,639
estimates and and know how good these

3549
02:00:48,639 --> 02:00:50,400
models are actually doing

3550
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:54,320
um so but um so

3551
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:56,639
so that's the kind of thing that you get

3552
02:00:56,639 --> 02:00:58,400
here at the end so you'll get

3553
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:00,159
so i should say this trajectory thing is

3554
02:01:00,159 --> 02:01:01,520
not that meaningful it's just showing

3555
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:03,119
for the first and second parameter what

3556
02:01:03,119 --> 02:01:04,719
the trajectory of the change in the

3557
02:01:04,719 --> 02:01:06,000
parameters are

3558
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,920
as it converges toward the posterior

3559
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:09,679
values but when you have more than

3560
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:11,679
two parameters it's not that informative

3561
02:01:11,679 --> 02:01:13,920
um so

3562
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:17,520
so um you know we have in the paper

3563
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:18,960
you know we have this figure that more

3564
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:20,719
or less just kind of depicts

3565
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:22,159
an example of what this kind of thing

3566
02:01:22,159 --> 02:01:24,000
looks like um

3567
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,560
and more or less as long as this kind of

3568
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:28,480
you know iterations converge and has

3569
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:30,400
this kind of nice increasing

3570
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:32,719
slopey thing to it then you're probably

3571
02:01:32,719 --> 02:01:34,560
fine but if you're doing this

3572
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:37,440
and you find that through iterations it

3573
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:38,960
kind of bounces up and then bounces way

3574
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:40,639
back down and then bounces up and it

3575
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:42,239
looks really kind of inconsistent does

3576
02:01:42,239 --> 02:01:43,840
have this nice kind of

3577
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:46,800
slope to convergence that's usually a

3578
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:48,400
telltale sign that you're running into

3579
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:50,239
some local minima or you know

3580
02:01:50,239 --> 02:01:52,960
something's going wrong um in which case

3581
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:54,480
you might want to like tweak your priors

3582
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:56,000
and see if it works better or you might

3583
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:56,880
that might tell you there's just

3584
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:58,400
something wrong with your model

3585
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:01,119
um so it's a good kind of diagnostic i i

3586
02:02:01,119 --> 02:02:01,679
just

3587
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:03,599
would love to hear like sometimes it's

3588
02:02:03,599 --> 02:02:05,440
hard to grasp

3589
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:08,239
how can it be converging downhill like

3590
02:02:08,239 --> 02:02:08,639
you

3591
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:10,239
like when we were talking earlier about

3592
02:02:10,239 --> 02:02:11,599
the difference between sampling based

3593
02:02:11,599 --> 02:02:13,520
methods and the factorized methods

3594
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:14,800
so there's obviously a world of

3595
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:16,080
difference in the setup and in the

3596
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:17,119
computation

3597
02:02:17,119 --> 02:02:19,440
but like how is it that just doing

3598
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:21,280
something like minimizing free energy

3599
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:21,679
does

3600
02:02:21,679 --> 02:02:24,320
take us to these acceptable parameter

3601
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:24,800
ranges

3602
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:27,040
if there's any sense that you have of

3603
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:30,400
working so closely with it

3604
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:34,000
um like what is it that that's what is

3605
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,560
it about that accumulating bars

3606
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:39,599
that leads us you know inevitably

3607
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:42,639
seemingly at least

3608
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:44,960
reasonably to an acceptable set of

3609
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:46,080
parameters in a vast

3610
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:49,280
space what is actually happening there

3611
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:50,960
that somehow it doesn't converge into a

3612
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:52,000
local minima

3613
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,480
or you know which way you go it doesn't

3614
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:57,440
converge in a local solution set

3615
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:59,040
oh there's no there's no guarantee that

3616
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:01,040
it doesn't do that

3617
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:02,719
usually this could easily converge into

3618
02:03:02,719 --> 02:03:04,400
a local minimum that's not the global

3619
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:05,440
minimum

3620
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:07,599
um you know i mean all this is literally

3621
02:03:07,599 --> 02:03:08,880
all this is saying is that there's a

3622
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:09,280
kind of

3623
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:13,040
smooth you know like locally convex

3624
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:15,280
right like gradient descent towards some

3625
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:16,800
stable value

3626
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:18,960
um but no i mean that could totally be a

3627
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:20,800
local minimum there's nothing that that

3628
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:22,400
stops it from being that it just means

3629
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:23,440
that there's a kind of

3630
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:25,280
clear slope it's not like a super kind

3631
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:26,719
of like bumpy

3632
02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:29,440
weird you know parameter landscape but

3633
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:31,520
then that we need to inject some layer

3634
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:34,639
of sampling first with many starting

3635
02:03:34,639 --> 02:03:35,280
positions

3636
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:38,960
in order to to get good meta conversions

3637
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:39,679
because

3638
02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:42,080
it's not enough to look at one model

3639
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:43,040
trace

3640
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:44,880
and say like yep well this one converged

3641
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:46,800
that model converged somewhere

3642
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:49,679
and it settled in given a very complex

3643
02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:50,480
free energy

3644
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:52,800
function but then we need to pull back

3645
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:53,840
another level

3646
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:56,320
right to get traces from many points in

3647
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:58,719
the landscape

3648
02:03:58,719 --> 02:04:00,719
um well i mean that's just a that's just

3649
02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:02,560
another approach that is a potential

3650
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:05,679
you know like not you know like trying

3651
02:04:05,679 --> 02:04:06,000
to

3652
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,360
not testing out a bunch of different

3653
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:08,880
prior values and seeing if everything

3654
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:10,079
converges from a bunch of different

3655
02:04:10,079 --> 02:04:12,159
prior values to the same spot

3656
02:04:12,159 --> 02:04:14,639
um like yes it is a limitation because

3657
02:04:14,639 --> 02:04:16,639
this could represent a local minimum

3658
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:20,800
but if it if it um stably converges

3659
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:24,480
on um like different

3660
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:27,040
reliable you know parameter estimates

3661
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:28,000
for each person

3662
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,440
you know which which corresponds to a

3663
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:31,520
range of places in a landscape

3664
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:34,800
then um then like those will be

3665
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:36,719
stable individual differences you'll

3666
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:38,480
probably get slightly different values

3667
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:39,840
if you start your priors at a different

3668
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:40,880
place

3669
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:42,719
almost inevitably because the complexity

3670
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:44,320
cost will be less if you don't have to

3671
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:45,679
move as far

3672
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:49,280
to find accurate parameters

3673
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,679
but so long as you're getting

3674
02:04:51,679 --> 02:04:53,440
interesting variability and convergence

3675
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:54,560
for each person

3676
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:56,480
has a nice kind of slope like this then

3677
02:04:56,480 --> 02:04:58,800
um it's not like everybody

3678
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:01,360
is is getting stuck in some particular

3679
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:02,960
um you know single

3680
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:06,000
well or attractor of some kind um

3681
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,079
but again the question isn't necessarily

3682
02:05:08,079 --> 02:05:10,079
what the true one is per se it's

3683
02:05:10,079 --> 02:05:12,320
you know like can you find estimates

3684
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:14,079
that you know provide

3685
02:05:14,079 --> 02:05:16,159
interesting individual differences given

3686
02:05:16,159 --> 02:05:17,679
a set of priors

3687
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:19,599
um you know i mean it's it's it's

3688
02:05:19,599 --> 02:05:21,040
important to realize too and we

3689
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:21,599
mentioned

3690
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:24,079
mentioned this in the paper that um you

3691
02:05:24,079 --> 02:05:25,199
know typically

3692
02:05:25,199 --> 02:05:27,520
the model the model that will win the

3693
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:29,119
model though have the best parameter

3694
02:05:29,119 --> 02:05:29,840
estimates

3695
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:32,079
will typically be simpler than whatever

3696
02:05:32,079 --> 02:05:34,000
the true underlying generative process

3697
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,360
was in the person that generated the

3698
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,199
data because typically there are simpler

3699
02:05:37,199 --> 02:05:38,560
explanations

3700
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:41,440
um than the ones that generate the ones

3701
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:43,360
that actually generate

3702
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:45,520
data in a complicated system like the

3703
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:46,880
brain

3704
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:49,440
you know so so you're not necessarily

3705
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:50,639
treating this as though it's

3706
02:05:50,639 --> 02:05:53,360
the true one but if it gives you nice

3707
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:54,800
convergence for each person

3708
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:56,480
and you're getting nice individual

3709
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:58,719
differences then it still is a it still

3710
02:05:58,719 --> 02:06:00,320
is a reasonable measure

3711
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:03,040
of you know of individual of interesting

3712
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:04,639
individual differences

3713
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:07,440
um and if you can simultaneously do

3714
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:08,639
things like

3715
02:06:08,639 --> 02:06:11,199
show that parameters parameter estimates

3716
02:06:11,199 --> 02:06:13,760
correlate with other things like um

3717
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:16,079
so just you know i happen to have it up

3718
02:06:16,079 --> 02:06:17,760
um

3719
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:20,800
you know so this is this you know eeg

3720
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:24,159
ceg study that uh i'm uh in the process

3721
02:06:24,159 --> 02:06:26,079
of putting a paper together before

3722
02:06:26,079 --> 02:06:29,199
and we have parameter estimates here um

3723
02:06:29,199 --> 02:06:32,320
for intraoceptive precision um in that

3724
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:33,520
gastrointestinal task

3725
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:36,320
task i mentioned now precision here

3726
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:38,480
correlates with reaction times

3727
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:41,199
negative point point negative 0.74

3728
02:06:41,199 --> 02:06:43,199
despite the fact that the model is not

3729
02:06:43,199 --> 02:06:44,880
fit to reaction times

3730
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:46,800
um and it's a direct prediction of the

3731
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:48,320
neural process theory

3732
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:50,320
that as interrupts you know higher

3733
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:51,599
interceptive precision

3734
02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:53,520
should mean faster evidence accumulation

3735
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:54,639
which should mean

3736
02:06:54,639 --> 02:06:56,239
faster convergence time which should

3737
02:06:56,239 --> 02:06:58,800
mean shorter reaction times

3738
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:01,840
right so you know if you have you know

3739
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:03,520
so you can separately validate that your

3740
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:04,960
parameter estimates are tracking what

3741
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:06,239
you want them to be

3742
02:07:06,239 --> 02:07:08,960
by seeing what they correlate with um

3743
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:09,360
you know

3744
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:10,480
in a way that they ought to correlate

3745
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:12,400
with for construct validity for things

3746
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:14,400
that didn't get fed into the model

3747
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:16,000
um you know so there's there's lots of

3748
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,159
ways of doing this um

3749
02:07:18,159 --> 02:07:20,880
um but but you're right i mean if you

3750
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:22,639
using other approaches that use multiple

3751
02:07:22,639 --> 02:07:24,320
seeds the kind of like the monte carlo

3752
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:26,480
stuff that you were talking about before

3753
02:07:26,480 --> 02:07:29,520
that is another approach and um you

3754
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:31,199
might be more likely to

3755
02:07:31,199 --> 02:07:34,719
um you know find like a global

3756
02:07:34,719 --> 02:07:37,920
minimum um but uh but again they're just

3757
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:39,360
they're just different approaches

3758
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:41,360
there's just a quick plug so i think the

3759
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:42,880
model that's kind of most closely

3760
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:44,639
related to active inference and is

3761
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:46,320
actually fittable

3762
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:48,239
fitted can be fitted to data is probably

3763
02:07:48,239 --> 02:07:50,800
the hierarchical gaussian filter

3764
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:53,679
um and i think they're actually gen at

3765
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:54,079
the moment

3766
02:07:54,079 --> 02:07:55,520
it's estimated the parameters of the

3767
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:57,840
rest made they're using variational base

3768
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:59,679
but as i understand that they're also i

3769
02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:01,199
don't know if they have developed it or

3770
02:08:01,199 --> 02:08:02,560
are still developing

3771
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:04,239
but they're also developing monte carlo

3772
02:08:04,239 --> 02:08:07,199
markov chain version

3773
02:08:07,199 --> 02:08:12,079
um very exciting yeah this is all just

3774
02:08:12,079 --> 02:08:15,679
yeah so so okay so last thing here

3775
02:08:15,679 --> 02:08:19,360
just uh just to um to you know to kind

3776
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:19,679
of

3777
02:08:19,679 --> 02:08:21,440
you know wrap up everything so at least

3778
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:22,800
people know

3779
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:25,520
what um know what's available you know

3780
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:26,880
for them to kind of expand on this in

3781
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:28,639
our example code that we've

3782
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:32,639
um you know set up is um

3783
02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:36,719
so down here uh when we actually do the

3784
02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:39,760
um where is this

3785
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:44,079
uh so this this right here

3786
02:08:44,079 --> 02:08:46,320
is the function for doing model

3787
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:47,119
comparison

3788
02:08:47,119 --> 02:08:49,920
so spm underscore bms bayesian model

3789
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:50,960
selection

3790
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:53,760
you just feed in the free energies for

3791
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:54,560
each person

3792
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:58,239
so for instance if you um

3793
02:08:58,239 --> 02:09:01,839
you know if i just uh

3794
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:05,040
if i so i just it will just store these

3795
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:06,159
right so for instance

3796
02:09:06,159 --> 02:09:10,239
four um so these

3797
02:09:10,239 --> 02:09:13,360
are the negative free energies for

3798
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:16,639
um my six simulated people for their

3799
02:09:16,639 --> 02:09:18,000
best fit models

3800
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,320
um best fit parameters uh for the two

3801
02:09:20,320 --> 02:09:21,760
parameter model

3802
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:25,360
whereas that's it for the three

3803
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:26,800
parameter model

3804
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:29,920
and um and so

3805
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:32,960
bayesian model comparison is just

3806
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:36,079
um just feeding you just feeding both of

3807
02:09:36,079 --> 02:09:36,960
those vectors

3808
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:40,480
into column vectors into that function

3809
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:43,920
and it will spit out the expect expected

3810
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:45,760
or predicted exceedance probability for

3811
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:47,280
you as well as a number of other sort of

3812
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:49,440
diagnostic checks and you can um

3813
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:52,159
read uh there's good papers um like

3814
02:09:52,159 --> 02:09:53,119
class stuff on

3815
02:09:53,119 --> 02:09:55,679
and um anyway we we reference them and

3816
02:09:55,679 --> 02:09:57,280
they we cite them in the paper

3817
02:09:57,280 --> 02:10:00,560
that describe this in detail if you go

3818
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:01,040
into

3819
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:03,840
the actual uh you know function itself

3820
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:04,800
it also

3821
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:06,239
will tell you exactly what the inputs

3822
02:10:06,239 --> 02:10:08,960
are and exactly what the outputs

3823
02:10:08,960 --> 02:10:10,719
mean right so alpha is just a vector of

3824
02:10:10,719 --> 02:10:12,719
the model probabilities

3825
02:10:12,719 --> 02:10:14,880
again xp is the exceedance probabilities

3826
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:16,159
before doing the

3827
02:10:16,159 --> 02:10:19,440
protected part and so forth

3828
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:24,079
so once that's all done

3829
02:10:24,079 --> 02:10:25,280
and i should say i'm not going through

3830
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:27,360
every kind of line in this but

3831
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:30,159
we commented it you know as well as we

3832
02:10:30,159 --> 02:10:31,440
could and we hope it's

3833
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:33,040
we hope it's clear as you go through you

3834
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:35,040
know what we're doing um but it also

3835
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:36,320
will spit out

3836
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:39,199
right cleanly into the into you know the

3837
02:10:39,199 --> 02:10:39,599
main

3838
02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:42,400
uh terminal here what uh you know what

3839
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:43,599
the outputs are

3840
02:10:43,599 --> 02:10:45,920
um so if you wanna you can kind of

3841
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:46,800
hopefully adapt

3842
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:48,800
this code for your own purposes to do

3843
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:50,400
recoverability and

3844
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:52,400
um do model estimation and stuff like

3845
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:55,040
that um

3846
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:58,159
but once you've done that um

3847
02:10:58,159 --> 02:11:00,719
then you can do i was just going to show

3848
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:01,840
you briefly

3849
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:05,360
the um the hierarchical base the

3850
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:08,639
peb um stuff and for that we put things

3851
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:09,280
into

3852
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:12,719
these gcm structures so gcm for model 2

3853
02:11:12,719 --> 02:11:14,639
gcm for model 3

3854
02:11:14,639 --> 02:11:18,320
and you can just pick which one

3855
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:22,000
here that you want that you want to use

3856
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,079
right whether you want to do peb on the

3857
02:11:24,079 --> 02:11:25,760
two parameter model outputs or the three

3858
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:27,599
parameter model outputs

3859
02:11:27,599 --> 02:11:31,440
um and this just sets a bunch of

3860
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:34,000
defaults in peb you shouldn't have to

3861
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:37,040
mess with any of those

3862
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:40,159
but if you but if you run it so i've so

3863
02:11:40,159 --> 02:11:42,000
what i've done is in the glm and the

3864
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,840
general linear model for peb

3865
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:45,840
i've just set the mean value across

3866
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:47,599
subjects i've put a

3867
02:11:47,599 --> 02:11:50,000
uh regressor for group so this is saying

3868
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,360
compare groups

3869
02:11:51,360 --> 02:11:53,920
um and then i've put in this sort of

3870
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:55,199
fake age variable

3871
02:11:55,199 --> 02:11:58,480
just with random numbers basically so

3872
02:11:58,480 --> 02:12:00,880
if i run this section on the three

3873
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:03,040
parameter model

3874
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:05,599
then i'll get you know it'll do this

3875
02:12:05,599 --> 02:12:07,440
kind of estimation thing

3876
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:11,199
and it will spit out a bunch of things

3877
02:12:11,199 --> 02:12:15,280
um and basically the way

3878
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:19,119
to read this is um

3879
02:12:19,119 --> 02:12:22,480
ignore that so this one just ignore

3880
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:24,960
uh when it spits it out this one will

3881
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:26,079
tell you

3882
02:12:26,079 --> 02:12:29,520
um for instance this is saying like four

3883
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:31,679
uh so this one is probably the best one

3884
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:34,000
um so these are the reduced models

3885
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:37,199
so the best model um removing the

3886
02:12:37,199 --> 02:12:38,000
parameters

3887
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:41,840
uh parameter differences that um didn't

3888
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:43,360
matter didn't win in bayesian model

3889
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:45,280
comparison um so this is saying

3890
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:48,639
parameter two and parameter three

3891
02:12:48,639 --> 02:12:51,840
were different between groups

3892
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:53,679
and were and remain different between

3893
02:12:53,679 --> 02:12:56,800
groups and the best fit model

3894
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:59,280
and again we we explained this all in

3895
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:00,639
more detail in the paper

3896
02:13:00,639 --> 02:13:03,199
you can really ignore these ones at the

3897
02:13:03,199 --> 02:13:04,480
bottom

3898
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:07,280
in the in the figure uh in the paper we

3899
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:07,920
show you

3900
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:11,199
which ones are um which ones matter

3901
02:13:11,199 --> 02:13:13,920
to look at such as these more or less

3902
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:15,119
those top three

3903
02:13:15,119 --> 02:13:17,679
so the you know the estimated

3904
02:13:17,679 --> 02:13:19,040
differences and the estimated

3905
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:20,400
differences that survive model

3906
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:21,119
comparison

3907
02:13:21,119 --> 02:13:23,360
so kind of pruning away the parameters

3908
02:13:23,360 --> 02:13:25,040
that don't stick around in the best bit

3909
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:26,159
model

3910
02:13:26,159 --> 02:13:28,159
um so in this one this is just gonna say

3911
02:13:28,159 --> 02:13:29,679
what the pink bars are

3912
02:13:29,679 --> 02:13:31,840
because to me it wasn't immediately that

3913
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:33,520
they're the they're just the variances

3914
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:34,560
they're just the variances and the

3915
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:38,320
posterior estimates um

3916
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:42,239
um so so uh so yeah so i mean for

3917
02:13:42,239 --> 02:13:42,800
instance

3918
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:44,239
so you'd expect right this one has a

3919
02:13:44,239 --> 02:13:45,760
really high variance you you might

3920
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:48,079
expect this one wouldn't survive

3921
02:13:48,079 --> 02:13:50,000
um you know as a winner in the in the

3922
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
reduced model um

3923
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,360
but even even this isn't probably the

3924
02:13:55,360 --> 02:13:55,920
most

3925
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:59,119
useful the most useful um is the actual

3926
02:13:59,119 --> 02:14:01,199
like peb review parameter

3927
02:14:01,199 --> 02:14:05,040
gui um see so this is the actual

3928
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:07,599
glm so this is just saying the mean the

3929
02:14:07,599 --> 02:14:09,280
group difference so this grape light

3930
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:11,040
gray versus dark gray because the first

3931
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:12,079
three subjects are a group

3932
02:14:12,079 --> 02:14:13,840
second three are a group this third

3933
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:15,520
column is just the randomly generated

3934
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:16,960
age values

3935
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:20,159
um so you can just say for instance

3936
02:14:20,159 --> 02:14:21,520
you know which of these which of the

3937
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:23,119
means are different well the means for

3938
02:14:23,119 --> 02:14:24,800
one and two are different

3939
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:26,800
um you know so there's a main effects

3940
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:28,480
essentially of those two

3941
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:31,920
um you could go to group and

3942
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:33,599
you could say okay these are the two

3943
02:14:33,599 --> 02:14:35,280
that are different

3944
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:37,199
but you can put a threshold on it right

3945
02:14:37,199 --> 02:14:39,679
so weak evidence you know posterior

3946
02:14:39,679 --> 02:14:41,440
probability has to be above

3947
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:43,440
you know some ever some value for

3948
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:44,960
positive evidence

3949
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:47,440
right so if i make it if i give it a

3950
02:14:47,440 --> 02:14:49,440
higher it has to there has to be decent

3951
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:51,760
evidence for it then only the second

3952
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:54,639
parameter here is the one that actually

3953
02:14:54,639 --> 02:14:56,880
has good evidence for a group difference

3954
02:14:56,880 --> 02:15:00,960
um you know for example so you can

3955
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:02,960
you know but if i make it required to

3956
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:05,119
have very strong evidence

3957
02:15:05,119 --> 02:15:06,639
so posterior probability greater than

3958
02:15:06,639 --> 02:15:09,920
0.99 then the whole thing gets removed

3959
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:13,440
um so so this is a nice and you can you

3960
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:15,040
know just do it in terms of free energy

3961
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:17,040
or just in terms of

3962
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:19,599
probability that a parameter is greater

3963
02:15:19,599 --> 02:15:20,880
than zero

3964
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:22,400
you know so there's different ways to uh

3965
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:24,400
different ways to do it but so this is

3966
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:26,000
actually probably the nicest thing for

3967
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,679
navigating

3968
02:15:27,679 --> 02:15:30,320
the the results of peb that will matter

3969
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:32,560
if you're doing group analyses using it

3970
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:36,239
um so

3971
02:15:36,239 --> 02:15:39,280
um so that um so that is

3972
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:43,040
pebb um and um yeah i'm trying to think

3973
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:44,560
if there's

3974
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:48,400
anything um anything else really

3975
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:49,760
um because that's i mean that's

3976
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:51,760
primarily where where things end so i

3977
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:53,760
mean at that point you should be able to

3978
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:57,840
um should be able to do

3979
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:01,840
everything um i guess the

3980
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:03,599
yeah i mean i was gonna briefly i did

3981
02:16:03,599 --> 02:16:05,599
skip over this just the

3982
02:16:05,599 --> 02:16:06,880
this was the thing i mentioned that

3983
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:09,360
philip um did where he was able to

3984
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:12,159
do kind of like within trial by trial um

3985
02:16:12,159 --> 02:16:13,599
model predictions as opposed to these

3986
02:16:13,599 --> 02:16:14,960
just group differences and show the

3987
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:16,320
trial by trial the

3988
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:18,719
beta updates um correlated with this

3989
02:16:18,719 --> 02:16:19,599
midbrain

3990
02:16:19,599 --> 02:16:23,920
dopamine area but um but yeah i mean

3991
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:26,880
really i mean that's more or less um the

3992
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:28,079
steps you need to know

3993
02:16:28,079 --> 02:16:30,960
right so so what we talked about was you

3994
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:32,000
have to have participants

3995
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,840
perform the task you build one or more

3996
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:35,519
models we did two

3997
02:16:35,519 --> 02:16:37,040
find the parameter values in each model

3998
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:39,359
to best reproduce uh the data

3999
02:16:39,359 --> 02:16:41,200
right the behavior we did that we did

4000
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:42,879
model comparison

4001
02:16:42,879 --> 02:16:44,558
we used the correlations between true

4002
02:16:44,558 --> 02:16:46,080
and generative parameter are

4003
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:48,398
generated in generative and estimated

4004
02:16:48,398 --> 02:16:49,679
parameters

4005
02:16:49,679 --> 02:16:51,120
to make sure the winning model was

4006
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:52,718
identifiable

4007
02:16:52,718 --> 02:16:56,318
and then you could do either normal

4008
02:16:56,318 --> 02:16:58,318
group level frequency statistics or

4009
02:16:58,318 --> 02:17:00,000
something like pep

4010
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:03,599
to test for a between group or just

4011
02:17:03,599 --> 02:17:06,959
uh yeah group level um

4012
02:17:06,959 --> 02:17:08,240
you know between subjects sorts of

4013
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:09,920
analyses on parameters at the end of the

4014
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:10,799
day

4015
02:17:10,799 --> 02:17:15,120
um so i think i think that um

4016
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:18,000
yeah i think that really covers um most

4017
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:18,558
of the

4018
02:17:18,558 --> 02:17:20,160
you know kind of meat of it i mean the

4019
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:21,599
only oh okay

4020
02:17:21,599 --> 02:17:23,200
sorry one other thing that i do need to

4021
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:24,718
show you um

4022
02:17:24,718 --> 02:17:28,240
is that the um to actually

4023
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:31,519
do the parameter estimation um

4024
02:17:31,519 --> 02:17:36,160
that calls where is it um

4025
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:38,080
that calls this estimate parameter

4026
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:39,679
script which is one that we also

4027
02:17:39,679 --> 02:17:40,558
included

4028
02:17:40,558 --> 02:17:42,718
so if you open that just right click it

4029
02:17:42,718 --> 02:17:44,000
and say open

4030
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:47,040
um then this is where you set your prior

4031
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:48,718
means and variances

4032
02:17:48,718 --> 02:17:51,679
so here so it says here we specify prior

4033
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:53,040
expectations for parameter means and

4034
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:56,080
variances right so we say that um

4035
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:58,080
so this is where so in this case i just

4036
02:17:58,080 --> 02:17:59,599
set the same prior variance for all the

4037
02:17:59,599 --> 02:18:01,200
parameters you know one over four

4038
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:03,599
you don't have to do that but so here

4039
02:18:03,599 --> 02:18:05,040
you can think about it as the smaller

4040
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:07,040
the value you put here the greater the

4041
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:08,718
complexity penalty that you're

4042
02:18:08,718 --> 02:18:11,359
adding right so the smaller that is the

4043
02:18:11,359 --> 02:18:13,519
more you're going to prevent overfitting

4044
02:18:13,519 --> 02:18:17,599
um but if you make it too tight then

4045
02:18:17,599 --> 02:18:19,519
then the posterior estimates probably

4046
02:18:19,519 --> 02:18:22,398
won't be that accurate

4047
02:18:22,638 --> 02:18:25,760
so so in this case what you can see that

4048
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:27,120
we've done is

4049
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:29,439
um so if you're estimating alpha so

4050
02:18:29,439 --> 02:18:30,959
action precision

4051
02:18:30,959 --> 02:18:32,959
then this is where you'd put the prior

4052
02:18:32,959 --> 02:18:35,359
so we put a prior here of 16

4053
02:18:35,359 --> 02:18:38,478
um we log it here

4054
02:18:38,478 --> 02:18:40,799
i'm just so it's in log space um and

4055
02:18:40,799 --> 02:18:43,200
that just makes it so during estimation

4056
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:45,760
um it doesn't allow that number to ever

4057
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:46,638
become

4058
02:18:46,638 --> 02:18:49,120
a negative value um so it keeps it it

4059
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:50,160
needs to stay

4060
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:53,280
a positive value during estimation if if

4061
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:54,959
estimation ever tried to test out a

4062
02:18:54,959 --> 02:18:56,558
negative value for that parameter then

4063
02:18:56,558 --> 02:18:57,840
the thing would break

4064
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:01,760
um same thing if if we were doing beta

4065
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:02,718
so that would be

4066
02:19:02,718 --> 02:19:04,478
um which we didn't try here but i just

4067
02:19:04,478 --> 02:19:06,000
like we include it if you want

4068
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,638
to so this would be the policy expected

4069
02:19:08,638 --> 02:19:10,000
free energy precision

4070
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,760
so there the prior is one and again

4071
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:13,519
we're just keeping the prior variance

4072
02:19:13,519 --> 02:19:16,318
um equal to one-fourth you know up there

4073
02:19:16,318 --> 02:19:18,080
for everybody

4074
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:20,080
this is the loss of version which we

4075
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:21,359
didn't include

4076
02:19:21,359 --> 02:19:23,760
um but is in there if you want to that's

4077
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:25,359
the risk seeking parameter and we gave

4078
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:27,200
it a prior of five

4079
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:30,398
and then eta the learning rate this has

4080
02:19:30,398 --> 02:19:30,959
to be

4081
02:19:30,959 --> 02:19:32,718
not just any positive value it has to be

4082
02:19:32,718 --> 02:19:34,799
a value between 0 and 1

4083
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:36,398
which means that you have to put it into

4084
02:19:36,398 --> 02:19:39,200
logic space as opposed to log space

4085
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:40,879
and that just means that to set the

4086
02:19:40,879 --> 02:19:43,359
prior you have to make that

4087
02:19:43,359 --> 02:19:46,638
whatever your prior is and then also

4088
02:19:46,638 --> 02:19:49,760
put that same number here um so in this

4089
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:50,399
case we've

4090
02:19:50,399 --> 02:19:52,080
given it a prior for learning rate of

4091
02:19:52,080 --> 02:19:54,080
0.5 which is just kind of halfway

4092
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:55,439
between zero and one so it's just kind

4093
02:19:55,439 --> 02:19:56,399
of middle of the road

4094
02:19:56,399 --> 02:19:58,640
you know which you know would make sense

4095
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:00,240
in a lot of cases

4096
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:03,840
um and then more or less this function

4097
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:04,880
down here

4098
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:07,359
just turns those back into their normal

4099
02:20:07,359 --> 02:20:09,600
values so it exponentiates

4100
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:12,800
the um the log values

4101
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:15,520
um you know and so forth um so it just

4102
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:16,319
brings them back

4103
02:20:16,319 --> 02:20:20,160
re-transforms them um

4104
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:23,200
and uh this is just where we

4105
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:25,520
um for technical reasons this is where

4106
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:27,280
we set what the uh

4107
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:30,800
what the values are for risk seeking

4108
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:34,960
um and uh and then this is the actual

4109
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:36,000
log likelihood

4110
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:39,680
so it will just for each trial it will

4111
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:41,840
add the log likelihood so the

4112
02:20:41,840 --> 02:20:44,479
mdp.p here is the probability of each

4113
02:20:44,479 --> 02:20:45,200
action

4114
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:47,120
um that it will show that just as in the

4115
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:48,240
mdp structure

4116
02:20:48,240 --> 02:20:51,200
which again we showed last time in in

4117
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:51,520
other

4118
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:54,399
sessions and in the actual um we have a

4119
02:20:54,399 --> 02:20:55,040
table

4120
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:57,840
in the um table three i think in the

4121
02:20:57,840 --> 02:21:00,080
tutorial that says what each mdp field

4122
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:02,240
is so it just takes those and just adds

4123
02:21:02,240 --> 02:21:04,080
them just logs them and it just adds

4124
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:04,880
them

4125
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:07,439
up um across trials to get the total

4126
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:08,160
probability

4127
02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:10,160
and then the the less negative this is

4128
02:21:10,160 --> 02:21:11,439
at the end the better

4129
02:21:11,439 --> 02:21:15,680
the the um the better the the better the

4130
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:16,640
fit is

4131
02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:18,080
um so it's important to know about this

4132
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:19,680
one just because this is where you would

4133
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:21,120
change your prior means and your prior

4134
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:23,920
variances um

4135
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:27,280
so so um so yeah and then

4136
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:30,399
and then uh this for instance this dcm

4137
02:21:30,399 --> 02:21:32,319
field thing it's just set up so that

4138
02:21:32,319 --> 02:21:33,760
you would just enter the name of

4139
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:35,040
whichever parameters you want to

4140
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:36,640
estimate for that model so here if you

4141
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:38,960
put an alpha in rs it'll estimate

4142
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:41,520
alpha and rs but you could also add you

4143
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:42,479
know eta here

4144
02:21:42,479 --> 02:21:46,080
right if you wanted to you could add

4145
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:50,640
that then it would also estimate

4146
02:21:52,399 --> 02:21:53,920
anyway i mean i'm sure there's other

4147
02:21:53,920 --> 02:21:55,359
little things in the in the code here

4148
02:21:55,359 --> 02:21:56,960
that could be explained in more detail

4149
02:21:56,960 --> 02:21:57,680
but

4150
02:21:57,680 --> 02:21:59,920
um you know this this hopefully will be

4151
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:00,960
enough to to get

4152
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:05,280
people going well thanks so much

4153
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:07,120
ryan and christopher this was really an

4154
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:09,600
awesome series it was our first

4155
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:12,160
model stream and it was really just a

4156
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:13,920
great learning experience for all of us

4157
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:16,080
so i'm going to give some final comments

4158
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:17,840
from the chat so

4159
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:20,960
uh someone wrote thanks for the authors

4160
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:21,680
continuous

4161
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:23,840
updating of the paper it will be great

4162
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:25,600
if these uh slides as

4163
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:27,439
in their current version are somehow

4164
02:22:27,439 --> 02:22:29,040
made available at the end of the episode

4165
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:30,319
so maybe like you mentioned

4166
02:22:30,319 --> 02:22:32,880
doing a supplemental file or something

4167
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:33,920
for the paper

4168
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:37,920
so that was one thing

4169
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:39,760
for these just for these slides i like

4170
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:41,600
to put them maybe so someone could say

4171
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:43,200
oh that was slide 87

4172
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:45,760
at hour three of this thing and then we

4173
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:47,600
could just have this version

4174
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:49,040
so that people could know where that

4175
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:50,560
figure was because i know that they're

4176
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:52,319
probably in other places or just copied

4177
02:22:52,319 --> 02:22:53,120
over but

4178
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:56,399
that would be one is that

4179
02:22:56,479 --> 02:22:58,319
like i mean i guess i can imagine i

4180
02:22:58,319 --> 02:22:59,600
could imagine

4181
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:01,680
putting together a powerpoint that just

4182
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:04,880
kind of you know kind of concatenates

4183
02:23:04,880 --> 02:23:06,080
all of the slides that we've gone

4184
02:23:06,080 --> 02:23:08,399
through over these over these sessions

4185
02:23:08,399 --> 02:23:10,240
the vast majority of them will be

4186
02:23:10,240 --> 02:23:11,520
just the same as the figures in the

4187
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:13,359
tutorial itself

4188
02:23:13,359 --> 02:23:14,880
but the best the best i could do

4189
02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:16,399
probably is to

4190
02:23:16,399 --> 02:23:19,520
put that as a supplemental file um in

4191
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:20,080
the um

4192
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:21,840
for the supplement or the supplementary

4193
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:24,160
materials on the psy archive

4194
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:27,280
uh version um that's probably that's

4195
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:28,560
probably the only thing we could

4196
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:31,280
imagine doing we could have a first um

4197
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:32,880
page on the pdf or something that just

4198
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:35,120
says here's a link to the these streams

4199
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:37,439
as this version so that'll be one thing

4200
02:23:37,439 --> 02:23:39,120
and then a related question

4201
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:42,240
was um just that future people wanted

4202
02:23:42,240 --> 02:23:44,160
future tutorials and model streams

4203
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:47,920
so either both of you it's an open

4204
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:51,120
invitation to just come on whenever the

4205
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:51,840
time is right

4206
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:53,920
and talk about any kind of modeling or

4207
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:55,359
all these other cool ideas we've been

4208
02:23:55,359 --> 02:23:57,359
bringing up

4209
02:23:57,359 --> 02:24:00,240
so i mean i'm happy to continue this um

4210
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:01,840
you know in a more kind of

4211
02:24:01,840 --> 02:24:04,560
yeah on the fly you know way as people

4212
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:06,000
request things i mean but

4213
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,160
but at this point i mean i would i would

4214
02:24:08,160 --> 02:24:09,280
probably need

4215
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:12,479
um or we would probably need um any kind

4216
02:24:12,479 --> 02:24:13,439
of requests

4217
02:24:13,439 --> 02:24:15,040
right like what is it that people want

4218
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:16,240
to cover because i mean now we've kind

4219
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:17,120
of gone through

4220
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:18,720
the tutorial start to finish at least in

4221
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:20,240
broad strokes

4222
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:23,120
um so i would need to know at that point

4223
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:23,840
what

4224
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:25,359
you know from now forward i need to know

4225
02:24:25,359 --> 02:24:27,120
what else people would want us to cover

4226
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:28,479
because you know we've gone through most

4227
02:24:28,479 --> 02:24:30,399
of it

4228
02:24:30,399 --> 02:24:32,960
cool well this tutorial definitely took

4229
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:34,240
us to kind of the brink

4230
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:37,280
of all of these papers i maybe it'd be

4231
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:38,240
interesting to

4232
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:40,960
walk through a paper like a tutorial of

4233
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:42,640
the paper especially this enteroceptive

4234
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:43,120
one like

4235
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:45,680
how would we adapt that for other do

4236
02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:47,200
kind of a walk through that'd be one

4237
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:48,960
thought or we could go into the

4238
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:50,800
formalism side we could invite a

4239
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:51,359
colleague

4240
02:24:51,359 --> 02:24:53,120
or collaborator who came from a

4241
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:54,960
different perspective more on the

4242
02:24:54,960 --> 02:24:56,319
analytical

4243
02:24:56,319 --> 02:24:59,600
more from some other dimension that

4244
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:00,000
we're

4245
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:03,520
that we are just also all learning about

4246
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:05,359
yeah i mean i should say i mean there's

4247
02:25:05,359 --> 02:25:07,040
certainly a lot of areas of like the

4248
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:08,800
broader kind of free energy literature

4249
02:25:08,800 --> 02:25:10,319
free energy principle literature that

4250
02:25:10,319 --> 02:25:10,720
we're

4251
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:13,040
totally not covering here intentionally

4252
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:14,720
right like our focus is this is what you

4253
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:15,600
need to know

4254
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:17,840
to build models and use them

4255
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:18,800
experimentally

4256
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:20,880
right so you know for instance there's a

4257
02:25:20,880 --> 02:25:22,000
lot of other stuff in

4258
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,280
for instance like the physics

4259
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:25,280
formulation for

4260
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:27,439
for you know that also gets called right

4261
02:25:27,439 --> 02:25:29,040
part of active inference

4262
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:30,479
um or the free energy principle more

4263
02:25:30,479 --> 02:25:31,760
broadly that includes things like for

4264
02:25:31,760 --> 02:25:32,640
instance like

4265
02:25:32,640 --> 02:25:35,280
um carl fristan's kind of variant on

4266
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:37,120
talking about markov blankets

4267
02:25:37,120 --> 02:25:38,960
um you know or i mean there's a lot of

4268
02:25:38,960 --> 02:25:40,800
stuff on them like uh non-equilibrium

4269
02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:41,680
steady states

4270
02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:43,200
right and how that how that can be

4271
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:45,600
talked about in terms of um

4272
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:47,600
uh minimizing variational free energy

4273
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:49,760
but also a lot of the physics

4274
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:51,840
um you know like thermodynamic right

4275
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:53,280
like free energy and things like that

4276
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:54,720
also come in and um

4277
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:55,600
that stuff's quite a bit more

4278
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:57,840
theoretical and um um

4279
02:25:57,840 --> 02:26:00,160
it's certainly interesting but it's not

4280
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:01,120
uh

4281
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:02,720
not things that you need to know or all

4282
02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:04,319
that directly relevant to actually

4283
02:26:04,319 --> 02:26:05,520
build models and do the stuff in

4284
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:07,680
practice so um

4285
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:09,840
yeah there's other places other places

4286
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:11,200
to look to that can they get that kind

4287
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:12,399
of stuff i guess this is what i'm

4288
02:26:12,399 --> 02:26:13,600
pointing out as ours

4289
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:15,200
this is not true completely

4290
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:17,359
comprehensive of look it's called the

4291
02:26:17,359 --> 02:26:18,880
active inference or at least free energy

4292
02:26:18,880 --> 02:26:21,839
principle there sure

4293
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:26,720
so any other final thoughts from either

4294
02:26:26,720 --> 02:26:28,080
of you

4295
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:30,240
no i'm just been really fun thank you

4296
02:26:30,240 --> 02:26:32,840
yay great well it was really fun same

4297
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:35,439
yeah and like i said i mean if if people

4298
02:26:35,439 --> 02:26:36,319
want to like

4299
02:26:36,319 --> 02:26:38,240
you know like go through get walked

4300
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:39,520
through specific

4301
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:41,439
you know papers either like you know

4302
02:26:41,439 --> 02:26:43,280
simulation either some of like our

4303
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:45,040
simulation papers or empirical papers in

4304
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:46,319
more detail

4305
02:26:46,319 --> 02:26:47,920
um so they could get a sense of how they

4306
02:26:47,920 --> 02:26:49,600
would do that in practice i'm happy to

4307
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:50,240
do that

4308
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:52,560
um but um i guess that's something that

4309
02:26:52,560 --> 02:26:53,680
we can just kind of

4310
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:56,640
uh determine at a later date nice so we

4311
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,040
will

4312
02:26:57,040 --> 02:27:00,080
wait for somebody to stimulate

4313
02:27:00,080 --> 02:27:01,840
us to do a walkthrough on a certain

4314
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:03,920
topic or on a certain

4315
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:06,160
um with a certain distribution of people

4316
02:27:06,160 --> 02:27:08,319
we'll figure it out but we'll um

4317
02:27:08,319 --> 02:27:10,479
we'll figure it out then so really

4318
02:27:10,479 --> 02:27:11,600
thanks again both

4319
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:14,080
i'm gonna finish the live stream so

4320
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:16,040
peace out everyone thanks for watching

4321
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:17,840
activeinference.org

4322
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:19,760
thanks so much ryan smith christopher

4323
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:22,560
white
