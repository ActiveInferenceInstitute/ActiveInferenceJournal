1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,913
Daniel: Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:06,884 --> 00:00:11,233
It is January 31, 2023.

3
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:16,725
We're here in Active Bookstream number

4
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:16,725
1.8.

5
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:17,877
Off to you, Bleu.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:28,937
Bleu: So we will be discussing this book,

7
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:28,937
continuing our discussion of this book

8
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:28,937
governing Continuous Transformation by

9
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:28,937
Dean Kelsey.

10
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:38,990
We are the Active Inference participatory

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:38,990
online institute that is communicating,

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:38,990
learning, and practicing applied active

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:38,990
inference.

14
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:42,299
You can reach us at all of our social

15
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:42,299
media links.

16
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:48,902
This is a recorded and an archived live

17
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:48,902
stream, so please provide us with

18
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:48,902
feedback so that we can improve on our

19
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:48,902
work.

20
00:00:42,312 --> 00:00:53,463
All backgrounds and perspectives are

21
00:00:53,463 --> 00:00:53,463
welcome here, and we will be following

22
00:00:53,463 --> 00:00:53,463
good video etiquette for live streams.

23
00:00:48,914 --> 00:01:03,824
Again, if you would like to participate

24
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:03,824
in this project or any activities that

25
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:03,824
are ongoing in the Active Coherence

26
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:03,824
Institute, please reach out to us.

27
00:00:55,625 --> 00:01:06,110
There are plenty of ways to get connected

28
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:06,110
and involved.

29
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:15,053
Okay, so the goal of today's bookstream

30
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:15,053
is to continue our discussion of this

31
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:15,053
book, and we will just be going through

32
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:15,053
it as usual.

33
00:01:07,248 --> 00:01:16,172
Just as always.

34
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:21,642
This is not a review or a final word over

35
00:01:21,642 --> 00:01:21,642
this material.

36
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:24,992
Just this is an introduction to some of

37
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:24,992
the Dean.

38
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:26,165
Okay?

39
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:32,723
So just quick introduction for those of

40
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:32,723
you who don't know us, I am Bleu Knight.

41
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:36,180
I've been involved in the Active

42
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,180
Inference Institute for quite a while.

43
00:01:32,737 --> 00:01:43,816
I'm an independent researcher in New

44
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:43,816
Mexico, and I'll pass it off to Daniel.

45
00:01:36,194 --> 00:01:45,007
Daniel: Hi, Daniel.

46
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:47,024
I'm a researcher in California.

47
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:49,040
I'll pass to Tyler.

48
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:51,060
Tyler: My name is Tyler.

49
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:54,094
I'm a critical designer and gab

50
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:54,094
researcher in California.

51
00:01:51,060 --> 00:02:02,119
Bleu: All right, so today we're moving on

52
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:02,119
to chapter eight of the book.

53
00:01:57,126 --> 00:02:06,159
The title of this chapter is in part two,

54
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,159
the Free Energy Governance section.

55
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:11,201
And the title of this chapter is

56
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:11,201
Capabilities Duality Management.

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:17,265
And we'll talk more as we go on as to

58
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:17,265
what duality management kind of means.

59
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:23,328
Okay, so there are two sections outlined

60
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:23,328
by Bijan here in this chapter.

61
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:29,387
The dynamic capability view and

62
00:02:29,387 --> 00:02:29,387
antagonistic neural networks

63
00:02:29,387 --> 00:02:29,387
perspective.

64
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:35,440
There's a whole bunch of keywords and

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:35,440
we'll just jump right into it.

66
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:38,469
Tyler, do you want to read this part of

67
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:38,469
the abstract for us?

68
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:38,477
Sure.

69
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:58,672
Tyler: Right, so abstract Dynamics

70
00:02:58,672 --> 00:02:58,672
Ambiguity View, DCV and Antagonistic

71
00:02:58,672 --> 00:02:58,672
Neural Networks Perspective amp address

72
00:02:58,672 --> 00:02:58,672
free Energy governance capabilities

73
00:02:58,672 --> 00:02:58,672
dimension the board's cognitive

74
00:02:58,672 --> 00:02:58,672
capabilities in terms of metamaging

75
00:02:58,672 --> 00:02:58,672
interdependently opposing logics as

76
00:02:58,672 --> 00:02:58,672
unity, are increasingly relevant to

77
00:02:58,672 --> 00:02:58,672
continuous strategic renewal.

78
00:02:38,478 --> 00:03:07,709
Duality management, such as the

79
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:07,709
vacillation between exploitation versus

80
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:07,709
exploration and balancing financial

81
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:07,709
strategic control, is established as a

82
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:07,709
dynamic forward capability.

83
00:02:58,673 --> 00:03:11,747
Effectively, FEG extends DCM to the board

84
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:11,747
level.

85
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:24,877
More importantly, by adopting a free

86
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:24,877
Energy principle powered perspective by

87
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:24,877
redefining the firm as an active

88
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:24,877
inference machine, DCB's tripletive

89
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:24,877
sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring

90
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:24,877
aspects operational such that firm is

91
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:24,877
engaged as a whole.

92
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:27,907
Bleu: Great.

93
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:39,027
So Antagonistic Neural Network

94
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:39,027
Perspective is established and applied as

95
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:39,027
the neuroscientific basis for duality

96
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:39,027
management, managing the existing while

97
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:39,027
contradicting the present to develop the

98
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:39,027
future.

99
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:45,089
This task positive network, what is the

100
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:45,089
other one?

101
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:49,120
GMM Dynamic Mode network.

102
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:51,142
I can't remember antagonism.

103
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:52,153
What is it?

104
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:56,192
Default mode network.

105
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,201
There it is.

106
00:03:56,192 --> 00:04:12,292
Default mode network antagonism between

107
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:12,292
exploitative task execution and

108
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:12,292
exploration, abductive thinking is a

109
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:12,292
neurological representation of the

110
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:12,292
contradictory demands that challenges

111
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:12,292
company's sustainable outperformance and

112
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:12,292
survival.

113
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:21,387
The board's traditional monitoring and

114
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:21,387
advisory roles must be explicitly

115
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:21,387
complemented with a duality management

116
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:21,387
mandate managing both of these networks.

117
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:32,496
More specifically, the board's dynamic

118
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:32,496
capability of duality management lays the

119
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:32,496
foundation for the board's newly

120
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:32,496
established governance purpose and

121
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:32,496
discontinuous and distributed markets.

122
00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:34,518
Quote duality stewardship.

123
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:35,527
Yeah.

124
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:42,598
And so we'll get into these task positive

125
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:42,598
and default mode networks as we get in

126
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:42,598
later to this presentation.

127
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:47,647
All right, so this is a dynamic

128
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:47,647
capability view.

129
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:48,652
I looked it up.

130
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:50,671
I found this cool image.

131
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:59,760
So Bijan says, sensing strategic

132
00:04:59,760 --> 00:04:59,760
opportunities in dynamic market

133
00:04:59,760 --> 00:04:59,760
environments, seizing the opportunity and

134
00:04:59,760 --> 00:04:59,760
reconfiguring a firm's resource base.

135
00:04:50,672 --> 00:05:05,767
Accordingly, our dynamic capability views

136
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:05,767
three central pillars and he cites this

137
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:05,767
reference.

138
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:11,821
So here we see these fencing, seizing and

139
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:11,821
managing.

140
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:13,845
Or I guess that's reconfiguring.

141
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:21,929
These are the three pillars and then they

142
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:21,929
give some micro foundations like what is

143
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:21,929
this encoding?

144
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:25,961
Seizing, reconfiguration, or managing

145
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:25,961
threats?

146
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,974
So I don't know.

147
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:31,022
Tyler, do you have and thing to add here

148
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:31,022
or maybe like specific examples?

149
00:05:26,974 --> 00:05:37,086
To me, this is a very abstract diagram

150
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:37,086
and I'm like what's going on here?

151
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:44,154
Tyler: Yeah, I think this makes it more

152
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:44,154
seem more difficult and complicated than

153
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:44,154
it really is.

154
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:47,187
Where a lot of times is sensing a lot of

155
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:47,187
that's where it's like that abductive

156
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:47,187
reasoning.

157
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:49,207
We're saying like, hey, there's something

158
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:49,207
here.

159
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:51,221
What could be true here?

160
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:55,264
How do I explain kind of these disparate

161
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:55,264
signals I'm getting from the

162
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:55,264
environment?

163
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:57,280
How do I make sense of this?

164
00:05:55,265 --> 00:06:03,283
And we're seizing is like actually

165
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:03,283
building the thing and managing threats

166
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:03,283
and performing is like managing that

167
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:03,283
thing you built over time.

168
00:05:57,281 --> 00:06:12,375
And I think actually in the next slide it

169
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:12,375
gives a really good example with Amazon

170
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:12,375
Kindle, actually, maybe if you could just

171
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:12,375
go to the next slide, I think it explains

172
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:12,375
it well.

173
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:31,562
So, for example, it says, for example,

174
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:31,562
amazon's launch of the Kindle 2006

175
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:31,562
involves sensing the impending threat of

176
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:31,562
its core bookselling business, using the

177
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:31,562
opportunity through rapid development of

178
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:31,562
the first generative ebook reader and

179
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:31,562
gradually reconfiguring its internal

180
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:31,562
activities to ensure that the Kindle

181
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:31,562
became an integrated part of its overall

182
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:31,562
market offering.

183
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:34,597
Bleu: Nice.

184
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:35,605
Thank you.

185
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:52,769
Bijan goes on to say in a similar manner

186
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:52,769
to that in which organizational learning

187
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:52,769
research distinguishes between single

188
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:52,769
loop and double loop learning capability

189
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:52,769
research also distinguishes between

190
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:52,769
operational capabilities and dynamics

191
00:06:52,769 --> 00:06:52,769
capabilities.

192
00:06:36,615 --> 00:07:04,832
And so in the text he gives some examples

193
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:04,832
of operational capabilities like mergers

194
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:04,832
and acquisitions and other things that

195
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:04,832
are outside the scope of this dynamics

196
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:04,832
capability view.

197
00:06:52,770 --> 00:07:08,876
Okay, so start reading these claims.

198
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:30,090
So he says there has lately been a shift

199
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,090
in dynamic capability view from

200
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,090
behavioral to cognitive interpretations,

201
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,090
explicating the cognitive

202
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,090
microfoundations underpinning Tse's 2007

203
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,090
three core pillars of dynamic

204
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,090
capabilities sensing perception, seizing

205
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,090
sense making and asset configuration,

206
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,090
language, communication and social

207
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,090
cognition.

208
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:38,179
So this is like reframing again, those

209
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:38,179
three pillars kind of more towards the

210
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:38,179
active inference or free energy

211
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:38,179
governance perspective.

212
00:07:30,091 --> 00:08:00,337
He goes on to say, with respect to

213
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:00,337
dynamic managerial capabilities for

214
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:00,337
seizing and reconfiguring, in particular,

215
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:00,337
we have emphasized ways in which top

216
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:00,337
management can shape aspects of the

217
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:00,337
organizational context, such as by

218
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:00,337
encouraging cooperation, lowering

219
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:00,337
resistance to change, designing a

220
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:00,337
business model for a new venture, and

221
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:00,337
investing in new skills and assets.

222
00:07:39,183 --> 00:08:12,456
This suggests that managerial cognitive

223
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:12,456
capabilities may function as mediators of

224
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:12,456
the relationship between Chang Kim

225
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:12,456
organizational context and strategic

226
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:12,456
change, which in turn can affect firm

227
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:12,456
performance.

228
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:16,497
Do either of you guys have any comments

229
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:16,497
here?

230
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:18,511
Should we move to the next one?

231
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:18,518
Okay.

232
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:20,533
All right.

233
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:28,618
So I had to look this up because the term

234
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:28,618
industrial vertical was brought up and I

235
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:28,618
was like, what is industrial vertical?

236
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:31,649
It's more commonly called an industry

237
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:31,649
vertical.

238
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:35,682
You can have it like in the industrial

239
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:35,682
field and then it's like something

240
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:35,682
different.

241
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:38,719
But an industry vertical is also known as

242
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:38,719
a vertical market.

243
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:46,796
And it's like a unique business niche

244
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:46,796
that serves a specific set of consumers

245
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:46,796
or customers and their particular needs.

246
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:54,870
And there's tons of examples of that,

247
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,870
like, I don't know, organic food and I

248
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,870
don't know, like, solutions for biology

249
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,870
lab.

250
00:08:46,798 --> 00:09:16,034
Or there's all these niche markets and

251
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:16,034
it's like if you're trying to sell

252
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:16,034
chemicals to a biology lab, you're

253
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:16,034
selling them like HPLC Purified acetic

254
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:16,034
acid, and you're not selling that acetic

255
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:16,034
acid to someone to use in their kitchen

256
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:16,034
for a salad dressing, even though you're

257
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:16,034
selling acetic acid.

258
00:08:54,871 --> 00:09:19,067
Those are two totally different markets

259
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:19,067
of people.

260
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:25,129
So you don't want to make a product

261
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:25,129
that's bought by everyone because then it

262
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:25,129
actually is not useful for anyone.

263
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:27,147
That was kind of my understanding.

264
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,162
Do you have anything to add, Tyler?

265
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:32,190
Tyler: Yeah, I could give a little bit

266
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:32,190
more color of examples here.

267
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:38,258
So an example of and industry vertical

268
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:38,258
could be like movie making business,

269
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:38,258
where on the top end you might have like

270
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:38,258
where the movies are consumed.

271
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:41,284
It's a movie theater, and then you have

272
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:41,284
how it's produced.

273
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:47,343
So you have studios, you have

274
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:47,343
screenwriters, you have the people who

275
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:47,343
are actually creating the equipment and

276
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:47,343
making the film, right?

277
00:09:41,285 --> 00:09:55,428
So it's basically like this big, kind of

278
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:55,428
almost supply chain are these

279
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:55,428
interrelated businesses that are all

280
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:55,428
supporting each other to one final

281
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:55,428
product.

282
00:09:47,344 --> 00:10:05,467
So one thing I would add here too, that I

283
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:05,467
think the genre would probably agree with

284
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:05,467
is that in a more discontinuous world,

285
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:05,467
the idea of an industry vertical is

286
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:05,467
becoming a little bit more fuzzy.

287
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:13,546
And so, for example, in the past, you

288
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:13,546
might say like, well, I have this I make

289
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:13,546
chemicals for biology research, right?

290
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:18,591
But it could be the case that you also

291
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:18,591
make chemicals that are used for hair

292
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:18,591
products.

293
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:23,641
And so your verticals are increasingly

294
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:23,641
becoming more fuzzy and intertwined.

295
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:31,722
It becomes harder to think about what

296
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:31,722
niche do I actually serve, what is the

297
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:31,722
market I'm in?

298
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:31,724
Right?

299
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:32,737
And it can be really hard to think that.

300
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:39,800
And that's where sensing really comes in

301
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:39,800
handy is because you could be like, oh

302
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:39,800
well, I thought I was making biology

303
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:39,800
research chemicals.

304
00:10:32,737 --> 00:10:51,926
But it turns out because I'm sensing and

305
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:51,926
using my active reasoning and my best FEG

306
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:51,926
perspective, I can then actually in the

307
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:51,926
hair care market and that's where I

308
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:51,926
really should be.

309
00:10:39,801 --> 00:10:57,988
And so it's kind of the idea of a

310
00:10:57,988 --> 00:10:57,988
vertical becomes harder to define over

311
00:10:57,988 --> 00:10:57,988
time.

312
00:10:52,934 --> 00:11:11,065
Bleu: This website actually gave a lot of

313
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:11,065
examples about how industry verticals

314
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:11,065
allow companies that would sometimes be

315
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:11,065
competitors to collaborate with each

316
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:11,065
other.

317
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:25,204
Like, they talked about how the Samsung

318
00:11:25,204 --> 00:11:25,204
glass is used by the Apple iPhone, or

319
00:11:25,204 --> 00:11:25,204
maybe it's the other way around, but

320
00:11:25,204 --> 00:11:25,204
either way, like Samsung and like the

321
00:11:25,204 --> 00:11:25,204
Samsung phones and the Apple phones are

322
00:11:25,204 --> 00:11:25,204
normally like competitors in a market.

323
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:27,222
I don't even know that they computer

324
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:27,222
anymore.

325
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:30,250
Like either you're a Mac person or you're

326
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:30,250
an Android person.

327
00:11:27,223 --> 00:11:32,271
I don't think that there's any

328
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:32,271
competition there.

329
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:42,370
But maybe they're collaborating with the

330
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:42,370
use of the glass and making it accessible

331
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:42,370
to everyone just because everybody needs

332
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:42,370
glass.

333
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:42,376
Right?

334
00:11:42,371 --> 00:11:49,449
Okay, so Bishop also brought up oh yeah,

335
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:49,449
here is the industrial vertical.

336
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:52,471
So let me read this from the book.

337
00:11:50,449 --> 00:12:01,507
It says indeed, independently of

338
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:01,507
industrial vertical, the increasingly

339
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:01,507
distributed and discontinuous nature of

340
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:01,507
market transforming forces cannot be

341
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:01,507
overestimated.

342
00:11:52,471 --> 00:12:05,547
However, market velocity is too generic

343
00:12:05,547 --> 00:12:05,547
of a concept.

344
00:12:01,508 --> 00:12:12,613
And so I was trying to understand how he

345
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:12,613
was using this term market velocity.

346
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:13,622
Here.

347
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:19,688
Market velocity, like when you Google it,

348
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:19,688
it indicates the level of market activity

349
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:19,688
in individual Nasdaq stocks.

350
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:31,803
By measuring the frequency and share

351
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:31,803
volume in aggressively priced orders, it

352
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:31,803
can indicate changes in market direction,

353
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:31,803
momentum or liquidity in each stock,

354
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:31,803
enabling users to imply future price

355
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:31,803
movements and trades.

356
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:35,841
So that's how fast the market is moving,

357
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:35,841
I guess.

358
00:12:31,804 --> 00:12:38,876
And then it's also a company that

359
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:38,876
recycles.

360
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:42,911
And velocity is a measure of two

361
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:42,911
dimensions, right?

362
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:45,945
The speed of change and the change in

363
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:45,945
dimension.

364
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:50,997
So I don't know the concept of market

365
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:50,997
velocity here.

366
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:55,040
He goes on to computer it to

367
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,040
environmental scarcity.

368
00:12:51,004 --> 00:13:11,144
So the more suitable dynamics capability

369
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:11,144
concept is environmental scarcity

370
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:11,144
inspired by Cameron and Zuluto 1983,

371
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:11,144
meaning meaningfully relating, sensing

372
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:11,144
and sense making as meta capabilities

373
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:11,144
respectively to eco niche dynamics and

374
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:11,144
strategic renewal.

375
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:19,224
I don't know how environmental scarcity

376
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:19,224
and market velocity, like how those two

377
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:19,224
relate to each other.

378
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:25,281
I don't know if you guys can offer any

379
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:25,281
insight here, but this is something that

380
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:25,281
I would hold out and ask Bijan about.

381
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:39,427
Tyler: Yeah, I think with market

382
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:39,427
velocity, a lot of times when people talk

383
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:39,427
about discontinuities and people who are

384
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:39,427
not coming from an FPG background talking

385
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:39,427
about hey, things are moving really

386
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:39,427
quickly, it's more uncertain than ever.

387
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:41,446
They talk about market velocity, right.

388
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:43,464
Things are just changing all the time.

389
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:50,533
And I think what Bijan is saying is just

390
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:50,533
saying that things are changing very

391
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:50,533
quickly isn't very helpful to you because

392
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:50,533
you're like, okay, cool.

393
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:51,548
Like life is hard, I get it.

394
00:13:50,533 --> 00:14:09,661
Now what do I do with that information

395
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:09,661
where when you present environmental

396
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:09,661
scarcity, it's becoming a little bit more

397
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:09,661
specific and how you can actually be more

398
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:09,661
action oriented with it because you're

399
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:09,661
like, okay, well, what's my niche and

400
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:09,661
what are the meta capabilities I have to

401
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:09,661
create to manage this uncertainty and

402
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:09,661
create my own niche?

403
00:13:52,549 --> 00:14:14,717
Whereas market velocity is kind of like

404
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:14,717
being overwhelmed by uncertainty and

405
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:14,717
being like, I don't know, things are

406
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:14,717
hard.

407
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:16,731
Like this is scary.

408
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:18,750
That's at least my take.

409
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:23,802
Bleu: On to sorry, go ahead, Daniel.

410
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:41,982
Daniel: One related angle to connect back

411
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:41,982
to what we've discussed elsewhere is this

412
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:41,982
concept of generalized coordinates, which

413
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:41,982
is the value that something is at, and

414
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:41,982
then the first derivative, which is the

415
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:41,982
velocity, and then the acceleration,

416
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:41,982
higher derivatives and so on.

417
00:14:23,803 --> 00:14:55,119
And so that allows you to track one

418
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:55,119
variable like the temperature or the

419
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:55,119
salinity of the water or the funds in the

420
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:55,119
bank account and look at it, not just

421
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:55,119
where it is, but how fast it's moving and

422
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:55,119
how fast it's changing, how fast it's

423
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:55,119
moving.

424
00:14:41,983 --> 00:15:01,125
And then you can learn certain things

425
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:01,125
like, oh, the third derivative is always

426
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:01,125
within this range.

427
00:14:55,121 --> 00:15:10,212
So that puts certain bounds on timelines

428
00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:10,212
that the primary indicator might change

429
00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:10,212
by a certain amount or not.

430
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:16,273
And we see some of those things, like the

431
00:15:16,273 --> 00:15:16,273
gradual decline, sudden decline.

432
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:21,327
Those are differentiated not by their

433
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:21,327
starting point, but by the rate of their

434
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:21,327
decline.

435
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:28,391
So velocity is something that we can talk

436
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:28,391
about in Bayesian physics, actually, as a

437
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:28,391
speed.

438
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:59,708
Bleu: And then he goes on to outline this

439
00:15:59,708 --> 00:15:59,708
environment scarcity from this Schmidt at

440
00:15:59,708 --> 00:15:59,708
Al 2016 reference, which says combining

441
00:15:59,708 --> 00:15:59,708
the type and rate of decline allows us to

442
00:15:59,708 --> 00:15:59,708
distinguish four environmental scarcity

443
00:15:59,708 --> 00:15:59,708
situations environmental dissolution,

444
00:15:59,708 --> 00:15:59,708
which is a gradual decline in shape,

445
00:15:59,708 --> 00:15:59,708
environment erosion, gradual decline in

446
00:15:59,708 --> 00:15:59,708
size, environmental collapse, sudden

447
00:15:59,708 --> 00:15:59,708
decline in shape, and environmental

448
00:15:59,708 --> 00:15:59,708
contraction.

449
00:15:32,437 --> 00:16:01,668
Sudden decline in size.

450
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:12,774
I was trying to picture this as maybe

451
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:12,774
like a Markov, the market changes shape.

452
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:15,807
What would it mean for a market to change

453
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:15,807
shape?

454
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:16,814
Really?

455
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:18,836
I get like, the market changes size.

456
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:23,886
Like all of a sudden there's not a market

457
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:23,886
force CDs anymore because everybody's

458
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:23,886
listening to MP3.

459
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:31,960
I guess that's a change in shape and size

460
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:31,960
I'm not sure how to really think about.

461
00:16:26,914 --> 00:16:38,038
Tyler: To use that example, that would be

462
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:38,038
a Chang Kim shape, where, for example,

463
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:38,038
imagine the same number of people were

464
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:38,038
listening to music, but the format

465
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:38,038
changed.

466
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:41,062
So it's like the market is music.

467
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:45,102
People who listen to music, but the shape

468
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:45,102
is a little bit different of how they're

469
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:45,102
consuming it.

470
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:48,138
Whereas it could be a change of size and

471
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:48,138
shape.

472
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:55,200
As if you move to MP3 s now because it's

473
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,200
MP3 s, more people can access the music

474
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,200
the market grows.

475
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:56,212
And that'd be Chang Kim size and.

476
00:16:55,201 --> 00:17:03,228
Bleu: Shape or like, the market totally

477
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:03,228
disappears because we can just stream

478
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:03,228
whatever we want on YouTube now.

479
00:16:56,212 --> 00:17:04,239
Yeah, exactly.

480
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:08,276
That's also a change in size and shape, I

481
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:08,276
guess.

482
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:10,295
Okay, cool.

483
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:20,393
So environmental scarcity is more

484
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:20,393
suitable than market velocity, and I

485
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:20,393
guess I can see why that is, because it's

486
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:20,393
more nuanced as to what is actually

487
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:20,393
changing.

488
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:23,422
Is it just like up or down and how fast?

489
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:27,461
Or like the shape and the size and the

490
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:27,461
rate?

491
00:17:23,423 --> 00:17:31,507
I guess all of that is taken into this

492
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:31,507
environmental scarcity concept.

493
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:35,547
Okay, do you want to read these claims,

494
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:35,547
Tyler?

495
00:17:32,514 --> 00:17:36,555
Sure.

496
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:54,737
Tyler: So while slow and gradual market

497
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:54,737
changes test, in particular are

498
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:54,737
capability more sudden changes,

499
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:54,737
challenges affirm sense making

500
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:54,737
capability, there really is no

501
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:54,737
objectively uncertain market environment

502
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:54,737
and certainty is an accuracy penitent

503
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:54,737
mental experience facing one's very

504
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:54,737
limitations of dynamic interplay between

505
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:54,737
sensing and sensemaking.

506
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:59,782
Therefore, independent of the degree of

507
00:17:59,782 --> 00:17:59,782
market velocity, dynamic capabilities are

508
00:17:59,782 --> 00:17:59,782
critical.

509
00:17:54,738 --> 00:18:14,870
He goes on to say the stronger and sudden

510
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,870
the impact of environmental scarcity, the

511
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,870
higher the agency to act, and hence the

512
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,870
stronger the tendency for strategic

513
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,870
renewal to be rather financial control

514
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,870
centered by M and A and other forms of

515
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,870
alliancing precisely for two reasons.

516
00:17:59,783 --> 00:18:29,002
One, the existing resource base is too

517
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:29,002
trapped in the past to unlearn advance

518
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:29,002
renewal from within and without or two,

519
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:29,002
the opportunity for market consolidation

520
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:29,002
is too irresistible, as JPMorgan had

521
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:29,002
demonstrated during the 2007 and 2008

522
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:29,002
financial crisis.

523
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:31,004
And time to action is critical.

524
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:35,008
Bleu: Cool.

525
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:43,016
So, yeah, I guess that kind of sheds more

526
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:43,016
light on the environmental scarcity

527
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:43,016
concept here.

528
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:47,020
Okay, so I wanted to define this.

529
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:53,026
We kind of talked about the tyranny of

530
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:53,026
the or last time, but we didn't really

531
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:53,026
elaborate on it.

532
00:18:47,020 --> 00:19:07,034
And so last time we talked about this

533
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:07,034
good to great tagon book, Circuit City

534
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:07,034
and The Tyranny of the Ore is actually,

535
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:07,034
Bijan keeps quoting this Wardsl book

536
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:07,034
about the tyranny of the force, but I had

537
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:07,034
to look it up.

538
00:18:53,026 --> 00:19:13,040
It's actually from not good to great Jim

539
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,040
Collins book, but like another Jim

540
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,040
Collins book that I haven't read, Built

541
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,040
to Last.

542
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:24,051
And so here the tyranny of the Force is

543
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:24,051
the rational view that cannot easily

544
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:24,051
accept paradox, that cannot live with two

545
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:24,051
seemingly contradictory forces or ideas

546
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:24,051
at the same time.

547
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:30,057
The tyranny of the or pushes people to

548
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:30,057
believe that things must be either A or

549
00:19:30,057 --> 00:19:30,057
B, but not both.

550
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:49,076
And so I think that this concept kind of

551
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:49,076
goes like a light introduction and we'll

552
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:49,076
dive deeper into it about duality and

553
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:49,076
duality management being able to hold two

554
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:49,076
simultaneously opposing or maybe

555
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:49,076
seemingly opposing or necessarily

556
00:19:49,076 --> 00:19:49,076
contradictory opinions or views.

557
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:55,082
And here we go right into duality

558
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:55,082
management.

559
00:19:51,078 --> 00:20:09,090
So Bijan says, in fact, at any point in

560
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,090
time a firm is challenged to balance

561
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,090
strategic, organic, R and D driven

562
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,090
innovation and growth with financial

563
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,090
control, external growth and innovation

564
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,090
by way of forms of strategic partnering.

565
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:11,092
There is no tyranny of ore.

566
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:20,101
It is a duality, a continuous balancing

567
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:20,101
act that is mutually reinforcing and with

568
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:20,101
perspective in time and space forms a

569
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:20,101
unity.

570
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:27,108
Free energy governance establishes

571
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:27,108
duality management as a dynamic

572
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:27,108
capability, specifically as a dynamic

573
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:27,108
board capability.

574
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:37,118
Duality management such as vasculation of

575
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:37,118
exploitation versus exploration and

576
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:37,118
balancing financial and strategic control

577
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:37,118
is established as a dynamics board

578
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:37,118
capability.

579
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:57,138
The goal directed, action centric and

580
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
generative circular causality of top

581
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
down, bottom up and lateral sense making

582
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
processes, prediction error minimization

583
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
forms the basis for leveraging opposing

584
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
logic in the form of duality and duality

585
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
management in contrast with strategy

586
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
management.

587
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:59,140
Do you want to read this one, Tyler?

588
00:20:57,138 --> 00:21:01,136
Sure.

589
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,136
So.

590
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:32,167
Tyler: Indeed, strategy management has

591
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
traditionally embraced one, environmental

592
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
co creation versus colignment two,

593
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
exploitation of the first exploration and

594
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
three, financial for strategic control as

595
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
dualism or paradox rather than as

596
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
duality, gives the background of a world

597
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
as increasingly distributed discontinuous

598
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
and inescapably interdependent

599
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
persistence, persistency in contradiction

600
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
of interdependent elements, which is the

601
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
defining core paradox potentially

602
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
nonsense and therefore severely limits

603
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
the theoretical as well as practical

604
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:32,167
relevance of a strategic paradox lens.

605
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:35,170
Bleu: Cool.

606
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:43,178
I think that this is like the old way and

607
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:43,178
as opposed to duality management, which

608
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:43,178
is the new way.

609
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:46,181
Do you guys have anything to add to

610
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:46,181
here?

611
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:59,194
Daniel: This is kind of like paradox is

612
00:21:59,194 --> 00:21:59,194
attention to balance, unity is plural and

613
00:21:59,194 --> 00:21:59,194
at minimum two rather than paradox is

614
00:21:59,194 --> 00:21:59,194
something that must be resolved one way

615
00:21:59,194 --> 00:21:59,194
or the other.

616
00:21:47,182 --> 00:22:07,196
So it's really compatible with a lot of

617
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:07,196
qualitative things people say about

618
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:07,196
wisdom and balance.

619
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:14,203
And I think the question will be how is

620
00:22:14,203 --> 00:22:14,203
that enacted in organizations and how

621
00:22:14,203 --> 00:22:14,203
does that connect to active?

622
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:25,214
Tyler: Yeah, I mean, one thing that's

623
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:25,214
interesting about duality management is

624
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:25,214
that there's also a strong cultural

625
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:25,214
tendency to be decisive or biased to be

626
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:25,214
decisive.

627
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:43,232
And that the perception of kind of not

628
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:43,232
wanting to make a choice can be seen as

629
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:43,232
weak, whereas you haven't really I think

630
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:43,232
a lot of people would recognize the

631
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:43,232
duality and say, like, yeah, I don't

632
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:43,232
know, it's kind of both.

633
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:44,233
Like you want to explore or you want to

634
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:44,233
spoil.

635
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:47,236
I think a lot of people would recognize

636
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:47,236
that.

637
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:57,246
But when you're in a meeting and you're

638
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:57,246
not really committing to something, a lot

639
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:57,246
of people feel like they're not really

640
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:57,246
offering a new perspective, like they're

641
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:57,246
not putting their stake in the grass.

642
00:22:48,236 --> 00:23:02,245
This is how I feel about it and this is

643
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:02,245
where I'm going to push behind.

644
00:22:57,246 --> 00:23:08,251
And so I feel like a lot of people feel

645
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:08,251
this pull to make a call and so that's

646
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:08,251
one like even in an executive level you

647
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:08,251
can feel that.

648
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:23,266
Especially too when you're on the

649
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:23,266
executive level and even if you recognize

650
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:23,266
this duality and you're communicating

651
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:23,266
what you want to do to the broader

652
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:23,266
organization, duality is a really hard

653
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:23,266
thing to communication and be like yeah,

654
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:23,266
we don't really know what's going on.

655
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:26,269
It could be one of these multiple things

656
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:26,269
like, let's figure it out together.

657
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:28,271
I haven't done this.

658
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:29,272
I have, like, communicate this before.

659
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:32,275
It's a hard road to go down, right?

660
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:34,277
We were like, hey, yeah, we're all just

661
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:34,277
figuring it out.

662
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:37,280
Like, it's going to be like, let's just

663
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:37,280
kind of be fluid about it.

664
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:45,287
A lot of people don't like to hear that

665
00:23:45,287 --> 00:23:45,287
because it sounds like, well, this person

666
00:23:45,287 --> 00:23:45,287
doesn't know what they're doing, and I

667
00:23:45,287 --> 00:23:45,287
don't even know where we're going.

668
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:46,289
This is really scary.

669
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:49,291
And so I do want to touch on this later.

670
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:54,297
But, like, it's one thing recognizing

671
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:54,297
duality in yourself and on a small

672
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:54,297
management team.

673
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:59,302
How you talk about duality in a broader

674
00:23:59,302 --> 00:23:59,302
organization is like a whole different

675
00:23:59,302 --> 00:23:59,302
animal.

676
00:23:54,297 --> 00:24:02,299
And so I hope we can talk about that more

677
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:02,299
a little bit later.

678
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:08,305
Bleu: Thanks for that.

679
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:17,314
Okay, so we talked last time also about

680
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:17,314
the quantum duality and what does Bijan

681
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:17,314
mean?

682
00:24:10,307 --> 00:24:22,319
And we knew that he would really kind of

683
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:22,319
unwrap it here in this chapter.

684
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:25,322
So I guess we've seen duality.

685
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:29,326
Like, we are able to hold

686
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:29,326
simultaneously.

687
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:32,329
It's simultaneously a one and a zero.

688
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:41,337
And so we were wondering if what was

689
00:24:41,337 --> 00:24:41,337
really meant by duality in the quantum

690
00:24:41,337 --> 00:24:41,337
sense was more like the superposition

691
00:24:41,337 --> 00:24:41,337
angle.

692
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:47,344
And so it seems like yes, based on even

693
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:47,344
this quote from the book.

694
00:24:41,338 --> 00:25:19,370
So Bijan says it is important to

695
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
appreciate that many dichotomies that

696
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
have defined the science and practice of

697
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
strategy management, such as firm versus

698
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
environment, executive leadership versus

699
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
nonexecutive board, individual versus

700
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
firm exploitation versus exploration,

701
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
financial control versus strategic

702
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
control, formal versus informal channels,

703
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
and flexibility versus stability, for

704
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
example, are less and less dichotomous in

705
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
a distributed and discontinuous world,

706
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
but coexist in superposition as of

707
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,370
duality or synchronicity.

708
00:24:47,344 --> 00:25:25,376
So I think that this kind of maybe

709
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:25,376
answers that question for us from last

710
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:25,376
week.

711
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:28,378
Do you guys have any comments here?

712
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:42,393
Daniel: Okay, Anil Seth, some of those

713
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:42,393
dualities are raised as a partition, like

714
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:42,393
firm from environment or organism versus

715
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:42,393
environment.

716
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:46,397
It's a partition that is an integrated

717
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:46,397
whole.

718
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:57,408
And so that is part of this framing

719
00:25:57,408 --> 00:25:57,408
function, seeing it as an integrated unit

720
00:25:57,408 --> 00:25:57,408
but also containing separate aspects.

721
00:25:46,397 --> 00:26:04,409
And then also quantum carries a lot of

722
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:04,409
baggage, whether somebody is familiar

723
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:04,409
with what it technically means or not.

724
00:25:58,408 --> 00:26:08,413
Dualities in the quantum space could

725
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:08,413
refer to wave particle.

726
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:11,416
It could refer to observer observed.

727
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:21,426
And so I think it needs a lot more

728
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:21,426
operationalism to have utility beyond a

729
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:21,426
sort of like evocative quantum

730
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:21,426
management.

731
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:29,434
And then again, to come back to Tyler's

732
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:29,434
point, which I want to hear more about,

733
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:29,434
if you say, well, we're actually doing

734
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:29,434
all the strategies.

735
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:30,435
It's like a wave.

736
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:32,437
You thought we were going to go to one

737
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:32,437
strategy or the other.

738
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:35,440
We're going to be probabilistic across

739
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:35,440
all of them.

740
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:37,442
How does that work.

741
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:45,450
Bleu: Tyler, if I'm waiting for your

742
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:45,450
comeback?

743
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:56,461
Tyler: Well, I mean, honestly, I have

744
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:56,461
actually a strategy of how I do this and

745
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:56,461
I just don't necessarily communicate

746
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:56,461
broadly that we're doing all of the

747
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:56,461
strategies probabilistically.

748
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:59,464
I might know that and maybe a couple of

749
00:26:59,464 --> 00:26:59,464
other people know that.

750
00:26:56,461 --> 00:27:03,462
We're kind of keeping our options open

751
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:03,462
for a bunch of different avenues.

752
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:05,464
But you communicate something that's much

753
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:05,464
more clear.

754
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:08,467
I don't think you get to do both.

755
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:10,469
You don't get to communicate that

756
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:10,469
broadly.

757
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:18,477
It's just not consumable by other people

758
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:18,477
and it doesn't give them like it's not

759
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:18,477
really actionable by them.

760
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:21,480
So you can't say we're doing all the

761
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,480
strategies because they're like cool,

762
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,480
then how do I fit into this?

763
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:26,485
You have to say, well this is broadly

764
00:27:26,485 --> 00:27:26,485
what we're doing and this is how you're

765
00:27:26,485 --> 00:27:26,485
going to fit into it.

766
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:33,492
Daniel: Also, action helps cut this

767
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:33,492
knot.

768
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:46,505
So for and given search space, it's not

769
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:46,505
possible to have one parameter value that

770
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:46,505
is maximizing exploitation and

771
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:46,505
exploration that gets into the sort of

772
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:46,505
like I'm everywhere on the number line at

773
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:46,505
once type thinking.

774
00:27:33,492 --> 00:27:56,515
But action allows us to say, well, our

775
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:56,515
strategy is we're going to move quick,

776
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:56,515
but as soon as criteria one, two and

777
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:56,515
three are met, then we're going to lock

778
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:56,515
in.

779
00:27:46,505 --> 00:28:06,519
So that's actually a plan that you can

780
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:06,519
have precision about that embodies in

781
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:06,519
another variable space, explore,

782
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:06,519
exploit.

783
00:27:56,515 --> 00:28:14,527
But where we have precision about is

784
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:14,527
about action, which is what his whole

785
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:14,527
emphasis is on actually.

786
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:21,534
Tyler: And that reminds me, another

787
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:21,534
strategy I use too is that you explicitly

788
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:21,534
frame it around exploration and that

789
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:21,534
you're waiting for something to exploit.

790
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:26,539
So you're saying like, hey, all right,

791
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
we're going to build this thing and we're

792
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
not sure who's gain to even use this,

793
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:26,539
right?

794
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:27,540
But we're going to build this thing.

795
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:32,545
We have a hypothesis that these kinds of

796
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:32,545
people might use it and then we're going

797
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:32,545
to see who uses it.

798
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:41,554
And that's like the experience experiment

799
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
we're running together as a company is

800
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
this like defined scope explorer stage

801
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
and then once we run that experiment,

802
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
then we move to exploit.

803
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:47,560
And so you can kind of clearly do that

804
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:47,560
within an organization of how you're

805
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:47,560
switching between these different modes.

806
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:52,565
Bleu: Nice.

807
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,566
Okay.

808
00:28:52,565 --> 00:29:06,573
Bijan says therefore to effectively

809
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
operationalize dynamic capabilities

810
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
triplet of sensing, seizing and

811
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
reconfiguring, we need a model that

812
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
dynamically links dynamic capabilities to

813
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
triplet with the environment.

814
00:28:53,566 --> 00:29:10,577
This is Free Energy Governance's

815
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:10,577
underlying active inference lab.

816
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:12,579
One active states.

817
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:13,580
Acting, sensing.

818
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:34,601
Two sensory states perception, sensing,

819
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:34,601
sense making and Seizing the Opportunity

820
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:34,601
and three internal states, firm

821
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:34,601
resources, Resource Configuration and

822
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:34,601
four external states, unknown, hidden,

823
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:34,601
are all linked in circular causality

824
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:34,601
conditioned by the internal external

825
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:34,601
Markov blanket and governed by free

826
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:34,601
Energy minimization.

827
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:44,611
And so I just thought it was interesting

828
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:44,611
here, like we can go back and look here

829
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:44,611
at the three pillars like the sensing,

830
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:44,611
seizing and reconfiguring.

831
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:51,618
And for me the sensing part goes here in

832
00:29:51,618 --> 00:29:51,618
this action.

833
00:29:44,611 --> 00:30:10,631
Sensing or sensing is like in sensory

834
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:10,631
states, but seizing the opportunity as a

835
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:10,631
sensory state totally threw me off is it

836
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:10,631
just me sensing the opportunity is like

837
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:10,631
one thing, but leveraging an opportunity

838
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:10,631
as a sensory state, that seems more like

839
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:10,631
an action state.

840
00:29:51,618 --> 00:30:19,640
I don't know if it's just me or what you

841
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:19,640
guys think about that because I was kind

842
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:19,640
of like, whoa, seizing the opportunity is

843
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:19,640
a sensory state.

844
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:23,644
Tyler: Well, for example, in seizing, he

845
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:23,644
included creating your business model.

846
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:28,649
And so that is, I think, part of sense

847
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:28,649
making because you're like, this is how

848
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:28,649
we relate to the ecosystem.

849
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:36,657
So it's like action is action centric,

850
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:36,657
but this is also sensory or something

851
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:36,657
like, well, this is the kind of

852
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:36,657
information that we're going to collect

853
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:36,657
from the environment as well.

854
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:42,663
And so I think you're kind of doing both

855
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:42,663
the action and exteroception when you're

856
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:42,663
doing seasoning.

857
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:44,665
This is how I'm going to relate to my

858
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:44,665
environment.

859
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:51,672
Not sure if that's exactly what you're

860
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
saying.

861
00:30:49,670 --> 00:31:11,686
Daniel: I think this is an attempt to

862
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
coerce, for better and for worse, a

863
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
triplet into the particular partition

864
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
where blanket states defined as graph,

865
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
Bayesian graph, where there are nodes

866
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
that make two other sets of nodes

867
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
conditionally independent.

868
00:30:51,672 --> 00:31:26,701
And I think we've seen in the

869
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:26,701
philosophical and application settings a

870
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:26,701
lot of challenges with people simply

871
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:26,701
coercing a naturalistic understanding of

872
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:26,701
how things are in the world with this

873
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:26,701
Bayesian graph formulation.

874
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:30,705
Like, here we have active states, action

875
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:30,705
sensing.

876
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:35,710
Action states are the outgoing

877
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:35,710
statistical dependencies of an entity.

878
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:37,712
So yeah, they are action.

879
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:44,719
And if you think about active sensing,

880
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:44,719
then they're sort of elusively related to

881
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:44,719
sensing, but it's not a sense state.

882
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:52,727
And so how much are we going to have both

883
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:52,727
feet in the technical formalism of the

884
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:52,727
particular partition?

885
00:31:44,719 --> 00:32:02,731
And to what extent are we kind of leaving

886
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:02,731
1ft on the formalism and then pivoting

887
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:02,731
around and trying to draw in some other

888
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:02,731
framework and draw concordances?

889
00:31:52,727 --> 00:32:12,741
Bleu: So I agree that it's like a coerced

890
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:12,741
moving the triple it into this particular

891
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:12,741
partition.

892
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:19,748
But I just don't know if feeding the

893
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:19,748
opportunity is something that I would

894
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:19,748
include as a sensory state.

895
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:27,756
I think that that's something that I

896
00:32:27,756 --> 00:32:27,756
would put even in constructing a business

897
00:32:27,756 --> 00:32:27,756
plan that's still an action that you take

898
00:32:27,756 --> 00:32:27,756
on the world.

899
00:32:20,748 --> 00:32:32,761
That's something that's outgoing, not

900
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:32,761
something that's necessarily incoming.

901
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:38,767
And that's just how I would forage it, or

902
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:38,767
like the way that made more sense to me.

903
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:44,773
So I just found it a particularly curious

904
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:44,773
area to put it.

905
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:56,785
But yeah, we can move on and talk about

906
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
being ask Bijan why he put it there,

907
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
hopefully, and then we can talk about

908
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
this Antagonistic Neural Networks

909
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:56,785
perspective.

910
00:32:46,775 --> 00:33:09,792
So Bijan says Antagonistic Neural Network

911
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:09,792
Perspectives is established and applied

912
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:09,792
as the neuroscientific basis for duality

913
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:09,792
management, managing the existing while

914
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:09,792
contradicting the present to develop the

915
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:09,792
future.

916
00:32:57,786 --> 00:33:18,800
It is a form of organizational learning

917
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:18,800
that strategic management literature has

918
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:18,800
labeled ambidexterity, foraging,

919
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:18,800
exploitation and exploration.

920
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:24,807
In neuroscientific terms, the

921
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:24,807
antagonistic relationship is between two

922
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:24,807
large scale cortical networks.

923
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:25,808
The task positive network.

924
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:47,829
TPN and the Default mode network DMN,

925
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:47,829
which simply put our neuroanatomical

926
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:47,829
representations of top management's, day

927
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:47,829
to day, task specific focus on

928
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:47,829
exploitation, the Task Positive Network

929
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:47,829
on the one side and the rather non

930
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:47,829
routine divergent and creative thinking

931
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:47,829
that initiates exploration and strategic

932
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:47,829
renewal the Default Mode network.

933
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:59,842
And so I thought this was super

934
00:33:59,842 --> 00:33:59,842
interesting and took a deeper dive into

935
00:33:59,842 --> 00:33:59,842
looking up the reference for that quote

936
00:33:59,842 --> 00:33:59,842
here in this paper.

937
00:33:48,831 --> 00:34:08,845
Antagonistic neural networks underlying

938
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:08,845
differentiate leadership roles by boy ant

939
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:08,845
this and Rochford and Jack.

940
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:26,863
They say the antagonistic relationship

941
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:26,863
between the Task Positive network and the

942
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:26,863
Default mode network creates a

943
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:26,863
fundamental neural constraint on

944
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:26,863
cognition that is highly relevant to the

945
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:26,863
different roles and capabilities that

946
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:26,863
effective leaders must astutely juggle

947
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:26,863
and deploy.

948
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:34,871
An important consequence of this

949
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
constraint is that an overemphasis on

950
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
task oriented leadership can prove

951
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:34,871
deleterious to an organization.

952
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:41,878
In particular, when openness to new

953
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:41,878
ideas, people emotions and ethical

954
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:41,878
concerns are important to success.

955
00:34:34,871 --> 00:34:50,887
On the other hand, the overemphasis on

956
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:50,887
relationship oriented leadership may

957
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:50,887
prove deleterious to focus and the

958
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:50,887
execution of clearly defined goals.

959
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:52,889
And I thought that this was really cool.

960
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:56,893
I just have never like, thought about

961
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:56,893
leadership like this.

962
00:34:53,889 --> 00:35:03,894
But definitely there's the people

963
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:03,894
component and the GST component, like

964
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:03,894
getting stuff done.

965
00:34:56,893 --> 00:35:08,899
Leadership requires both and you need to

966
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:08,899
have both.

967
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:20,911
And I also thought that the ambidexterity

968
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:20,911
here, like where Bijan talks about, is

969
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:20,911
like interesting because you think about

970
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:20,911
organizations and you always hear the

971
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:20,911
phrase like the left hand doesn't know

972
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:20,911
what the right hand is doing.

973
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:34,925
And I wonder if that's why this different

974
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:34,925
management role or dichotomy is labeled

975
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:34,925
Ambit Xerity or which came first, the

976
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:34,925
chicken or the egg here?

977
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:35,926
I don't know.

978
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,928
Do you get through any comments here?

979
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:47,938
Tyler: One thing I thought was

980
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:47,938
interesting here is on one level there's

981
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:47,938
this analogy between the default network

982
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:47,938
and the test positive network with what

983
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:47,938
you might find in an organization.

984
00:35:38,929 --> 00:36:05,950
But I thought it was interesting too,

985
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:05,950
thinking about how the individual relates

986
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:05,950
to the organization and that the

987
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:05,950
creativity that an individual or leader

988
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:05,950
can exercise is kind of constrained by

989
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:05,950
the antagonistic relationship between

990
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:05,950
their own test positive and default mode

991
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:05,950
network, right?

992
00:35:47,938 --> 00:36:24,969
And it's one thing for beyond to say

993
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:24,969
like, yes, you need to have this

994
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:24,969
antagonistic relationship and then you

995
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:24,969
need to be this balance, but the ability

996
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:24,969
for the organization to do that is

997
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:24,969
constrained by the people within that

998
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:24,969
organization, their own individual

999
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:24,969
abilities to kind of switch between these

1000
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:24,969
two systems.

1001
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:35,980
And it's kind of a lot, I guess you're

1002
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:35,980
basically like, the organization's

1003
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:35,980
ability to do this runs up against the

1004
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:35,980
biology of the individuals and their own

1005
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:35,980
ability to switch between these different

1006
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:35,980
modes.

1007
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:40,985
And I think that ability to kind of run

1008
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:40,985
these two modes in parallel is quite

1009
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:40,985
rare.

1010
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:47,992
And it's one thing to ask your leaders to

1011
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:47,992
have it, but to ask your entire

1012
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:47,992
organization to have it is like a whole

1013
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:47,992
much different and much bigger ask.

1014
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:59,004
And so one of my things I keep thinking

1015
00:36:59,004 --> 00:36:59,004
about when I'm going through this book is

1016
00:36:59,004 --> 00:36:59,004
to what extent does the Bull organization

1017
00:36:59,004 --> 00:36:59,004
need to have internalized like duality

1018
00:36:59,004 --> 00:36:59,004
management or is it really just the

1019
00:36:59,004 --> 00:36:59,004
leaders?

1020
00:36:47,992 --> 00:37:05,004
Or I think what the John would say is

1021
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:05,004
like the board, but that doesn't seem to

1022
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:05,004
connect each level of the hierarchy.

1023
00:36:59,004 --> 00:37:11,010
It seems like each level of the hierarchy

1024
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:11,010
should be able to manage these two

1025
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:11,010
different modes of processing.

1026
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:12,011
But it's a rare skill.

1027
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,013
So how is that even possible to do?

1028
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:17,016
Not sure if you have any thoughts on

1029
00:37:17,016 --> 00:37:17,016
that.

1030
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:19,018
Daniel: Yeah, a few more.

1031
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:47,046
One is the switching, which is sometimes

1032
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
even potentially faster than a second of

1033
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
our own behavior or neurophysiology from

1034
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
task oriented to mind wandering and to

1035
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
what extent we sometimes just zone out,

1036
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
thinking, daydreaming, reflecting,

1037
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
integrating, looking at our schedule,

1038
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
looking at our inbox like it's not task

1039
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
driven.

1040
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:54,053
But that is like a space that can then

1041
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:54,053
transition into a task.

1042
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:57,056
Not always the task we want, but it can

1043
00:37:57,056 --> 00:37:57,056
transition to a task.

1044
00:37:54,053 --> 00:38:01,054
So that's kind of cool and antagonistic

1045
00:38:01,054 --> 00:38:01,054
is one way to frame it.

1046
00:37:57,056 --> 00:38:07,060
You could also call them synergistic or

1047
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,060
synergetic because they're part of that.

1048
00:38:01,054 --> 00:38:19,072
Unity is plural and at minimum two angle

1049
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:19,072
where no single neural network could be

1050
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:19,072
tuned to be able to be both diffusive and

1051
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:19,072
task oriented.

1052
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:34,087
So why not have some type of oscillatory

1053
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:34,087
process that enables those two modes like

1054
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:34,087
having a forward and a reverse in a car

1055
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:34,087
instead of trying to make one gear that

1056
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:34,087
can do two things that are

1057
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:34,087
contradictory?

1058
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:41,094
Bleu: It's a super good point.

1059
00:38:38,091 --> 00:39:02,109
And in this paper they really talked

1060
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,109
about they went in a greater detail about

1061
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,109
the task positive network and the default

1062
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,109
mode network and they said that the task

1063
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,109
positive network is activated during a

1064
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,109
broad range of non social tasks and is

1065
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,109
thought to be important for problem

1066
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,109
solving, focusing attention, making

1067
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:02,109
decisions and control of action.

1068
00:38:42,095 --> 00:39:03,110
In other words, for getting things done.

1069
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:11,118
However, activation of the task positive

1070
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:11,118
network also has a deleterious effect on

1071
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:11,118
other cognitive functions that are

1072
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:11,118
essential to leadership.

1073
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:16,123
It suppresses activity in the default

1074
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:16,123
mode network.

1075
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:25,132
And similarly, the default mode network

1076
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
plays a role in emotional self awareness,

1077
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
social cognition and ethical decision

1078
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
making.

1079
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:30,137
It is also strongly linked to creativity

1080
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:30,137
and insightful problem solving.

1081
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:37,144
And then the activation of the default

1082
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:37,144
mode network, they said elsewhere,

1083
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:37,144
inhibits the task positive network.

1084
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:42,149
So I thought that there's like this and

1085
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:42,149
it is like unity.

1086
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:43,150
You need both.

1087
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:46,153
You can't constantly be focused on a

1088
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:46,153
task.

1089
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:48,155
Like you guys know how that feels,

1090
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:48,155
right?

1091
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:50,157
To just be like out of it.

1092
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:51,158
Like you have to have that.

1093
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:57,164
You need to have work and play in order

1094
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:57,164
for some kind of balance.

1095
00:39:51,158 --> 00:40:00,161
It is unifying to be balanced.

1096
00:39:58,165 --> 00:40:01,162
I think.

1097
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:21,182
Tyler: One thing that made me remember I

1098
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:21,182
think I've actually mentioned this in the

1099
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:21,182
previous stream, but in regards to

1100
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:21,182
switching between the two gears of a car,

1101
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:21,182
rather than trying to run them both at

1102
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:21,182
the same time, one way that this was

1103
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:21,182
phrased to me by one of my previous CEOs

1104
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:21,182
was you have, like, art projects and you

1105
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:21,182
have science projects.

1106
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:30,191
And so like, your art being your default

1107
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:30,191
mode projects, your science being your

1108
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:30,191
task positive projects, and like

1109
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:30,191
explicitly saying like, we are in art

1110
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:30,191
mode right now.

1111
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:32,193
Like, don't hold us accountable to any

1112
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:32,193
metrics.

1113
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:38,199
Like, this is an art project we're

1114
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:38,199
exploring versus science, which is like,

1115
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:38,199
hold me accountable.

1116
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:40,201
And that means hold me accountable to

1117
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:40,201
metrics.

1118
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:46,207
Like, I'm going to set a number and I'm

1119
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:46,207
going to hit that number and that's how I

1120
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:46,207
should be evaluated.

1121
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:51,212
And so I think there are ways you could

1122
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:51,212
probably forage switching between these

1123
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:51,212
modes in an organization.

1124
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:53,214
Daniel: Yeah.

1125
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:54,215
Thank you, Tyler.

1126
00:40:53,214 --> 00:40:57,218
And one biological angle on this.

1127
00:40:54,215 --> 00:41:06,221
Sometimes this type of oscillation is

1128
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:06,221
called a winnerless competition, and it's

1129
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:06,221
modeled using predator prey type

1130
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:06,221
dynamics.

1131
00:40:57,218 --> 00:41:25,240
Latka Voltera is the name of the

1132
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:25,240
dynamical formalism and in the SPM

1133
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:25,240
textbook and package from Karl Friston

1134
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:25,240
and colleagues earlier work, there's a

1135
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:25,240
lot of examples of winnerless competition

1136
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:25,240
lacavultero models being used to model

1137
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:25,240
activity amongst different brain

1138
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:25,240
regions.

1139
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:32,247
And this winnerless competition is an

1140
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:32,247
interesting framing on everything from

1141
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:32,247
attention to sleep.

1142
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:37,252
It's like sleep is not trying to be 100%

1143
00:41:37,252 --> 00:41:37,252
of the time.

1144
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:40,255
Wakefulness is not trying to be 100% of

1145
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:40,255
the time.

1146
00:41:37,252 --> 00:41:52,267
They inhibit each other until there's a

1147
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:52,267
phase transition and then it's like a

1148
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:52,267
dwell in one state and then that

1149
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:52,267
inhibition shifts and one oscillates

1150
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:52,267
back.

1151
00:41:40,255 --> 00:42:00,269
And so similarly, like, a predator

1152
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
doesn't over the long run, really want to

1153
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
eradicate the prey, but their populations

1154
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
fluctuate.

1155
00:41:52,267 --> 00:42:02,271
And that's a winnerless competition.

1156
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:04,273
And in fact, that's a co winning

1157
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:04,273
competition.

1158
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:15,284
And just one last point I remember in The

1159
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:15,284
Selfish Gene, some of the discussion of

1160
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:15,284
out there on the savannah, look at the

1161
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:15,284
cheetah eating the gazelle.

1162
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:19,288
How can one say that that's like mammal

1163
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:19,288
level selection at play?

1164
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:21,290
That doesn't make any sense.

1165
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:30,299
But actually, if that ecological

1166
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:30,299
relationship weren't there, then neither

1167
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:30,299
population would have the resilience.

1168
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:44,313
So how we frame things, and especially

1169
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:44,313
the level of holism that we bring, is

1170
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:44,313
going to set the stage for whether we see

1171
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:44,313
something as sustainable or

1172
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:44,313
unsustainable, adversarial or non

1173
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:44,313
adversarial.

1174
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:50,319
Bleu: Awesome.

1175
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:55,324
Okay, so we're moving on.

1176
00:42:52,321 --> 00:43:12,335
Bijan says free energy governance is

1177
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
firmly rooted in the belief that in a

1178
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
discontinuous and distributed world, the

1179
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
marginal benefit of structural

1180
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
reorganizations as well as structural

1181
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
compartmentalization of exploitation and

1182
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
exploration are rather suboptimal or

1183
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
possibly counterproductive.

1184
00:42:55,324 --> 00:43:21,344
Competitiveness and survival are

1185
00:43:21,344 --> 00:43:21,344
increasingly determined by the extent to

1186
00:43:21,344 --> 00:43:21,344
which a system is rather less rule or top

1187
00:43:21,344 --> 00:43:21,344
down supervised learning base.

1188
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:25,348
Exploration happens increasingly in real

1189
00:43:25,348 --> 00:43:25,348
time within exploitation.

1190
00:43:21,344 --> 00:43:32,355
In effect, the emergence of the new is

1191
00:43:32,355 --> 00:43:32,355
essentially hypothesis testing within the

1192
00:43:32,355 --> 00:43:32,355
existing.

1193
00:43:25,348 --> 00:43:33,356
And I really liked this.

1194
00:43:32,355 --> 00:43:41,364
Like Daniel, you had mentioned earlier

1195
00:43:41,364 --> 00:43:41,364
about is this a partition or is this like

1196
00:43:41,364 --> 00:43:41,364
a nesting?

1197
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:53,376
And this exploration and exploitation is

1198
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:53,376
a partition and also is like a nesting

1199
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:53,376
based on what Bijan says here.

1200
00:43:41,364 --> 00:44:06,383
He also says in a distributed and

1201
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:06,383
discontinuous market environment, the

1202
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:06,383
real leadership challenge is to de

1203
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:06,383
antagonize the past positive Network

1204
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:06,383
Default Mode network dichotomy in the

1205
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:06,383
form of duality management.

1206
00:43:53,376 --> 00:44:09,386
Do you guys have any comments here?

1207
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:15,392
All right, moving on.

1208
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:16,393
Do you want to read these claims?

1209
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:17,394
Tyler?

1210
00:44:16,393 --> 00:44:18,395
Sure.

1211
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:29,406
Tyler: FPG's cross hierarchical

1212
00:44:29,406 --> 00:44:29,406
connectivity logically concludes that

1213
00:44:29,406 --> 00:44:29,406
managing the TPN DMN antagonism is not a

1214
00:44:29,406 --> 00:44:29,406
top down challenge calling for structural

1215
00:44:29,406 --> 00:44:29,406
compartmentalization, but one of duality

1216
00:44:29,406 --> 00:44:29,406
management.

1217
00:44:18,395 --> 00:44:43,420
By vacillating between or among discrete

1218
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,420
formal organization, those just

1219
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,420
centralization and decentralization the

1220
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,420
organization may increase dynamically the

1221
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,420
levels of exploration and exploitation

1222
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,420
beyond those achievable through an

1223
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,420
approach based strictly on a static

1224
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,420
design choice.

1225
00:44:29,406 --> 00:44:49,426
In summary, pretty much conceive

1226
00:44:49,426 --> 00:44:49,426
organizing as an informally deep learning

1227
00:44:49,426 --> 00:44:49,426
and self designing compass.

1228
00:44:43,420 --> 00:45:01,432
Centralizing intelligence at any higher

1229
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:01,432
level of the organization can be

1230
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:01,432
counterproductive, increasing free

1231
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:01,432
energy, promoting entropy, and eventually

1232
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:01,432
capitulating to TPN DMN's antagonistic

1233
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:01,432
forces.

1234
00:44:49,426 --> 00:45:19,450
So I think one thing you might have been

1235
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
referencing here is when you're

1236
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
structurally trying to create your DMN

1237
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
and TPN and like, having them separate

1238
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
from each other, this is what's, like,

1239
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
traditionally done in companies of having

1240
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
like an R and D department where, like,

1241
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
this is where all of the new ideas come

1242
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:19,450
from.

1243
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:24,455
And so I think he was just supposing the

1244
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:24,455
FPG approach to that very traditional

1245
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:24,455
model.

1246
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:35,466
Bleu: So we'll move on here.

1247
00:45:33,463 --> 00:45:59,489
So he gives here the free energy

1248
00:45:59,489 --> 00:45:59,489
governance response to the Task Positive

1249
00:45:59,489 --> 00:45:59,489
Network Default Mode Network Challenge

1250
00:45:59,489 --> 00:45:59,489
and it's this three fold response and he

1251
00:45:59,489 --> 00:45:59,489
says sensitizing the entire organization

1252
00:45:59,489 --> 00:45:59,489
in regard to upper echelon's tendency to

1253
00:45:59,489 --> 00:45:59,489
top down extrapolating its dominant

1254
00:45:59,489 --> 00:45:59,489
supervising knowledge structures, logic

1255
00:45:59,489 --> 00:45:59,489
and past experience as a guide and

1256
00:45:59,489 --> 00:45:59,489
prediction for future success.

1257
00:45:35,466 --> 00:46:03,488
A fallacy that task specific exploitation

1258
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:03,488
tends to reinforce.

1259
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:12,497
Embracing strategic renewal as a matter

1260
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:12,497
of continuous deep learning in the form

1261
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:12,497
of cultivating cross hierarchical

1262
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:12,497
processes empowering purpose directed and

1263
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:12,497
action generated.

1264
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:16,501
Bottom up Markov stimuli as a basis for

1265
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:16,501
double loop learning.

1266
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:29,514
Questioning the very models that

1267
00:46:29,514 --> 00:46:29,514
generative model top down predictions and

1268
00:46:29,514 --> 00:46:29,514
three default abductive attentional

1269
00:46:29,514 --> 00:46:29,514
engagement at every level of the

1270
00:46:29,514 --> 00:46:29,514
organization forms the basis for

1271
00:46:29,514 --> 00:46:29,514
effective top down bottom up prediction

1272
00:46:29,514 --> 00:46:29,514
error inclination.

1273
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:36,521
After noticing an environmental change,

1274
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:36,521
it is essential to question one's

1275
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:36,521
understanding of how the subsystems of

1276
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:36,521
the environment eg.

1277
00:46:29,514 --> 00:46:50,535
Technology and markets and the

1278
00:46:50,535 --> 00:46:50,535
organization eg knowledge and goals are

1279
00:46:50,535 --> 00:46:50,535
linked without losing sight of the fact

1280
00:46:50,535 --> 00:46:50,535
that environment is not objectively

1281
00:46:50,535 --> 00:46:50,535
defined, but a product of action

1282
00:46:50,535 --> 00:46:50,535
generated and socially constructed shared

1283
00:46:50,535 --> 00:46:50,535
meaning and expectations.

1284
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:56,541
So I think this is like how the duality

1285
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:56,541
management works, essentially.

1286
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:58,543
That's kind of what I took home here.

1287
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:59,544
Tyler, do you have comments?

1288
00:46:58,543 --> 00:47:05,544
Tyler: Yeah, and just that these are all

1289
00:47:05,544 --> 00:47:05,544
really the big asks to make of an

1290
00:47:05,544 --> 00:47:05,544
organization at every level.

1291
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:12,551
I think it's one thing to say I agree

1292
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:12,551
that this is the answer and if this could

1293
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:12,551
be done, be like, hell yeah, I'm all for

1294
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:12,551
it.

1295
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:24,563
But I again feel like you're kind of

1296
00:47:24,563 --> 00:47:24,563
running up against people's individual

1297
00:47:24,563 --> 00:47:24,563
abilities to manage duality just within

1298
00:47:24,563 --> 00:47:24,563
themselves and that will constrain your

1299
00:47:24,563 --> 00:47:24,563
ability to do this within organization.

1300
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:35,574
Bleu: It's funny because I think about

1301
00:47:35,574 --> 00:47:35,574
the cognitive cone, right, that we talked

1302
00:47:35,574 --> 00:47:35,574
about with Michael Levin.

1303
00:47:29,567 --> 00:47:42,581
And it's funny, what you just said is

1304
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:42,581
like the flip of the cognitive cone.

1305
00:47:35,574 --> 00:47:53,592
So usually it's like the larger structure

1306
00:47:53,592 --> 00:47:53,592
or like the more top level hierarchical

1307
00:47:53,592 --> 00:47:53,592
structure will cognitively constrain

1308
00:47:53,592 --> 00:47:53,592
things that are nested within it.

1309
00:47:42,581 --> 00:48:02,595
So the shape of that cone, the shape of

1310
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:02,595
the individuals within that cone can't be

1311
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:02,595
any other shape, right?

1312
00:47:54,592 --> 00:48:06,599
So they can't come out of the cognitive

1313
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:06,599
cone of the entire organization.

1314
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:21,614
But it's interesting to think about how

1315
00:48:21,614 --> 00:48:21,614
what is happening at the individual

1316
00:48:21,614 --> 00:48:21,614
level, like the shape of the individual

1317
00:48:21,614 --> 00:48:21,614
cognitive cone also lends itself to the

1318
00:48:21,614 --> 00:48:21,614
configuration of the higher level

1319
00:48:21,614 --> 00:48:21,614
cognitive cone.

1320
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:22,615
Daniel, do you have comments?

1321
00:48:21,614 --> 00:48:23,616
I see you're writing furiously.

1322
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:24,617
No.

1323
00:48:23,616 --> 00:48:25,618
All right.

1324
00:48:25,617 --> 00:48:29,622
Drawing furious doodling.

1325
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:30,623
Seriously.

1326
00:48:29,622 --> 00:48:32,625
Okay.

1327
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:36,629
So Bijan goes on to say, talk about a

1328
00:48:36,629 --> 00:48:36,629
salience trap.

1329
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:53,646
He says, While salience is critical to an

1330
00:48:53,646 --> 00:48:53,646
active inference, it can nonetheless

1331
00:48:53,646 --> 00:48:53,646
potentially increase free energy to

1332
00:48:53,646 --> 00:48:53,646
empower active sense making so that weak

1333
00:48:53,646 --> 00:48:53,646
signals can serve as an information rich

1334
00:48:53,646 --> 00:48:53,646
enhancement to predictions processing,

1335
00:48:53,646 --> 00:48:53,646
listening to what wants to emergence.

1336
00:48:36,629 --> 00:49:06,653
Organizational design is challenged to

1337
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:06,653
neutralize the tendency of experienced

1338
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:06,653
managers and board members to

1339
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:06,653
overconfidently superimpose the potential

1340
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:06,653
fallacy of their historic and self

1341
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:06,653
confidence powered pattern recognition.

1342
00:48:53,646 --> 00:49:21,668
Since the human brain's task positive

1343
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:21,668
network and default mode network spheres

1344
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:21,668
are antagonistically related, the only

1345
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:21,668
way to embrace antagonism as duality is

1346
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:21,668
by linking in circular, causality, top

1347
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:21,668
down predictions and bottom up stimuli.

1348
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:39,686
And so here I think that Bijan is really

1349
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:39,686
maybe kind of criticizing or like maybe

1350
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:39,686
not criticizing, maybe, I don't know,

1351
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:39,686
maybe criticizing is the right word.

1352
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:54,701
Like how experience leads you to

1353
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:54,701
prioritize, like leads you to place

1354
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:54,701
importance on things and maybe perhaps

1355
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:54,701
miss things that are important in an

1356
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:54,701
adaptive communication.

1357
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:55,702
I don't know.

1358
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:56,703
Do you agent some comments here?

1359
00:49:55,702 --> 00:50:07,708
Daniel: We're drawn to the salience, not

1360
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:07,708
to the meaningful or adaptive

1361
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:07,708
necessarily.

1362
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:15,716
We hope that our salience field can be

1363
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:15,716
aligned with what's adaptive and

1364
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:15,716
meaningful.

1365
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:20,721
But I think we found out that that is not

1366
00:50:20,721 --> 00:50:20,721
always the case.

1367
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:26,727
Bleu: And it's funny, like, I think about

1368
00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:26,727
just in scientific discovery, right?

1369
00:50:23,724 --> 00:50:31,732
Like how we're so attuned, we're looking

1370
00:50:31,732 --> 00:50:31,732
for the signal that we're looking for.

1371
00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:42,743
It takes like a very perceptive and adept

1372
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:42,743
scientist to not fall into that salience

1373
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:42,743
trap and perhaps notice what's going on

1374
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:42,743
in the periphery, right?

1375
00:50:31,732 --> 00:50:54,755
Like, even though this is the center,

1376
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:54,755
this is what we're focusing on, there's a

1377
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:54,755
lot of peripheral things happening that

1378
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:54,755
might actually be important or as

1379
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:54,755
important or maybe more important than

1380
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:54,755
the central thing that we're focused on.

1381
00:50:42,743 --> 00:51:06,761
Tyler: Yeah, I guess the other thing I

1382
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:06,761
say is that this is just like another

1383
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:06,761
it's one of those things, like I agree

1384
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:06,761
with this and like, theoretically, but

1385
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:06,761
there's so much stress going to like many

1386
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:06,761
of these decisions.

1387
00:50:55,756 --> 00:51:13,768
Like for example, if you have to do

1388
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:13,768
layoffs, for example, it is very time

1389
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:13,768
sensitive and the stakes are really

1390
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:13,768
high.

1391
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:29,784
And so going off your previous experience

1392
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
can be really helpful in there because

1393
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
you have to just make a really quick

1394
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
decision, and it's often going to be

1395
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
heuristic space, which may be not

1396
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
necessarily optimal, but you really are

1397
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
often constrained by your time and

1398
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:29,784
resources.

1399
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:36,791
And really processing all of your bottom

1400
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:36,791
up signals, like, even with the best

1401
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:36,791
attention, is really hard to do.

1402
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:50,804
And so again, it's not to say like, you

1403
00:51:50,804 --> 00:51:50,804
shouldn't try to do it or it can't be

1404
00:51:50,804 --> 00:51:50,804
done, but it's just like it's another one

1405
00:51:50,804 --> 00:51:50,804
of these things where like, hey, this is

1406
00:51:50,804 --> 00:51:50,804
a really big ass and I just want to call

1407
00:51:50,804 --> 00:51:50,804
out this is really hard to do, especially

1408
00:51:50,804 --> 00:51:50,804
when you're under the gun.

1409
00:51:37,792 --> 00:51:55,810
Bleu: Yeah.

1410
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:58,813
In the ideal world, this is how it

1411
00:51:58,813 --> 00:51:58,813
works.

1412
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:58,813
Right.

1413
00:51:58,813 --> 00:52:01,810
Okay.

1414
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:03,812
Do you want to read this claim for us,

1415
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:03,812
Tyler?

1416
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:04,813
Sure.

1417
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:05,814
Tyler: All right.

1418
00:52:05,814 --> 00:52:10,819
So indeed, this real time switching

1419
00:52:10,819 --> 00:52:10,819
correlation process cannot be relegated

1420
00:52:10,819 --> 00:52:10,819
to a single person.

1421
00:52:05,814 --> 00:52:24,833
You need a CEO or executive chairman or

1422
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
upper echelon as a team, but must be the

1423
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
result of an unsupervised and FEP

1424
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
determined layering process that relates

1425
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
top down predictions and bottom up data

1426
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
input and circular causality that dictate

1427
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:24,833
resource reconfiguration accordingly.

1428
00:52:10,819 --> 00:52:30,839
Consequently, the board's potentially

1429
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:30,839
unique DMN dimension cannot be ignored,

1430
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:30,839
but must be integrated into the process.

1431
00:52:24,833 --> 00:52:31,840
At the very top.

1432
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:47,856
The board goal directed has given us

1433
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:47,856
cognitive diversity and composition and

1434
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:47,856
cognitive distance firms dominant TPN

1435
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:47,856
exploitation logics emerges as a

1436
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:47,856
monitoring surveyor of the system that is

1437
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:47,856
centered around managing the dynamic

1438
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:47,856
interplay of dual forces exploitation,

1439
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:47,856
exploration, and financial and strategic

1440
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:47,856
control.

1441
00:52:31,840 --> 00:53:03,866
Something I thought it was interesting

1442
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:03,866
here is that while he's making this claim

1443
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:03,866
and we should do through the whole book

1444
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:03,866
that pay the boards in this really unique

1445
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:03,866
position to be this kind of like and

1446
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:03,866
integrated unit that kind of comes back

1447
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:03,866
to what we were saying earlier of like,

1448
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:03,866
okay, who is actually doing this?

1449
00:52:49,858 --> 00:53:04,867
Duality management.

1450
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:15,878
And so in one sense I'm like, okay, it

1451
00:53:15,878 --> 00:53:15,878
makes sense that the board would be doing

1452
00:53:15,878 --> 00:53:15,878
this because you can hold them

1453
00:53:15,878 --> 00:53:15,878
accountable to holding these different

1454
00:53:15,878 --> 00:53:15,878
ideas in their head at the same time

1455
00:53:15,878 --> 00:53:15,878
managing duality.

1456
00:53:04,867 --> 00:53:23,886
But it seems I would think that you would

1457
00:53:23,886 --> 00:53:23,886
need that duality management to be going

1458
00:53:23,886 --> 00:53:23,886
down the hierarchy, not just at the

1459
00:53:23,886 --> 00:53:23,886
border as well.

1460
00:53:15,878 --> 00:53:26,889
And at each level the hierarchy is

1461
00:53:26,889 --> 00:53:26,889
managing duality in some sense.

1462
00:53:23,886 --> 00:53:32,895
So I very much want to ask for you on

1463
00:53:32,895 --> 00:53:32,895
that when we got on a call with him.

1464
00:53:29,891 --> 00:53:39,902
Bleu Daniel, anything to add here?

1465
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:54,917
Bleu: No, but this is one sentence that I

1466
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:54,917
pulled out randomly from the chapter that

1467
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:54,917
just struck me and he just threw it in

1468
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:54,917
here and didn't unpack it or anything.

1469
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:58,921
The firm is a generative social field and

1470
00:53:58,921 --> 00:53:58,921
emerges in language.

1471
00:53:54,917 --> 00:54:01,918
And I thought that this was like really

1472
00:54:01,918 --> 00:54:01,918
profound.

1473
00:53:58,921 --> 00:54:07,924
So I don't know, I just put it in here

1474
00:54:07,924 --> 00:54:07,924
because just like, wow, that's very

1475
00:54:07,924 --> 00:54:07,924
deep.

1476
00:54:01,918 --> 00:54:09,926
I don't know.

1477
00:54:08,925 --> 00:54:14,931
I don't know if you guys have comments or

1478
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:14,931
this is something like I would ask Bijan

1479
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:14,931
to expand upon.

1480
00:54:09,926 --> 00:54:20,937
Daniel: You could ask 100 people with

1481
00:54:20,937 --> 00:54:20,937
different backgrounds what this?

1482
00:54:15,932 --> 00:54:24,941
Invokes for them and see where that

1483
00:54:24,941 --> 00:54:24,941
goes.

1484
00:54:21,937 --> 00:54:28,945
Bleu: That sounds like a fun project.

1485
00:54:26,943 --> 00:54:36,953
It was just like a sentence that seemed

1486
00:54:36,953 --> 00:54:36,953
very deep and just casually thrown in

1487
00:54:36,953 --> 00:54:36,953
there.

1488
00:54:28,945 --> 00:54:38,955
Tyler: I'm going to get this tattooed on

1489
00:54:38,955 --> 00:54:38,955
my chest.

1490
00:54:36,953 --> 00:54:40,957
Bleu: Right?

1491
00:54:39,956 --> 00:54:42,959
Put it on your next business card.

1492
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:45,962
That would be an awesome statement for a

1493
00:54:45,962 --> 00:54:45,962
business card, right?

1494
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,964
That would be great.

1495
00:54:46,963 --> 00:54:50,967
Daniel: So what is it you say you do?

1496
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:54,971
Bleu: I don't know.

1497
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:56,973
I guess that's true.

1498
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:58,975
This is a business philosophy.

1499
00:54:56,973 --> 00:55:00,971
Daniel: Awesome.

1500
00:54:59,976 --> 00:55:05,976
Bleu: So do you guys have any final like,

1501
00:55:05,976 --> 00:55:05,976
comments, questions?

1502
00:55:01,972 --> 00:55:07,978
Tyler, did you tell us all the things you

1503
00:55:07,978 --> 00:55:07,978
wanted to tell us?

1504
00:55:05,976 --> 00:55:09,980
Tyler: No.

1505
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:15,986
Daniel: Yeah, we're moving along through

1506
00:55:15,986 --> 00:55:15,986
the structure.

1507
00:55:12,983 --> 00:55:38,008
I'm looking forward to more conversations

1508
00:55:38,008 --> 00:55:38,008
and also some digestions and reflections,

1509
00:55:38,008 --> 00:55:38,008
making some schemes to visualize at a

1510
00:55:38,008 --> 00:55:38,008
high level what we've been coming away

1511
00:55:38,008 --> 00:55:38,008
from because this is like our 8th session

1512
00:55:38,008 --> 00:55:38,008
and I think we're starting to see his

1513
00:55:38,008 --> 00:55:38,008
patterns and style of laying out what he

1514
00:55:38,008 --> 00:55:38,008
wants to convey and integrate.

1515
00:55:15,986 --> 00:55:47,018
Bleu: Yeah, I definitely think we're

1516
00:55:47,018 --> 00:55:47,018
getting repeat the message and so it's

1517
00:55:47,018 --> 00:55:47,018
starting to drive some of it home for me

1518
00:55:47,018 --> 00:55:47,018
at least.

1519
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:58,029
So coming up to the end of the second

1520
00:55:58,029 --> 00:55:58,029
part of the book next week and I'll be

1521
00:55:58,029 --> 00:55:58,029
looking forward to that and to hopefully

1522
00:55:58,029 --> 00:55:58,029
discussing the author at his convenience,

1523
00:55:58,029 --> 00:55:58,029
Hae Park.

1524
00:55:48,018 --> 00:56:01,026
Thank you.

1525
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:03,028
Daniel: Bleu and Tyler, farewell.

1526
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:04,029
Bleu: Bye.

1527
00:56:03,028 --> 00:56:05,030
Daniel: Bye.

1528
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:15,040
Bleu: Conor, next week, same time.
