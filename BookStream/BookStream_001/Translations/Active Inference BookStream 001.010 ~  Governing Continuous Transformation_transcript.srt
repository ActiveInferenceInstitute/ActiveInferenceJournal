1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,023
Daniel: Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:07,963 --> 00:00:18,909
It's March 14, 2023, and we're in active

3
00:00:18,909 --> 00:00:18,909
Bookstream 1.010 off to you, Bleu.

4
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:20,138
Tyler: Hi.

5
00:00:19,063 --> 00:00:26,782
Today we are going to be discussing this

6
00:00:26,782 --> 00:00:26,782
governing Continuing Transformation

7
00:00:26,782 --> 00:00:26,782
book.

8
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:38,988
We're moving into the third and final

9
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:38,988
section of the text and so we're going to

10
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:38,988
kick it off today and next week, and we

11
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:38,988
will wrap up our discussion of the book

12
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:38,988
over these next couple of weeks.

13
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:47,891
So we are the Active Active Inference

14
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:47,891
Institute, participatory online institute

15
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:47,891
that is communicating, learning, and

16
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:47,891
practicing applied active inference.

17
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:50,154
These are all of our social media links.

18
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:57,823
This live stream is recorded and

19
00:00:57,823 --> 00:00:57,823
archived, so please provide us with

20
00:00:57,823 --> 00:00:57,823
feedback so that we can improve on our

21
00:00:57,823 --> 00:00:57,823
work.

22
00:00:50,164 --> 00:01:03,846
All backgrounds and perspectives are

23
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:03,846
welcome and we will be following good

24
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:03,846
video etiquette for live streams.

25
00:00:57,835 --> 00:01:13,823
If you would like to get involved in this

26
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:13,823
project or any of the ongoing projects at

27
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:13,823
the institute, get in touch, reach out

28
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:13,823
active inference.org.

29
00:01:04,912 --> 00:01:18,316
I think we're active inference institute

30
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:18,316
now too, so either one works.

31
00:01:13,826 --> 00:01:26,133
Okay, so we are in the 10th chapter of

32
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:26,133
this governing continuous transformation

33
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:26,133
book.

34
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:30,529
We're going to actually discuss chapters

35
00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:30,529
ten and eleven today.

36
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:39,453
This final section really is just a

37
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:39,453
conclusion and wrap up of the information

38
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:39,453
that's been presented in sections one and

39
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:39,453
two.

40
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:43,806
So we can just introduce ourselves

41
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:43,806
briefly.

42
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:47,024
I am Bleu Knight, an independent

43
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:47,024
researcher in New Mexico, and I will pass

44
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:47,024
it off.

45
00:01:43,814 --> 00:01:57,122
Bleu: I'm Tyler, I'm a dow researcher and

46
00:01:57,122 --> 00:01:57,122
protocol designer in California.

47
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:58,132
Daniel.

48
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:59,148
Daniel: I'm Daniel.

49
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:01,108
I'm a researcher in California.

50
00:01:59,148 --> 00:02:06,155
Bleu: Cool.

51
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:14,239
Tyler: Okay, so doing this third part,

52
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:14,239
the conclusion part, the chapters today.

53
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:25,345
So chapter ten is really just an

54
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:25,345
abstract, which we'll read, and then it's

55
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:25,345
like a giant table summarizing the free

56
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:25,345
energy governance model versus

57
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:25,345
traditional corporate governance.

58
00:02:15,243 --> 00:02:30,398
And so we'll just cover that and just

59
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:30,398
summarize how these are the same and

60
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:30,398
different.

61
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:37,465
And then we'll get into chapter eleven

62
00:02:37,465 --> 00:02:37,465
and some of the content, the conclusion

63
00:02:37,465 --> 00:02:37,465
content that is presented there.

64
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:40,496
Tyler, do you want to read this one for

65
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:40,496
us?

66
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:42,512
And I'll take the next part?

67
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:43,526
Bleu: Sure.

68
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:53,623
So through the lens of the theoretical

69
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:53,623
concepts developed in this book, feg and

70
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:53,623
traditional corporate governance Tcg are

71
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:53,623
assessing comparative perspective.

72
00:02:43,528 --> 00:03:01,646
Tcg models are predominantly

73
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:01,646
characterized by a compliance mentality

74
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:01,646
centered around board effectiveness as a

75
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:01,646
matter of managing agency conflicts of

76
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:01,646
interest.

77
00:02:53,624 --> 00:03:14,776
Through optimizing stereotypical board

78
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:14,776
diversity enforcing director

79
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:14,776
independence, feg introduces a radically

80
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:14,776
new logic, exercising the corporate

81
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:14,776
wholesale reinvention that strategic

82
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:14,776
renewal is now imposing.

83
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:20,839
Indeed, any such position of two

84
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:20,839
governance logics can hardly escape the

85
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:20,839
accusation of oversimplification.

86
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:31,945
However, once we embrace the world as

87
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:31,945
discontinuous and distributed, we start

88
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:31,945
understanding that today's entrenched

89
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:31,945
corporate governance approaches are a low

90
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:31,945
scale, low leverage, legacy business

91
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:31,945
creating inertia.

92
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:37,000
Tyler: Well, I'll just read this second

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
part.

94
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:40,031
Public policy prescribes best practices.

95
00:03:37,004 --> 00:04:01,180
Guiding corporate governance is an

96
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,180
anachronism of Modern business

97
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,180
reinforcing, upper echelon's, risk

98
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,180
aversiveness I e compromising epistemic

99
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,180
foraging, and consequently entrapment in

100
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,180
the incapacitating perception of the

101
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,180
world as volatile, uncertain, complex and

102
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,180
ambiguous or vuca.

103
00:03:40,032 --> 00:04:22,394
Free Energy Governance embraces any

104
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:22,394
dimension of vuca as information rich

105
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:22,394
input for top down, bottom up prediction,

106
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:22,394
error, minimization in pursuit of

107
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:22,394
minimizing surprise, an over reliance on

108
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:22,394
CEO framed information flows and

109
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:22,394
analysis, which is so characteristic of

110
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:22,394
traditional corporate governance, is as

111
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:22,394
good as flipping a coin.

112
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:26,437
The very processes that explain success

113
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:26,437
equally breed failure.

114
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:39,563
And this Table 10.1, there's a little bit

115
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:39,563
in the chapter, but this Table 10.1 is

116
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:39,563
one of the very few figures or tables

117
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:39,563
presented in the entire text, if not the

118
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:39,563
only one.

119
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:43,605
And here we can just see like, there's

120
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:43,605
three columns.

121
00:04:39,568 --> 00:04:52,694
The first is the logic, and then the

122
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:52,694
second is Free Energy Governance, like

123
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:52,694
how it relates to that logic.

124
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:57,742
And then the third column is Traditional

125
00:04:57,742 --> 00:04:57,742
Corporate Governance and how that relates

126
00:04:57,742 --> 00:04:57,742
to the logic.

127
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:59,762
For example.

128
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:20,911
So here the structure or hierarchy is the

129
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:20,911
logic where the Free Energy Governance

130
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:20,911
method is top down, bottom up, top down

131
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:20,911
belief propagation and bottom up message

132
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:20,911
passing in circular, causality,

133
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:20,911
unidirectional, upper echelon belief

134
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:20,911
propagation only.

135
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:23,946
So there's not that bi directional

136
00:05:23,946 --> 00:05:23,946
information flow.

137
00:05:20,912 --> 00:05:29,006
And the process for Free Energy

138
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:29,006
Governance is generative or continuous.

139
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:35,064
And traditional corporate governance is

140
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:35,064
static or agenda driven.

141
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:43,144
Capabilities are metadatmic cognitive in

142
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:43,144
Free Energy Governance and operational or

143
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:43,144
domain centric.

144
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:53,243
In traditional corporate governance, the

145
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:53,243
dominant neural network is this direct

146
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:53,243
no, default default mode network.

147
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:54,253
Direct default.

148
00:05:53,244 --> 00:05:57,283
I think it's default default mode centric

149
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:57,283
network.

150
00:05:54,254 --> 00:06:02,270
And then the traditional corporate

151
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:02,270
governance is task positive network

152
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:02,270
centric.

153
00:05:57,285 --> 00:06:03,287
So this is interesting to me.

154
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:20,455
I thought that when we were talking about

155
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:20,455
these neural networks, it was really like

156
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:20,455
the conjunction of the two networks that

157
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:20,455
I thought was characteristic of Free

158
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:20,455
Energy Governance, as opposed to one

159
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:20,455
neural network being more dominant than

160
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:20,455
another.

161
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:22,473
Did you guys get that too?

162
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:25,502
Or is this like I don't know.

163
00:06:22,474 --> 00:06:27,524
To me, I think that this is kind of

164
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:27,524
weird.

165
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:29,541
This took me by surprise.

166
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:39,640
Bleu: I think when they say, like, Dmn

167
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Centric, they're not saying that one is

168
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:39,640
limited to Free Energy Governance or

169
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Tcg.

170
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:45,709
They're just saying that there's more of

171
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:45,709
an emphasis on this kind of exploratory

172
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:45,709
default mode processing with Free Energy

173
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:45,709
Governance.

174
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:53,787
But you still have to switch between

175
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:53,787
explore and exploit or actually not

176
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:53,787
switch between, but pursue them both

177
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:53,787
simultaneously.

178
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:57,824
And so both are happening in parallel is

179
00:06:57,824 --> 00:06:57,824
my understanding, at least.

180
00:06:53,788 --> 00:07:01,801
Daniel: Yeah, agreed with that, Tyler.

181
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:09,882
And also, is it the case that the normal

182
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:09,882
operating function is task oriented and

183
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:09,882
then we pull back to review?

184
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:18,970
Or is it the case that we're pulled back

185
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:18,970
in review and then we drop into the task

186
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:18,970
that's like Dmn Centric?

187
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:21,008
But in both cases, you still would want

188
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:21,008
the effective Oscillation.

189
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:36,157
Tyler: And then the learning for Free

190
00:07:36,157 --> 00:07:36,157
Energy Governance is double loop learning

191
00:07:36,157 --> 00:07:36,157
and single loop prevails in the

192
00:07:36,157 --> 00:07:36,157
traditional corporate governance.

193
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:49,287
And then there's different performance

194
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:49,287
metrics and performance variables and

195
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:49,287
corporate purpose, which I don't know

196
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:49,287
that we got too into that.

197
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:57,368
This is kind of maybe was, like,

198
00:07:57,368 --> 00:07:57,368
lacking.

199
00:07:54,329 --> 00:08:00,333
So I was surprised to see this here the

200
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:00,333
corporate purpose.

201
00:07:57,369 --> 00:08:08,410
So he says, in free energy governance,

202
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:08,410
it's existential and axiomatically

203
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:08,410
integral to the free energy minimizing

204
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:08,410
governance mandate.

205
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:15,484
Like the purpose of that, where in

206
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:15,484
traditional corporate governance, it's

207
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:15,484
diffuse and opportunistic with no

208
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:15,484
relevance to governance.

209
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:20,534
So maybe I just skimmed over that or

210
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:20,534
blanked it from the text.

211
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:23,564
Bleu: Yeah, I think it was from the very

212
00:08:23,564 --> 00:08:23,564
first chapter.

213
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:36,695
So this is like, what, 13 live streams

214
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:36,695
ago that they're just linking, like

215
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:36,695
corporations want to survive, linking

216
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:36,695
that very much into calling out the

217
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:36,695
corporate purpose is to survive and

218
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:36,695
continue on.

219
00:08:23,564 --> 00:08:40,734
Tyler: Cool.

220
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:55,881
So then the second part of this table, we

221
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:55,881
talked about strategic and financial

222
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:55,881
control, like the dual mandate management

223
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:55,881
in Feg, where traditional corporate

224
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:55,881
governance is focused on financial

225
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:55,881
environmental engagement.

226
00:08:40,735 --> 00:09:08,954
We talked about infra energy governance

227
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:08,954
as enactments with traditional corporate

228
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:08,954
governance is adaptation digital

229
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:08,954
transformation, which is like, that's

230
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:08,954
interesting.

231
00:08:55,883 --> 00:09:10,978
It's an interesting logic.

232
00:09:09,964 --> 00:09:23,105
Like the logic of digital transformation,

233
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:23,105
where Feg is holistic wholesale

234
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:23,105
reinvention and traditional corporate

235
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:23,105
governance is selective transformation or

236
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:23,105
domain specific.

237
00:09:10,978 --> 00:09:29,164
But I'm having a hard time relating to

238
00:09:29,164 --> 00:09:29,164
this digital transformation logic.

239
00:09:24,118 --> 00:09:32,195
I don't know if you guys want to shed

240
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:32,195
more light on that.

241
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:38,256
Bleu: I think what he potentially might

242
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:38,256
mean is say that you're a business that

243
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:38,256
sells something and you sell it over the

244
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:38,256
counter, right?

245
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:42,299
The selective transformation would be

246
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:42,299
like, okay, well, now we have like, a web

247
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:42,299
checkout flow.

248
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:54,410
But the digital, like the wholesale

249
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:54,410
reinvention could be like using AI to

250
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:54,410
take your bottoms up input to transform

251
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:54,410
those into top down predictions, right?

252
00:09:43,300 --> 00:10:04,450
Like really doing something fundamentally

253
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:04,450
different with your digital tools rather

254
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:04,450
than just like, mapping physical

255
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:04,450
processes into a digital is my

256
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:04,450
understanding.

257
00:09:54,411 --> 00:10:13,548
Tyler: And then strategic renewal is

258
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:13,548
autonomous under free energy governance

259
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:13,548
proactive.

260
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:25,663
And it's like this dual information flow

261
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:25,663
again, where in traditional corporate

262
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:25,663
governance, it's induced or reactive top

263
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:25,663
down mandates driven by belief

264
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:25,663
propagation.

265
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:28,690
The machine learning logic.

266
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,713
I thought this was cool.

267
00:10:29,702 --> 00:10:38,797
And maybe I don't know, maybe Daniel

268
00:10:38,797 --> 00:10:38,797
wants to speak more to this as we've been

269
00:10:38,797 --> 00:10:38,797
talking about the need for free energy

270
00:10:38,797 --> 00:10:38,797
minimization active inference lab or

271
00:10:38,797 --> 00:10:38,797
not.

272
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:47,880
So the machine learning logic in free

273
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:47,880
energy governance is optimizing the

274
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:47,880
principle of least action to resist

275
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:47,880
dissipation in order to persist.

276
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:54,955
In traditional corporate governance, it's

277
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:54,955
like supervised or rule based maximizing

278
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:54,955
predetermined reward functions.

279
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:55,965
I don't know.

280
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,986
Daniel, do you want to speak any more to

281
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:57,986
that?

282
00:10:55,965 --> 00:11:00,956
I know you've been thinking about it.

283
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,970
Daniel: Okay.

284
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:06,013
The first thought was free energy bounds

285
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:06,013
surprisal.

286
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:09,049
We would minimize our surprisal if we had

287
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:09,049
the perfect generative model.

288
00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:18,135
So minimizing surprisal is like having

289
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:18,135
the most model evidence, and we're going

290
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:18,135
to bound surprisal with free energy

291
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:18,135
minimization.

292
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:30,251
And so in this machine learning logic,

293
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:30,251
it's almost like we're going to bound our

294
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:30,251
surprisal so that we can persist and

295
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:30,251
thrive in our niche.

296
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:49,447
On the other side, it's almost like we're

297
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:49,447
going to be following best practices and

298
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:49,447
compliance, getting to the governance

299
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:49,447
mandate below, we're going to be bounding

300
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:49,447
and staying within the lines on all of

301
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:49,447
the checklists.

302
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:53,482
And then question mark, question mark,

303
00:11:53,482 --> 00:11:53,482
question mark.

304
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:56,513
We will have impact in the niche.

305
00:11:54,492 --> 00:12:24,737
Whereas in free energy governance,

306
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:24,737
surprisal minimization bounding as a

307
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:24,737
first imperative ends up taking on some

308
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:24,737
of those outcomes that under the

309
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:24,737
traditional corporate governance column,

310
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:24,737
would be seen as consequences of reducing

311
00:12:24,737 --> 00:12:24,737
mismatch with compliance and regulation.

312
00:11:56,517 --> 00:12:29,781
Tyler: Cool.

313
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:30,790
Thank you.

314
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:37,861
And then finally, the final item in the

315
00:12:37,861 --> 00:12:37,861
table, the logic is the governance

316
00:12:37,861 --> 00:12:37,861
mandate.

317
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:44,931
Under free energy governance is

318
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:44,931
continuous strategic renewal, firm

319
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:44,931
outperformance and firm survival.

320
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:58,077
So, like optimizing governance and

321
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:58,077
operational coupling, environmental

322
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:58,077
enactment and dynamic duality management

323
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:58,077
of exploration and exploitation as well

324
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:58,077
as financial and strategic control, all

325
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:58,077
powered by inactive inference.

326
00:12:45,949 --> 00:13:14,171
And then traditional corporate governance

327
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:14,171
is regulatory compliance, board

328
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:14,171
effectiveness from performance by

329
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:14,171
monitoring, advising, challenging,

330
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:14,171
boundary spanning networking, all guided

331
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:14,171
by Ceocentric and principally upper

332
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:14,171
echelon dominated frames.

333
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:28,317
And so this table in a nutshell really

334
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:28,317
sums up a lot of the concepts that we've

335
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:28,317
discussed throughout the text and what we

336
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:28,317
are kind of looking for in this new

337
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:28,317
governance model.

338
00:13:14,174 --> 00:13:36,389
Maybe tyler, do you want to read the

339
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,389
first half of this abstract for chapter

340
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,389
eleven?

341
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:47,506
Bleu: So how can one possibly redefine

342
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:47,506
the board's strategic meta role when

343
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:47,506
traditional governance modes are

344
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:47,506
ridiculously entrenched in cognitive

345
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:47,506
capabilities so poorly developed or non

346
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:47,506
manifest?

347
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:55,586
To be practice relevant theory must be

348
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:55,586
intuitive and inspire upper Echelon

349
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:55,586
questioning it's very habits of mind to

350
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:55,586
conceive strategic renewal as

351
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:55,586
continuous.

352
00:13:47,508 --> 00:13:57,606
Enjoying the process of top down

353
00:13:57,606 --> 00:13:57,606
predictions.

354
00:13:55,586 --> 00:14:10,674
Bottom up stimuli surprise minimization

355
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:10,674
urges upper echelon to consequently

356
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:10,674
optimize the multi intelligent sources of

357
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:10,674
stimuli, redesign processes as well as

358
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:10,674
incentive structures and develop a new

359
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:10,674
language to empower active inference

360
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:10,674
lab.

361
00:13:57,606 --> 00:14:18,758
Indeed, to date, corporate governance

362
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:18,758
research and practice are more concerned

363
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:18,758
with defining behavioral responsibilities

364
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:18,758
rather than addressing its very

365
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:18,758
capability needs.

366
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:24,813
Tyler: Thanks, I'll take this second

367
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:24,813
part.

368
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:38,951
There is no one size fits all best

369
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:38,951
practices catalog, but effigy's nexus of

370
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:38,951
structure, cognition and capabilities

371
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:38,951
provides the building blocks for a

372
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:38,951
fundamentally new governance logic in a

373
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:38,951
discontinuous world.

374
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:47,042
The essential governance challenge is to

375
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:47,042
ensure the self organizing optimization

376
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:47,042
of top down, bottom up prediction error

377
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:47,042
minimization, learning to infer.

378
00:14:38,952 --> 00:15:01,123
Once we embrace Fpg as a novel

379
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:01,123
organizational framework and early

380
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:01,123
detector of a firm's impending entropic

381
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:01,123
decay, we must reckon that unless

382
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:01,123
replaced with an Fpg inspired logic,

383
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:01,123
traditional corporate governance is

384
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:01,123
likely to continue.

385
00:14:47,044 --> 00:15:17,282
Relegating the board of directors to

386
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:17,282
strategic irrelevance reinforce financial

387
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:17,282
control at the expense of strategic

388
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:17,282
control, prioritize top down content over

389
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:17,282
top down, bottom up processes, cultivate

390
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:17,282
inertia and inhibit the full growth and

391
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:17,282
survival potential of firms as self

392
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:17,282
organizing systems.

393
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:25,362
And so this chapter had some sections in

394
00:15:25,362 --> 00:15:25,362
it that I just tried to summarize here.

395
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:30,415
And so he talks about the dimensions of

396
00:15:30,415 --> 00:15:30,415
the theory and like the relevance.

397
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:37,481
He says the relevance of theory to the

398
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:37,481
practice of strategy management and

399
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:37,481
governance is essentially determined by

400
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:37,481
three dimensions.

401
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:42,537
Theory must, first, be intuitive as well

402
00:15:42,537 --> 00:15:42,537
as problem or opportunity driven.

403
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:55,667
Second, establish new metaphors or give

404
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:55,667
new meaning to existing language that

405
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:55,667
empowers purposeful sensing, sense

406
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:55,667
making, and strategic, and third, inspire

407
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:55,667
upper echelon questioning its very habits

408
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:55,667
of mind.

409
00:15:42,539 --> 00:16:00,654
I e provide a new and enriching

410
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:00,654
perspective around doing things

411
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:00,654
differently.

412
00:15:55,668 --> 00:16:13,784
And I brought up the theory particularly

413
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:13,784
because what's not here in the dimension

414
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:13,784
of a theory or the relevance of theory to

415
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:13,784
the practice of strategy management.

416
00:16:01,663 --> 00:16:16,818
And I don't have any background in this,

417
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:16,818
so maybe, Tyler, you want to say some

418
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:16,818
more about it.

419
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:36,012
But I feel like the relevance of theory

420
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:36,012
to the practice of strategy management

421
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:36,012
for me, what's missing through this text,

422
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:36,012
I think we're getting a little bit more

423
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:36,012
into it now, and we've uncovered it, but

424
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:36,012
it's not very obvious is like, how do you

425
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:36,012
find a practice that's grounded in this

426
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:36,012
theory?

427
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:42,073
Like, what are specific practices that

428
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:42,073
this theory is imploring us as a firm to

429
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:42,073
do so I don't know.

430
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:43,088
Tyler, do you want to speak maybe to

431
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:43,088
that?

432
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:48,131
And just in terms of strategy management

433
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:48,131
overall, do all theories do that?

434
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:51,159
Or am I just like, where is the hard

435
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:51,159
evidence?

436
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:52,177
Maybe I'm just being a stickler.

437
00:16:51,161 --> 00:17:00,192
Bleu: Well, first off, like, a good

438
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:00,192
grounding in economics and corporate

439
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:00,192
theory is that most of it is wrong, like,

440
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:00,192
completely bullshit.

441
00:16:52,178 --> 00:17:07,261
A lot of even microeconomics theory is

442
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:07,261
totally debunked, never was correct in

443
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:07,261
the first place.

444
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:14,333
And so there's a very low bar for having

445
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:14,333
a good theory for economics or corporate

446
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:14,333
governance.

447
00:17:07,262 --> 00:17:25,449
With that said, I'm trying to think of

448
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:25,449
what makes free energy governance

449
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:25,449
different to process than other kind of

450
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:25,449
business management theories in the past,

451
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:25,449
and usually with other business

452
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:25,449
management theories.

453
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:31,505
Do these 15 steps, or here is your best

454
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:31,505
practice guide to what this looks like.

455
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:36,556
Whereas with free energy governance, it's

456
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:36,556
like not that at all, because it has to

457
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:36,556
be receptive to your environment.

458
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:44,637
So it really demands a spiritual

459
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:44,637
embodiment of these principles to really

460
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:44,637
do or even understand at all.

461
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:48,672
It really is like a spiritual I keep

462
00:17:48,672 --> 00:17:48,672
coming back to that.

463
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:49,680
That's what it feels like.

464
00:17:48,672 --> 00:17:59,780
And you have to really own this and

465
00:17:59,780 --> 00:17:59,780
internalize it for it to be used, whereas

466
00:17:59,780 --> 00:17:59,780
you don't have to feel that with anything

467
00:17:59,780 --> 00:17:59,780
else in economics or corporate

468
00:17:59,780 --> 00:17:59,780
governance.

469
00:17:49,681 --> 00:18:00,736
You can just follow the steps.

470
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:10,834
But here, a lot of the same things we

471
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:10,834
talk about free energy governance are the

472
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:10,834
same ways we talk about creativity, for

473
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:10,834
example, and a lot of spiritual

474
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:10,834
practices.

475
00:18:00,737 --> 00:18:18,918
It's like a very receptive, dynamic

476
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:18,918
environmental practice, which you really

477
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:18,918
can't just put down to a series of

478
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:18,918
concrete steps.

479
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:28,001
And so that's why I think this is both so

480
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:28,001
powerful and also so frustrating at the

481
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:28,001
same time, because it's just like, how do

482
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:28,001
you be creative I don't know.

483
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:32,005
This is something you figure out by in

484
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:32,005
conversation with your environment,

485
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:32,005
right?

486
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:34,007
It's the same thing with free Energy

487
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:34,007
Governance.

488
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:36,009
Like the most powerful things you can get

489
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:36,009
from this theory.

490
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:39,012
No one's going to be able to directly

491
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:39,012
teach you.

492
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:41,013
You have to kind of just live it.

493
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:56,029
So calling this a theory is like even

494
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:56,029
though it is grounded in hardcore maths,

495
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:56,029
at least for the way a lot of business

496
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:56,029
people, including myself, will practice,

497
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:56,029
it does not feel that way at all.

498
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:59,032
It feels much more of like a spiritual

499
00:18:59,032 --> 00:18:59,032
mindset.

500
00:18:56,029 --> 00:19:06,033
And that's very new for a lot of these

501
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:06,033
kind of I haven't experienced that before

502
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:06,033
in a business context.

503
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:09,036
Daniel: I'll give a few other notes.

504
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:10,037
Thank you, Tyler.

505
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:11,038
Very interesting.

506
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:19,046
The first point that theory should be

507
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:19,046
problem or opportunity oriented, I think

508
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:19,046
Bleu.

509
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:24,051
That's where we would feel like we were

510
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:24,051
getting our hands dirty with the theory.

511
00:19:20,046 --> 00:19:39,066
And free energy governance gives a

512
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:39,066
continuity between what might be

513
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:39,066
happening in the analytics department

514
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:39,066
with the actual generative models, and in

515
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:39,066
the Communications department and the

516
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:39,066
tools they use and in the boardroom.

517
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:58,085
Whereas one thing that we could say about

518
00:19:58,085 --> 00:19:58,085
the traditional corporate governance

519
00:19:58,085 --> 00:19:58,085
theories is whether they were more

520
00:19:58,085 --> 00:19:58,085
mindset based or more behavioral and

521
00:19:58,085 --> 00:19:58,085
practice based, their limitation in

522
00:19:58,085 --> 00:19:58,085
relevance was that they were doing these

523
00:19:58,085 --> 00:19:58,085
three points.

524
00:19:39,066 --> 00:20:02,083
But then what would the work actually be

525
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:02,083
about?

526
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:05,086
What would the machine learning engineer

527
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:05,086
actually be doing?

528
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:07,088
Something totally ad hoc.

529
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:18,099
So there was always this disarticulation

530
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:18,099
between the narratives and the values and

531
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:18,099
the broader purpose of the organization

532
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:18,099
and then the implementation.

533
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:24,105
So here we're coming from the upper

534
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:24,105
echelon to the front line.

535
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:44,125
And part of Feg is, I think, that by

536
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:44,125
being imbued in theory, even if this book

537
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:44,125
was not heavily equation or simulation

538
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:44,125
based yet, it can provide continuity

539
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:44,125
within the organism, within the

540
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:44,125
corporation.

541
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:53,134
Tyler: So I like hear that you brought in

542
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:53,134
spirituality, Tyler.

543
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:54,135
And I'm sorry.

544
00:20:53,134 --> 00:21:14,149
It says my Internet connection is

545
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,149
unstable, so I'll apologize in advance if

546
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,149
I'm cutting in and out, but I like how

547
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,149
you brought in spirituality to this and

548
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,149
also creativity, because here it's like

549
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,149
the the job of the theory is to inspire

550
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,149
upper echelon, like questioning their own

551
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,149
habits, right?

552
00:20:54,135 --> 00:21:18,153
And so in this way, it's like a coon,

553
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:18,153
right?

554
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:22,157
It's like some puzzle that you sit down

555
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:22,157
to just think about and solve and reflect

556
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:22,157
upon.

557
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:27,162
So the job of the theory is to be like a

558
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:27,162
spiritual coon, to just think about it.

559
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:32,167
And then, secondly, the creativity part.

560
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:33,168
You're talking about?

561
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,169
Creativity, Tyler.

562
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:37,172
And also interaction with the

563
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:37,172
environment.

564
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:41,176
It's brought about literally by

565
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:41,176
interacting with the environment.

566
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:45,180
And there's a really cool book that I

567
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,180
don't know if either of you guys have

568
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,180
read or heard about.

569
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:47,182
It's called the Artist's way.

570
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:56,191
And literally, it's just like a series of

571
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:56,191
tasks that get you into your environment

572
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:56,191
so that you're inspired to be more

573
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:56,191
creative.

574
00:21:47,182 --> 00:22:03,192
It's like a series of just like in its

575
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
own way, like its own riddle or puzzle to

576
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
be reflected on.

577
00:21:56,191 --> 00:22:07,196
That's what they lead you through in that

578
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:07,196
book.

579
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:18,207
Bleu: That's actually why I mentioned

580
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:18,207
that, because I'm simultaneously reading

581
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:18,207
The Artist's Way and also Rick Rubin

582
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:18,207
famous producer, he just released a book

583
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:18,207
about creativity.

584
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:28,217
And the way that they were talking about

585
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:28,217
creativity in both these books is very

586
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:28,217
much about bottoms up, sense making and

587
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:28,217
listening to your environment.

588
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:35,224
I was like, wow, a lot of these the

589
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:35,224
language is the same with free energy

590
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:35,224
governance because at some level we're

591
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:35,224
talking about the same thing.

592
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:49,238
And so it's just like, again, that's one

593
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:49,238
of the things I love about free energy

594
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:49,238
governance is that it is so broad and can

595
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:49,238
encompass all these different disciplines

596
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:49,238
from creativity, corporate governance,

597
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:49,238
ant, colonies, whatever.

598
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:52,241
Daniel: Just a few short notes.

599
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:57,245
Receptivity is not passivity, it's the

600
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:57,245
opposite.

601
00:22:52,241 --> 00:23:07,250
It's the sentient engagement and the

602
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:07,250
receptivity with the generative process

603
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:07,250
that fine tunes our generative model so

604
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:07,250
that we can be who we expect and prefer

605
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:07,250
to be.

606
00:22:57,246 --> 00:23:11,254
So receptive and engaged with the niche

607
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:11,254
does not mean sitting back.

608
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:13,256
That's probably been clear.

609
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:19,262
And then also the framework shouldn't be

610
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:19,262
providing specifics.

611
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:30,273
I know that's a normative claim, but it's

612
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:30,273
like if somebody said, I have a linear

613
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:30,273
regression machine and it always comes up

614
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:30,273
with positive linear regressions, it'd be

615
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:30,273
like, well, let's maybe separate that.

616
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:40,283
Let's have the neutral linear regressor,

617
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:40,283
and then we can have a second order

618
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:40,283
preference for ones that are positive or

619
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:40,283
let's filter out the ones that are

620
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:40,283
positive only.

621
00:23:30,273 --> 00:24:06,303
So in a way because it is a framework or

622
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:06,303
a theory for this strategic renewal

623
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:06,303
discussion, which is the positioning of

624
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:06,303
the book, it is at a level above any

625
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:06,303
specific practice because just like you

626
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:06,303
couldn't say, well, a wing or a tooth or

627
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:06,303
a poison is like simply a high fitness

628
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:06,303
adaptation of an organism outside of its

629
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:06,303
context and niche.

630
00:23:41,284 --> 00:24:15,312
There's no practice or any pattern that

631
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:15,312
would apply to all different organisms or

632
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:15,312
organizations in their niche.

633
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:34,331
So the discussion had to be moved back to

634
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:34,331
this not ultimately neutral space, in

635
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:34,331
fact a very principled space, but one

636
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:34,331
that gave the expressivity to then

637
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:34,331
specialize according to the dimensions

638
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:34,331
that we basically looked at in the parts

639
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:34,331
of the book and in this table from

640
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:34,331
today.

641
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:39,336
Tyler: Awesome, thanks.

642
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:52,349
Okay, so moving on from the dimensions of

643
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:52,349
theory, I think Bijean goes through a

644
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:52,349
very good summary of all of the things up

645
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:52,349
until this point.

646
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:54,351
I think so.

647
00:24:52,349 --> 00:25:02,353
He says free energy governance provides

648
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:02,353
rich and new meaning to existing concepts

649
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:02,353
and establishes new relationships.

650
00:24:54,351 --> 00:25:09,360
First, top down, bottom up prediction

651
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:09,360
processing is applied to strategic

652
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:09,360
management and defined in form of a

653
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:09,360
generative process.

654
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:12,363
Integrating circular causality in

655
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:12,363
circular causality.

656
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:24,375
Top down belief propagation and bottom up

657
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:24,375
message passing in pursuit of one

658
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:24,375
objective, minimize surprise, to resist,

659
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:24,375
entropy to persist, powered by one first

660
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:24,375
order principle of least action.

661
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:25,376
I e.

662
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:30,381
Free Energy Minimization, a purpose

663
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
directed firm is the foundation for free

664
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
Energy governance's.

665
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:34,385
Top down, bottom up, circular causality

666
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:34,385
to come and stay alive.

667
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:49,400
And he goes on to say, in the same

668
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,400
context, that upper echelon communication

669
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,400
is centered around four dimensions

670
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,400
dynamically linked in feg circular

671
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,400
causality, purpose prediction models,

672
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,400
predictions, and stimuli.

673
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:57,408
The simplicity and plasticity of the

674
00:25:57,408 --> 00:25:57,408
language are critical to ensure that

675
00:25:57,408 --> 00:25:57,408
reach and inclusion of team members are

676
00:25:57,408 --> 00:25:57,408
optimized.

677
00:25:50,401 --> 00:26:02,407
More importantly, firm members must be

678
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:02,407
incentivized to stimuli.

679
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:16,421
Challenge predictions underlying

680
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:16,421
prediction models according to the first

681
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:16,421
order free Energy Organization principle

682
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:16,421
will self evidently evolve by the way of

683
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:16,421
unsupervised self organization.

684
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:24,429
And he refers back to the structure,

685
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:24,429
cognition and capabilities that we've

686
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:24,429
been linking through this entire text.

687
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:33,438
So this I like, but I'm not sure how to.

688
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:41,446
He says the simplicity and plasticity of

689
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:41,446
the language are critical to ensure that

690
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:41,446
reach and inclusion of team members are

691
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:41,446
optimized.

692
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:44,449
I'm not sure how to do that.

693
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:53,458
How do you make language simple and

694
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:53,458
plastic to ensure optimal reach and

695
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:53,458
inclusion inclusivity?

696
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:56,460
I don't know if you guys have thoughts on

697
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:56,460
that.

698
00:26:54,459 --> 00:27:00,459
I'm like, where are my step by step

699
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:00,459
procedures that I'm supposed to follow to

700
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:00,459
make this happen?

701
00:26:56,461 --> 00:27:05,464
Daniel: I think there's many angles on

702
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:05,464
it.

703
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:06,465
Just a few comments.

704
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:17,476
One, a starting point would be making

705
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:17,476
sure that the language are in the native

706
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:17,476
or preferred tongue of that person or

707
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:17,476
augmented entity.

708
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:28,487
So having Active inference lab ontology

709
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:28,487
translated into multiple language is one

710
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:28,487
first step, but then there's some second

711
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:28,487
order considerations about still using

712
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:28,487
language.

713
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:31,490
And then the self organization.

714
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:43,502
I thought, well, just pouring water on a

715
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:43,502
mountain landscape, the water is going to

716
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:43,502
self organize, but it might not follow

717
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:43,502
the path of least action to organize the

718
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:43,502
way you want.

719
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:51,510
Okay, so then you modify the generative

720
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,510
model or the generative process and you

721
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,510
put a ditch here and a wall here.

722
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:57,516
And again it follows a path of least

723
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
action and it self organizes given the

724
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
constraints.

725
00:27:52,511 --> 00:28:02,515
So it's like a combination of whatever

726
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:02,515
will be, will be.

727
00:27:57,516 --> 00:28:05,518
However it unfolds is how it is going to

728
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:05,518
unfold.

729
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:10,523
We can't really descent from that level

730
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:10,523
of tautology.

731
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:21,534
However, that is the space which

732
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:21,534
modifications of the niche and of the

733
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:21,534
generative model can then self organize

734
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:21,534
to be whatever it will be.

735
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:33,546
Tyler: That speaks a lot too to the

736
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:33,546
receptivity and action or interaction.

737
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:39,552
Active inference is interactive with the

738
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:39,552
environment and the niche, the inability

739
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:39,552
to separate those things.

740
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:43,556
Okay, so he says this is back here.

741
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:47,560
Free Energy Governance provides rich and

742
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:47,560
new meaning to existing concepts and

743
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:47,560
establishes new relationships.

744
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:51,564
So this is another one of the new

745
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:51,564
relationships that Bijean claims.

746
00:28:47,560 --> 00:29:02,569
He says enactment, coined by Karl Wick

747
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:02,569
and astutely applied by Smirchich and

748
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:02,569
Stubborn to strategy process, has

749
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:02,569
conceptually inspired Free Energy

750
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:02,569
Governance.

751
00:28:51,564 --> 00:29:06,573
And he goes on to say enactment is

752
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
redefined as Active Inference lab.

753
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:18,585
Essentially, Free Energy Governance is

754
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:18,585
liberating upper echelon from the

755
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:18,585
overwhelming cognitive distortion that

756
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:18,585
their biggest challenge is Taming or

757
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:18,585
Taming uncertainty, when instead they

758
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:18,585
should be really surfing it.

759
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:23,590
And this is kind of these cool two

760
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:23,590
references he throws in here.

761
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:36,603
Unless environment is redefined as a

762
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:36,603
purpose directed and action centric

763
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:36,603
generative prediction challenge in the

764
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:36,603
form of prediction error, minimization

765
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:36,603
firms will continue being incapacitated

766
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:36,603
by the faithful pursuit of adaptive

767
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:36,603
fitness.

768
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:47,614
More importantly, redefining strategy as

769
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:47,614
top down, bottom up predictive coding

770
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:47,614
lays the foundation to optimally leverage

771
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:47,614
and coevolve the human machine potential

772
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:47,614
cognition.

773
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:52,619
I don't know if you guys have comments

774
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:52,619
here on this or we can move on.

775
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:58,625
If not, okay.

776
00:29:52,619 --> 00:30:12,633
And then the third relationship that

777
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:12,633
Bijean describes is he says dynamic board

778
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:12,633
capabilities in the form of duality

779
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:12,633
management are an entirely new genre of

780
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:12,633
upper echelon capabilities that Feg

781
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:12,633
establishes.

782
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:24,645
He goes on to say that inactive

783
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:24,645
prediction processing becomes manifest in

784
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:24,645
duality management in the form of

785
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:24,645
balancing financial and strategic control

786
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:24,645
as well as exploitation and exploration.

787
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:32,653
Duality management is all about

788
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:32,653
probabilistic resource reconfigurations

789
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:32,653
in superposition waiting to be enacted.

790
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:37,658
Duality stewardship is effigy's essential

791
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:37,658
governance mandate.

792
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:48,669
And then he continues later the R and D

793
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:48,669
or research and development percentage

794
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:48,669
share of total revenues is potentially a

795
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:48,669
good indicator of a looming financial

796
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:48,669
control trap.

797
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:54,675
Within each industry there is a rough

798
00:30:54,675 --> 00:30:54,675
percentage benchmark for Rnd investment,

799
00:30:54,675 --> 00:30:54,675
for organic reinvention.

800
00:30:48,669 --> 00:31:05,680
Once a firm operates year on year below

801
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:05,680
industry R and D investment standards,

802
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:05,680
financial control is likely to be the

803
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:05,680
only control left and describes that as

804
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:05,680
the capabilities.

805
00:30:54,675 --> 00:31:11,686
And so here I really appreciate the

806
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
section of the book because I think that

807
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:11,686
we're starting to get some good.

808
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:14,689
Like how do we know if we're minimizing

809
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:14,689
free energy?

810
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:17,692
How do we know if we're adapting free

811
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:17,692
energy governance?

812
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:18,693
Are we doing a good job?

813
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:20,695
What are the benchmarks?

814
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:22,697
These are the kinds of things that I'm

815
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:22,697
looking for.

816
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:23,698
And so here I like this.

817
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:38,713
You have to be investing at least the

818
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:38,713
minimum industry industry standard into

819
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:38,713
research and development to ensure that

820
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:38,713
you're doing the strategic part and not

821
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:38,713
just going for financial exploitation.

822
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:40,715
Like the R and D is the exploration

823
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:40,715
part.

824
00:31:39,713 --> 00:31:46,721
And so I thought that this is kind of a

825
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:46,721
concrete application of what we've been

826
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:46,721
looking at so far.

827
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:46,721
Daniel?

828
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:47,722
Daniel: Yes.

829
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:48,723
Thank you.

830
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:55,730
The superposition, it's a quantum shout

831
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:55,730
out and it made me think about some task

832
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:55,730
that needs to be done.

833
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:59,734
We need to vectorize some images and then

834
00:31:59,734 --> 00:31:59,734
print stickers.

835
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:12,741
There's a superposition of plans we could

836
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:12,741
upskill, we could hire somebody, we could

837
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:12,741
acquire the company, we could do all of

838
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:12,741
these different plans, including

839
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:12,741
crossovers with the different plans.

840
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:20,749
And those pure plans, maybe in their

841
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:20,749
extreme form, are never even on the

842
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:20,749
table.

843
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:36,765
But the organization can think of its

844
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:36,765
strategy as this mixed state that is

845
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:36,765
truly quantum and it's doing a quantum

846
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:36,765
optimization over those pathways, maybe

847
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:36,765
not even needing to brute force through

848
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:36,765
them.

849
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:39,768
But rather just letting the quantum

850
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:39,768
annealing work its magic.

851
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:46,774
So that's one interesting, and then the

852
00:32:46,774 --> 00:32:46,774
other piece is, like you mentioned,

853
00:32:46,774 --> 00:32:46,774
Bleu.

854
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:54,783
Once the firm is below a critical point

855
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:54,783
in its research and development, only

856
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:54,783
financial control is left.

857
00:32:46,775 --> 00:33:03,786
And so it's almost like if there's still

858
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:03,786
wiggle room to turn left and right, it's

859
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:03,786
still a very maneuverable car.

860
00:32:54,783 --> 00:33:11,794
But if you're in a position where only

861
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:11,794
one of those sides wiggle can only happen

862
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:11,794
to one direction, like, okay, well, now

863
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:11,794
we need to be cutting costs.

864
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:13,796
That's our only degree of freedom is

865
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:13,796
cutting costs.

866
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:24,807
Now, it doesn't even say that's not going

867
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:24,807
to be a functional strategy, just that

868
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:24,807
that is on that pathway to entropic

869
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:24,807
decline.

870
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:32,815
Because by having a reduction of

871
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:32,815
affordances, you are on the pathway to

872
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:32,815
the ultimate reduction of affordances,

873
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:32,815
which is the failure to persist.

874
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:40,823
And as long as you have options on the

875
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:40,823
table and the expectation of future

876
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:40,823
options on the table, if not more, you're

877
00:33:40,823 --> 00:33:40,823
in the game of persisting.

878
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:47,830
Tyler: Well, thank you for those

879
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:47,830
thoughts.

880
00:33:46,828 --> 00:33:51,833
Okay.

881
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:56,838
Bijean says how to make it all work in

882
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:56,838
practice is a daunting task.

883
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:58,841
There is no best practices catalog.

884
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:02,839
First of all, best practices should be

885
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:02,839
considered a potential source of

886
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:02,839
inertia.

887
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:04,841
Like throw those things out the window.

888
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:05,842
We don't need them.

889
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:17,854
We need first order principles to empower

890
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:17,854
structural organization, formal and

891
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:17,854
informal throughput environmental

892
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:17,854
engagement and capability to foster self

893
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:17,854
organizing processes.

894
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:20,857
Free energy governance does exactly

895
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:20,857
this.

896
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:29,866
And Tyler, you had spoken earlier, too,

897
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:29,866
like the throwing away best practices

898
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:29,866
also, or like, there is not a map to do

899
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:29,866
that here in Free Energy Governance.

900
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:33,869
So we don't have a 15 step book.

901
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:46,883
Bleu: But it's also the case, too, if you

902
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:46,883
make this analogy between free energy

903
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:46,883
governance and creativity or

904
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:46,883
spirituality, it's always the case where

905
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:46,883
they can't say, okay, here's, follow

906
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:46,883
these steps, and this is exactly how it's

907
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:46,883
going to work out for you.

908
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:50,887
But I think what's effective a lot of

909
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:50,887
times, too, is like, hey, well, this is

910
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:50,887
what it doesn't look like.

911
00:34:46,883 --> 00:35:03,894
For example, if you find yourself kind of

912
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:03,894
enslaved to your addictions, for example,

913
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:03,894
you may not be on the spiritual path, or

914
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:03,894
you may be kind of like, off course a

915
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:03,894
little bit, right?

916
00:34:51,888 --> 00:35:09,900
So there are things that you can point

917
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:09,900
to, like, okay, well, I can't say define

918
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:09,900
what it is, but I can define what isn't.

919
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:16,907
And I think we have some good clues to

920
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:16,907
that from this book, even though it might

921
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:16,907
not be as prescriptive as we might like.

922
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:25,916
Tyler: All right.

923
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:30,921
And speaking of persisting, I almost

924
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:30,921
wanted to skip to this slide directly.

925
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:34,925
Why should this business exist and

926
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:34,925
prevail in the first place?

927
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:41,932
Bajan asked this question in the middle

928
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:41,932
of the book and I don't know, why do any

929
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:41,932
of us exist or prevail in the first

930
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:41,932
place?

931
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:45,936
We're all just hanging out, minimizing

932
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:45,936
free energy, taking the path of least

933
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:45,936
action.

934
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:46,937
I guess.

935
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,938
It's just interesting.

936
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:50,941
Why do you exist and prevail?

937
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:59,950
And he encourages people to ask

938
00:35:59,950 --> 00:35:59,950
themselves this as part of the governance

939
00:35:59,950 --> 00:35:59,950
mandate.

940
00:35:50,941 --> 00:36:01,946
Why should we exist and prevail?

941
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:03,948
For what reason?

942
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:06,951
I think that's always a good question.

943
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:17,962
Daniel: Yeah, one thought on that, we can

944
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:17,962
always take the how did things come to be

945
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:17,962
question and just whether we take that

946
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:17,962
descriptively or as a mystery.

947
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:23,968
But given where we are or how we

948
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:23,968
recognize ourselves, it's a little bit

949
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:23,968
like a stay or leave question.

950
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:32,977
We can stay on our path of least action,

951
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:32,977
or we can push the trim tab a little bit,

952
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:32,977
push the rudder a little bit, and then be

953
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:32,977
on a different path of least action.

954
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:41,985
So again, we don't get to dissent from

955
00:36:41,985 --> 00:36:41,985
being on a path of least ActInf, but we

956
00:36:41,985 --> 00:36:41,985
have affordances, which are our space of

957
00:36:41,985 --> 00:36:41,985
local adjacencies.

958
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:48,992
And this claim, as I think you're

959
00:36:48,992 --> 00:36:48,992
pointing to, it's something that the

960
00:36:48,992 --> 00:36:48,992
individual employee could ask

961
00:36:48,992 --> 00:36:48,992
themselves.

962
00:36:41,986 --> 00:36:53,998
It's something that the team could ask

963
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:53,998
themselves or the department and the

964
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:53,998
organization.

965
00:36:48,993 --> 00:37:01,000
And maybe the organization's level

966
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,000
conversation is happening in the

967
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,000
boardroom for certain kinds of

968
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,000
organizations.

969
00:36:54,999 --> 00:37:07,006
And it's like, should we make the next

970
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:07,006
six months look a lot like the last six

971
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:07,006
month?

972
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:11,010
Should we pivot in this direction, or

973
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:11,010
should we just shut it down?

974
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:27,026
And having a space for those kinds of

975
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:27,026
multilevel questions and meaning finding,

976
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:27,026
I think part of the subtext is that's not

977
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:27,026
a waste of time, that's not a distraction

978
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:27,026
from the work itself.

979
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:35,034
This is like the fountain that the work

980
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:35,034
performance or alignment on any given

981
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:35,034
scale actually flows from.

982
00:37:28,027 --> 00:37:53,052
Bleu: Yeah, just to add on that, I think

983
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:53,052
the context of this book has been large

984
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:53,052
corporations that there's like a legal

985
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:53,052
mandate for this thing to exist and for

986
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:53,052
you to meet the obligations of your

987
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:53,052
people who are financing the business.

988
00:37:37,036 --> 00:38:06,059
Whereas there might be more of lifestyle

989
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:06,059
businesses you might have, or there might

990
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:06,059
be a nonprofit or something where the

991
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:06,059
free energy governance mandate to survive

992
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:06,059
at all costs may not make as much sense.

993
00:37:53,052 --> 00:38:14,067
Like, maybe this business organization is

994
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
more of an extension of your personal

995
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
passion rather than being this own entity

996
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:14,067
that needs to survive on its own terms.

997
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:15,068
Right.

998
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:28,081
So I think it's also important to

999
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:28,081
reflect, like, okay, free energy

1000
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:28,081
governance is this useful frame for

1001
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:28,081
thinking about it, but am I really trying

1002
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:28,081
to create this larger entity that exists

1003
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:28,081
independently of myself, or is this what

1004
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:28,081
am I actually trying to do here?

1005
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:31,084
And is this a relevant framework?

1006
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:42,095
Daniel: One other thought on that with

1007
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:42,095
the organism organization conversation in

1008
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:42,095
mind are we a seasonal grass?

1009
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:44,097
Are we a 17 year cicada?

1010
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:52,105
And then have that conversation, even if

1011
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:52,105
that's playful or in the beginning stages

1012
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:52,105
of team formation or of dow formation.

1013
00:38:45,098 --> 00:39:14,121
So that if some people think that they're

1014
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
going to be building the 100,000 year

1015
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
Arctic vaults and some other group of

1016
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
people think that they're doing a one

1017
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
time concert, that those can be

1018
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
recognized and integrated in a way that

1019
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
isn't just as much of just like keep

1020
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
things going.

1021
00:38:52,105 --> 00:39:28,135
Which is how maybe this question can seem

1022
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:28,135
at first pass that it's just about

1023
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:28,135
existence and prevalence, but existence

1024
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:28,135
and prevalence in the biological space is

1025
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:28,135
so rich and complex that it would make

1026
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:28,135
sense.

1027
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:30,137
It would be that way for organizations

1028
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:30,137
too.

1029
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:36,143
Tyler: Definitely.

1030
00:39:35,142 --> 00:39:53,160
Okay, and then here Bijean quotes like,

1031
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,160
and this is part of a long quote and

1032
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,160
we're going to carry over these over

1033
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,160
across the next two slides, but he says,

1034
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,160
Jan Stalberg's practice relevant

1035
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,160
statements from Stalberg 2021.

1036
00:39:37,144 --> 00:40:01,162
The reference, if anybody wants to look

1037
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:01,162
it up, concerning transparency,

1038
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:01,162
communication and reaching out to the

1039
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:01,162
bottom should inspire management

1040
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:01,162
practice.

1041
00:39:53,160 --> 00:40:07,168
The first of these statements is everyone

1042
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,168
is informed in real time about

1043
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,168
everything.

1044
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:22,183
And then Stalberg goes on to say, I

1045
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:22,183
believe, looking at some of the core

1046
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:22,183
propositions of free energy governance,

1047
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:22,183
this is free energy governance connecting

1048
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:22,183
top and bottom in circular causality of

1049
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:22,183
sense making with the least friction and

1050
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:22,183
optimal response time.

1051
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:32,193
So this is like something that I've

1052
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:32,193
wondered about how do you prioritize

1053
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:32,193
information flow top down, bottom up,

1054
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:32,193
belief propagation and message passing?

1055
00:40:22,183 --> 00:40:38,199
And they're saying like, full

1056
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:38,199
transparency, everybody knows everything

1057
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:38,199
all of the time.

1058
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:46,207
And that to me was kind of like mind

1059
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:46,207
blowing because it's not how I would ever

1060
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:46,207
think to run a company.

1061
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:47,208
Like, not at all.

1062
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:50,211
Daniel: Daniel okay, I hear you on that.

1063
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:52,213
I have a slightly different reading

1064
00:40:52,213 --> 00:40:52,213
here.

1065
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:59,220
I'm just imagining starting with this

1066
00:40:59,220 --> 00:40:59,220
agreement, wherever you are, there you

1067
00:40:59,220 --> 00:40:59,220
are.

1068
00:40:53,214 --> 00:41:06,221
So whatever you're informed about, that's

1069
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:06,221
what you're informed about, whatever your

1070
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:06,221
situational awareness is, that's what it

1071
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:06,221
is.

1072
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:09,224
And then that's the part that's been

1073
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:09,224
infuriating.

1074
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:30,245
There is no suggestions for who should be

1075
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:30,245
in what messaging channel, or who should

1076
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:30,245
be on what email thread, or who should be

1077
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:30,245
in what video chat, but whatever we do

1078
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:30,245
decide with the chats and the emails and

1079
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:30,245
the meetings, that will be your local

1080
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:30,245
message passing, your information

1081
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:30,245
environment, your capacity for inference

1082
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:30,245
and action.

1083
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:36,251
So I don't think this means that every

1084
00:41:36,251 --> 00:41:36,251
single employee or contractor has the

1085
00:41:36,251 --> 00:41:36,251
full dashboard.

1086
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:48,263
I think everyone's dashboard is

1087
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:48,263
respected, though, as their dashboard,

1088
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:48,263
which helps bring the discussion to what

1089
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:48,263
function, what accessibility do they need

1090
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:48,263
and so on.

1091
00:41:37,252 --> 00:42:00,269
Bleu: Yeah, I think this is part one, but

1092
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
John was talking about a management

1093
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
theory called open governance, I think it

1094
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
was called, which is the extreme version

1095
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
of everyone knows everything all the

1096
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
time.

1097
00:41:49,263 --> 00:42:11,280
And he was criticizing that because he

1098
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,280
was saying, well, if you give everybody

1099
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,280
all the information all the time, that

1100
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,280
doesn't necessarily give them the tools

1101
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,280
for making meaning of that or having that

1102
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,280
be relevant to their specific context.

1103
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:22,291
So I think what he's implying here is,

1104
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:22,291
yes, you give everyone access to

1105
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:22,291
information as well as tools for

1106
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:22,291
processing that information in a locally

1107
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:22,291
relevant way.

1108
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:27,296
I don't think he means just like pure

1109
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:27,296
chaos information dump, but could be

1110
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:27,296
reading into it.

1111
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:38,307
Daniel: Okay, Blues, pause.

1112
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:40,309
But I hear you on that, Tyler.

1113
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:42,311
Bleu: Cool.

1114
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:45,314
Internet may have cut out.

1115
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:49,318
Daniel: Yes.

1116
00:42:48,317 --> 00:42:51,320
Tyler: Cool.

1117
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,323
Daniel: What other parts have you found

1118
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:54,323
interesting so far?

1119
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,323
Oh, there you go.

1120
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:55,324
You're back Bleu.

1121
00:42:54,323 --> 00:43:02,325
You're back Bleu.

1122
00:43:01,324 --> 00:43:03,326
Maybe you can disable your video.

1123
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:10,333
You can disable your video, Bleu.

1124
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:30,353
I want to give a thought on some

1125
00:43:30,353 --> 00:43:30,353
synchronous and asynchronous things, but

1126
00:43:30,353 --> 00:43:30,353
you never really know when it will be now

1127
00:43:30,353 --> 00:43:30,353
and real for Bleu.

1128
00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:33,356
But we're in a different now and real

1129
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:33,356
moment.

1130
00:43:30,353 --> 00:43:34,357
Tyler.

1131
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:38,361
Bleu: I think she's back in our now.

1132
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:41,364
Tyler: I think I got it.

1133
00:43:40,363 --> 00:43:42,365
Daniel: Okay.

1134
00:43:41,364 --> 00:43:42,365
Continue, Bleu.

1135
00:43:42,365 --> 00:43:43,366
Thank you.

1136
00:43:43,365 --> 00:43:44,367
It was fine.

1137
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:45,368
It's all fine.

1138
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:53,376
Tyler: Okay, so this is again to continue

1139
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:53,376
quoting Stalberg.

1140
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:59,382
Value creation, in my experience, has

1141
00:43:59,382 --> 00:43:59,382
been usually determined by a combination

1142
00:43:59,382 --> 00:43:59,382
of the following governance imperatives.

1143
00:43:53,376 --> 00:44:03,380
First, you must start with a clear

1144
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:03,380
purpose and long term goal.

1145
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:08,385
Prepare to invest for the long term and

1146
00:44:08,385 --> 00:44:08,385
infrastructure.

1147
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:11,388
Second, you need to continuously question

1148
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:11,388
yourself.

1149
00:44:08,385 --> 00:44:12,389
Paranoia is key.

1150
00:44:11,388 --> 00:44:15,392
Third, team decisions are critical.

1151
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:21,398
Create a culture that empowers and

1152
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:21,398
encourages people to contribute, to take

1153
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:21,398
decisions, and not to be risk averse.

1154
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:27,404
In summary, it really comes down to three

1155
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:27,404
things communication, transparency and

1156
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:27,404
respect.

1157
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:35,412
And so reading this whole quote in

1158
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:35,412
context is kind of what made me think

1159
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:35,412
that they're encouraging open channels of

1160
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:35,412
communication.

1161
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:43,420
Everything flows to all the people all

1162
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,420
the time, but it might not be the correct

1163
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:43,420
reading.

1164
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:52,429
And I do think that in what you're

1165
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:52,429
saying, Daniel, you have your information

1166
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:52,429
channel and you live in that river, and

1167
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:52,429
that is where everything comes to you in

1168
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:52,429
real time.

1169
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:52,429
And whatever.

1170
00:44:52,429 --> 00:44:56,433
You're just in the river that you can

1171
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:56,433
sense make about right.

1172
00:44:53,430 --> 00:45:00,431
You don't necessarily need to be in the

1173
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:00,431
ocean when you live in a river.

1174
00:44:56,433 --> 00:45:04,435
And then that makes more sense to me in

1175
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:04,435
terms of information flow.

1176
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:11,442
Do you guys have more thoughts here on

1177
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:11,442
value creation, transparency, respect,

1178
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:11,442
communication?

1179
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:12,443
No?

1180
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:12,443
Okay.

1181
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:14,445
All right.

1182
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:21,452
No.

1183
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:34,465
This is actually the essential governance

1184
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:34,465
challenge in a discontinuous and

1185
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:34,465
distributive world is now a matter of

1186
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:34,465
setting free the self organizing

1187
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:34,465
optimization of top down, bottom up

1188
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:34,465
prediction error minimization.

1189
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:37,468
Learning to infer the firm is the

1190
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:37,468
generative model.

1191
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:53,484
The continuous nature of strategic

1192
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:53,484
renewal makes prediction modeling as well

1193
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:53,484
as prediction error minimization an

1194
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:53,484
integral and direct default mode network

1195
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:53,484
centric dimension of traditional

1196
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:53,484
monitoring, advisory and boundary

1197
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:53,484
spanning board responsibilities.

1198
00:45:37,468 --> 00:46:03,488
Effectively, in the absence of board

1199
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:03,488
level medica facilities as developed in

1200
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:03,488
this book, the board can no longer

1201
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:03,488
fulfill even its most basic and

1202
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:03,488
traditional responsibilities.

1203
00:45:53,484 --> 00:46:16,500
And I think that maybe Bajan here is

1204
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:16,500
calling out the discontinuous nature of

1205
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:16,500
the world and how disruptions are regular

1206
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:16,500
and things move fast.

1207
00:46:04,489 --> 00:46:23,508
Change is always happening and the board

1208
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:23,508
needs to get on board or not.

1209
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:26,511
But that's the wrap up of this chapter.

1210
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:28,513
Do you guys have any thoughts on this?

1211
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:35,520
Daniel: Well, one thing is whatever is

1212
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:35,520
working in the niche today.

1213
00:46:31,516 --> 00:46:42,527
If you expect the niche to remain the

1214
00:46:42,527 --> 00:46:42,527
same, you can keep your strategy the

1215
00:46:42,527 --> 00:46:42,527
same, and it will be the same.

1216
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:51,536
However, biological ecosystems have

1217
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:51,536
variability and patterns over different

1218
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:51,536
timescales, and also organisms and

1219
00:46:51,536 --> 00:46:51,536
organizations develop.

1220
00:46:42,527 --> 00:47:06,545
So it'd be like saying if the two year

1221
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:06,545
old baby can't fulfill its meta

1222
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:06,545
capability to learn and to change, it

1223
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:06,545
will eventually no longer be able to

1224
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:06,545
fulfill even its most basic and

1225
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:06,545
traditional responsibilities.

1226
00:46:52,537 --> 00:47:31,570
And so that is where we start to see

1227
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:31,570
general claims about system operation and

1228
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:31,570
development and evolution and potentially

1229
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:31,570
the ways those are linked in the FEP with

1230
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:31,570
the kinds of conversations that today can

1231
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:31,570
happen by differently framing the upper

1232
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:31,570
echelon frontline dialectic.

1233
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:37,576
Tyler: Cool.

1234
00:47:37,576 --> 00:47:38,577
I think that that's it.

1235
00:47:37,576 --> 00:47:52,591
So we're going to get in next week to

1236
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:52,591
discuss the last two sections of the book

1237
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:52,591
and hopefully bring Bijean and maybe you,

1238
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:52,591
if you're interested, anyone else who's

1239
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:52,591
interested in maybe discussing this

1240
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:52,591
material.

1241
00:47:39,577 --> 00:47:56,595
Hopefully we'll get some new voices and

1242
00:47:56,595 --> 00:47:56,595
perspectives that would really be great.

1243
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:58,597
So thanks, guys.

1244
00:47:57,596 --> 00:48:00,593
Nice to see you.

1245
00:47:59,598 --> 00:48:01,594
Daniel: Thank you.

1246
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:02,595
Bye.
