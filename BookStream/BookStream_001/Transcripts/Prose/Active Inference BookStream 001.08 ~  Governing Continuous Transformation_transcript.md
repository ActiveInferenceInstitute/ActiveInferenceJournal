
00:06 _Daniel:_

Hello and welcome.
It is January 31, 2023.
We're here in Active Bookstream number 1.8.
Off to you, Bleu.

00:20 _Bleu:_

So we will be discussing this book, continuing our discussion of this book governing Continuous Transformation by Dean Kelsey.
We are the Active Inference participatory online institute that is communicating, learning, and practicing applied active inference.
You can reach us at all of our social media links.
This is a recorded and an archived live stream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve on our work.
All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here, and we will be following good video etiquette for live streams.

00:55 Again, if you would like to participate in this project or any activities that are ongoing in the Active Coherence Institute, please reach out to us.
There are plenty of ways to get connected and involved.
Okay, so the goal of today's bookstream is to continue our discussion of this book, and we will just be going through it as usual.
Just as always.
This is not a review or a final word over this material.

01:21 Just this is an introduction to some of the Dean.
Okay?
So just quick introduction for those of you who don't know us, I am Bleu Knight.
I've been involved in the Active Inference Institute for quite a while.
I'm an independent researcher in New Mexico, and I'll pass it off to Daniel.

01:44 _Daniel:_

Hi, Daniel.
I'm a researcher in California.
I'll pass to Tyler.

01:50 _Tyler:_

My name is Tyler.
I'm a critical designer and gab researcher in California.

01:57 _Bleu:_

All right, so today we're moving on to chapter eight of the book.
The title of this chapter is in part two, the Free Energy Governance section.
And the title of this chapter is Capabilities Duality Management.
And we'll talk more as we go on as to what duality management kind of means.
Okay, so there are two sections outlined by Bijan here in this chapter.

02:23 The dynamic capability view and antagonistic neural networks perspective.
There's a whole bunch of keywords and we'll just jump right into it.
Tyler, do you want to read this part of the abstract for us?
Sure.

02:38 _Tyler:_

Right, so abstract Dynamics Ambiguity View, DCV and Antagonistic Neural Networks Perspective amp address free Energy governance capabilities dimension the board's cognitive capabilities in terms of metamaging interdependently opposing logics as unity, are increasingly relevant to continuous strategic renewal.

02:58 Duality management, such as the vacillation between exploitation versus exploration and balancing financial strategic control, is established as a dynamic forward capability.
Effectively, FEG extends DCM to the board level.
More importantly, by adopting a free Energy principle powered perspective by redefining the firm as an active inference machine, DCB's tripletive sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring aspects operational such that firm is engaged as a whole.

03:26 _Bleu:_

Great.
So Antagonistic Neural Network Perspective is established and applied as the neuroscientific basis for duality management, managing the existing while contradicting the present to develop the future.
This task positive network, what is the other one?
GMM Dynamic Mode network.
I can't remember antagonism.

03:51 What is it?

03:55 Default mode network.
There it is.
Default mode network antagonism between exploitative task execution and exploration, abductive thinking is a neurological representation of the contradictory demands that challenges company's sustainable outperformance and survival.
The board's traditional monitoring and advisory roles must be explicitly complemented with a duality management mandate managing both of these networks.
More specifically, the board's dynamic capability of duality management lays the foundation for the board's newly established governance purpose and discontinuous and distributed markets.

04:32 Quote duality stewardship.
Yeah.
And so we'll get into these task positive and default mode networks as we get in later to this presentation.
All right, so this is a dynamic capability view.
I looked it up.

04:48 I found this cool image.
So Bijan says, sensing strategic opportunities in dynamic market environments, seizing the opportunity and reconfiguring a firm's resource base.
Accordingly, our dynamic capability views three central pillars and he cites this reference.
So here we see these fencing, seizing and managing.
Or I guess that's reconfiguring.

05:15 These are the three pillars and then they give some micro foundations like what is this encoding?
Seizing, reconfiguration, or managing threats?
So I don't know.
Tyler, do you have and thing to add here or maybe like specific examples?

05:33 To me, this is a very abstract diagram and I'm like what's going on here?

05:38 _Tyler:_

Yeah, I think this makes it more seem more difficult and complicated than it really is.
Where a lot of times is sensing a lot of that's where it's like that abductive reasoning.
We're saying like, hey, there's something here.
What could be true here?

05:51 How do I explain kind of these disparate signals I'm getting from the environment?
How do I make sense of this?
And we're seizing is like actually building the thing and managing threats and performing is like managing that thing you built over time.
And I think actually in the next slide it gives a really good example with Amazon Kindle, actually, maybe if you could just go to the next slide, I think it explains it well.
So, for example, it says, for example, amazon's launch of the Kindle 2006 involves sensing the impending threat of its core bookselling business, using the opportunity through rapid development of the first generative ebook reader and gradually reconfiguring its internal activities to ensure that the Kindle became an integrated part of its overall market offering.

06:34 _Bleu:_

Nice.
Thank you.
Bijan goes on to say in a similar manner to that in which organizational learning research distinguishes between single loop and double loop learning capability research also distinguishes between operational capabilities and dynamics capabilities.
And so in the text he gives some examples of operational capabilities like mergers and acquisitions and other things that are outside the scope of this dynamics capability view.
Okay, so start reading these claims.

07:08 So he says there has lately been a shift in dynamic capability view from behavioral to cognitive interpretations, explicating the cognitive microfoundations underpinning Tse's 2007 three core pillars of dynamic capabilities sensing perception, seizing sense making and asset configuration, language, communication and social cognition.
So this is like reframing again, those three pillars kind of more towards the active inference or free energy governance perspective.
He goes on to say, with respect to dynamic managerial capabilities for seizing and reconfiguring, in particular, we have emphasized ways in which top management can shape aspects of the organizational context, such as by encouraging cooperation, lowering resistance to change, designing a business model for a new venture, and investing in new skills and assets.
This suggests that managerial cognitive capabilities may function as mediators of the relationship between Chang Kim organizational context and strategic change, which in turn can affect firm performance.

08:13 Do either of you guys have any comments here?

08:16 Should we move to the next one?
Okay.
All right.
So I had to look this up because the term industrial vertical was brought up and I was like, what is industrial vertical?
It's more commonly called an industry vertical.

08:32 You can have it like in the industrial field and then it's like something different.
But an industry vertical is also known as a vertical market.
And it's like a unique business niche that serves a specific set of consumers or customers and their particular needs.
And there's tons of examples of that, like, I don't know, organic food and I don't know, like, solutions for biology lab.
Or there's all these niche markets and it's like if you're trying to sell chemicals to a biology lab, you're selling them like HPLC Purified acetic acid, and you're not selling that acetic acid to someone to use in their kitchen for a salad dressing, even though you're selling acetic acid.

09:16 Those are two totally different markets of people.
So you don't want to make a product that's bought by everyone because then it actually is not useful for anyone.
That was kind of my understanding.
Do you have anything to add, Tyler?

09:29 _Tyler:_

Yeah, I could give a little bit more color of examples here.

09:32 So an example of and industry vertical could be like movie making business, where on the top end you might have like where the movies are consumed.
It's a movie theater, and then you have how it's produced.
So you have studios, you have screenwriters, you have the people who are actually creating the equipment and making the film, right?
So it's basically like this big, kind of almost supply chain are these interrelated businesses that are all supporting each other to one final product.
So one thing I would add here too, that I think the genre would probably agree with is that in a more discontinuous world, the idea of an industry vertical is becoming a little bit more fuzzy.

10:05 And so, for example, in the past, you might say like, well, I have this I make chemicals for biology research, right?
But it could be the case that you also make chemicals that are used for hair products.
And so your verticals are increasingly becoming more fuzzy and intertwined.
It becomes harder to think about what niche do I actually serve, what is the market I'm in?
Right?

10:31 And it can be really hard to think that.
And that's where sensing really comes in handy is because you could be like, oh well, I thought I was making biology research chemicals.
But it turns out because I'm sensing and using my active reasoning and my best FEG perspective, I can then actually in the hair care market and that's where I really should be.
And so it's kind of the idea of a vertical becomes harder to define over time.

10:59 _Bleu:_

This website actually gave a lot of examples about how industry verticals allow companies that would sometimes be competitors to collaborate with each other.

11:11 Like, they talked about how the Samsung glass is used by the Apple iPhone, or maybe it's the other way around, but either way, like Samsung and like the Samsung phones and the Apple phones are normally like competitors in a market.
I don't even know that they computer anymore.
Like either you're a Mac person or you're an Android person.
I don't think that there's any competition there.
But maybe they're collaborating with the use of the glass and making it accessible to everyone just because everybody needs glass.

11:42 Right?
Okay, so Bishop also brought up oh yeah, here is the industrial vertical.
So let me read this from the book.
It says indeed, independently of industrial vertical, the increasingly distributed and discontinuous nature of market transforming forces cannot be overestimated.
However, market velocity is too generic of a concept.

12:05 And so I was trying to understand how he was using this term market velocity.
Here.
Market velocity, like when you Google it, it indicates the level of market activity in individual Nasdaq stocks.
By measuring the frequency and share volume in aggressively priced orders, it can indicate changes in market direction, momentum or liquidity in each stock, enabling users to imply future price movements and trades.
So that's how fast the market is moving, I guess.

12:35 And then it's also a company that recycles.
And velocity is a measure of two dimensions, right?
The speed of change and the change in dimension.
So I don't know the concept of market velocity here.
He goes on to computer it to environmental scarcity.

12:55 So the more suitable dynamics capability concept is environmental scarcity inspired by Cameron and Zuluto 1983, meaning meaningfully relating, sensing and sense making as meta capabilities respectively to eco niche dynamics and strategic renewal.
I don't know how environmental scarcity and market velocity, like how those two relate to each other.
I don't know if you guys can offer any insight here, but this is something that I would hold out and ask Bijan about.

13:25 _Tyler:_

Yeah, I think with market velocity, a lot of times when people talk about discontinuities and people who are not coming from an FPG background talking about hey, things are moving really quickly, it's more uncertain than ever.
They talk about market velocity, right.

13:41 Things are just changing all the time.
And I think what Bijan is saying is just saying that things are changing very quickly isn't very helpful to you because you're like, okay, cool.
Like life is hard, I get it.
Now what do I do with that information where when you present environmental scarcity, it's becoming a little bit more specific and how you can actually be more action oriented with it because you're like, okay, well, what's my niche and what are the meta capabilities I have to create to manage this uncertainty and create my own niche?
Whereas market velocity is kind of like being overwhelmed by uncertainty and being like, I don't know, things are hard.

14:14 Like this is scary.
That's at least my take.

14:20 _Bleu:_

On to sorry, go ahead, Daniel.

14:23 _Daniel:_

One related angle to connect back to what we've discussed elsewhere is this concept of generalized coordinates, which is the value that something is at, and then the first derivative, which is the velocity, and then the acceleration, higher derivatives and so on.
And so that allows you to track one variable like the temperature or the salinity of the water or the funds in the bank account and look at it, not just where it is, but how fast it's moving and how fast it's changing, how fast it's moving.
And then you can learn certain things like, oh, the third derivative is always within this range.
So that puts certain bounds on timelines that the primary indicator might change by a certain amount or not.

15:10 And we see some of those things, like the gradual decline, sudden decline.
Those are differentiated not by their starting point, but by the rate of their decline.
So velocity is something that we can talk about in Bayesian physics, actually, as a speed.

15:32 _Bleu:_

And then he goes on to outline this environment scarcity from this Schmidt at Al 2016 reference, which says combining the type and rate of decline allows us to distinguish four environmental scarcity situations environmental dissolution, which is a gradual decline in shape, environment erosion, gradual decline in size, environmental collapse, sudden decline in shape, and environmental contraction.
Sudden decline in size.
I was trying to picture this as maybe like a Markov, the market changes shape.
What would it mean for a market to change shape?
Really?

16:16 I get like, the market changes size.
Like all of a sudden there's not a market force CDs anymore because everybody's listening to MP3.

16:26 I guess that's a change in shape and size I'm not sure how to really think about.

16:31 _Tyler:_

To use that example, that would be a Chang Kim shape, where, for example, imagine the same number of people were listening to music, but the format changed.
So it's like the market is music.
People who listen to music, but the shape is a little bit different of how they're consuming it.
Whereas it could be a change of size and shape.

16:48 As if you move to MP3 s now because it's MP3 s, more people can access the music the market grows.
And that'd be Chang Kim size and.

16:56 _Bleu:_

Shape or like, the market totally disappears because we can just stream whatever we want on YouTube now.
Yeah, exactly.
That's also a change in size and shape, I guess.

17:09 Okay, cool.
So environmental scarcity is more suitable than market velocity, and I guess I can see why that is, because it's more nuanced as to what is actually changing.
Is it just like up or down and how fast?
Or like the shape and the size and the rate?
I guess all of that is taken into this environmental scarcity concept.

17:32 Okay, do you want to read these claims, Tyler?
Sure.

17:36 _Tyler:_

So while slow and gradual market changes test, in particular are capability more sudden changes, challenges affirm sense making capability, there really is no objectively uncertain market environment and certainty is an accuracy penitent mental experience facing one's very limitations of dynamic interplay between sensing and sensemaking.
Therefore, independent of the degree of market velocity, dynamic capabilities are critical.
He goes on to say the stronger and sudden the impact of environmental scarcity, the higher the agency to act, and hence the stronger the tendency for strategic renewal to be rather financial control centered by M and A and other forms of alliancing precisely for two reasons.

18:14 One, the existing resource base is too trapped in the past to unlearn advance renewal from within and without or two, the opportunity for market consolidation is too irresistible, as JPMorgan had demonstrated during the 2007 and 2008 financial crisis.
And time to action is critical.

18:34 _Bleu:_

Cool.
So, yeah, I guess that kind of sheds more light on the environmental scarcity concept here.
Okay, so I wanted to define this.
We kind of talked about the tyranny of the or last time, but we didn't really elaborate on it.
And so last time we talked about this good to great tagon book, Circuit City and The Tyranny of the Ore is actually, Bijan keeps quoting this Wardsl book about the tyranny of the force, but I had to look it up.

19:07 It's actually from not good to great Jim Collins book, but like another Jim Collins book that I haven't read, Built to Last.
And so here the tyranny of the Force is the rational view that cannot easily accept paradox, that cannot live with two seemingly contradictory forces or ideas at the same time.
The tyranny of the or pushes people to believe that things must be either A or B, but not both.
And so I think that this concept kind of goes like a light introduction and we'll dive deeper into it about duality and duality management being able to hold two simultaneously opposing or maybe seemingly opposing or necessarily contradictory opinions or views.
And here we go right into duality management.

19:56 So Bijan says, in fact, at any point in time a firm is challenged to balance strategic, organic, R and D driven innovation and growth with financial control, external growth and innovation by way of forms of strategic partnering.
There is no tyranny of ore.
It is a duality, a continuous balancing act that is mutually reinforcing and with perspective in time and space forms a unity.
Free energy governance establishes duality management as a dynamic capability, specifically as a dynamic board capability.
Duality management such as vasculation of exploitation versus exploration and balancing financial and strategic control is established as a dynamics board capability.

20:37 The goal directed, action centric and generative circular causality of top down, bottom up and lateral sense making processes, prediction error minimization forms the basis for leveraging opposing logic in the form of duality and duality management in contrast with strategy management.
Do you want to read this one, Tyler?
Sure.
So.

21:01 _Tyler:_

Indeed, strategy management has traditionally embraced one, environmental co creation versus colignment two, exploitation of the first exploration and three, financial for strategic control as dualism or paradox rather than as duality, gives the background of a world as increasingly distributed discontinuous and inescapably interdependent persistence, persistency in contradiction of interdependent elements, which is the defining core paradox potentially nonsense and therefore severely limits the theoretical as well as practical relevance of a strategic paradox lens.

21:34 _Bleu:_

Cool.
I think that this is like the old way and as opposed to duality management, which is the new way.
Do you guys have anything to add to here?

21:47 _Daniel:_

This is kind of like paradox is attention to balance, unity is plural and at minimum two rather than paradox is something that must be resolved one way or the other.
So it's really compatible with a lot of qualitative things people say about wisdom and balance.

22:07 And I think the question will be how is that enacted in organizations and how does that connect to active?

22:15 _Tyler:_

Yeah, I mean, one thing that's interesting about duality management is that there's also a strong cultural tendency to be decisive or biased to be decisive.
And that the perception of kind of not wanting to make a choice can be seen as weak, whereas you haven't really I think a lot of people would recognize the duality and say, like, yeah, I don't know, it's kind of both.
Like you want to explore or you want to spoil.
I think a lot of people would recognize that.

22:48 But when you're in a meeting and you're not really committing to something, a lot of people feel like they're not really offering a new perspective, like they're not putting their stake in the grass.
This is how I feel about it and this is where I'm going to push behind.
And so I feel like a lot of people feel this pull to make a call and so that's one like even in an executive level you can feel that.
Especially too when you're on the executive level and even if you recognize this duality and you're communicating what you want to do to the broader organization, duality is a really hard thing to communication and be like yeah, we don't really know what's going on.
It could be one of these multiple things like, let's figure it out together.

23:26 I haven't done this.
I have, like, communicate this before.
It's a hard road to go down, right?
We were like, hey, yeah, we're all just figuring it out.
Like, it's going to be like, let's just kind of be fluid about it.

23:37 A lot of people don't like to hear that because it sounds like, well, this person doesn't know what they're doing, and I don't even know where we're going.
This is really scary.
And so I do want to touch on this later.
But, like, it's one thing recognizing duality in yourself and on a small management team.
How you talk about duality in a broader organization is like a whole different animal.

23:59 And so I hope we can talk about that more a little bit later.

24:06 _Bleu:_

Thanks for that.

24:10 Okay, so we talked last time also about the quantum duality and what does Bijan mean?
And we knew that he would really kind of unwrap it here in this chapter.
So I guess we've seen duality.
Like, we are able to hold simultaneously.
It's simultaneously a one and a zero.

24:32 And so we were wondering if what was really meant by duality in the quantum sense was more like the superposition angle.
And so it seems like yes, based on even this quote from the book.
So Bijan says it is important to appreciate that many dichotomies that have defined the science and practice of strategy management, such as firm versus environment, executive leadership versus nonexecutive board, individual versus firm exploitation versus exploration, financial control versus strategic control, formal versus informal channels, and flexibility versus stability, for example, are less and less dichotomous in a distributed and discontinuous world, but coexist in superposition as of duality or synchronicity.
So I think that this kind of maybe answers that question for us from last week.
Do you guys have any comments here?

25:30 _Daniel:_

Okay, Anil Seth, some of those dualities are raised as a partition, like firm from environment or organism versus environment.
It's a partition that is an integrated whole.
And so that is part of this framing function, seeing it as an integrated unit but also containing separate aspects.
And then also quantum carries a lot of baggage, whether somebody is familiar with what it technically means or not.
Dualities in the quantum space could refer to wave particle.

26:08 It could refer to observer observed.
And so I think it needs a lot more operationalism to have utility beyond a sort of like evocative quantum management.
And then again, to come back to Tyler's point, which I want to hear more about, if you say, well, we're actually doing all the strategies.
It's like a wave.
You thought we were going to go to one strategy or the other.

26:32 We're going to be probabilistic across all of them.
How does that work.

26:43 _Bleu:_

Tyler, if I'm waiting for your comeback?

26:45 _Tyler:_

Well, I mean, honestly, I have actually a strategy of how I do this and I just don't necessarily communicate broadly that we're doing all of the strategies probabilistically.
I might know that and maybe a couple of other people know that.
We're kind of keeping our options open for a bunch of different avenues.
But you communicate something that's much more clear.

27:07 I don't think you get to do both.
You don't get to communicate that broadly.
It's just not consumable by other people and it doesn't give them like it's not really actionable by them.
So you can't say we're doing all the strategies because they're like cool, then how do I fit into this?
You have to say, well this is broadly what we're doing and this is how you're going to fit into it.

27:28 _Daniel:_

Also, action helps cut this knot.
So for and given search space, it's not possible to have one parameter value that is maximizing exploitation and exploration that gets into the sort of like I'm everywhere on the number line at once type thinking.
But action allows us to say, well, our strategy is we're going to move quick, but as soon as criteria one, two and three are met, then we're going to lock in.
So that's actually a plan that you can have precision about that embodies in another variable space, explore, exploit.
But where we have precision about is about action, which is what his whole emphasis is on actually.

28:14 _Tyler:_

And that reminds me, another strategy I use too is that you explicitly frame it around exploration and that you're waiting for something to exploit.
So you're saying like, hey, all right, we're going to build this thing and we're not sure who's gain to even use this, right?
But we're going to build this thing.
We have a hypothesis that these kinds of people might use it and then we're going to see who uses it.
And that's like the experience experiment we're running together as a company is this like defined scope explorer stage and then once we run that experiment, then we move to exploit.

28:41 And so you can kind of clearly do that within an organization of how you're switching between these different modes.

28:51 _Bleu:_

Nice.
Okay.
Bijan says therefore to effectively operationalize dynamic capabilities triplet of sensing, seizing and reconfiguring, we need a model that dynamically links dynamic capabilities to triplet with the environment.
This is Free Energy Governance's underlying active inference lab.
One active states.

29:12 Acting, sensing.
Two sensory states perception, sensing, sense making and Seizing the Opportunity and three internal states, firm resources, Resource Configuration and four external states, unknown, hidden, are all linked in circular causality conditioned by the internal external Markov blanket and governed by free Energy minimization.
And so I just thought it was interesting here, like we can go back and look here at the three pillars like the sensing, seizing and reconfiguring.
And for me the sensing part goes here in this action.
Sensing or sensing is like in sensory states, but seizing the opportunity as a sensory state totally threw me off is it just me sensing the opportunity is like one thing, but leveraging an opportunity as a sensory state, that seems more like an action state.

30:10 I don't know if it's just me or what you guys think about that because I was kind of like, whoa, seizing the opportunity is a sensory state.

30:19 _Tyler:_

Well, for example, in seizing, he included creating your business model.
And so that is, I think, part of sense making because you're like, this is how we relate to the ecosystem.
So it's like action is action centric, but this is also sensory or something like, well, this is the kind of information that we're going to collect from the environment as well.
And so I think you're kind of doing both the action and exteroception when you're doing seasoning.

30:42 This is how I'm going to relate to my environment.

30:49 Not sure if that's exactly what you're saying.

30:51 _Daniel:_

I think this is an attempt to coerce, for better and for worse, a triplet into the particular partition where blanket states defined as graph, Bayesian graph, where there are nodes that make two other sets of nodes conditionally independent.
And I think we've seen in the philosophical and application settings a lot of challenges with people simply coercing a naturalistic understanding of how things are in the world with this Bayesian graph formulation.
Like, here we have active states, action sensing.
Action states are the outgoing statistical dependencies of an entity.

31:35 So yeah, they are action.
And if you think about active sensing, then they're sort of elusively related to sensing, but it's not a sense state.
And so how much are we going to have both feet in the technical formalism of the particular partition?
And to what extent are we kind of leaving 1ft on the formalism and then pivoting around and trying to draw in some other framework and draw concordances?

32:05 _Bleu:_

So I agree that it's like a coerced moving the triple it into this particular partition.
But I just don't know if feeding the opportunity is something that I would include as a sensory state.
I think that that's something that I would put even in constructing a business plan that's still an action that you take on the world.
That's something that's outgoing, not something that's necessarily incoming.
And that's just how I would forage it, or like the way that made more sense to me.

32:38 So I just found it a particularly curious area to put it.

32:46 But yeah, we can move on and talk about being ask Bijan why he put it there, hopefully, and then we can talk about this Antagonistic Neural Networks perspective.
So Bijan says Antagonistic Neural Network Perspectives is established and applied as the neuroscientific basis for duality management, managing the existing while contradicting the present to develop the future.
It is a form of organizational learning that strategic management literature has labeled ambidexterity, foraging, exploitation and exploration.
In neuroscientific terms, the antagonistic relationship is between two large scale cortical networks.
The task positive network.

33:26 TPN and the Default mode network DMN, which simply put our neuroanatomical representations of top management's, day to day, task specific focus on exploitation, the Task Positive Network on the one side and the rather non routine divergent and creative thinking that initiates exploration and strategic renewal the Default Mode network.
And so I thought this was super interesting and took a deeper dive into looking up the reference for that quote here in this paper.
Antagonistic neural networks underlying differentiate leadership roles by boy ant this and Rochford and Jack.
They say the antagonistic relationship between the Task Positive network and the Default mode network creates a fundamental neural constraint on cognition that is highly relevant to the different roles and capabilities that effective leaders must astutely juggle and deploy.

34:26 An important consequence of this constraint is that an overemphasis on task oriented leadership can prove deleterious to an organization.

34:34 In particular, when openness to new ideas, people emotions and ethical concerns are important to success.
On the other hand, the overemphasis on relationship oriented leadership may prove deleterious to focus and the execution of clearly defined goals.
And I thought that this was really cool.
I just have never like, thought about leadership like this.
But definitely there's the people component and the GST component, like getting stuff done.

35:04 Leadership requires both and you need to have both.
And I also thought that the ambidexterity here, like where Bijan talks about, is like interesting because you think about organizations and you always hear the phrase like the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.
And I wonder if that's why this different management role or dichotomy is labeled Ambit Xerity or which came first, the chicken or the egg here?
I don't know.
Do you get through any comments here?

35:38 _Tyler:_

One thing I thought was interesting here is on one level there's this analogy between the default network and the test positive network with what you might find in an organization.
But I thought it was interesting too, thinking about how the individual relates to the organization and that the creativity that an individual or leader can exercise is kind of constrained by the antagonistic relationship between their own test positive and default mode network, right?
And it's one thing for beyond to say like, yes, you need to have this antagonistic relationship and then you need to be this balance, but the ability for the organization to do that is constrained by the people within that organization, their own individual abilities to kind of switch between these two systems.
And it's kind of a lot, I guess you're basically like, the organization's ability to do this runs up against the biology of the individuals and their own ability to switch between these different modes.
And I think that ability to kind of run these two modes in parallel is quite rare.

36:40 And it's one thing to ask your leaders to have it, but to ask your entire organization to have it is like a whole much different and much bigger ask.
And so one of my things I keep thinking about when I'm going through this book is to what extent does the Bull organization need to have internalized like duality management or is it really just the leaders?
Or I think what the John would say is like the board, but that doesn't seem to connect each level of the hierarchy.
It seems like each level of the hierarchy should be able to manage these two different modes of processing.
But it's a rare skill.

37:12 So how is that even possible to do?
Not sure if you have any thoughts on that.

37:18 _Daniel:_

Yeah, a few more.
One is the switching, which is sometimes even potentially faster than a second of our own behavior or neurophysiology from task oriented to mind wandering and to what extent we sometimes just zone out, thinking, daydreaming, reflecting, integrating, looking at our schedule, looking at our inbox like it's not task driven.
But that is like a space that can then transition into a task.

37:54 Not always the task we want, but it can transition to a task.
So that's kind of cool and antagonistic is one way to frame it.
You could also call them synergistic or synergetic because they're part of that.
Unity is plural and at minimum two angle where no single neural network could be tuned to be able to be both diffusive and task oriented.
So why not have some type of oscillatory process that enables those two modes like having a forward and a reverse in a car instead of trying to make one gear that can do two things that are contradictory?

38:38 _Bleu:_

It's a super good point.
And in this paper they really talked about they went in a greater detail about the task positive network and the default mode network and they said that the task positive network is activated during a broad range of non social tasks and is thought to be important for problem solving, focusing attention, making decisions and control of action.
In other words, for getting things done.
However, activation of the task positive network also has a deleterious effect on other cognitive functions that are essential to leadership.
It suppresses activity in the default mode network.

39:17 And similarly, the default mode network plays a role in emotional self awareness, social cognition and ethical decision making.
It is also strongly linked to creativity and insightful problem solving.
And then the activation of the default mode network, they said elsewhere, inhibits the task positive network.
So I thought that there's like this and it is like unity.
You need both.

39:44 You can't constantly be focused on a task.
Like you guys know how that feels, right?
To just be like out of it.
Like you have to have that.
You need to have work and play in order for some kind of balance.

39:58 It is unifying to be balanced.
I think.

40:02 _Tyler:_

One thing that made me remember I think I've actually mentioned this in the previous stream, but in regards to switching between the two gears of a car, rather than trying to run them both at the same time, one way that this was phrased to me by one of my previous CEOs was you have, like, art projects and you have science projects.
And so like, your art being your default mode projects, your science being your task positive projects, and like explicitly saying like, we are in art mode right now.
Like, don't hold us accountable to any metrics.

40:32 Like, this is an art project we're exploring versus science, which is like, hold me accountable.
And that means hold me accountable to metrics.
Like, I'm going to set a number and I'm going to hit that number and that's how I should be evaluated.
And so I think there are ways you could probably forage switching between these modes in an organization.

40:52 _Daniel:_

Yeah.

40:53 Thank you, Tyler.
And one biological angle on this.
Sometimes this type of oscillation is called a winnerless competition, and it's modeled using predator prey type dynamics.
Latka Voltera is the name of the dynamical formalism and in the SPM textbook and package from Karl Friston and colleagues earlier work, there's a lot of examples of winnerless competition lacavultero models being used to model activity amongst different brain regions.
And this winnerless competition is an interesting framing on everything from attention to sleep.

41:32 It's like sleep is not trying to be 100% of the time.
Wakefulness is not trying to be 100% of the time.
They inhibit each other until there's a phase transition and then it's like a dwell in one state and then that inhibition shifts and one oscillates back.
And so similarly, like, a predator doesn't over the long run, really want to eradicate the prey, but their populations fluctuate.
And that's a winnerless competition.

42:02 And in fact, that's a co winning competition.
And just one last point I remember in The Selfish Gene, some of the discussion of out there on the savannah, look at the cheetah eating the gazelle.
How can one say that that's like mammal level selection at play?
That doesn't make any sense.
But actually, if that ecological relationship weren't there, then neither population would have the resilience.

42:31 So how we frame things, and especially the level of holism that we bring, is going to set the stage for whether we see something as sustainable or unsustainable, adversarial or non adversarial.

42:49 _Bleu:_

Awesome.
Okay, so we're moving on.
Bijan says free energy governance is firmly rooted in the belief that in a discontinuous and distributed world, the marginal benefit of structural reorganizations as well as structural compartmentalization of exploitation and exploration are rather suboptimal or possibly counterproductive.
Competitiveness and survival are increasingly determined by the extent to which a system is rather less rule or top down supervised learning base.
Exploration happens increasingly in real time within exploitation.

43:25 In effect, the emergence of the new is essentially hypothesis testing within the existing.
And I really liked this.
Like Daniel, you had mentioned earlier about is this a partition or is this like a nesting?
And this exploration and exploitation is a partition and also is like a nesting based on what Bijan says here.
He also says in a distributed and discontinuous market environment, the real leadership challenge is to de antagonize the past positive Network Default Mode network dichotomy in the form of duality management.

44:07 Do you guys have any comments here?

44:12 All right, moving on.
Do you want to read these claims?
Tyler?
Sure.

44:18 _Tyler:_

FPG's cross hierarchical connectivity logically concludes that managing the TPN DMN antagonism is not a top down challenge calling for structural compartmentalization, but one of duality management.

44:29 By vacillating between or among discrete formal organization, those just centralization and decentralization the organization may increase dynamically the levels of exploration and exploitation beyond those achievable through an approach based strictly on a static design choice.
In summary, pretty much conceive organizing as an informally deep learning and self designing compass.
Centralizing intelligence at any higher level of the organization can be counterproductive, increasing free energy, promoting entropy, and eventually capitulating to TPN DMN's antagonistic forces.
So I think one thing you might have been referencing here is when you're structurally trying to create your DMN and TPN and like, having them separate from each other, this is what's, like, traditionally done in companies of having like an R and D department where, like, this is where all of the new ideas come from.
And so I think he was just supposing the FPG approach to that very traditional model.

45:33 _Bleu:_

So we'll move on here.
So he gives here the free energy governance response to the Task Positive Network Default Mode Network Challenge and it's this three fold response and he says sensitizing the entire organization in regard to upper echelon's tendency to top down extrapolating its dominant supervising knowledge structures, logic and past experience as a guide and prediction for future success.
A fallacy that task specific exploitation tends to reinforce.
Embracing strategic renewal as a matter of continuous deep learning in the form of cultivating cross hierarchical processes empowering purpose directed and action generated.
Bottom up Markov stimuli as a basis for double loop learning.

46:16 Questioning the very models that generative model top down predictions and three default abductive attentional engagement at every level of the organization forms the basis for effective top down bottom up prediction error inclination.
After noticing an environmental change, it is essential to question one's understanding of how the subsystems of the environment eg.
Technology and markets and the organization eg knowledge and goals are linked without losing sight of the fact that environment is not objectively defined, but a product of action generated and socially constructed shared meaning and expectations.
So I think this is like how the duality management works, essentially.
That's kind of what I took home here.

46:58 Tyler, do you have comments?

47:00 _Tyler:_

Yeah, and just that these are all really the big asks to make of an organization at every level.
I think it's one thing to say I agree that this is the answer and if this could be done, be like, hell yeah, I'm all for it.
But I again feel like you're kind of running up against people's individual abilities to manage duality just within themselves and that will constrain your ability to do this within organization.

47:29 _Bleu:_

It's funny because I think about the cognitive cone, right, that we talked about with Michael Levin.
And it's funny, what you just said is like the flip of the cognitive cone.
So usually it's like the larger structure or like the more top level hierarchical structure will cognitively constrain things that are nested within it.
So the shape of that cone, the shape of the individuals within that cone can't be any other shape, right?
So they can't come out of the cognitive cone of the entire organization.

48:06 But it's interesting to think about how what is happening at the individual level, like the shape of the individual cognitive cone also lends itself to the configuration of the higher level cognitive cone.
Daniel, do you have comments?
I see you're writing furiously.
No.
All right.

48:26 Drawing furious doodling.
Seriously.
Okay.
So Bijan goes on to say, talk about a salience trap.
He says, While salience is critical to an active inference, it can nonetheless potentially increase free energy to empower active sense making so that weak signals can serve as an information rich enhancement to predictions processing, listening to what wants to emergence.

48:53 Organizational design is challenged to neutralize the tendency of experienced managers and board members to overconfidently superimpose the potential fallacy of their historic and self confidence powered pattern recognition.
Since the human brain's task positive network and default mode network spheres are antagonistically related, the only way to embrace antagonism as duality is by linking in circular, causality, top down predictions and bottom up stimuli.
And so here I think that Bijan is really maybe kind of criticizing or like maybe not criticizing, maybe, I don't know, maybe criticizing is the right word.
Like how experience leads you to prioritize, like leads you to place importance on things and maybe perhaps miss things that are important in an adaptive communication.

49:54 I don't know.

49:55 Do you agent some comments here?

50:01 _Daniel:_

We're drawn to the salience, not to the meaningful or adaptive necessarily.
We hope that our salience field can be aligned with what's adaptive and meaningful.
But I think we found out that that is not always the case.

50:23 _Bleu:_

And it's funny, like, I think about just in scientific discovery, right?
Like how we're so attuned, we're looking for the signal that we're looking for.
It takes like a very perceptive and adept scientist to not fall into that salience trap and perhaps notice what's going on in the periphery, right?
Like, even though this is the center, this is what we're focusing on, there's a lot of peripheral things happening that might actually be important or as important or maybe more important than the central thing that we're focused on.

50:55 _Tyler:_

Yeah, I guess the other thing I say is that this is just like another it's one of those things, like I agree with this and like, theoretically, but there's so much stress going to like many of these decisions.

51:06 Like for example, if you have to do layoffs, for example, it is very time sensitive and the stakes are really high.
And so going off your previous experience can be really helpful in there because you have to just make a really quick decision, and it's often going to be heuristic space, which may be not necessarily optimal, but you really are often constrained by your time and resources.
And really processing all of your bottom up signals, like, even with the best attention, is really hard to do.
And so again, it's not to say like, you shouldn't try to do it or it can't be done, but it's just like it's another one of these things where like, hey, this is a really big ass and I just want to call out this is really hard to do, especially when you're under the gun.

51:54 _Bleu:_

Yeah.
In the ideal world, this is how it works.
Right.
Okay.
Do you want to read this claim for us, Tyler?

52:03 Sure.

52:05 _Tyler:_

All right.
So indeed, this real time switching correlation process cannot be relegated to a single person.
You need a CEO or executive chairman or upper echelon as a team, but must be the result of an unsupervised and FEP determined layering process that relates top down predictions and bottom up data input and circular causality that dictate resource reconfiguration accordingly.
Consequently, the board's potentially unique DMN dimension cannot be ignored, but must be integrated into the process.

52:30 At the very top.
The board goal directed has given us cognitive diversity and composition and cognitive distance firms dominant TPN exploitation logics emerges as a monitoring surveyor of the system that is centered around managing the dynamic interplay of dual forces exploitation, exploration, and financial and strategic control.

52:49 Something I thought it was interesting here is that while he's making this claim and we should do through the whole book that pay the boards in this really unique position to be this kind of like and integrated unit that kind of comes back to what we were saying earlier of like, okay, who is actually doing this?
Duality management.
And so in one sense I'm like, okay, it makes sense that the board would be doing this because you can hold them accountable to holding these different ideas in their head at the same time managing duality.
But it seems I would think that you would need that duality management to be going down the hierarchy, not just at the border as well.
And at each level the hierarchy is managing duality in some sense.

53:29 So I very much want to ask for you on that when we got on a call with him.

53:37 Bleu Daniel, anything to add here?

53:42 _Bleu:_

No, but this is one sentence that I pulled out randomly from the chapter that just struck me and he just threw it in here and didn't unpack it or anything.
The firm is a generative social field and emerges in language.
And I thought that this was like really profound.
So I don't know, I just put it in here because just like, wow, that's very deep.
I don't know.

54:09 I don't know if you guys have comments or this is something like I would ask Bijan to expand upon.

54:15 _Daniel:_

You could ask 100 people with different backgrounds what this?
Invokes for them and see where that goes.

54:26 _Bleu:_

That sounds like a fun project.
It was just like a sentence that seemed very deep and just casually thrown in there.

54:36 _Tyler:_

I'm going to get this tattooed on my chest.

54:39 _Bleu:_

Right?
Put it on your next business card.

54:43 That would be an awesome statement for a business card, right?
That would be great.

54:48 _Daniel:_

So what is it you say you do?

54:54 _Bleu:_

I don't know.
I guess that's true.
This is a business philosophy.

54:59 _Daniel:_

Awesome.

55:01 _Bleu:_

So do you guys have any final like, comments, questions?

55:05 Tyler, did you tell us all the things you wanted to tell us?

55:09 _Tyler:_

No.

55:12 _Daniel:_

Yeah, we're moving along through the structure.
I'm looking forward to more conversations and also some digestions and reflections, making some schemes to visualize at a high level what we've been coming away from because this is like our 8th session and I think we're starting to see his patterns and style of laying out what he wants to convey and integrate.

55:40 _Bleu:_

Yeah, I definitely think we're getting repeat the message and so it's starting to drive some of it home for me at least.
So coming up to the end of the second part of the book next week and I'll be looking forward to that and to hopefully discussing the author at his convenience, Hae Park.

56:01 Thank you.

56:01 _Daniel:_

Bleu and Tyler, farewell.

56:03 _Bleu:_

Bye.

56:04 _Daniel:_

Bye.

56:09 _Bleu:_

Conor, next week, same time.
