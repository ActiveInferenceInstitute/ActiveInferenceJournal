
00:04 _Daniel:_

Hello?
It's February 7, 2023.
We're here in Active Bookstream number 1.09.
Off to you, Bleu.

00:17 _Bleu:_

Hi, I'm Bleu Knight.
I am a researcher in New Mexico, and we are the Active Active Inference Institute, participatory online institute that is communicating, learning, and practicing applied active inference.
You can reach us at our social media links here.
And just a reminder, this is a recorded and an archived Livestream.
So please provide us with feedback so that we can improve on our work.

00:41 All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here, and we will be following good video etiquette for live streams.
And just as we're mentioning that all backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here, we will be having our final discussion coming up in about four weeks.
So if you would really like to participate, if you've watched some of the live streams and have some questions, we would really like to get some outside perspective.
So please get in touch with us so that you can participate in our final discussion.
So, like I said, if you want to participate, this is how.

01:14 And so we are still discussing governing continuous transformation.
And today our goal is to discuss section nine.
So, chapter nine.
And we will be doing Bookmap roadmap and all of the typical things.
So, I already introduced myself.

01:32 Daniel just gave us the date.
Why don't you introduce yourself?

01:39 _Daniel:_

It's Daniel in California.
I'll pass to Tyler.

01:45 _Tyler:_

I'm Tyler in California.
I am a dow researcher and protocol designer.
All right, Bleu.

01:54 _Bleu:_

All right.
So here we are at the end of part two.
So next week, the author is going to join us for a discussion over part two, the Free Energy governance section of the book.
And then we'll be moving into part three.
I think we're going to do two chapters at a time as we go through part three.

02:15 And I don't think we'll be discussing the engaged scholarship interviews, but if you're curious about them, I encourage you to read the text.
Okay.
Tyler, do you want to read this first part of the abstract for us?

02:27 _Tyler:_

Sure.
All right.

02:28 So beneath all chaos is an underlying structure.
Our challenges to exploit disorder's.
Underlying order survive.
Living organisms are encoded to resist disorder.
I.

02:37 E.
Entropy by way of self organization.
Firms are nothing more than molecules and are subject to obeying the very same laws.
Thermodynamics entropy will eventually rise.
Three specific propositions previously developed as part of this book's underlying dissertational research are outlined.

02:52 One structure.
The stronger, affirm's, cross hierarchical, top down, bottom up cognitive throughput coupling between and within governance and operational channels.
The less dominant, affirm's, top down approach cultivating a form of CEO centrism and strategy ownership.
Bleu, you want to take the next one?

03:14 _Bleu:_

Yes.
So, two cognition.
The stronger a firm's cognitive disposition toward environmental enactment and innovative abduction, as opposed to adaptation.
The stronger the firm's strategic control and the smaller the risk of falling for the financial control trap.
Three capabilities the stronger the board's dmn centric duality stewardship empowering upper echelon to sustainably balance exploitation versus exploration as well as financial versus strategic control.

03:43 The stronger the sustainability of successful and continuous strategic renewal and hence the firm's prospects for survival.
Strategy is less macroscopic but more subatomic, less linear and deterministic, but more quantum and discontinuous.
There is a dominant tendency of glorifying the realist beauty of top down linear cause effect relationships to the very detriment of quantum self organization.
And I'm going to start off just reading Thomas Parr from the book so Bijean says, I'm trying to see it over my screen order.
Anywhere in the cosmos is so singular.

04:23 It always requires an exemplary mechanism or a process, while randomization requires no, I can't read the word.
It is simply the way of the world.
When particles are allowed to act randomly, whether it's the contents of a glass of club soda on the rocks or the countless atoms making up the air in the room they slam into each other, exchanging energy until complete randomizations of their positions and velocities is observed.
And so Bijean quotes this Lanza et al.
2020 paper and I was just like thinking of firms as organizations of people and it really brought this picture to mind of atoms randomly slamming into each other like people randomly slamming into each other like the mosh pit versus the board meeting.

05:09 I just wanted to bring this juxtaposition of what is it to minimize free energy in terms of assembling humans as opposed to assembling atoms.
Anyway, I should have to share with this mental image.
Okay.
Tyler, do you want to read this one for us?

05:27 _Tyler:_

Sure.

05:27 So beneath all chaos is an underlying structure.
Our challenge is to exploit disorders underlying order to survive.
Living organisms are encoded to resist disorder I.
E.
Entropy by way of self organization.

05:38 Firms are nothing more than molecules and are subject to bang the very same laws thermodynamics.
And so yeah, I thought the connection here that was interesting was comparing saying that the laws of thermodynamics apply to firms and that's what's really going on.
And we talked about this in previous streams.
I know we have Blues kind of talk about a little more in detail here but whether that's more of like an analogy comparing to thermodynamics or something like a real underlying structure of thermodynamics and we'll talk about that more shortly.

06:10 _Bleu:_

That also brings to mind like the mosh pit.

06:14 And I wonder in our base case as humans, is our natural inclination to be increasingly chaotic and we override that?
I don't know.
I had all these mental images as I was reading this as well.
Yeah, Tyler put this in.
So I love this.

06:34 I'm going to read it because I love it.

06:41 He actually quotes Gould et al.
2016 in the quote.
He says if physical theories were people thermodynamics would be the village witch.
Over the course of three centuries she smiled quietly as other theories rose.
And withered surviving major revolutions in physics, like the advent of general relativity and quantum mechanics, the other theories find her somewhat odd, somehow different in nature from the rest.

07:07 Yet everyone comes to her for advice, and no one dares to contradict her.
Einstein, for instance, called her the only physical theory of universal content, which I am convinced that within the framework of applicability of its basic concepts will never be overthrown.
Her power and resilience lay mostly on her frank intentions.
Thermodynamics has never claimed to be a means to understand the mysteries of the natural world, but rather a path toward efficient exploitation of said world.
Yeah.

07:36 Do you want to add comments here, Tyler?

07:39 _Tyler:_

Yeah, I liked about this was that the kind of, like, mystical business leader, like a Steve Jobs character, is kind of like a trope in the business world, and it's kind of like almost like a joke at this point.
But there's also a real case mystical business leader, which is almost kind of what I think Dejan is describing here, is that the real state of the world, of operating as a firm in a very uncertain is probably not the word I should use, but in an ActInf sense, it's a very mystical, receptive way of engaging with the world.
And I really like making that connection of mysticism with business, with corporations.

08:21 _Daniel:_

One other angle there is organizations are doing work.

08:26 They're doing hopefully useful work.
And Thermodynamics is concerned with how thermal energy that uncorrelated exchangeable entropic dissipation can be channeled into moving the steamboat forward or lifting up the weight on the crane.
And so sometimes with the amount of seething activity in formal firms or informal groups, it's like, but if we all just went in this exact direction at this exact time, we could do this.
It's like, well, if all the air molecules just slammed against the wall, it would fall over.
Or if they all formed into a droplet, you'd get rain in the room.

09:09 Like Thermodynamics helps us understand what is likely to happen given those interacting state spaces.
And again, interestingly, it has to do with extracting work, useful work from this background of just vibration.
That's not work.

09:30 _Tyler:_

Yeah.
The other thing I like to just to build on that is it's okay to not know what's going on is that that doesn't necessarily need to be a source of stress.
It's just like you can harness those energies and kind of see which way the wind is blowing, so to speak, without necessarily understanding all the underlying principles.
And that's totally okay.
And I think that's generally something that gives a lot of people, both in the business world and even in our personal lives, a lot of stress.

09:54 But this is also, I think, a very freeing way to approach an uncertain world.

10:04 _Bleu:_

Yeah.

10:08 Maybe to close the loop or maybe open it up a little bit more.
There's also the prospect of doing work that you don't know is going to be fruitful.
And so that is this uncertainty.
Minimization you could spend your whole an hour trying to crack open a nut.
And the nut is empty.

10:26 That's also possible, right?
So even though you're doing work that may be useful work, it might not bear fruit.
So there's that uncertainty element as just a human or also as a firm?

10:42 So I just wanted to bring back these slides while we're talking about thermodynamics we talked about this a long time ago, and we talked about the difference between thermodynamic entropy and information.
Theoretic entropy?
And so I just wanted to kind of bring this back and just remind everyone that there's a difference.
There is relationships between the two that are still being hashed out, like mathematically and not totally understood.
But the second law of thermodynamics is that this entropy like disorder in the universe is always increasing.

11:23 And here the energy is always lost in a transfer.
In work, as heat to the environment less and less usable energy becomes available.
All Right?
And then in information theory, we kind of talked about entropy with an inverse relationship with information.
So here you can see like event that is low probability is high information.

11:54 So if you're decoding a stream of letters I always like to think about it like this because it was explained to me like that and it made so much sense.
If you're decoding a stream of letters and you're expecting a message.
And this was Claude Shannon and kind of like how he or how it was explained to me how he kind of came up with this.
So you're decoding a message and you get the letters.
Th It would be really freaking weird if the next letter was Z.

12:19 I don't know any words that have THC.
That's a very low probability event.
Right?
So it would be like a very high information thing.
Or maybe something came before the th and you missed it.

12:30 But there's some probability.
Like th e would be great or like thi.
But thz wouldn't make any sense.
Unless the th was at the end of some previous word.
And so you can kind of deduce what to expect in those kinds of situations.

12:46 The probability distribution is like when there's 50 50 probability.
So this is the second graph on the right.
When there's 50 50 probability.
Like the flip of a fair coin.
That's super high entropy.

12:59 Like you don't have any idea if it's going to be heads or if it's going to be tails.
But here it's low entropy.
If It's like a Coin with two heads, there's heads On Both sides.
Like you can only come out with heads.
So there's very low entropy in such a coin flip because the outcome is always heads.

13:17 Right.
If there's no distinction between the two sides.
So I don't know that's the thermodynamic dynamic entropy versus information.
Theoretic entropy.
And I think we talk a lot about thermodynamic entropy, but maybe forget that the FEP is really kind of founded in the information theoretic entropy as well.

13:37 Do you guys have anything to add here?
No?
Okay.
All right, so Bijean makes this claim in this section, and I'm not going to read the claim, but I'm just going to point out that here we kind of have a really concise definition of like he's been emphasizing the structure, cognition, and capabilities for a few chapters now.
And so here he defines structure as the circular coupling of governance predictions and operational stimuli channels in the form of prediction, error, minimization.

14:12 He defines cognition as environmental engagement in the form of enactment rather than adaptation.
And he defines capabilities as sensing and sense making in the form of duality management.
And so this chapter was really kind of a good summary chapter, I thought, and kind of gives us a chance to go back and revisit a couple of the concepts that we talked about before, but maybe need to highlight one more time.
Do you want to read this one, Tyler, for us?

14:43 _Tyler:_

Sure.

14:44 So, yeah, through the rest of the chapter, Bajan is going through each structure cognition, and he's really kind of going deep and kind of recapping what he's been covering through the previous the rest of the book.
So for structure, he says, the stronger a firm's cross hierarchical, top down, bottom up cognitive throughput coupling between and within governance and operational channels, the stronger the firm's orientation towards free energy.
Surprise minimization based on self organization.
The less dominant a firm's top down approach cultivating a form of Ceocentrism and strategy ownership, the stronger the sustainability of successful and continuous strategic renewal and hence the firm's prospects for survival.

15:27 _Bleu:_

Cool, thanks.
And so this is kind of like the punchline of the structure.
And so I pulled out maybe just a couple of topics from before the punchline to talk about.
And so this kind of like top down, bottom up coupling, I was like looking for a picture of what does top down, bottom up coupling look like?
How do you see that?

15:49 Can I visualize that?
Actually, I was looking for a picture to put on the previous slide and I came across this 2008 paper, from Emotion Resonance to Empathic Understanding a Social Developmental Neuroscience Account.
And my background is neuroscience, but it's definitely like cellular and molecular neuroscience.
So I don't really have a good comprehensive reading of social and developmental neuroscience and what that looks like.
And I loved this figure because it just was so encompassing of so many of the things that we've talked about so far.

16:24 Daniel, have you read this paper?
Have you ever seen this before?
I hadn't either, and I came across the figure and I was like, oh, I have to get the paper now.
And so it was nice to kind of just delve into this and it's really about what's required for empathy.

16:40 And I'll talk more about it.
But here you see like the top down, bottom up coupling.
So it's bottom up information processing, top down information processing relation to relative to the individual and then the context or situation.
And there's this perception action coupling in 2008.
I'm like the perception action loop from 2008.

17:02 This is cool.
And they talk about shared representation and this self other awareness, which we talked about a couple of bookstreams ago, how distinguishing the self versus the other self and non self.
So I thought that this was really cool.
And executive functions, regulation and control metacognition, that's like double loop learning the metacognition aspect.
So I thought that this paper was really cool and it really was like, wow, all of this is grounded in empathy.

17:36 Anyway, it was neat, it was a good read.
It's destiny and Meyer, 2008.
And the link is up there if you want the DOI or any of that stuff.
And it made me think, all of this is grounded in empathy.
We know, or at least it's thought in business, that to be successful as a business person, your emotional potion, your EQ, is way more important than your IQ, like your ability to relate to others and interact with people.

18:04 So a good emotional high emotional quotient versus like an intelligence quotient is way more crucial to business success.
And so I just wonder about the relationship between, if any, between free energy governance and the emotional quotient.

18:23 Never talked about this directly in the book, but it just made me think how important is empathy for this kind of governance structure?
I don't know if you guys have any thoughts here on this.

18:34 _Tyler:_

Yeah, I think empathy is just really like sensitivity to your environment or sensitivity to other actors and their internal states.
And so in the context of a firm, it doesn't necessarily need to be like you could think of an emotion necessarily as for another firm, maybe the internal state of this external other firm.
So maybe you are dependent on this other firm.

19:00 Things aren't going the way you would expect them to go with this other firm.
Maybe orders are backlogged or their API is being kind of intermittently down.
Maybe that is like a signal into the internal state of that firm and the internal state of the ecosystem as well.
And so I think that might be analogous to an emotion in a human context.
Maybe.

19:27 _Bleu:_

They had a bunch of definitions actually in the paper, and I can't pull it up because I'm screencasting, so I'm not going to let you guys go through all my 25,000 open windows, but maybe we'll pull them out.
And this is maybe a good question for Brian about the relationship between empathy and the free energy governance when we get to see him next week.
But they had several different definitions of empathy too in the paper, which I thought was interesting they really tried to take a very logical approach to it and it was cool.
Okay, so here is a claim from the paper.
Bajan says the higher the organizational friction in terms of obstructing bottom up error messages, traveling to and reaching top down prediction generators, the higher free energy, the potential for surprise, and the more likely that top down dominant logics fossilize prediction models, and hence reinforce a firm's entropy.

20:22 And this is something that maybe Tyler and I have brought up either on stream, but we've talked about it off stream a lot.
How do we reduce this organizational friction?
Where are the examples that show us what is the best way to reduce this friction to create a good top down, bottom up coupling?
We know that this coupling is super important, like at all layers across the hierarchy.
But can we find an empirical way that works in all situations to build that structure?

20:55 And that, I think, is like a challenge or maybe a future research question?

20:59 _Tyler:_

I guess another thing that is a little counterintuitive about this too, is that oftentimes the things that will reduce friction and maybe like the longer term, feel high friction in that moment.
So, for example, in previous streams, we've been talking about dissonance as being like a way of thinking about that friction, right?
Well, the easiest way to deal with dissonance, the lowest friction way you could deal with it personally is just like not thinking about it, just like tunnel vision and just ignore it and don't worry about these weird feelings that you have.
But that obviously doesn't help the friction of the organization as a whole.

21:32 And so, yeah, there's this kind of especially in your personal life too, by analogy, is like confronting your own emotions that you don't want to think about in the short term.
Really easy to just power through and just keep doing what you're doing.
But if you can process these and integrate these emotions, that's a lot healthier for you long term.
So it's an interesting kind of tension between your individual tendencies of not wanting friction and friction in the organization as a whole.

21:58 _Daniel:_

Also to connect back to the thermodynamics.

22:02 What is friction?
Well, it's when a force is applied on some surface or through some media and it results in heat, which is dissipated, taking away energy from what could have been done for work.
And now think about friction engineering.
Do we coat every object with Teflon?
Do we want everything to just at the lightest touch, fly off into space?

22:27 So just because we can increase or reduce friction actually doesn't tell us, especially over time scales like you're bringing up Tyler, whether we want something to have a lot of friction, like where the rubber hits the road or whether there are some fundamental trade offs with how much heat the tire is losing in contact with a smooth road versus how much grip it has on a loose road.
And so all these different trade offs are where the actual art and science is going to come into play.
But friction is not just a term that's used every day to describe annoying communication patterns.
Feg is pointing towards that potentially being understood as an actual physical force.

23:14 _Bleu:_

Cool.
Do you want to read this one for us, Tyler?

23:17 _Tyler:_

Sure.
So, the second proposition cognition.
So the stronger a firm's cognitive disposition towards environmental enactment and innovative abduction as opposed to adaptation.

23:26 The stronger the firm's orientation towards free energy surprise minimization based self organization the stronger the firm's strategic control and the smaller the risk of falling for the financial control trap, the stronger the sustainability of successful and continuous strategic renewal and hence the firm's prospects for survival.

23:47 _Bleu:_

All right.
And so I'm going to read another quote from this section on cognition, and I brought back this picture because I think it's important.
Okay, so Bijean says, cognition in the form of world enactment is the purpose, directed, action, centric and social construction of shared meaning and shared expectations, anchored in the understanding that a firm's environment is a matter of environmental engagement in the form of interaction, revealing significance, and assigning probabilities to a bounded set of external unknown states.
And so I'm coming back to this paper and I'm looking at the information processing, bottom up, top down.
And here I see this shared representations, and we've seen this in this figure in this paper.

24:32 They're talking about body language.
And somatic response like heart rate increase or lower and all these things that have been measured in the generation of empathy.
But is empathy maybe something that is required for shared meaning or shared expectation?
I wonder, do you have to have that?
Is a sociopath, like, devoid of empathy, like living in a world where things don't mean the same thing and expectations aren't the same?

25:00 Maybe, right?
There might be a strong link there that I wonder if it's been explored or not.
So I'm just curious if you guys have thoughts on what developing shared meaning and expectation is and if it requires some kind of empathy with others.

25:16 _Tyler:_

Yeah, I share that feeling.
One of the big questions I've had through this, and honestly, it's on a personal level, I've always been interested on whether you could build tooling that would help create that shared meaning and expectations or whether this is really just constrained by the individual.
If you have people who are sociopaths in your organization, maybe it's just like there's certain the way that they're wired kind of limits the way that they can engage and create shared meaning with the rest of the organization.
And so, yeah, I'm kind of curious what you all think about that too.
I don't have an answer for it, but maybe that'd be a good question for Sean.

25:53 _Bleu:_

All right.
Daniel, thoughts?
No thoughts?

25:56 _Daniel:_

Well, to have interpersonal empathy as a behavior, as a feeling, that's one whole area.
But in the creation of organizations, it's almost like we have to ask not how strongly we feel or what we feel, but whether some future person in that organization outside of our direct perception, cognition action loop is going to have some sort of outcome.

26:26 Because I think it's easy just to sketch out that you could feel really empathetic empathetic or any emotional state, and it could result in a totally discordant state even for somebody you care about or vice versa.
So how do we not get lost with just the introspection of the feeling of empathy and translate that into systems whose efficacy is equivalent to what we would have intended, but that may not feel like empathy all the time?

27:01 _Tyler:_

Yeah, I feel like especially over the last couple of chapters, we keep running to a similar concept of theme of how the individuals wired in terms of empathy and their ability to create shared meaning and how that bubbles up into the rest of the organization.
And yeah, I keep feeling like there's no way out of like, hey, we're just limited as humans in our ability to integrate external information and that limits the ability of the organization.
But sounds like Daniel was maybe sounding more optimistic note of like, well, actually, maybe you can build some maybe there's tooling and systems you can build that can have organizational empathy even if the individual doesn't have it.

27:46 _Bleu:_

So that brings to light something that Daniel and I have talked about before working on the discussion of memes, like randomly random insertion, random plug for the Eco Meme project.
But when you're really thinking about painting a picture to convey a shared meaning, we talked about the echolocation, how the dolphin literally can paint a picture.

28:06 Like, I saw a fish over here and can translate puts the picture of the fish into the other dolphin's mind.
Like, there's the picture of the fish, right?
And so, like you we literally can paint the entire picture.
So like, even if we could do something as remarkable as that, we convey only the semantic content.
If you can say the fire hydrant is red, right?

28:32 And you guys both know can picture in your mind like a red fire hydrant, right?
But we don't know what semiotic content is contained in that message.
Maybe someone's colorblind, maybe they don't know if it's red or green.
They can't help, right?
And so the fire hydrant just appears in this gray thing that they think might be red or maybe someone has been in a house that burned down and the fire hydrant didn't work and they have this trauma inspiration moment, right?

28:58 So the semiotic content, the symbolism behind the message or the picture that you painted, even in a situation where you can perfectly create the tooling to come to this shared meaning or representation, you're never going to get the symbolism that exists for someone else.
It's a highly personal thing.
We can have shared symbolism too, culturally, for sure, but there's a deep level of personal symbolism in every human that's dependent on your previous life experience, I think.

29:34 So coming back to abduction, because we did talk about it in the section, I can't remember if it was in the last quote or not, but I just wanted to point out this is a recycled slide.
But coming back to abduction, where Bijean talks about it, is abductive reasoning.
This is a quote from the book.
Abductive reasoning usually begins with a surprising observation or experience.
This is what shatters our habit and motivates us to create a hypothesis that might resolve the anomaly.

30:00 Abduction is an inferential procedure in which we create a conjecture that if it would make the surprising anomaly part of our normal world, of our normal understanding of the world.
So this picture is, like, the best way for me to always think about abduction.
You can have a specific observation and you can come to a general conclusion, right?
And then you can have deductive reasoning where you have a general rule, but that leads to a specific conclusion that's always true.
And then when you have an incomplete observation, like, you can't see what's going on, you just go to the best guess.

30:34 And so in Business and Bishop talks about this again and again and again, you have to use abductive reasoning, because we're never going to have a complete picture of the past and future of the market, like, the whole market, or even your target audience.
So you're dealing with the best logical guess.

30:56 Okay.
Do you want to read this one for us, Tyler?
This is you?

31:00 _Tyler:_

Sure.
So the firm's Generative model is the firm's Econich.

31:04 If uncertainty and unpredictability dominate our worldly perception, well, then this reflects the very limitations and corrosiveness of our models and the underlying processes generating those models.
There is no objective uncertainty.
There is only your uncertainty.
Environment is enacted.
Each act opens a new fork of multiple paths, leading to potentially very different outcomes.

31:24 Reality is subjective algorithm applying an infinite number of worlds.
In superposition.
Our ActInf not only create the junctures leading to different paths, but we are in control to decide which path to take at each juncture.
So, yeah, I thought this really summarized well, the kind of inactive cognition.
So there's a song proposition Two here of Feg.

31:46 And also just that was, like, a fun quote because we talked about a lot in the last stream, but John's been using kind of quantum language here, and we talked about that in the last stream of K.
What exactly does he mean there by that Bleu?
Daniel, anything to add here?

32:06 _Bleu:_

I love your Excel spreadsheet.
Quantum superposition of an Excel spreadsheet.

32:12 _Daniel:_

It's capturing the late night blurry.
What action selection to take based upon this spreadsheet?
Great.

32:27 _Bleu:_

All right, so Bajan makes this claim also in this section.
He says, in fact, we are challenged.
Not to allow for the human brain's conceptual limits to solely determine perception and sense making, instead outsourcing some of the heavy information.
Lifting to the environment in the form of extended cognition is the essence of optimizing prediction error minimization.
The more exponential and hence discontinuous a market environment, the more we need self organizing mechanisms that leverage the world as a supervisory signal, challenging in circular causality the very perceptual content of our predictions.

33:03 And so we've talked a lot about cognitive offloading or extended cognition in terms of cumulative cultural evolution.
Not in this bookstream per se, but over the course active inference lab from the very first beginning live streams.
We've talked about it a lot because now so much thinking is done externally.
It's encultured at some point with the smartphone, we don't have to know how to get anywhere anymore, we'll just map it.
So I just am thinking like this self organizing mechanisms that leverage the world as a supervisory signal, challenging in circular causality the very perceptual content of our predictions.

33:45 I'm so amazed by Chat GPT.
I'm using it so much just because it's like what does everybody know?
Chat GPT tells you what everybody knows.
It is like the selective synthesis of all information, right?
And so if you know something that Chat Gpt-3 doesn't know, that's great, you can write a blog about it.

34:04 But now Chat GP Three can just write all the blogs about every other thing.
It knows everything, right?
It's got all of the information synthesis except the rare pockets of knowledge.
So is this, this self organizing mechanism, this Chat Gpt-3 like a Global search synthesis information management system?

34:28 _Daniel:_

I don't know.

34:28 _Bleu:_

What do you guys think about that?

34:30 _Tyler:_

Well, this is very out of my depth both in terms of machine learning and active inference.
But I was thinking about this last night because this is like a huge debate right now.
It's like whether Chat Gpt-3 is actually showing emergent intelligence or whether it's just like a clever algorithm.
And I was thinking about this too.

34:48 Where are the differences between Chat Gbt Three and what I've been learning so far about active inference?
And the crucial things that seems to be missing is like the inactive aspect of it.
It's not really in dialogue with its world.
It's like stringing together information that's like a static, right?
It doesn't even incorporate new information.

35:05 Like if you were to ask it about the news yesterday, it couldn't do that.
And it's not taking actions in the world and giving feedback.
It's just like the static model of how the world works.
And so I don't know, it feels like fundamentally different to me and I'm not sure what that means.
I'm not sure if something has to display active inference to have true intelligence.

35:28 I'm sure this is like a big hotly contested topic.
I'm sure you guys have many live streams about this.
Yeah.
Daniel Bleu.
I'm curious what you guys think in.

35:38 _Daniel:_

The space of communication, the response it provides to you is an action that's not moving, a mechanical arm on a table.
But in our Internet of everything, it's not so hard to see how the digital outputs from a generative algorithm do translate to physical objects moving.
But it may not even need to do that.
It can send out messages on social media and definitely meriting further discussion as things will continue to develop and gain more access to recent information, world model learning and action capacity soon.

36:18 _Bleu:_

I have a little bit of a technical response here.
I think that the question is not about true intelligence, maybe, but the question that I hear talked about a lot is Sentience, right?
But I have read this big article about is Gpt-3 Sentient?
And I think it was like from one of the inside Google people, the one that was released, and now they're talking about it because everybody's using it.
And Sentient, they just said able to think and act independently.

36:51 But that's not the definition of Sentient.
I'm not sure what the definition of Sentient is, but it's not like autonomous.
They're using Sentient and autonomous the same way.
And Sentient is like, able to feel things.
Right?

37:03 So I think let's look it up right now.
Let's define Sentient for the world at large.
What does that mean?
Because intelligent Sentient and autonomous are all different.
So hold on, I'm looking on my.

37:16 _Daniel:_

Phone because I'm screen sharing words, words humpty.
Alice in Wonderland, people will use them.

37:24 _Bleu:_

How they want, but that's everything.
So a Sentient is able to perceive or feel things, right?
And so is Gpt-3 feeling anything?

37:33 I highly doubt it perceiving a lot, sure.
But as to your thing about updating, Tyler, I'm sure the model will update at some regular interval.
So just think about we're not there yet in terms of compute power, but maybe in ten years it will be training on the entire Wikipedia catalog every single day.
So does Wikipedia have a date entry for every day?
I think it does, right?

37:58 So when you ask, what was the news yesterday, it'll know that that's just a matter of what's encoded and what's being processed through silicone.
It's only time, right?
We're way close.
So it will be able to update with some regularity will it update itself?
I don't know.

38:16 That gets into autonomous acting.
I don't know.
All those things are different.

38:23 _Tyler:_

That reminds me, though, because we've had this discussion over the past 15 minutes about empathy and do organizations have empathy?
And it's kind of like the same conversation as Gpt-3 of like, okay, well, maybe organizational empathy, it looks and just feels differently than individual empathy.

38:39 Right?
And so you can imagine the same thing happening in Gpt-3.
And I don't know what that version of empathy would look like in Gpt-3, but maybe it's just like something that we can't quite wrap our hands around.

38:52 _Daniel:_

It'll be awesome.
Again, I think a further discussion would be very timely, especially if, for example, communication from one person's syntax could move into a semantic space or a rhetorical space from the eco meme direction, as Bleu mentioned, and then be translated back into another semantic space for the listener.

39:14 That might be changing the amount of math detail or in a different human natural language.
So there's a lot of incredible opportunities.

39:25 _Bleu:_

Yeah, definitely.
I think it'll be interesting to see to interrogate Bajan with such esoteric questions.
With such esoteric questions.
See what he thinks.
Does the firm have empathy?

39:39 Where did you even get this?
Well, we got it.
Sorry, we're off to ask anyway.
All right, so moving on.
Tyler, do you want to read this one proposition?

39:49 _Tyler:_

Sure.
So the stronger the board's dmn centric duality stewardship empowering upper echelon, sustainably balanced exploitation versus exploration, as well as strategic or financial versus strategic control, the stronger the firm's orientation towards free energy surprise minimization based self organization, the stronger the sustainability of successful and continuous strategic renewal and hence the firm's prospects for survival.

40:16 _Bleu:_

Cool.
And so we talked about this last week a lot.
I didn't put a lot of extra information in here because we did, like, the antagonistic neural that perspective last week, but I did just want to include the summary.
So Bijean, at the end of the chapter, summarizes it by saying, in summary, the board must assume the role of sponsor or enforcer of three categorical imperatives defining the success and sustainability of strategic renewal and firm survival.
First, foster cognitive coupling between and within all hierarchical layers.

40:51 I'm really excited to find out exactly how to do this.
Second, embrace environment as action generated and socially constructed shared meaning and shared expectations, which we've talked about a lot today.
And third, DeChane the firm from thinking in terms of antagonisms, but embrace real time duality management as a critical determinant of performance and survival.
That's pretty much it.
Do you guys have any final thoughts?

41:24 _Daniel:_

The overtime period?
The generative AI speculation moment?
The hashtag 2023?
Questions that we all have.

41:42 _Bleu:_

Good times.
So we talked about quantum.
So I'm leaving us with this one quote from this chapter because it's just kind of, like, thrown in there.
Bijan says, classical linear cause effect thinking is no match for quantum exponentiality.
I wonder what he means by quantum exponentiality.

42:06 Like, are we again talking about superposition or are we talking about, like, super?
Because that's, like, I guess, the many states existing at once.
Is that what he means by exponentiality?
What do you guys think?

42:17 _Tyler:_

Think Jean has a poetic bent in him.

42:20 Not sure if we're meant to take this fully literally.

42:24 _Daniel:_

Exponents are used in a lot of quantum mechanics, so there could be various readings just like any other good poem.
So we should jump in with these kinds of questions.

42:43 _Bleu:_

Cool.
Well, that's next week.
So, yeah.
Excited to wrap up this part and just a couple more book streams left for us.
Winding down again.

42:53 Get in touch if you would like to participate in our final discussion.
We would really welcome any external perspectives.

43:02 _Daniel:_

All right, thanks.
See you next time.
