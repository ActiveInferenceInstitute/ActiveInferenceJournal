00:07 _Daniel:_

Hello and welcome.
It's March 14, 2023, and we're in active Bookstream 1.010 off to you, Bleu.

00:19 _Bleu:_

Hi.
Today we are going to be discussing this governing Continuing Transformation book.
We're moving into the third and final section of the text and so we're going to kick it off today and next week, and we will wrap up our discussion of the book over these next couple of weeks.

00:39 So we are the Active Active Inference Institute, participatory online institute that is communicating, learning, and practicing applied active inference.
These are all of our social media links.
This live stream is recorded and archived, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve on our work.
All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome and we will be following good video etiquette for live streams.
If you would like to get involved in this project or any of the ongoing projects at the institute, get in touch, reach out active inference.org.

01:13 I think we're active inference institute now too, so either one works.
Okay, so we are in the 10th chapter of this governing continuous transformation book.
We're going to actually discuss chapters ten and eleven today.
This final section really is just a conclusion and wrap up of the information that's been presented in sections one and two.
So we can just introduce ourselves briefly.

01:43 I am Bleu Knight, an independent researcher in New Mexico, and I will pass it off.

01:52 _Tyler:_

I'm Tyler, I'm a DAO researcher and protocol designer in California.
Daniel.

01:59 _Daniel:_

I'm Daniel.
I'm a researcher in California.

02:06 _Tyler:_

Cool.

02:06 _Bleu:_

Okay, so doing this third part, the conclusion part, the chapters today.
So chapter ten is really just an abstract, which we'll read, and then it's like a giant table summarizing the free energy governance model versus traditional corporate governance.
And so we'll just cover that and just summarize how these are the same and different.
And then we'll get into chapter eleven and some of the content, the conclusion content that is presented there.

02:38 Tyler, do you want to read this one for us?
And I'll take the next part?

02:42 _Tyler:_

Sure.
So through the lens of the theoretical concepts developed in this book, feg and traditional corporate governance Tcg are assessing comparative perspective.
Tcg models are predominantly characterized by a compliance mentality centered around board effectiveness as a matter of managing agency conflicts of interest.

03:01 Through optimizing stereotypical board diversity enforcing director independence, feg introduces a radically new logic, exercising the corporate wholesale reinvention that strategic renewal is now imposing.
Indeed, any such position of two governance logics can hardly escape the accusation of oversimplification.
However, once we embrace the world as discontinuous and distributed, we start understanding that today's entrenched corporate governance approaches are a low scale, low leverage, legacy business creating inertia.

03:34 _Bleu:_

Well, I'll just read this second part.
Public policy prescribes best practices.
Guiding corporate governance is an anachronism of Modern business reinforcing, upper echelon's, risk aversiveness I e compromising epistemic foraging, and consequently entrapment in the incapacitating perception of the world as volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or vuca.
Free Energy Governance embraces any dimension of vuca as information rich input for top down, bottom up prediction, error, minimization in pursuit of minimizing surprise, an over reliance on CEO framed information flows and analysis, which is so characteristic of traditional corporate governance, is as good as flipping a coin.
The very processes that explain success equally breed failure.

04:28 And this Table 10.1, there's a little bit in the chapter, but this Table 10.1 is one of the very few figures or tables presented in the entire text, if not the only one.
And here we can just see like, there's three columns.
The first is the logic, and then the second is Free Energy Governance, like how it relates to that logic.
And then the third column is Traditional Corporate Governance and how that relates to the logic.
For example.

04:59 So here the structure or hierarchy is the logic where the Free Energy Governance method is top down, bottom up, top down belief propagation and bottom up message passing in circular, causality, unidirectional, upper echelon belief propagation only.
So there's not that bi directional information flow.
And the process for Free Energy Governance is generative or continuous.
And traditional corporate governance is static or agenda driven.
Capabilities are metadatmic cognitive in Free Energy Governance and operational or domain centric.

05:43 In traditional corporate governance, the dominant neural network is this direct no, default default mode network.
Direct default.
I think it's default default mode centric network.
And then the traditional corporate governance is task positive network centric.
So this is interesting to me.

06:03 I thought that when we were talking about these neural networks, it was really like the conjunction of the two networks that I thought was characteristic of Free Energy Governance, as opposed to one neural network being more dominant than another.
Did you guys get that too?
Or is this like I don't know.
To me, I think that this is kind of weird.
This took me by surprise.

06:31 _Tyler:_

I think when they say, like, Dmn Centric, they're not saying that one is limited to Free Energy Governance or Tcg.
They're just saying that there's more of an emphasis on this kind of exploratory default mode processing with Free Energy Governance.
But you still have to switch between explore and exploit or actually not switch between, but pursue them both simultaneously.
And so both are happening in parallel is my understanding, at least.

06:58 _Daniel:_

Yeah, agreed with that, Tyler.

07:01 And also, is it the case that the normal operating function is task oriented and then we pull back to review?
Or is it the case that we're pulled back in review and then we drop into the task that's like Dmn Centric?
But in both cases, you still would want the effective Oscillation.

07:28 _Bleu:_

And then the learning for Free Energy Governance is double loop learning and single loop prevails in the traditional corporate governance.
And then there's different performance metrics and performance variables and corporate purpose, which I don't know that we got too into that.

07:54 This is kind of maybe was, like, lacking.
So I was surprised to see this here the corporate purpose.
So he says, in free energy governance, it's existential and axiomatically integral to the free energy minimizing governance mandate.
Like the purpose of that, where in traditional corporate governance, it's diffuse and opportunistic with no relevance to governance.
So maybe I just skimmed over that or blanked it from the text.

08:20 _Tyler:_

Yeah, I think it was from the very first chapter.
So this is like, what, 13 live streams ago that they're just linking, like corporations want to survive, linking that very much into calling out the corporate purpose is to survive and continue on.

08:39 _Bleu:_

Cool.
So then the second part of this table, we talked about strategic and financial control, like the dual mandate management in Feg, where traditional corporate governance is focused on financial environmental engagement.
We talked about infra energy governance as enactments with traditional corporate governance is adaptation digital transformation, which is like, that's interesting.
It's an interesting logic.
Like the logic of digital transformation, where Feg is holistic wholesale reinvention and traditional corporate governance is selective transformation or domain specific.

09:24 But I'm having a hard time relating to this digital transformation logic.
I don't know if you guys want to shed more light on that.

09:32 _Tyler:_

I think what he potentially might mean is say that you're a business that sells something and you sell it over the counter, right?
The selective transformation would be like, okay, well, now we have like, a web checkout flow.
But the digital, like the wholesale reinvention could be like using AI to take your bottoms up input to transform those into top down predictions, right?

09:54 Like really doing something fundamentally different with your digital tools rather than just like, mapping physical processes into a digital is my understanding.

10:07 _Bleu:_

And then strategic renewal is autonomous under free energy governance proactive.
And it's like this dual information flow again, where in traditional corporate governance, it's induced or reactive top down mandates driven by belief propagation.
The machine learning logic.
I thought this was cool.
And maybe I don't know, maybe Daniel wants to speak more to this as we've been talking about the need for free energy minimization active inference lab or not.

10:38 So the machine learning logic in free energy governance is optimizing the principle of least action to resist dissipation in order to persist.
In traditional corporate governance, it's like supervised or rule based maximizing predetermined reward functions.
I don't know.
Daniel, do you want to speak any more to that?
I know you've been thinking about it.

11:01 _Daniel:_

Okay.
The first thought was free energy bounds surprisal.
We would minimize our surprisal if we had the perfect generative model.
So minimizing surprisal is like having the most model evidence, and we're going to bound surprisal with free energy minimization.
And so in this machine learning logic, it's almost like we're going to bound our surprisal so that we can persist and thrive in our niche.

11:32 On the other side, it's almost like we're going to be following best practices and compliance, getting to the governance mandate below, we're going to be bounding and staying within the lines on all of the checklists.
And then question mark, question mark, question mark.
We will have impact in the niche.
Whereas in free energy governance, surprisal minimization bounding as a first imperative ends up taking on some of those outcomes that under the traditional corporate governance column, would be seen as consequences of reducing mismatch with compliance and regulation.

12:28 _Bleu:_

Cool.
Thank you.
And then finally, the final item in the table, the logic is the governance mandate.
Under free energy governance is continuous strategic renewal, firm outperformance and firm survival.
So, like optimizing governance and operational coupling, environmental enactment and dynamic duality management of exploration and exploitation as well as financial and strategic control, all powered by inactive inference.

12:59 And then traditional corporate governance is regulatory compliance, board effectiveness from performance by monitoring, advising, challenging, boundary spanning networking, all guided by Ceocentric and principally upper echelon dominated frames.
And so this table in a nutshell really sums up a lot of the concepts that we've discussed throughout the text and what we are kind of looking for in this new governance model.

13:32 Maybe tyler, do you want to read the first half of this abstract for chapter eleven?

13:37 _Tyler:_

So how can one possibly redefine the board's strategic meta role when traditional governance modes are ridiculously entrenched in cognitive capabilities so poorly developed or non manifest?
To be practice relevant theory must be intuitive and inspire upper Echelon questioning it's very habits of mind to conceive strategic renewal as continuous.
Enjoying the process of top down predictions.
Bottom up stimuli surprise minimization urges upper echelon to consequently optimize the multi intelligent sources of stimuli, redesign processes as well as incentive structures and develop a new language to empower active inference lab.

14:10 Indeed, to date, corporate governance research and practice are more concerned with defining behavioral responsibilities rather than addressing its very capability needs.

14:20 _Bleu:_

Thanks, I'll take this second part.
There is no one size fits all best practices catalog, but effigy's nexus of structure, cognition and capabilities provides the building blocks for a fundamentally new governance logic in a discontinuous world.
The essential governance challenge is to ensure the self organizing optimization of top down, bottom up prediction error minimization, learning to infer.
Once we embrace Fpg as a novel organizational framework and early detector of a firm's impending entropic decay, we must reckon that unless replaced with an Fpg inspired logic, traditional corporate governance is likely to continue.
Relegating the board of directors to strategic irrelevance reinforce financial control at the expense of strategic control, prioritize top down content over top down, bottom up processes, cultivate inertia and inhibit the full growth and survival potential of firms as self organizing systems.

15:18 And so this chapter had some sections in it that I just tried to summarize here.
And so he talks about the dimensions of the theory and like the relevance.
He says the relevance of theory to the practice of strategy management and governance is essentially determined by three dimensions.
Theory must, first, be intuitive as well as problem or opportunity driven.
Second, establish new metaphors or give new meaning to existing language that empowers purposeful sensing, sense making, and strategic, and third, inspire upper echelon questioning its very habits of mind.

15:55 I e provide a new and enriching perspective around doing things differently.
And I brought up the theory particularly because what's not here in the dimension of a theory or the relevance of theory to the practice of strategy management.
And I don't have any background in this, so maybe, Tyler, you want to say some more about it.
But I feel like the relevance of theory to the practice of strategy management for me, what's missing through this text, I think we're getting a little bit more into it now, and we've uncovered it, but it's not very obvious is like, how do you find a practice that's grounded in this theory?
Like, what are specific practices that this theory is imploring us as a firm to do so I don't know.

16:42 Tyler, do you want to speak maybe to that?
And just in terms of strategy management overall, do all theories do that?
Or am I just like, where is the hard evidence?
Maybe I'm just being a stickler.

16:52 _Tyler:_

Well, first off, like, a good grounding in economics and corporate theory is that most of it is wrong, like, completely bullshit.

17:00 A lot of even microeconomics theory is totally debunked, never was correct in the first place.
And so there's a very low bar for having a good theory for economics or corporate governance.
With that said, I'm trying to think of what makes free energy governance different to process than other kind of business management theories in the past, and usually with other business management theories.
Do these 15 steps, or here is your best practice guide to what this looks like.
Whereas with free energy governance, it's like not that at all, because it has to be receptive to your environment.

17:36 So it really demands a spiritual embodiment of these principles to really do or even understand at all.
It really is like a spiritual I keep coming back to that.
That's what it feels like.
And you have to really own this and internalize it for it to be used, whereas you don't have to feel that with anything else in economics or corporate governance.
You can just follow the steps.

18:00 But here, a lot of the same things we talk about free energy governance are the same ways we talk about creativity, for example, and a lot of spiritual practices.
It's like a very receptive, dynamic environmental practice, which you really can't just put down to a series of concrete steps.
And so that's why I think this is both so powerful and also so frustrating at the same time, because it's just like, how do you be creative I don't know.
This is something you figure out by in conversation with your environment, right?
It's the same thing with free Energy Governance.

18:34 Like the most powerful things you can get from this theory.
No one's going to be able to directly teach you.
You have to kind of just live it.
So calling this a theory is like even though it is grounded in hardcore maths, at least for the way a lot of business people, including myself, will practice, it does not feel that way at all.
It feels much more of like a spiritual mindset.

19:00 And that's very new for a lot of these kind of I haven't experienced that before in a business context.

19:08 _Daniel:_

I'll give a few other notes.
Thank you, Tyler.
Very interesting.
The first point that theory should be problem or opportunity oriented, I think Bleu.

19:20 That's where we would feel like we were getting our hands dirty with the theory.
And free energy governance gives a continuity between what might be happening in the analytics department with the actual generative models, and in the Communications department and the tools they use and in the boardroom.
Whereas one thing that we could say about the traditional corporate governance theories is whether they were more mindset based or more behavioral and practice based, their limitation in relevance was that they were doing these three points.
But then what would the work actually be about?
What would the machine learning engineer actually be doing?

20:05 Something totally ad hoc.
So there was always this disarticulation between the narratives and the values and the broader purpose of the organization and then the implementation.
So here we're coming from the upper echelon to the front line.
And part of Feg is, I think, that by being imbued in theory, even if this book was not heavily equation or simulation based yet, it can provide continuity within the organism, within the corporation.

20:48 _Bleu:_

So I like hear that you brought in spirituality, Tyler.
And I'm sorry.
It says my Internet connection is unstable, so I'll apologize in advance if I'm cutting in and out, but I like how you brought in spirituality to this and also creativity, because here it's like the the job of the theory is to inspire upper echelon, like questioning their own habits, right?
And so in this way, it's like a coon, right?
It's like some puzzle that you sit down to just think about and solve and reflect upon.

21:22 So the job of the theory is to be like a spiritual coon, to just think about it.
And then, secondly, the creativity part.
You're talking about?
Creativity, Tyler.
And also interaction with the environment.

21:38 It's brought about literally by interacting with the environment.
And there's a really cool book that I don't know if either of you guys have read or heard about.
It's called the Artist's way.
And literally, it's just like a series of tasks that get you into your environment so that you're inspired to be more creative.
It's like a series of just like in its own way, like its own riddle or puzzle to be reflected on.

22:04 That's what they lead you through in that book.

22:08 _Tyler:_

That's actually why I mentioned that, because I'm simultaneously reading The Artist's Way and also Rick Rubin famous producer, he just released a book about creativity.
And the way that they were talking about creativity in both these books is very much about bottoms up, sense making and listening to your environment.
I was like, wow, a lot of these the language is the same with free energy governance because at some level we're talking about the same thing.
And so it's just like, again, that's one of the things I love about free energy governance is that it is so broad and can encompass all these different disciplines from creativity, corporate governance, ant, colonies, whatever.

22:50 _Daniel:_

Just a few short notes.
Receptivity is not passivity, it's the opposite.
It's the sentient engagement and the receptivity with the generative process that fine tunes our generative model so that we can be who we expect and prefer to be.
So receptive and engaged with the niche does not mean sitting back.
That's probably been clear.

23:13 And then also the framework shouldn't be providing specifics.
I know that's a normative claim, but it's like if somebody said, I have a linear regression machine and it always comes up with positive linear regressions, it'd be like, well, let's maybe separate that.
Let's have the neutral linear regressor, and then we can have a second order preference for ones that are positive or let's filter out the ones that are positive only.
So in a way because it is a framework or a theory for this strategic renewal discussion, which is the positioning of the book, it is at a level above any specific practice because just like you couldn't say, well, a wing or a tooth or a poison is like simply a high fitness adaptation of an organism outside of its context and niche.
There's no practice or any pattern that would apply to all different organisms or organizations in their niche.

24:15 So the discussion had to be moved back to this not ultimately neutral space, in fact a very principled space, but one that gave the expressivity to then specialize according to the dimensions that we basically looked at in the parts of the book and in this table from today.

24:38 _Bleu:_

Awesome, thanks.
Okay, so moving on from the dimensions of theory, I think Bijean goes through a very good summary of all of the things up until this point.
I think so.
He says free energy governance provides rich and new meaning to existing concepts and establishes new relationships.
First, top down, bottom up prediction processing is applied to strategic management and defined in form of a generative process.

25:09 Integrating circular causality in circular causality.
Top down belief propagation and bottom up message passing in pursuit of one objective, minimize surprise, to resist, entropy to persist, powered by one first order principle of least action.
I e.
Free Energy Minimization, a purpose directed firm is the foundation for free Energy governance's.
Top down, bottom up, circular causality to come and stay alive.

25:34 And he goes on to say, in the same context, that upper echelon communication is centered around four dimensions dynamically linked in feg circular causality, purpose prediction models, predictions, and stimuli.
The simplicity and plasticity of the language are critical to ensure that reach and inclusion of team members are optimized.
More importantly, firm members must be incentivized to stimuli.
Challenge predictions underlying prediction models according to the first order free Energy Organization principle will self evidently evolve by the way of unsupervised self organization.
And he refers back to the structure, cognition and capabilities that we've been linking through this entire text.

26:25 So this I like, but I'm not sure how to.
He says the simplicity and plasticity of the language are critical to ensure that reach and inclusion of team members are optimized.
I'm not sure how to do that.

26:46 How do you make language simple and plastic to ensure optimal reach and inclusion inclusivity?
I don't know if you guys have thoughts on that.
I'm like, where are my step by step procedures that I'm supposed to follow to make this happen?

27:02 _Daniel:_

I think there's many angles on it.
Just a few comments.
One, a starting point would be making sure that the language are in the native or preferred tongue of that person or augmented entity.
So having Active inference lab ontology translated into multiple language is one first step, but then there's some second order considerations about still using language.
And then the self organization.

27:32 I thought, well, just pouring water on a mountain landscape, the water is going to self organize, but it might not follow the path of least action to organize the way you want.
Okay, so then you modify the generative model or the generative process and you put a ditch here and a wall here.
And again it follows a path of least action and it self organizes given the constraints.
So it's like a combination of whatever will be, will be.
However it unfolds is how it is going to unfold.

28:05 We can't really descent from that level of tautology.
However, that is the space which modifications of the niche and of the generative model can then self organize to be whatever it will be.

28:25 _Bleu:_

That speaks a lot too to the receptivity and action or interaction.
Active inference is interactive with the environment and the niche, the inability to separate those things.
Okay, so he says this is back here.
Free Energy Governance provides rich and new meaning to existing concepts and establishes new relationships.
So this is another one of the new relationships that Bijean claims.

28:51 He says enactment, coined by Karl Wick and astutely applied by Smirchich and Stubborn to strategy process, has conceptually inspired Free Energy Governance.
And he goes on to say enactment is redefined as Active Inference lab.
Essentially, Free Energy Governance is liberating upper echelon from the overwhelming cognitive distortion that their biggest challenge is Taming or Taming uncertainty, when instead they should be really surfing it.
And this is kind of these cool two references he throws in here.
Unless environment is redefined as a purpose directed and action centric generative prediction challenge in the form of prediction error, minimization firms will continue being incapacitated by the faithful pursuit of adaptive fitness.

29:36 More importantly, redefining strategy as top down, bottom up predictive coding lays the foundation to optimally leverage and coevolve the human machine potential cognition.
I don't know if you guys have comments here on this or we can move on.
If not, okay.
And then the third relationship that Bijean describes is he says dynamic board capabilities in the form of duality management are an entirely new genre of upper echelon capabilities that Feg establishes.
He goes on to say that inactive prediction processing becomes manifest in duality management in the form of balancing financial and strategic control as well as exploitation and exploration.

30:24 Duality management is all about probabilistic resource reconfigurations in superposition waiting to be enacted.
Duality stewardship is effigy's essential governance mandate.
And then he continues later the R and D or research and development percentage share of total revenues is potentially a good indicator of a looming financial control trap.
Within each industry there is a rough percentage benchmark for Rnd investment, for organic reinvention.
Once a firm operates year on year below industry R and D investment standards, financial control is likely to be the only control left and describes that as the capabilities.

31:05 And so here I really appreciate the section of the book because I think that we're starting to get some good.
Like how do we know if we're minimizing free energy?
How do we know if we're adapting free energy governance?
Are we doing a good job?
What are the benchmarks?

31:20 These are the kinds of things that I'm looking for.
And so here I like this.
You have to be investing at least the minimum industry industry standard into research and development to ensure that you're doing the strategic part and not just going for financial exploitation.
Like the R and D is the exploration part.
And so I thought that this is kind of a concrete application of what we've been looking at so far.

31:46 Daniel?

31:47 _Daniel:_

Yes.
Thank you.
The superposition, it's a quantum shout out and it made me think about some task that needs to be done.
We need to vectorize some images and then print stickers.

32:00 There's a superposition of plans we could upskill, we could hire somebody, we could acquire the company, we could do all of these different plans, including crossovers with the different plans.
And those pure plans, maybe in their extreme form, are never even on the table.
But the organization can think of its strategy as this mixed state that is truly quantum and it's doing a quantum optimization over those pathways, maybe not even needing to brute force through them.
But rather just letting the quantum annealing work its magic.
So that's one interesting, and then the other piece is, like you mentioned, Bleu.

32:46 Once the firm is below a critical point in its research and development, only financial control is left.
And so it's almost like if there's still wiggle room to turn left and right, it's still a very maneuverable car.
But if you're in a position where only one of those sides wiggle can only happen to one direction, like, okay, well, now we need to be cutting costs.
That's our only degree of freedom is cutting costs.
Now, it doesn't even say that's not going to be a functional strategy, just that that is on that pathway to entropic decline.

33:24 Because by having a reduction of affordances, you are on the pathway to the ultimate reduction of affordances, which is the failure to persist.
And as long as you have options on the table and the expectation of future options on the table, if not more, you're in the game of persisting.

33:46 _Bleu:_

Well, thank you for those thoughts.

33:50 Okay.
Bijean says how to make it all work in practice is a daunting task.
There is no best practices catalog.
First of all, best practices should be considered a potential source of inertia.
Like throw those things out the window.

34:04 We don't need them.
We need first order principles to empower structural organization, formal and informal throughput environmental engagement and capability to foster self organizing processes.
Free energy governance does exactly this.
And Tyler, you had spoken earlier, too, like the throwing away best practices also, or like, there is not a map to do that here in Free Energy Governance.
So we don't have a 15 step book.

34:33 _Tyler:_

But it's also the case, too, if you make this analogy between free energy governance and creativity or spirituality, it's always the case where they can't say, okay, here's, follow these steps, and this is exactly how it's going to work out for you.
But I think what's effective a lot of times, too, is like, hey, well, this is what it doesn't look like.
For example, if you find yourself kind of enslaved to your addictions, for example, you may not be on the spiritual path, or you may be kind of like, off course a little bit, right?
So there are things that you can point to, like, okay, well, I can't say define what it is, but I can define what isn't.
And I think we have some good clues to that from this book, even though it might not be as prescriptive as we might like.

35:24 _Bleu:_

All right.
And speaking of persisting, I almost wanted to skip to this slide directly.
Why should this business exist and prevail in the first place?
Bajan asked this question in the middle of the book and I don't know, why do any of us exist or prevail in the first place?
We're all just hanging out, minimizing free energy, taking the path of least action.

35:45 I guess.
It's just interesting.
Why do you exist and prevail?
And he encourages people to ask themselves this as part of the governance mandate.
Why should we exist and prevail?

36:02 For what reason?
I think that's always a good question.

36:06 _Daniel:_

Yeah, one thought on that, we can always take the how did things come to be question and just whether we take that descriptively or as a mystery.
But given where we are or how we recognize ourselves, it's a little bit like a stay or leave question.
We can stay on our path of least action, or we can push the trim tab a little bit, push the rudder a little bit, and then be on a different path of least action.

36:32 So again, we don't get to dissent from being on a path of least ActInf, but we have affordances, which are our space of local adjacencies.
And this claim, as I think you're pointing to, it's something that the individual employee could ask themselves.
It's something that the team could ask themselves or the department and the organization.
And maybe the organization's level conversation is happening in the boardroom for certain kinds of organizations.
And it's like, should we make the next six months look a lot like the last six month?

37:07 Should we pivot in this direction, or should we just shut it down?
And having a space for those kinds of multilevel questions and meaning finding, I think part of the subtext is that's not a waste of time, that's not a distraction from the work itself.
This is like the fountain that the work performance or alignment on any given scale actually flows from.

37:37 _Tyler:_

Yeah, just to add on that, I think the context of this book has been large corporations that there's like a legal mandate for this thing to exist and for you to meet the obligations of your people who are financing the business.
Whereas there might be more of lifestyle businesses you might have, or there might be a nonprofit or something where the free energy governance mandate to survive at all costs may not make as much sense.
Like, maybe this business organization is more of an extension of your personal passion rather than being this own entity that needs to survive on its own terms.
Right.
So I think it's also important to reflect, like, okay, free energy governance is this useful frame for thinking about it, but am I really trying to create this larger entity that exists independently of myself, or is this what am I actually trying to do here?

38:28 And is this a relevant framework?

38:32 _Daniel:_

One other thought on that with the organism organization conversation in mind are we a seasonal grass?
Are we a 17 year cicada?
And then have that conversation, even if that's playful or in the beginning stages of team formation or of dow formation.
So that if some people think that they're going to be building the 100,000 year Arctic vaults and some other group of people think that they're doing a one time concert, that those can be recognized and integrated in a way that isn't just as much of just like keep things going.

39:14 Which is how maybe this question can seem at first pass that it's just about existence and prevalence, but existence and prevalence in the biological space is so rich and complex that it would make sense.
It would be that way for organizations too.

39:35 _Bleu:_

Definitely.
Okay, and then here Bijean quotes like, and this is part of a long quote and we're going to carry over these over across the next two slides, but he says, Jan Stalberg's practice relevant statements from Stalberg 2021.
The reference, if anybody wants to look it up, concerning transparency, communication and reaching out to the bottom should inspire management practice.
The first of these statements is everyone is informed in real time about everything.
And then Stalberg goes on to say, I believe, looking at some of the core propositions of free energy governance, this is free energy governance connecting top and bottom in circular causality of sense making with the least friction and optimal response time.

40:22 So this is like something that I've wondered about how do you prioritize information flow top down, bottom up, belief propagation and message passing?
And they're saying like, full transparency, everybody knows everything all of the time.
And that to me was kind of like mind blowing because it's not how I would ever think to run a company.
Like, not at all.

40:47 _Daniel:_

Daniel okay, I hear you on that.

40:50 I have a slightly different reading here.
I'm just imagining starting with this agreement, wherever you are, there you are.
So whatever you're informed about, that's what you're informed about, whatever your situational awareness is, that's what it is.
And then that's the part that's been infuriating.
There is no suggestions for who should be in what messaging channel, or who should be on what email thread, or who should be in what video chat, but whatever we do decide with the chats and the emails and the meetings, that will be your local message passing, your information environment, your capacity for inference and action.

41:31 So I don't think this means that every single employee or contractor has the full dashboard.
I think everyone's dashboard is respected, though, as their dashboard, which helps bring the discussion to what function, what accessibility do they need and so on.

41:49 _Tyler:_

Yeah, I think this is part one, but John was talking about a management theory called open governance, I think it was called, which is the extreme version of everyone knows everything all the time.
And he was criticizing that because he was saying, well, if you give everybody all the information all the time, that doesn't necessarily give them the tools for making meaning of that or having that be relevant to their specific context.
So I think what he's implying here is, yes, you give everyone access to information as well as tools for processing that information in a locally relevant way.

42:22 I don't think he means just like pure chaos information dump, but could be reading into it.

42:36 _Daniel:_

Okay, Blues, pause.
But I hear you on that, Tyler.

42:41 _Tyler:_

Cool.
Internet may have cut out.

42:48 _Daniel:_

Yes.

42:50 _Bleu:_

Cool.

42:51 _Daniel:_

What other parts have you found interesting so far?
Oh, there you go.
You're back Bleu.

43:01 You're back Bleu.
Maybe you can disable your video.

43:08 You can disable your video, Bleu.

43:23 I want to give a thought on some synchronous and asynchronous things, but you never really know when it will be now and real for Bleu.
But we're in a different now and real moment.
Tyler.

43:36 _Tyler:_

I think she's back in our now.

43:40 _Bleu:_

I think I got it.

43:41 _Daniel:_

Okay.
Continue, Bleu.
Thank you.

43:43 It was fine.
It's all fine.

43:47 _Bleu:_

Okay, so this is again to continue quoting Stalberg.
Value creation, in my experience, has been usually determined by a combination of the following governance imperatives.
First, you must start with a clear purpose and long term goal.
Prepare to invest for the long term and infrastructure.
Second, you need to continuously question yourself.

44:11 Paranoia is key.
Third, team decisions are critical.
Create a culture that empowers and encourages people to contribute, to take decisions, and not to be risk averse.
In summary, it really comes down to three things communication, transparency and respect.
And so reading this whole quote in context is kind of what made me think that they're encouraging open channels of communication.

44:35 Everything flows to all the people all the time, but it might not be the correct reading.
And I do think that in what you're saying, Daniel, you have your information channel and you live in that river, and that is where everything comes to you in real time.
And whatever.
You're just in the river that you can sense make about right.
You don't necessarily need to be in the ocean when you live in a river.

45:00 And then that makes more sense to me in terms of information flow.
Do you guys have more thoughts here on value creation, transparency, respect, communication?
No?
Okay.
All right.

45:20 No.
This is actually the essential governance challenge in a discontinuous and distributive world is now a matter of setting free the self organizing optimization of top down, bottom up prediction error minimization.
Learning to infer the firm is the generative model.
The continuous nature of strategic renewal makes prediction modeling as well as prediction error minimization an integral and direct default mode network centric dimension of traditional monitoring, advisory and boundary spanning board responsibilities.
Effectively, in the absence of board level medica facilities as developed in this book, the board can no longer fulfill even its most basic and traditional responsibilities.

46:04 And I think that maybe Bajan here is calling out the discontinuous nature of the world and how disruptions are regular and things move fast.
Change is always happening and the board needs to get on board or not.
But that's the wrap up of this chapter.
Do you guys have any thoughts on this?

46:31 _Daniel:_

Well, one thing is whatever is working in the niche today.
If you expect the niche to remain the same, you can keep your strategy the same, and it will be the same.
However, biological ecosystems have variability and patterns over different timescales, and also organisms and organizations develop.
So it'd be like saying if the two year old baby can't fulfill its meta capability to learn and to change, it will eventually no longer be able to fulfill even its most basic and traditional responsibilities.
And so that is where we start to see general claims about system operation and development and evolution and potentially the ways those are linked in the FEP with the kinds of conversations that today can happen by differently framing the upper echelon frontline dialectic.

47:37 _Bleu:_

Cool.
I think that that's it.
So we're going to get in next week to discuss the last two sections of the book and hopefully bring Bijean and maybe you, if you're interested, anyone else who's interested in maybe discussing this material.
Hopefully we'll get some new voices and perspectives that would really be great.
So thanks, guys.

47:59 Nice to see you.

48:00 _Daniel:_

Thank you.
Bye.
