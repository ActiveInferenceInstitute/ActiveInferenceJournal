
00:09 _Daniel:_

Hello and welcome.
It's March 28, 2023.
We're here in Active Bookstream number 1.012.
Off to you, Bleu.

00:20 _Bleu:_

Great.

00:20 So we will be continuing our discussion of the book governing Continuous Transformation by Bijean Kesri and this actually is going to wrap up our coverage of this book.
We're not going to go into the interviews covered in the final section, but we're going to just cover this concluding part and then wrap it up now.
And then in a few weeks we will rejoin for a discussion section or a discussion session.
So if you've been following along with the live streams to this point, please get in touch with us so that you can come on and discuss some of the contents of the book with us.
And hopefully the author is available to join us.

00:55 So we are Active Inference Lab Institute, a participatory online institute that is communicating, learning and practicing applied active inference.
You can reach us at social media at all of these links.
This is also a recorded and an archived Livestream so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve on our work.
All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome here and we will be attempting to follow good video etiquette for live streams.
Again, there's many ways to participate and collaborate with the Active Inference Institute.

01:27 So if you are interested Active Inference Lab and are not yet collaborating with us, just get in touch.
Active Inference is our website and there's a link to fill out a form if you want to contribute in other ways to the institute besides joining us on the live stream.
So the goal of this bookstream is to conclude our discussions of this book.
So we are going to cover chapters twelve and 13.
I want to skip to the road belt.

01:53 So we're going to cover chapters twelve and 13 in this part three conclusion of the book.
So chapter twelve is the future Research agenda and chapter 13 is outperformance and survival as a matter of self organization.
So we can just quickly introduce ourselves before jumping into the contents.
I'm Bleu.
I'm an independent research consultant in New Mexico, and I'll pass it off to Tyler.

02:17 _Tyler:_

I'm Tyler.
I'm a protocol designer and Dow researcher.
Also in California.

02:22 _Daniel:_

And Daniel I'm a researcher in California.

02:27 _Bleu:_

Did I say California?

02:28 I meant to say New Mexico.
I think I said, did I say California?
Oh, my gosh.
All california.

02:35 _Tyler:_

I'm probably getting confused.

02:36 _Bleu:_

Maybe I said California.
I'm having visions of the beach.
Okay, so chapter twelve has a few different sections.
Again, this is like future research directions.
The Jeans discusses language and communication, embodied cognition, artificial intelligence, board capabilities, developmental paths, and then chapter 13 is really just a provocative conclusion section and reminds us of some of the things that we've learned in the book so far and also outperformance and survival as a matter of like free energy minimization.

03:08 So we will jump right into the content tyler, do you want to read this first part of the abstract for us?
Sure.

03:17 _Tyler:_

Feg is the product of the multidisciplinary research project connecting the dots among strategy governance and neuroscience research.
Opening a new conversation headlines introducing the free energy principles strategy management feg redefines the nexus structure of cognition ABV so touching base view advances the dynamic capability view and from the managerial to the core level and establishes strategy as an inactive Bayesian inference challenge.
In terms of future research, four areas should advance the optimization of Feg one, language and communication.

03:49 In particular, explainability of corporate purpose prediction models and predictions.
Two, by cognition in terms of a deeper understanding around the neurobiology underlying leadership's world engagement as well as false inference.

04:03 _Bleu:_

Thanks, and I'll read this next part.
So the third area is artificial intelligence, in particular the strategy application of Aipowered machine algorithms and fourth, board capabilities developmental paths, in particular, the board's ability to collectively develop meta capabilities.
Free Energy Governance as a framework provides the fundamental building blocks that empower a firm to implement free energy minimization as a self organized principle structure top down bottom up connectivity, cognition, environmental enactment and capabilities duality Management within the SDG framework, many vibrant strategy research topics lend themselves to be repurposed as a matter of optimizing free energy minimization.

04:44 More specifically, survival rather than just performance is the critical dependent variable.

04:54 Sorry, I'm trying to navigate my board so getting into the first section, Language and Communication.
So I just pulled a couple of sentences out of this section.
Bijean says that the effectiveness of free energy governance is critically determined by transparency in communication, specifically around the explainability of corporate purpose prediction models and predictions to obtain the most possible human energy for productive effort.
And I think this is really something.
The communication overall is an area that I would like to discuss with Bijean further.

05:30 But he does really kind of clarify some of the questions that we've been having over the last couple of weeks here in this section, and even maybe the next section about what specifically needs to be communicated to all members of the firm and at all levels.
So he really does kind of clarify.
He says if organization is emergent in communication as we believe, then it is not a being but a becoming.
And that's a quote from Taylor 2000.
And then he also says language is not a tool, but a force.

06:05 And with this, I think he specifically is referring to a force that holds the firm together, contributes to the self organizing purpose and sustainability of the firm.
And really he does talk a lot about the purpose of the firm both in this chapter and the next, as like, everybody needs to know what is the point for the firm's existence or for the corporation's existence?
And so I think that that is one aspect that might not necessarily be like a governance strategy or something that's internal, like a method of operation that's like we think about the top level executives, but something that why are we here?
What are we doing?
What purpose are we serving as a corporation, as a company?

06:55 And I think that that is like one reasonable thing that can be communicated to team members at all levels.
I don't know if you guys have any thoughts here or.

07:07 _Tyler:_

Yeah, one thing that was not really clear on about what John was getting at here was what it means to have explainable purpose.
Because on one level, the feg, like ultimate purpose, as I understand it, is just like survival.
But I'm not sure if he meant purpose in some other sense of like, I don't know, we are improving our customers access to health care or something like that style level of purpose.
And I wasn't quite clear what he meant and he didn't quite give that many examples.
So I'm not sure if you guys have any thoughts or a clear sense of what he meant.

07:45 _Daniel:_

Yeah, very good question.
It does seem to be like there's competing Communications around.
What purpose is is purpose in this deflationary sense merely survival and persistence, at which point the clear communication would just be around whatever we are, we need to continue, even if that involves change versus more sub purposes or topical performances, which then might resemble standard non survival oriented purposes.
Like to deliver the most x in y.

08:26 _Tyler:_

Yeah.
Oh, sorry.

08:29 _Bleu:_

So I would question also if survival is the purpose of free energy governance or if free energy minimization is the purpose.
I think about when a firm swallows another firm in MNA, right?
But then the little firm is not the purpose is not to survive, right?

08:46 Like the purpose is to become amalgamated or whatever subsumed by the larger corporation.
Sorry if I cut you off or interrupted your thought.

08:56 _Tyler:_

Yeah, I guess something that I feel like has been not maybe I just haven't gotten it, but not necessarily consistently communicated is whether purpose is at the highest level of organization or at sub levels.
So in the same way as a pancreas cell may not know the metapurpose of the pancreas, I don't know anything about biology, so I'm not misstating something here.
Is it necessarily true that an individual team has to always keep in mind the larger metapurpose of this organization?

09:27 Or is it really okay to have something that's more relevant to its subunit organization?
And that hasn't always been clear to me.
I'm still kind of struggling with that.

09:41 _Bleu:_

Yeah.
I do think that Bajan specifically when he was talking about purpose, and I think that it comes more in the next chapter, but it might have been this chapter.
I don't know.
It's all blurring together, this one big chapter.
But he talks about purpose being on the front lines, right?

09:57 Like the people that are on the front lines are as much determining the purpose as they are communicating the purpose.
So it might be not a top down directional communication method.
It's a reciprocal communicating.
The purpose of the organization is probably like a bi directional information flow, ideally, anyway.
So people at the top don't know what the people at the bottom think the purpose is, and the people at the bottom don't know what the people at the top think the purpose is.

10:24 There's no unity, and then the firm has a divided purpose, I guess.

10:35 _Tyler:_

Yeah, I think that makes sense.
I mean, my take on what he's saying is it's like this co created maybe amorphous thing that you're not necessarily pinning down and defining and putting on a landing page on your website.
Maybe it's something that's more of like a shared, felt and sensed thing.
That's what I think he's saying, but he doesn't explain it that way, so I'm not totally sure.

11:00 _Bleu:_

Yeah, so these are good questions that we will, I think, hopefully have the opportunity to discuss further.

11:06 For sure.

11:09 Okay.
Unless there's anything else.
We'll go to embodied cognition, where he says brain, body and environment together form one integrated, cognitive embodied, inactive extended system recasting the phenomena of false inference and institutional psychosis as a matter of impaired prediction.
Error minimization may highlight how critically firm performance is also a function of upper echelon's embodied cognition as determined amongst other by psychological aspects as well as neurobiology.
So in this section, there was a whole bunch of neuroscience about dopamine and the reward system and prediction error minimization.

11:53 And obviously, a firm doesn't have dopamine as a prediction error satisfier or reward, but they do.
The whole firm isn't getting like a dopamine hit, but the individual members within that firm are getting that dopamine, I guess, when their predictions are correct.
Yeah, this was kind of like a big stretch for me to jump into, I guess.
The embodied cognition of the firm is the embodied cognition of the upper echelon.
But shouldn't it be like the embodied cognition of all of the firm members?

12:35 Or how do you get that bi directional integration of information without the bottom mattering just as much as the top here?
This is, like, fuzzy and weird for me.

12:49 _Tyler:_

Well, I think at one level organization, it's each member's individual dopamine receptors and everything, right?
But then at the next level, you can abstract out of way and say, maybe it's like the response to financing, maybe having more access to venture capital funding, for example, is a way of motivating action for an organization or visitor growth.
On a landing page, it's like the signal of, like, hey, you're going in the right direction.

13:20 Double down here and keep moving or keep exploring.
So that's maybe how I would think of it at an organizational level in a way that maybe feels kind of like, at a different level than just the sum of the dopamine receptors of all of its members.

13:43 _Bleu:_

Yeah, like hearing you on the gamification metrics for the organization, like hits on the landing page, or the number of subscribers, or the number of viewers, or the number of Twitter followers.
All those things like we know that are rewarding us personally with dopamine.
I guess that's like an easy bridge to cross regarding dopamine and institutional success or prediction or minimization.
I think.

14:10 _Tyler:_

Well, what I mean by that is a little bit differently.

14:12 It's not like on an individual level, if you see more hits on your landing page, that's going to have a dopamine response with you as an individual.
But I think some of these things, like, for example, like press coverage or getting venture capital funding, for example, those produce systemic changes in an organization that aren't just merely about the dopamine response in the individual.
And that's something that I feel like is like a higher level change that is harder to explain.
I'm struggling to come up with the words from it, but just like when you get a lot of funding into an organization or a startup or you start getting traction on something, it produces a kind of like social contagion.
I don't know if that's the right word.

14:55 That is more than just the sum of its parts of dopamine changes of its individuals.

15:07 _Bleu:_

Anything else here?
Or we can move on to artificial intelligence.
So here Bajan says free energy minimization is a machine logic in its own right, empowering living as well as artifactual organisms to optimally resist entropy.
And this is, I think, a shout out to the many people who are working on using active inference in machine learning instead of reinforcement learning.
So that's kind of great.

15:47 And he really talks about the ethics of that.
What happens when we talk about the singularity, right?
Like when machines become smarter than us?
And he says that effectively the challenge is moving from coding, like programming, even with active inference.
Right.

16:14 So coding to ethics, like how are we going to ethically program the machines so that they're not like self driving cars aren't running over people or whatever?
So there's the ethics and then to survival, to human survival, right?

16:37 Yeah.
If the machines get to a point where they don't need us anymore, why should they follow the ethics that we've programmed into them, I guess.

16:43 _Daniel:_

Anil Seth, this was a very interesting section.
First we could imagine a kind of trolley car problem with some organization and some people, and eventually the kind of decidability that's going to have to come into play there.
And the other provocative aspect in this, from coding to ethics to survival, is we often hear you can't get an ought from an Is, so no amount of mechanic definition is going to result in an ethical imperative.

17:14 Can't get an ought from an Is.
And that kind of describes this coatings to ethics difficulty.
You can't really get an Ethic just from how something is encoded.
But in a way, survival is being proposed as a post ethical imperative of first principles.
We couldn't necessarily go from Is to ought, but we can go from Is through ought back to Is, which is survival.

17:45 And so it kind of reinstinuates a type of first principle ethic, more like a work ethic than like a moral ethic.
But that opens up a lot of questions about what kinds of ethics are of what statuses under or after the survival imperative.

18:18 _Tyler:_

Yeah, it's interesting because I think with Active Inference lab or free energy governance specifically, there are two ways where I think it's interesting.
One level is like, thinking about an organization as an organism where it's like, independent of my human experience of that organism, of what makes this organism survive.
And then I think the reason why I care about it the most, which is my own human experience of how meaning is created for me in an organization.
And I think ultimately that's personally, at least, what I care about the most.
And then when I think about AI, I'm like, okay, well, even if you have an embedded AI in your system, if it doesn't mean something personally to the humans in that organization, I don't really care, even if it makes the organization survive more likely to survive.

19:04 So it's just like, interesting, these two different takes of like, okay, even if it makes the organization more likely to survive, why do I care if that isn't meaningful to me as a human in that organization?
Not sure if that makes sense.

19:25 _Bleu:_

Yeah.
So then Bajan also says first order principles such as AI's free Energy Minimization will lay the foundation for governance models to increasingly self organize.
So I think that this is very meta.
It's like how Daniel was saying we go from coding to ethics to survival.
I think maybe ethics is like the fog between coding and survival, where free Energy Minimization is about persistence and can be used in coding and will lay the foundation for governance models to increasingly self organized.

20:06 So like, self organization based on free energy minimization.
I guess the section was interesting and I do think that there's like, Pajama super excited about AI and we got a long way to go.
We'll get there.
It's not impossible.
It's just going to take some time, I think.

20:28 Any other thoughts here in artificial intelligence?

20:37 I mean, I have lots of other thoughts here, but I think getting Bashan's perspective will be really fun.

20:43 _Tyler:_

Yeah, I think the thing I really am not quite understanding here is the explainability piece, and I think I was trying to mention this earlier.
If you have an AI that's like, bubbling up insights about your organization saying like, hey, this is what's going on, or this is the right answer of what you should do in this situation, but it isn't understood by the people in that organization.
Does it even matter?
And is that what Bajan means by explainability?

21:08 Right.
Even if AI gives you the right answer, but it isn't understood and integrated into the people in the organization, is that AI actually useful in that organization?
And that's like the tension I've been grappling with here and I don't quite understand.
And he talks about explainability of predictions.
I'm not sure if that's exactly what he's talking about or not, but it's a good question for Bajan for sure.

21:39 _Bleu:_

And then the last section for future development is the board capabilities developmental paths.
So he says, indeed, the board is ultimately responsible for anticipating the firm's future capability constellation, including that of the board itself, to sustainably succeed with continuous strategic renewal.
However, to avoid the cognitive traps related to individual board profiles that Layman and Wallin identified, we must study the cognitive microfoundations of capability development at the board level.
To date, this area represents a void in both strategy and governance research.

22:20 So I thought that this was cool, especially with respect to active inference lab institute, like as we are fleshing out our own board and the board decides what this and future boards will be capable of doing now and forever, and all this stuff can be changed with approval of the board.
Right?
So I think that I like this capability constellation phrase.
I thought that that was kind of neat because there's a lot of little sub capabilities within the board, like there's committees and this and that, and everybody can do or take care of many different things, or what don't we want the board to do?
The possibilities are pretty endless and expansive, but what is purposeful and what will gain the most bang for the buck in terms of what should the board focus on?

23:22 That's kind of crazy.
And then he outlined a little bit of these cognitive traps, but I didn't go too far into them here.

23:36 Do you guys have anything here on board capabilities?

23:44 Oh, so this, so I did go actually a little bit into them.
So what capabilities are required at the level of the individual board member when the necessary firm capabilities are not yet developed?
And so, as Bajan is thinking about this, he goes to this theory U, which I had never heard of before.
And so he outlines three of the principles developed in this theory U.
And it looks like that there's quite a few, but he talked about what are the capabilities required at the board member level when we're defining the firm capabilities, like the board capabilities for now and forever.

24:22 And so these I really liked.
So he says number nine, practice principle number nine is what it is.
Practice deep listening and dialogue.
Connect with your mind and heart wide open when connecting to other people and contact.
Open up all four channels of listening.

24:37 Listen from what you know, from what surprises you, from the whole and from what you sense wants to emerge, the emerging whole.
And I really like this like four different ways of listening, something that we don't always think about.
We just listen.
And we listen in one way.
I listened.

24:55 I heard this.
But when you're looking at listening in different aspects, it's different, right?
Like, listening from what surprises you?
Can you listen to it four times and pretend like you don't know anything?
Pretend like, how does this relate to what you already know?

25:15 I thought that this was really nice.
I don't know if you guys have if you were excited about it as I was as excited or I can read collective sense making next.
Or maybe Tyler wants to read collective sense making.

25:30 _Tyler:_

Yes.
I was just going to say I really love the convergence of new AG and corporate governance literature.

25:37 Kind of converging in reenergy governance.
It's wonderful.
All right, so number ten collective sense making.
So use social presencing, theater and embodied knowing.
So whatever process you use to make sense of the learning journey, what matters most is that you pay disciplined attention to all the voices and manifestations of the field.

25:56 Paying disciplined attention means that you are intentionally holding back all inclinations to mix your own interpretations or solutions.
Just spend all that because you want the data of the field to speak for you.
The field cannot speak to you if your mind is too busy.

26:19 _Bleu:_

So that was also cool.

26:23 But the data of the field cannot speak to you if your mind is too busy expressing opinions and proposing solutions.
Oh, that cuts to the core.
Yeah, sorry, I guess I cut that off.
And then whatever.
My slide making capabilities were subpar.

26:40 And then the last principle is principle 22.
I'm like, now I'm like, I want to read this theory.
You like, what is this all about?
I'm totally interested in learning more about these principles.
Number 22 is create enabling infrastructures that allow the system to sense and see itself.

26:59 And he quotes, making the system sense and see itself can change the coordination dynamics among the players in a field, moving them toward ecosystem awareness.
As traditional governance models are increasingly uprooted in a discontinuous world, there is not only a need for a new governance project, but correspondingly new board capabilities, developmental paths, specifically, duality management as a dynamic board capability demands dedicated research.
And that duality management, just to remind everyone, is like financial and strategic control.
So it's like both of those things, not one or the other.
They both work together.

27:40 Then we can go into chapter 13.
Or if you guys have more thoughts about this, these theory you principles.
No, we can go into this.
Chapter 13.
Tyler, do you want to read this portion of the abstract?

27:54 _Tyler:_

For us, the classical cause effect determinism upon which the paradigm of strategy management as well as governance research has been built, is uprooted.
Baparian academics relentless pursuit of empirically establishing, qualifying, and then falsifying mechanistic cause and effective relationships is struggling to inspire the business community, which is itself wriggling too often with the self inflicted limitations of its own, of its very world models.
Together, academia and practice are challenged to reconnect organizing to that self evidencing dimension of the universe's information system.
Fpg is as valid for business organizations as it is for political contracts, or for that matter, navigating geopolitical dislocations and debt cycle disruptions.

28:41 _Bleu:_

Thank you.

28:42 And I'll read this last piece.
It says, any organism that suffers from one top down, bottom up hierarchical disconnectivity and a top down dominance of supervised content prescriptions.
Two, an urge to adapt to the outer world emit an incapacity for an active inference.
And three, the nonexistence of both a timeless depurpose as well as medicapabilities is naturally entropy bound.
In the absence of a generative Bayesian model, we become incapacitated.

29:11 Indeed, camping on seesaws is the categorical imperative of survival pursuing self organization.
Organization as a means, not an end.
It is right here where the fundamental difference between traditional corporate governance and free energy governance models lie.
Free energy governance sees the informal organization as organizing, manifests itself as a self organizing generative model operating as a whole, within and without the firm, embracing self organization as a self evidencing universal information system.

29:45 And so he makes like I just pulled out several claims that he made in this chapter and a couple of little summary sections, because this is like the official summary.
He says, Together, academia and practice are challenged to reconnect organizing to that self organizing or self evidencing dimension inherent of the universe's information system to purposefully create, extend or modify the firm's resource base.
And that's a quote from Health Fed, et al.
And he says, to thrive and survive purposeful behavior is one of life's defining features, but it is only possible if living systems operate as a whole.
It is only by managing information that the cell can impose order on the extreme complexity of its operations and therefore fulfill its ultimate purpose of staying alive and reproducing.

30:36 And this is a quote from Nurse 2020.
And I don't know, this is so hard because I'll always go back to Mike Levin's beautiful explanation of the constraints imposed by the larger system on a smaller system.
Because a cell's ultimate purpose is not staying alive, reproducing.
In fact, if it's one cell, sure, but in a multicellular organism, some cells, like the purpose of the cell, is to die.
We all start off with webbing between the fingers, and that webbing is cells.

31:07 And then that webbing goes away.
So that cell, in the construction of our existence and our morphology, its purpose is to die.
So I guess, like we were talking about MNA earlier, the purpose of the smaller firm that gets subsumed by a larger firm is also to die or become incorporated or to somehow integrate with the current larger firm.
And so these constraints, I don't know.
So the nested hierarchical levels, each top level or each larger level constrains the function of the inner level and also that information.

31:54 Sorry, I have to just say that because otherwise staying alive and reproducing is not the purpose of self.
Sorry, I don't know if you guys have thought to move on.

32:10 Bijean says free energy as an information theoretic rather than thermodynamic measure, is uniquely positioned to measure and guide a firm's survivability as a self organizing information as well as belief system.
And he quotes this book from Lindsay 2021.
Daniel, have you read this?
I haven't read it, but it's like a frison memoir, I guess.
He says Friston recalls a thought he had as a teenager.

32:37 There must be a way of understanding everything by starting from nothing.
If I'm only allowed to start off with one point in the entire universe, can I derive everything else I need from that?
In friskin's world, the free energy principle is now the nearly nothing that can explain almost everything.
I like this quote from this book.
And also, I've got to go read it now.

32:56 I don't know if it's a frison memoir or maybe it's just an interview or like a long article or something like that, but I haven't read it.
But it's like someone else giving a detail of Kristen's life and ideas, I guess.
I don't know if you guys have thoughts here.

33:16 No.
Yes.
No.
Okay.

33:23 I just want to just call out.
We just talked about very early on, maybe it was like the fourth video we did talk about.
What are we talking about?
Thermodynamic versus information theoretic free energy.
Go back because we really did get into that.

33:42 So if you're going, what are they talking about?
We did talk about that quite a bit in one of the early videos.
So now might be a good time to just refresh your memory that we did detail that.
So if that's looking weird to you, go get a refresher.
Okay.

33:58 And then claim here, in summary, the inferential discovery of informational dissonance as an error minimizing source for optimizing the accuracy of posterior beliefs rather than explaining dissonance away is essential to firm survival in discontinuous environments.
And I like this informational dissonance part.
This was like a couple videos ago.
Not that not that far in the past, but yeah.
So this brought up the initial communication question for Bajan.

34:33 Does everybody need to know everything all of the time and also your information getting updated with the outside information to resolve the dissonance.
Anyway, there's that.
Do you get some thoughts here?
All right, I'm going to make somebody else read these because I'm tired of talking, tired of hearing myself talk.
Tyler, do you want to do this?

34:57 This is the building blocks of an active inference.
So this is a nice little summary recap of what we've learned so far.

35:04 _Tyler:_

All right.
Building blocks of active inference lab.
So one is the four states that's active action, sensory perception, internal firm resources, and external the.

35:14 Hidden unknowns.
Two one internal external Markovian boundary the site where actions upon hidden states generate outcomes that feed in circular causality our perception and allow the precision enhancing updating of prior beliefs.
Predictions three one first order principle free energy minimization as a measure of minimizing equivocally error and uncertainty I.
E.
The divergence between predictions, prior beliefs and outcomes posterior beliefs.

35:40 Eventually, everything becomes measurable.

35:45 _Bleu:_

Thank you.
Yeah.
And so Bijean makes this claim that once managers start approaching exploration in the form of an active inference linking in circular causality all four states conditioned by the Markov blanket and governance by free energy minimization, we can straightaway see that success and exploration is critically determined by the level of sophistication of a few things.
First, prediction models a self evidencing eco niche model that connects corporate purpose with the very predictions the firm stipulates.
Second, the bounded set of external states that the firm decides to act upon to bottom up, sample the world and test hypotheses with the least required computational resource investment.

36:28 And third, belief updating resulting from the consequences posterior beliefs that the firm's actions generate.
And so this was also, like a nice little summary section, I thought, and he continues to say it is now self evident to appreciate that action is central to perception.
More importantly, the firm's generative model and actions control ambiguity and uncertainty.
The firm's generative model is the firm's eco niche.
The firm is more in control than it traditionally resists to believe.

37:02 The perception of uncertainty is after observer I.
E.
Firm specific.
And I did like that real uncertainty versus the perception of uncertainty.
And when we're talking about embodied, enacted, extended cognition, it's all about your perception of uncertainty versus actual uncertainty.

37:26 So unless you can count cards, you're uncertain of like if you're playing blackjack, you don't you don't know what your chances are of getting 21.
But if you can count cards, that's just one example.
You're less uncertain if it's a single deck blackjack, you're less uncertain as to what are the possibilities as the game continues to unfold.

It's also interesting there with the kind of Declaration of Independence like self evident appreciation that reflects the real bright line between passive inference and active inference.
And it's like that claim does one agree or disagree?
And then if they did agree, then they have already seen their own eye movement and decision to seek out this information as central to their perception of that expression.
So it kind of serves as like a co on of self evidencing.
And then there are some downstream implications.

38:29 For example, one that he attacks many times throughout is that the external world is not uncertain.
There's not uncertainty in the commodities market.
There's an observer dependent uncertainty about external states and about action selection.
Active Inference Lab is a generic family of strategies for jointly resolving uncertainty about external states and actions that bring alignment aka provide pragmatic value.
So many of those implications of feg are downstream of the acceptance or acknowledgment that action is central to perception.

39:16 _Bleu:_

Very nice.
Thank you.

39:21 Okay, so he lists these requirements for outperformance and survival.
Tyler, do you want to read these for me?

39:30 _Tyler:_

Yes.
All right.
One, a timeless deep purpose.

39:34 Two generative top down, bottom up, prediction error, minimization form of free energy minimizing active inference lab.
Three principled values and aspirations determining go niche prosperity and sustainability.
If all three elements are articulated in simple explainable, Lagrange and communicated to all members within and beyond the firm's boundaries, then the firm's long term prospects will be sustainably enhanced in form of self organizing generative model.
The board of directors, rather than executive leadership only, must ensure that those elements come to life and more importantly, stay alive.

40:09 _Bleu:_

Thanks.

40:12 Sorry.
So this goes back to, like, we were talking about purpose earlier.
Where does purpose come from?
Who decides what the purpose is?
So it was more talked about, I think, a lot in this chapter.

40:25 And we've also talked about it before through the book.
So this is a nice little wrap up section.
And then Bijean goes on to make the claim that free organization okay.
I've said organization so many times.
I think if I were to count, like, I probably have said the word organization like a thousand times in this live stream.

40:46 Maybe not, maybe 150.
Energy governance is as valid for business organizations as it is for political constructs, or for that matter, navigating geopolitical dislocations and debt cycle disruptions.
Any organism that suffers from a one top down, bottom up disconnectivity.
Two top down dominance of ideological and supervised content prescriptions.
Three, dominant logic to adapt to the outer world amid a self inflicted incapacity for an active inference.

41:16 And not least, four, non existence of a timeless purpose, as well as medicabilities such as listening to what wants to emerge in the web of random interactions and observing the observer is naturally entropy bound and incapacitated to navigate macro disruptions.
So he gives that recipe for survival and outperformance here in the last requirements for outperformance and survival.
So I think that those are just like the three.
Those are just like the inverse statements of each other, like, this is what we need, this is what we can't have.
So that's a nice way to wrap up how free energy governance will contribute to the firm's outperformance and survival in the world, competing with other firms and such.

42:06 Do you guys have any thoughts here?

42:11 Good.
Okay.
And then I just pulled this final quote out, and we kind of alluded to this earlier.
It says, does the uncertainty that human space come from the inherent instability of the human landscape or from the perceptions and belief systems that we have about the human environment?
And this is kind of nice.

42:35 What is it that's unstable?
Where is the uncertainty?
Is the uncertainty in our perception or is it in the world somewhere?
So I don't know.
This is a nice thing to think about, and in resolving that uncertainty through action, I think, gets to kind of the core of free energy governance here at the end of the book.

43:03 Thanks for listening.
I don't know if you guys have any final thoughts on any of the content presented here in these two chapters or on the book overall or questions that are brewing through your mind.
Nothing like that.
All right.
We're quick through the concluding sections, and we look forward to having an open discussion with the author in a few weeks, as well as other participants who have been keeping up with the content.

43:31 So thanks, guys.

43:33 _Daniel:_

Thank you, Tyler.
Thank you.
Bleu farewell.
