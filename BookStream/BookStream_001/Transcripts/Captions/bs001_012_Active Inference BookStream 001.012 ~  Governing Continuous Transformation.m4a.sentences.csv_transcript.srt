1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,149
Daniel: Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:09,037 --> 00:00:13,424
It's March 28, 2023.

3
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:18,902
We're here in Active Bookstream number

4
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:18,902
1.012.

5
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:19,054
Off to you, Bleu.

6
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:20,182
Bleu: Great.

7
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:30,166
So we will be continuing our discussion

8
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:30,166
of the book governing Continuous

9
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:30,166
Transformation by Bijean Kesri and this

10
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:30,166
actually is going to wrap up our coverage

11
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:30,166
of this book.

12
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:38,974
We're not going to go into the interviews

13
00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:38,974
covered in the final section, but we're

14
00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:38,974
going to just cover this concluding part

15
00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:38,974
and then wrap it up now.

16
00:00:30,168 --> 00:00:44,551
And then in a few weeks we will rejoin

17
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:44,551
for a discussion section or a discussion

18
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:44,551
session.

19
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:52,383
So if you've been following along with

20
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:52,383
the live streams to this point, please

21
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:52,383
get in touch with us so that you can come

22
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:52,383
on and discuss some of the contents of

23
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:52,383
the book with us.

24
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:55,637
And hopefully the author is available to

25
00:00:55,637 --> 00:00:55,637
join us.

26
00:00:52,387 --> 00:01:04,951
So we are Active Inference Lab Institute,

27
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:04,951
a participatory online institute that is

28
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:04,951
communicating, learning and practicing

29
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:04,951
applied active inference.

30
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:08,309
You can reach us at social media at all

31
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:08,309
of these links.

32
00:01:04,962 --> 00:01:14,967
This is also a recorded and an archived

33
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:14,967
Livestream so please provide us with

34
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:14,967
feedback so that we can improve on our

35
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:14,967
work.

36
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:23,895
All backgrounds and perspectives are

37
00:01:23,895 --> 00:01:23,895
welcome here and we will be attempting to

38
00:01:23,895 --> 00:01:23,895
follow good video etiquette for live

39
00:01:23,895 --> 00:01:23,895
streams.

40
00:01:14,978 --> 00:01:27,277
Again, there's many ways to participate

41
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:27,277
and collaborate with the Active Inference

42
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:27,277
Institute.

43
00:01:24,914 --> 00:01:32,728
So if you are interested Active Inference

44
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:32,728
Lab and are not yet collaborating with

45
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:32,728
us, just get in touch.

46
00:01:27,282 --> 00:01:40,577
Active Inference is our website and

47
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:40,577
there's a link to fill out a form if you

48
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:40,577
want to contribute in other ways to the

49
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:40,577
institute besides joining us on the live

50
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:40,577
stream.

51
00:01:32,735 --> 00:01:46,016
So the goal of this bookstream is to

52
00:01:46,016 --> 00:01:46,016
conclude our discussions of this book.

53
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:51,066
So we are going to cover chapters twelve

54
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:51,066
and 13.

55
00:01:46,017 --> 00:01:53,081
I want to skip to the road belt.

56
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:58,131
So we're going to cover chapters twelve

57
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:58,131
and 13 in this part three conclusion of

58
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:58,131
the book.

59
00:01:53,082 --> 00:02:07,161
So chapter twelve is the future Research

60
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:07,161
agenda and chapter 13 is outperformance

61
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:07,161
and survival as a matter of self

62
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:07,161
organization.

63
00:01:58,132 --> 00:02:11,205
So we can just quickly introduce

64
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:11,205
ourselves before jumping into the

65
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:11,205
contents.

66
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:12,211
I'm Bleu.

67
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:17,262
I'm an independent research consultant in

68
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:17,262
New Mexico, and I'll pass it off to

69
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:17,262
Tyler.

70
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:18,276
Tyler: I'm Tyler.

71
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:20,297
I'm a protocol designer and Dow

72
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:20,297
researcher.

73
00:02:18,276 --> 00:02:22,312
Also in California.

74
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:26,351
Daniel: And Daniel I'm a researcher in

75
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:26,351
California.

76
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:28,379
Bleu: Did I say California?

77
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:30,390
I meant to say New Mexico.

78
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:32,411
I think I said, did I say California?

79
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:33,420
Oh, my gosh.

80
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:35,441
All california.

81
00:02:33,426 --> 00:02:36,458
Tyler: I'm probably getting confused.

82
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:38,474
Bleu: Maybe I said California.

83
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:40,494
I'm having visions of the beach.

84
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:45,545
Okay, so chapter twelve has a few

85
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:45,545
different sections.

86
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:47,566
Again, this is like future research

87
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:47,566
directions.

88
00:02:45,546 --> 00:03:08,712
The Jeans discusses language and

89
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:08,712
communication, embodied cognition,

90
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:08,712
artificial intelligence, board

91
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:08,712
capabilities, developmental paths, and

92
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:08,712
then chapter 13 is really just a

93
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:08,712
provocative conclusion section and

94
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:08,712
reminds us of some of the things that

95
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:08,712
we've learned in the book so far and also

96
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:08,712
outperformance and survival as a matter

97
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:08,712
of like free energy minimization.

98
00:02:47,567 --> 00:03:15,784
So we will jump right into the content

99
00:03:15,784 --> 00:03:15,784
tyler, do you want to read this first

100
00:03:15,784 --> 00:03:15,784
part of the abstract for us?

101
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:16,792
Sure.

102
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:23,864
Tyler: Feg is the product of the

103
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:23,864
multidisciplinary research project

104
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:23,864
connecting the dots among strategy

105
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:23,864
governance and neuroscience research.

106
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:43,059
Opening a new conversation headlines

107
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,059
introducing the free energy principles

108
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,059
strategy management feg redefines the

109
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,059
nexus structure of cognition ABV so

110
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,059
touching base view advances the dynamic

111
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,059
capability view and from the managerial

112
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,059
to the core level and establishes

113
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,059
strategy as an inactive Bayesian

114
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,059
inference challenge.

115
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:49,124
In terms of future research, four areas

116
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:49,124
should advance the optimization of Feg

117
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:49,124
one, language and communication.

118
00:03:43,063 --> 00:03:54,169
In particular, explainability of

119
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:54,169
corporate purpose prediction models and

120
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:54,169
predictions.

121
00:03:49,125 --> 00:04:01,189
Two, by cognition in terms of a deeper

122
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:01,189
understanding around the neurobiology

123
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:01,189
underlying leadership's world engagement

124
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:01,189
as well as false inference.

125
00:03:54,171 --> 00:04:05,224
Bleu: Thanks, and I'll read this next

126
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:05,224
part.

127
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:21,384
So the third area is artificial

128
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:21,384
intelligence, in particular the strategy

129
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:21,384
application of Aipowered machine

130
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:21,384
algorithms and fourth, board capabilities

131
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:21,384
developmental paths, in particular, the

132
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:21,384
board's ability to collectively develop

133
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:21,384
meta capabilities.

134
00:04:06,237 --> 00:04:44,613
Free Energy Governance as a framework

135
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:44,613
provides the fundamental building blocks

136
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:44,613
that empower a firm to implement free

137
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:44,613
energy minimization as a self organized

138
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:44,613
principle structure top down bottom up

139
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:44,613
connectivity, cognition, environmental

140
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:44,613
enactment and capabilities duality

141
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:44,613
Management within the SDG framework, many

142
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:44,613
vibrant strategy research topics lend

143
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:44,613
themselves to be repurposed as a matter

144
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:44,613
of optimizing free energy minimization.

145
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:49,664
More specifically, survival rather than

146
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:49,664
just performance is the critical

147
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:49,664
dependent variable.

148
00:04:44,615 --> 00:05:00,716
Sorry, I'm trying to navigate my board so

149
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:00,716
getting into the first section, Language

150
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:00,716
and Communication.

151
00:04:54,712 --> 00:05:06,770
So I just pulled a couple of sentences

152
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:06,770
out of this section.

153
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:22,933
Bijean says that the effectiveness of

154
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:22,933
free energy governance is critically

155
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:22,933
determined by transparency in

156
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:22,933
communication, specifically around the

157
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:22,933
explainability of corporate purpose

158
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:22,933
prediction models and predictions to

159
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:22,933
obtain the most possible human energy for

160
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:22,933
productive effort.

161
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:24,952
And I think this is really something.

162
00:05:22,935 --> 00:05:29,007
The communication overall is an area that

163
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:29,007
I would like to discuss with Bijean

164
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:29,007
further.

165
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:48,191
But he does really kind of clarify some

166
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:48,191
of the questions that we've been having

167
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:48,191
over the last couple of weeks here in

168
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:48,191
this section, and even maybe the next

169
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:48,191
section about what specifically needs to

170
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:48,191
be communicated to all members of the

171
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:48,191
firm and at all levels.

172
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:50,216
So he really does kind of clarify.

173
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:57,283
He says if organization is emergent in

174
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:57,283
communication as we believe, then it is

175
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:57,283
not a being but a becoming.

176
00:05:51,222 --> 00:06:00,258
And that's a quote from Taylor 2000.

177
00:05:57,283 --> 00:06:04,295
And then he also says language is not a

178
00:06:04,295 --> 00:06:04,295
tool, but a force.

179
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:19,440
And with this, I think he specifically is

180
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:19,440
referring to a force that holds the firm

181
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:19,440
together, contributes to the self

182
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:19,440
organizing purpose and sustainability of

183
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:19,440
the firm.

184
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:32,572
And really he does talk a lot about the

185
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:32,572
purpose of the firm both in this chapter

186
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:32,572
and the next, as like, everybody needs to

187
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:32,572
know what is the point for the firm's

188
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:32,572
existence or for the corporation's

189
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:32,572
existence?

190
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:51,762
And so I think that that is one aspect

191
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:51,762
that might not necessarily be like a

192
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:51,762
governance strategy or something that's

193
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:51,762
internal, like a method of operation

194
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:51,762
that's like we think about the top level

195
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:51,762
executives, but something that why are we

196
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:51,762
here?

197
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:52,771
What are we doing?

198
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:55,801
What purpose are we serving as a

199
00:06:55,801 --> 00:06:55,801
corporation, as a company?

200
00:06:52,771 --> 00:07:02,812
And I think that that is like one

201
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:02,812
reasonable thing that can be communicated

202
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:02,812
to team members at all levels.

203
00:06:55,802 --> 00:07:04,836
I don't know if you guys have any

204
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:04,836
thoughts here or.

205
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:15,947
Tyler: Yeah, one thing that was not

206
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:15,947
really clear on about what John was

207
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:15,947
getting at here was what it means to have

208
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:15,947
explainable purpose.

209
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:21,004
Because on one level, the feg, like

210
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:21,004
ultimate purpose, as I understand it, is

211
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:21,004
just like survival.

212
00:07:15,948 --> 00:07:33,126
But I'm not sure if he meant purpose in

213
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:33,126
some other sense of like, I don't know,

214
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:33,126
we are improving our customers access to

215
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:33,126
health care or something like that style

216
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:33,126
level of purpose.

217
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:36,158
And I wasn't quite clear what he meant

218
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:36,158
and he didn't quite give that many

219
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:36,158
examples.

220
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:41,199
So I'm not sure if you guys have any

221
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:41,199
thoughts or a clear sense of what he

222
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:41,199
meant.

223
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:46,255
Daniel: Yeah, very good question.

224
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,315
It does seem to be like there's competing

225
00:07:52,315 --> 00:07:52,315
Communications around.

226
00:07:46,256 --> 00:08:20,534
What purpose is is purpose in this

227
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:20,534
deflationary sense merely survival and

228
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:20,534
persistence, at which point the clear

229
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:20,534
communication would just be around

230
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:20,534
whatever we are, we need to continue,

231
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:20,534
even if that involves change versus more

232
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:20,534
sub purposes or topical performances,

233
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:20,534
which then might resemble standard non

234
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:20,534
survival oriented purposes.

235
00:07:52,315 --> 00:08:23,568
Like to deliver the most x in y.

236
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:27,602
Tyler: Yeah.

237
00:08:26,594 --> 00:08:28,612
Oh, sorry.

238
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:36,690
Bleu: So I would question also if

239
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:36,690
survival is the purpose of free energy

240
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:36,690
governance or if free energy minimization

241
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:36,690
is the purpose.

242
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:41,746
I think about when a firm swallows

243
00:08:41,746 --> 00:08:41,746
another firm in MNA, right?

244
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:46,790
But then the little firm is not the

245
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,790
purpose is not to survive, right?

246
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:52,854
Like the purpose is to become amalgamated

247
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:52,854
or whatever subsumed by the larger

248
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:52,854
corporation.

249
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:55,879
Sorry if I cut you off or interrupted

250
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:55,879
your thought.

251
00:08:52,855 --> 00:09:08,956
Tyler: Yeah, I guess something that I

252
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:08,956
feel like has been not maybe I just

253
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:08,956
haven't gotten it, but not necessarily

254
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:08,956
consistently communicated is whether

255
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:08,956
purpose is at the highest level of

256
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:08,956
organization or at sub levels.

257
00:08:56,894 --> 00:09:18,051
So in the same way as a pancreas cell may

258
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
not know the metapurpose of the pancreas,

259
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
I don't know anything about biology, so

260
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,051
I'm not misstating something here.

261
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:26,136
Is it necessarily true that an individual

262
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:26,136
team has to always keep in mind the

263
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:26,136
larger metapurpose of this organization?

264
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:32,191
Or is it really okay to have something

265
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:32,191
that's more relevant to its subunit

266
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:32,191
organization?

267
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:35,228
And that hasn't always been clear to me.

268
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:37,247
I'm still kind of struggling with that.

269
00:09:35,228 --> 00:09:42,296
Bleu: Yeah.

270
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:50,374
I do think that Bajan specifically when

271
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:50,374
he was talking about purpose, and I think

272
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:50,374
that it comes more in the next chapter,

273
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:50,374
but it might have been this chapter.

274
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:50,378
I don't know.

275
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:52,397
It's all blurring together, this one big

276
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:52,397
chapter.

277
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:57,445
But he talks about purpose being on the

278
00:09:57,445 --> 00:09:57,445
front lines, right?

279
00:09:52,398 --> 00:10:04,451
Like the people that are on the front

280
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:04,451
lines are as much determining the purpose

281
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:04,451
as they are communicating the purpose.

282
00:09:57,446 --> 00:10:08,493
So it might be not a top down directional

283
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:08,493
communication method.

284
00:10:04,452 --> 00:10:11,527
It's a reciprocal communicating.

285
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:17,588
The purpose of the organization is

286
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:17,588
probably like a bi directional

287
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:17,588
information flow, ideally, anyway.

288
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:24,654
So people at the top don't know what the

289
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:24,654
people at the bottom think the purpose

290
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:24,654
is, and the people at the bottom don't

291
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:24,654
know what the people at the top think the

292
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:24,654
purpose is.

293
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:29,701
There's no unity, and then the firm has a

294
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:29,701
divided purpose, I guess.

295
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:36,777
Tyler: Yeah, I think that makes sense.

296
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:47,884
I mean, my take on what he's saying is

297
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:47,884
it's like this co created maybe amorphous

298
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:47,884
thing that you're not necessarily pinning

299
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:47,884
down and defining and putting on a

300
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:47,884
landing page on your website.

301
00:10:36,777 --> 00:10:51,920
Maybe it's something that's more of like

302
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:51,920
a shared, felt and sensed thing.

303
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:58,994
That's what I think he's saying, but he

304
00:10:58,994 --> 00:10:58,994
doesn't explain it that way, so I'm not

305
00:10:58,994 --> 00:10:58,994
totally sure.

306
00:10:52,931 --> 00:11:06,013
Bleu: Yeah, so these are good questions

307
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:06,013
that we will, I think, hopefully have the

308
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:06,013
opportunity to discuss further.

309
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:07,024
For sure.

310
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:10,051
Okay.

311
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:11,061
Unless there's anything else.

312
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:28,233
We'll go to embodied cognition, where he

313
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:28,233
says brain, body and environment together

314
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:28,233
form one integrated, cognitive embodied,

315
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:28,233
inactive extended system recasting the

316
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:28,233
phenomena of false inference and

317
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:28,233
institutional psychosis as a matter of

318
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:28,233
impaired prediction.

319
00:11:11,062 --> 00:11:41,367
Error minimization may highlight how

320
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:41,367
critically firm performance is also a

321
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:41,367
function of upper echelon's embodied

322
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:41,367
cognition as determined amongst other by

323
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:41,367
psychological aspects as well as

324
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:41,367
neurobiology.

325
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:53,486
So in this section, there was a whole

326
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:53,486
bunch of neuroscience about dopamine and

327
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:53,486
the reward system and prediction error

328
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:53,486
minimization.

329
00:11:41,368 --> 00:12:01,506
And obviously, a firm doesn't have

330
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:01,506
dopamine as a prediction error satisfier

331
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:01,506
or reward, but they do.

332
00:11:53,487 --> 00:12:11,603
The whole firm isn't getting like a

333
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:11,603
dopamine hit, but the individual members

334
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:11,603
within that firm are getting that

335
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:11,603
dopamine, I guess, when their predictions

336
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:11,603
are correct.

337
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:24,732
Yeah, this was kind of like a big stretch

338
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:24,732
for me to jump into, I guess.

339
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:31,806
The embodied cognition of the firm is the

340
00:12:31,806 --> 00:12:31,806
embodied cognition of the upper echelon.

341
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:35,845
But shouldn't it be like the embodied

342
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:35,845
cognition of all of the firm members?

343
00:12:31,806 --> 00:12:45,943
Or how do you get that bi directional

344
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:45,943
integration of information without the

345
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:45,943
bottom mattering just as much as the top

346
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:45,943
here?

347
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:47,967
This is, like, fuzzy and weird for me.

348
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:58,072
Tyler: Well, I think at one level

349
00:12:58,072 --> 00:12:58,072
organization, it's each member's

350
00:12:58,072 --> 00:12:58,072
individual dopamine receptors and

351
00:12:58,072 --> 00:12:58,072
everything, right?

352
00:12:49,985 --> 00:13:16,191
But then at the next level, you can

353
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:16,191
abstract out of way and say, maybe it's

354
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:16,191
like the response to financing, maybe

355
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:16,191
having more access to venture capital

356
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:16,191
funding, for example, is a way of

357
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:16,191
motivating action for an organization or

358
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:16,191
visitor growth.

359
00:12:58,073 --> 00:13:20,234
On a landing page, it's like the signal

360
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:20,234
of, like, hey, you're going in the right

361
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:20,234
direction.

362
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:24,278
Double down here and keep moving or keep

363
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:24,278
exploring.

364
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:39,427
So that's maybe how I would think of it

365
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:39,427
at an organizational level in a way that

366
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:39,427
maybe feels kind of like, at a different

367
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:39,427
level than just the sum of the dopamine

368
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:39,427
receptors of all of its members.

369
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:52,558
Bleu: Yeah, like hearing you on the

370
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:52,558
gamification metrics for the

371
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:52,558
organization, like hits on the landing

372
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:52,558
page, or the number of subscribers, or

373
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:52,558
the number of viewers, or the number of

374
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:52,558
Twitter followers.

375
00:13:43,463 --> 00:13:58,613
All those things like we know that are

376
00:13:58,613 --> 00:13:58,613
rewarding us personally with dopamine.

377
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:08,653
I guess that's like an easy bridge to

378
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:08,653
cross regarding dopamine and

379
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:08,653
institutional success or prediction or

380
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:08,653
minimization.

381
00:13:58,616 --> 00:14:09,662
I think.

382
00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:12,693
Tyler: Well, what I mean by that is a

383
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:12,693
little bit differently.

384
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:21,785
It's not like on an individual level, if

385
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:21,785
you see more hits on your landing page,

386
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:21,785
that's going to have a dopamine response

387
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:21,785
with you as an individual.

388
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:36,934
But I think some of these things, like,

389
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:36,934
for example, like press coverage or

390
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:36,934
getting venture capital funding, for

391
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:36,934
example, those produce systemic changes

392
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:36,934
in an organization that aren't just

393
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:36,934
merely about the dopamine response in the

394
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:36,934
individual.

395
00:14:21,787 --> 00:14:41,986
And that's something that I feel like is

396
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:41,986
like a higher level change that is harder

397
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:41,986
to explain.

398
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:54,114
I'm struggling to come up with the words

399
00:14:54,114 --> 00:14:54,114
from it, but just like when you get a lot

400
00:14:54,114 --> 00:14:54,114
of funding into an organization or a

401
00:14:54,114 --> 00:14:54,114
startup or you start getting traction on

402
00:14:54,114 --> 00:14:54,114
something, it produces a kind of like

403
00:14:54,114 --> 00:14:54,114
social contagion.

404
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:55,124
I don't know if that's the right word.

405
00:14:54,114 --> 00:15:02,130
That is more than just the sum of its

406
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:02,130
parts of dopamine changes of its

407
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:02,130
individuals.

408
00:14:55,124 --> 00:15:08,197
Bleu: Anything else here?

409
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:15,266
Or we can move on to artificial

410
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:15,266
intelligence.

411
00:15:08,197 --> 00:15:27,387
So here Bajan says free energy

412
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:27,387
minimization is a machine logic in its

413
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:27,387
own right, empowering living as well as

414
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:27,387
artifactual organisms to optimally resist

415
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:27,387
entropy.

416
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:43,542
And this is, I think, a shout out to the

417
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:43,542
many people who are working on using

418
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:43,542
active inference in machine learning

419
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:43,542
instead of reinforcement learning.

420
00:15:29,402 --> 00:15:45,567
So that's kind of great.

421
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:54,652
And he really talks about the ethics of

422
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:54,652
that.

423
00:15:47,585 --> 00:16:01,664
What happens when we talk about the

424
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:01,664
singularity, right?

425
00:15:54,654 --> 00:16:04,699
Like when machines become smarter than

426
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:04,699
us?

427
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:14,793
And he says that effectively the

428
00:16:14,793 --> 00:16:14,793
challenge is moving from coding, like

429
00:16:14,793 --> 00:16:14,793
programming, even with active inference.

430
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:14,797
Right.

431
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:28,930
So coding to ethics, like how are we

432
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:28,930
going to ethically program the machines

433
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:28,930
so that they're not like self driving

434
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:28,930
cars aren't running over people or

435
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:28,930
whatever?

436
00:16:14,797 --> 00:16:34,997
So there's the ethics and then to

437
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:34,997
survival, to human survival, right?

438
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:37,022
Yeah.

439
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:43,082
If the machines get to a point where they

440
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:43,082
don't need us anymore, why should they

441
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:43,082
follow the ethics that we've programmed

442
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:43,082
into them, I guess.

443
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:47,123
Daniel: Anil Seth, this was a very

444
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:47,123
interesting section.

445
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:58,233
First we could imagine a kind of trolley

446
00:16:58,233 --> 00:16:58,233
car problem with some organization and

447
00:16:58,233 --> 00:16:58,233
some people, and eventually the kind of

448
00:16:58,233 --> 00:16:58,233
decidability that's going to have to come

449
00:16:58,233 --> 00:16:58,233
into play there.

450
00:16:47,124 --> 00:17:14,332
And the other provocative aspect in this,

451
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:14,332
from coding to ethics to survival, is we

452
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:14,332
often hear you can't get an ought from an

453
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:14,332
Is, so no amount of mechanic definition

454
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:14,332
is going to result in an ethical

455
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:14,332
imperative.

456
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:15,346
Can't get an ought from an Is.

457
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:21,400
And that kind of describes this coatings

458
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:21,400
to ethics difficulty.

459
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:25,440
You can't really get an Ethic just from

460
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:25,440
how something is encoded.

461
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:34,536
But in a way, survival is being proposed

462
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:34,536
as a post ethical imperative of first

463
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:34,536
principles.

464
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:45,640
We couldn't necessarily go from Is to

465
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:45,640
ought, but we can go from Is through

466
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:45,640
ought back to Is, which is survival.

467
00:17:35,545 --> 00:18:00,736
And so it kind of reinstinuates a type of

468
00:18:00,736 --> 00:18:00,736
first principle ethic, more like a work

469
00:18:00,736 --> 00:18:00,736
ethic than like a moral ethic.

470
00:17:45,644 --> 00:18:13,866
But that opens up a lot of questions

471
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:13,866
about what kinds of ethics are of what

472
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:13,866
statuses under or after the survival

473
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:13,866
imperative.

474
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:27,000
Tyler: Yeah, it's interesting because I

475
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,000
think with Active Inference lab or free

476
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,000
energy governance specifically, there are

477
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,000
two ways where I think it's interesting.

478
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:37,010
One level is like, thinking about an

479
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,010
organization as an organism where it's

480
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,010
like, independent of my human experience

481
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,010
of that organism, of what makes this

482
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,010
organism survive.

483
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:45,018
And then I think the reason why I care

484
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:45,018
about it the most, which is my own human

485
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:45,018
experience of how meaning is created for

486
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:45,018
me in an organization.

487
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:49,022
And I think ultimately that's personally,

488
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:49,022
at least, what I care about the most.

489
00:18:46,019 --> 00:19:04,031
And then when I think about AI, I'm like,

490
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:04,031
okay, well, even if you have an embedded

491
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:04,031
AI in your system, if it doesn't mean

492
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:04,031
something personally to the humans in

493
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:04,031
that organization, I don't really care,

494
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:04,031
even if it makes the organization survive

495
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:04,031
more likely to survive.

496
00:18:49,022 --> 00:19:15,042
So it's just like, interesting, these two

497
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:15,042
different takes of like, okay, even if it

498
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:15,042
makes the organization more likely to

499
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:15,042
survive, why do I care if that isn't

500
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:15,042
meaningful to me as a human in that

501
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:15,042
organization?

502
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:17,044
Not sure if that makes sense.

503
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:26,053
Bleu: Yeah.

504
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:36,063
So then Bajan also says first order

505
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,063
principles such as AI's free Energy

506
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,063
Minimization will lay the foundation for

507
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,063
governance models to increasingly self

508
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,063
organize.

509
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:41,068
So I think that this is very meta.

510
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:47,074
It's like how Daniel was saying we go

511
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:47,074
from coding to ethics to survival.

512
00:19:41,068 --> 00:20:06,087
I think maybe ethics is like the fog

513
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:06,087
between coding and survival, where free

514
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:06,087
Energy Minimization is about persistence

515
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:06,087
and can be used in coding and will lay

516
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:06,087
the foundation for governance models to

517
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:06,087
increasingly self organized.

518
00:19:47,074 --> 00:20:10,091
So like, self organization based on free

519
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:10,091
energy minimization.

520
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:21,102
I guess the section was interesting and I

521
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:21,102
do think that there's like, Pajama super

522
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:21,102
excited about AI and we got a long way to

523
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:21,102
go.

524
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:22,103
We'll get there.

525
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:24,105
It's not impossible.

526
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:27,108
It's just going to take some time, I

527
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:27,108
think.

528
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:31,112
Any other thoughts here in artificial

529
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:31,112
intelligence?

530
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:42,123
I mean, I have lots of other thoughts

531
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:42,123
here, but I think getting Bashan's

532
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:42,123
perspective will be really fun.

533
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:51,132
Tyler: Yeah, I think the thing I really

534
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:51,132
am not quite understanding here is the

535
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:51,132
explainability piece, and I think I was

536
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:51,132
trying to mention this earlier.

537
00:20:43,124 --> 00:21:04,139
If you have an AI that's like, bubbling

538
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:04,139
up insights about your organization

539
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:04,139
saying like, hey, this is what's going

540
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:04,139
on, or this is the right answer of what

541
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:04,139
you should do in this situation, but it

542
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:04,139
isn't understood by the people in that

543
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:04,139
organization.

544
00:20:51,132 --> 00:21:05,140
Does it even matter?

545
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:08,143
And is that what Bajan means by

546
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:08,143
explainability?

547
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,143
Right.

548
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:20,154
Even if AI gives you the right answer,

549
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:20,154
but it isn't understood and integrated

550
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:20,154
into the people in the organization, is

551
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:20,154
that AI actually useful in that

552
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:20,154
organization?

553
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:25,160
And that's like the tension I've been

554
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,160
grappling with here and I don't quite

555
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,160
understand.

556
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:29,164
And he talks about explainability of

557
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:29,164
predictions.

558
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:37,172
I'm not sure if that's exactly what he's

559
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:37,172
talking about or not, but it's a good

560
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:37,172
question for Bajan for sure.

561
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:47,182
Bleu: And then the last section for

562
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:47,182
future development is the board

563
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:47,182
capabilities developmental paths.

564
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:58,193
So he says, indeed, the board is

565
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:58,193
ultimately responsible for anticipating

566
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:58,193
the firm's future capability

567
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:58,193
constellation, including that of the

568
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:58,193
board itself, to sustainably succeed with

569
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:58,193
continuous strategic renewal.

570
00:21:47,182 --> 00:22:10,199
However, to avoid the cognitive traps

571
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:10,199
related to individual board profiles that

572
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:10,199
Layman and Wallin identified, we must

573
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:10,199
study the cognitive microfoundations of

574
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:10,199
capability development at the board

575
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:10,199
level.

576
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:17,206
To date, this area represents a void in

577
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:17,206
both strategy and governance research.

578
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:41,230
So I thought that this was cool,

579
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:41,230
especially with respect to active

580
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:41,230
inference lab institute, like as we are

581
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:41,230
fleshing out our own board and the board

582
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:41,230
decides what this and future boards will

583
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:41,230
be capable of doing now and forever, and

584
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:41,230
all this stuff can be changed with

585
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:41,230
approval of the board.

586
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:42,231
Right?

587
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:49,238
So I think that I like this capability

588
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:49,238
constellation phrase.

589
00:22:42,231 --> 00:23:06,249
I thought that that was kind of neat

590
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:06,249
because there's a lot of little sub

591
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:06,249
capabilities within the board, like

592
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:06,249
there's committees and this and that, and

593
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:06,249
everybody can do or take care of many

594
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:06,249
different things, or what don't we want

595
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:06,249
the board to do?

596
00:22:49,238 --> 00:23:22,265
The possibilities are pretty endless and

597
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:22,265
expansive, but what is purposeful and

598
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:22,265
what will gain the most bang for the buck

599
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:22,265
in terms of what should the board focus

600
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:22,265
on?

601
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:24,267
That's kind of crazy.

602
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:33,276
And then he outlined a little bit of

603
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:33,276
these cognitive traps, but I didn't go

604
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:33,276
too far into them here.

605
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:39,282
Do you guys have anything here on board

606
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:39,282
capabilities?

607
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:48,291
Oh, so this, so I did go actually a

608
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:48,291
little bit into them.

609
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:56,299
So what capabilities are required at the

610
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:56,299
level of the individual board member when

611
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:56,299
the necessary firm capabilities are not

612
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:56,299
yet developed?

613
00:23:48,291 --> 00:24:02,299
And so, as Bajan is thinking about this,

614
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:02,299
he goes to this theory U, which I had

615
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:02,299
never heard of before.

616
00:23:56,299 --> 00:24:06,303
And so he outlines three of the

617
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:06,303
principles developed in this theory U.

618
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:22,319
And it looks like that there's quite a

619
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:22,319
few, but he talked about what are the

620
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:22,319
capabilities required at the board member

621
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:22,319
level when we're defining the firm

622
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:22,319
capabilities, like the board capabilities

623
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:22,319
for now and forever.

624
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:24,321
And so these I really liked.

625
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:28,325
So he says number nine, practice

626
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:28,325
principle number nine is what it is.

627
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:30,327
Practice deep listening and dialogue.

628
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:34,331
Connect with your mind and heart wide

629
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:34,331
open when connecting to other people and

630
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:34,331
contact.

631
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:37,334
Open up all four channels of listening.

632
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:45,342
Listen from what you know, from what

633
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:45,342
surprises you, from the whole and from

634
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:45,342
what you sense wants to emerge, the

635
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:45,342
emerging whole.

636
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:51,348
And I really like this like four

637
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:51,348
different ways of listening, something

638
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:51,348
that we don't always think about.

639
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:52,349
We just listen.

640
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:54,351
And we listen in one way.

641
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:55,352
I listened.

642
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:56,353
I heard this.

643
00:24:55,352 --> 00:25:03,354
But when you're looking at listening in

644
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:03,354
different aspects, it's different,

645
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:03,354
right?

646
00:24:56,353 --> 00:25:07,358
Like, listening from what surprises you?

647
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:12,363
Can you listen to it four times and

648
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:12,363
pretend like you don't know anything?

649
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:15,366
Pretend like, how does this relate to

650
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
what you already know?

651
00:25:12,363 --> 00:25:16,367
I thought that this was really nice.

652
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:25,376
I don't know if you guys have if you were

653
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:25,376
excited about it as I was as excited or I

654
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:25,376
can read collective sense making next.

655
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:29,380
Or maybe Tyler wants to read collective

656
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:29,380
sense making.

657
00:25:26,377 --> 00:25:30,381
Tyler: Yes.

658
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:37,388
I was just going to say I really love the

659
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:37,388
convergence of new AG and corporate

660
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:37,388
governance literature.

661
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:40,391
Kind of converging in reenergy

662
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:40,391
governance.

663
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:41,392
It's wonderful.

664
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:44,395
All right, so number ten collective sense

665
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:44,395
making.

666
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:46,397
So use social presencing, theater and

667
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:46,397
embodied knowing.

668
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:56,407
So whatever process you use to make sense

669
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:56,407
of the learning journey, what matters

670
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:56,407
most is that you pay disciplined

671
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:56,407
attention to all the voices and

672
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:56,407
manifestations of the field.

673
00:25:46,397 --> 00:26:03,408
Paying disciplined attention means that

674
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:03,408
you are intentionally holding back all

675
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:03,408
inclinations to mix your own

676
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:03,408
interpretations or solutions.

677
00:25:56,407 --> 00:26:08,413
Just spend all that because you want the

678
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:08,413
data of the field to speak for you.

679
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:12,417
The field cannot speak to you if your

680
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:12,417
mind is too busy.

681
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:20,425
Bleu: So that was also cool.

682
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:28,433
But the data of the field cannot speak to

683
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:28,433
you if your mind is too busy expressing

684
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:28,433
opinions and proposing solutions.

685
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:30,435
Oh, that cuts to the core.

686
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:34,438
Yeah, sorry, I guess I cut that off.

687
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:35,440
And then whatever.

688
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:39,444
My slide making capabilities were

689
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:39,444
subpar.

690
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:44,449
And then the last principle is principle

691
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:44,449
22.

692
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:46,451
I'm like, now I'm like, I want to read

693
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:46,451
this theory.

694
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,452
You like, what is this all about?

695
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:51,456
I'm totally interested in learning more

696
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:51,456
about these principles.

697
00:26:48,452 --> 00:26:58,463
Number 22 is create enabling

698
00:26:58,463 --> 00:26:58,463
infrastructures that allow the system to

699
00:26:58,463 --> 00:26:58,463
sense and see itself.

700
00:26:52,457 --> 00:27:07,466
And he quotes, making the system sense

701
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:07,466
and see itself can change the

702
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:07,466
coordination dynamics among the players

703
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:07,466
in a field, moving them toward ecosystem

704
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:07,466
awareness.

705
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:25,484
As traditional governance models are

706
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:25,484
increasingly uprooted in a discontinuous

707
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:25,484
world, there is not only a need for a new

708
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:25,484
governance project, but correspondingly

709
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:25,484
new board capabilities, developmental

710
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:25,484
paths, specifically, duality management

711
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:25,484
as a dynamic board capability demands

712
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:25,484
dedicated research.

713
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:31,490
And that duality management, just to

714
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:31,490
remind everyone, is like financial and

715
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:31,490
strategic control.

716
00:27:26,485 --> 00:27:35,494
So it's like both of those things, not

717
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:35,494
one or the other.

718
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:37,496
They both work together.

719
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:43,502
Then we can go into chapter 13.

720
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:47,506
Or if you guys have more thoughts about

721
00:27:47,506 --> 00:27:47,506
this, these theory you principles.

722
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:50,509
No, we can go into this.

723
00:27:47,506 --> 00:27:52,511
Chapter 13.

724
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,513
Tyler, do you want to read this portion

725
00:27:54,513 --> 00:27:54,513
of the abstract?

726
00:27:52,511 --> 00:28:04,517
Tyler: For us, the classical cause effect

727
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:04,517
determinism upon which the paradigm of

728
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:04,517
strategy management as well as governance

729
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:04,517
research has been built, is uprooted.

730
00:27:54,513 --> 00:28:22,535
Baparian academics relentless pursuit of

731
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:22,535
empirically establishing, qualifying, and

732
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:22,535
then falsifying mechanistic cause and

733
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:22,535
effective relationships is struggling to

734
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:22,535
inspire the business community, which is

735
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:22,535
itself wriggling too often with the self

736
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:22,535
inflicted limitations of its own, of its

737
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:22,535
very world models.

738
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:30,543
Together, academia and practice are

739
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:30,543
challenged to reconnect organizing to

740
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:30,543
that self evidencing dimension of the

741
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:30,543
universe's information system.

742
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:40,553
Fpg is as valid for business

743
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:40,553
organizations as it is for political

744
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:40,553
contracts, or for that matter, navigating

745
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:40,553
geopolitical dislocations and debt cycle

746
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:40,553
disruptions.

747
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:42,555
Bleu: Thank you.

748
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:44,557
And I'll read this last piece.

749
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:54,567
It says, any organism that suffers from

750
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:54,567
one top down, bottom up hierarchical

751
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:54,567
disconnectivity and a top down dominance

752
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:54,567
of supervised content prescriptions.

753
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:59,572
Two, an urge to adapt to the outer world

754
00:28:59,572 --> 00:28:59,572
emit an incapacity for an active

755
00:28:59,572 --> 00:28:59,572
inference.

756
00:28:54,567 --> 00:29:06,573
And three, the nonexistence of both a

757
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
timeless depurpose as well as

758
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
medicapabilities is naturally entropy

759
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:06,573
bound.

760
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:11,578
In the absence of a generative Bayesian

761
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:11,578
model, we become incapacitated.

762
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:18,585
Indeed, camping on seesaws is the

763
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:18,585
categorical imperative of survival

764
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:18,585
pursuing self organization.

765
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:21,587
Organization as a means, not an end.

766
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:27,594
It is right here where the fundamental

767
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:27,594
difference between traditional corporate

768
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:27,594
governance and free energy governance

769
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:27,594
models lie.

770
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:42,609
Free energy governance sees the informal

771
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:42,609
organization as organizing, manifests

772
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:42,609
itself as a self organizing generative

773
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:42,609
model operating as a whole, within and

774
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:42,609
without the firm, embracing self

775
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:42,609
organization as a self evidencing

776
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:42,609
universal information system.

777
00:29:27,594 --> 00:29:54,621
And so he makes like I just pulled out

778
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:54,621
several claims that he made in this

779
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:54,621
chapter and a couple of little summary

780
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:54,621
sections, because this is like the

781
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:54,621
official summary.

782
00:29:45,611 --> 00:30:12,633
He says, Together, academia and practice

783
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:12,633
are challenged to reconnect organizing to

784
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:12,633
that self organizing or self evidencing

785
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:12,633
dimension inherent of the universe's

786
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:12,633
information system to purposefully

787
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:12,633
create, extend or modify the firm's

788
00:30:12,633 --> 00:30:12,633
resource base.

789
00:29:55,622 --> 00:30:14,635
And that's a quote from Health Fed, et

790
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:14,635
al.

791
00:30:13,634 --> 00:30:24,645
And he says, to thrive and survive

792
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:24,645
purposeful behavior is one of life's

793
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:24,645
defining features, but it is only

794
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:24,645
possible if living systems operate as a

795
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:24,645
whole.

796
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:35,656
It is only by managing information that

797
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:35,656
the cell can impose order on the extreme

798
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:35,656
complexity of its operations and

799
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:35,656
therefore fulfill its ultimate purpose of

800
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:35,656
staying alive and reproducing.

801
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:37,658
And this is a quote from Nurse 2020.

802
00:30:36,656 --> 00:30:51,672
And I don't know, this is so hard because

803
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
I'll always go back to Mike Levin's

804
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
beautiful explanation of the constraints

805
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
imposed by the larger system on a smaller

806
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
system.

807
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:55,676
Because a cell's ultimate purpose is not

808
00:30:55,676 --> 00:30:55,676
staying alive, reproducing.

809
00:30:51,672 --> 00:31:02,677
In fact, if it's one cell, sure, but in a

810
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:02,677
multicellular organism, some cells, like

811
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:02,677
the purpose of the cell, is to die.

812
00:30:55,676 --> 00:31:07,682
We all start off with webbing between the

813
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:07,682
fingers, and that webbing is cells.

814
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:09,684
And then that webbing goes away.

815
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:17,692
So that cell, in the construction of our

816
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:17,692
existence and our morphology, its purpose

817
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:17,692
is to die.

818
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:35,710
So I guess, like we were talking about

819
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:35,710
MNA earlier, the purpose of the smaller

820
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:35,710
firm that gets subsumed by a larger firm

821
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:35,710
is also to die or become incorporated or

822
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:35,710
to somehow integrate with the current

823
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:35,710
larger firm.

824
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:39,714
And so these constraints, I don't know.

825
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:52,727
So the nested hierarchical levels, each

826
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:52,727
top level or each larger level constrains

827
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:52,727
the function of the inner level and also

828
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:52,727
that information.

829
00:31:39,714 --> 00:32:01,730
Sorry, I have to just say that because

830
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:01,730
otherwise staying alive and reproducing

831
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:01,730
is not the purpose of self.

832
00:31:54,729 --> 00:32:06,735
Sorry, I don't know if you guys have

833
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:06,735
thought to move on.

834
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:25,754
Bijean says free energy as an information

835
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:25,754
theoretic rather than thermodynamic

836
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:25,754
measure, is uniquely positioned to

837
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:25,754
measure and guide a firm's survivability

838
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:25,754
as a self organizing information as well

839
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:25,754
as belief system.

840
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:28,757
And he quotes this book from Lindsay

841
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:28,757
2021.

842
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:29,758
Daniel, have you read this?

843
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:33,762
I haven't read it, but it's like a frison

844
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:33,762
memoir, I guess.

845
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:36,765
He says Friston recalls a thought he had

846
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:36,765
as a teenager.

847
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:40,769
There must be a way of understanding

848
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:40,769
everything by starting from nothing.

849
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:46,775
If I'm only allowed to start off with one

850
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:46,775
point in the entire universe, can I

851
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:46,775
derive everything else I need from that?

852
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:51,780
In friskin's world, the free energy

853
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:51,780
principle is now the nearly nothing that

854
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:51,780
can explain almost everything.

855
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:53,782
I like this quote from this book.

856
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:56,785
And also, I've got to go read it now.

857
00:32:53,782 --> 00:33:02,785
I don't know if it's a frison memoir or

858
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
maybe it's just an interview or like a

859
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
long article or something like that, but

860
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:02,785
I haven't read it.

861
00:32:56,785 --> 00:33:10,793
But it's like someone else giving a

862
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:10,793
detail of Kristen's life and ideas, I

863
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:10,793
guess.

864
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:13,796
I don't know if you guys have thoughts

865
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:13,796
here.

866
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:17,800
No.

867
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:17,800
Yes.

868
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,801
No.

869
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,803
Okay.

870
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:25,808
I just want to just call out.

871
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:32,815
We just talked about very early on, maybe

872
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:32,815
it was like the fourth video we did talk

873
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:32,815
about.

874
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:34,817
What are we talking about?

875
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:39,822
Thermodynamic versus information

876
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:39,822
theoretic free energy.

877
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:42,825
Go back because we really did get into

878
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:42,825
that.

879
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:43,826
So if you're going, what are they talking

880
00:33:43,826 --> 00:33:43,826
about?

881
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:48,831
We did talk about that quite a bit in one

882
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:48,831
of the early videos.

883
00:33:43,826 --> 00:33:52,835
So now might be a good time to just

884
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:52,835
refresh your memory that we did detail

885
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:52,835
that.

886
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:57,840
So if that's looking weird to you, go get

887
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:57,840
a refresher.

888
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:57,840
Okay.

889
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:16,853
And then claim here, in summary, the

890
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:16,853
inferential discovery of informational

891
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:16,853
dissonance as an error minimizing source

892
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:16,853
for optimizing the accuracy of posterior

893
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:16,853
beliefs rather than explaining dissonance

894
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:16,853
away is essential to firm survival in

895
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:16,853
discontinuous environments.

896
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:21,858
And I like this informational dissonance

897
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:21,858
part.

898
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:22,859
This was like a couple videos ago.

899
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:26,863
Not that not that far in the past, but

900
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:26,863
yeah.

901
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:33,870
So this brought up the initial

902
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:33,870
communication question for Bajan.

903
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:45,882
Does everybody need to know everything

904
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:45,882
all of the time and also your information

905
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:45,882
getting updated with the outside

906
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:45,882
information to resolve the dissonance.

907
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:47,884
Anyway, there's that.

908
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:49,886
Do you get some thoughts here?

909
00:34:48,884 --> 00:34:56,892
All right, I'm going to make somebody

910
00:34:56,892 --> 00:34:56,892
else read these because I'm tired of

911
00:34:56,892 --> 00:34:56,892
talking, tired of hearing myself talk.

912
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:57,894
Tyler, do you want to do this?

913
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:59,896
This is the building blocks of an active

914
00:34:59,896 --> 00:34:59,896
inference.

915
00:34:57,894 --> 00:35:04,895
So this is a nice little summary recap of

916
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:04,895
what we've learned so far.

917
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:05,896
Tyler: All right.

918
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,897
Building blocks of active inference lab.

919
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:14,905
So one is the four states that's active

920
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:14,905
action, sensory perception, internal firm

921
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:14,905
resources, and external the.

922
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:15,906
Hidden unknowns.

923
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:27,918
Two one internal external Markovian

924
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:27,918
boundary the site where actions upon

925
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:27,918
hidden states generate outcomes that feed

926
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:27,918
in circular causality our perception and

927
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:27,918
allow the precision enhancing updating of

928
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:27,918
prior beliefs.

929
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:36,927
Predictions three one first order

930
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:36,927
principle free energy minimization as a

931
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:36,927
measure of minimizing equivocally error

932
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:36,927
and uncertainty I.

933
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:36,927
E.

934
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:40,931
The divergence between predictions, prior

935
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:40,931
beliefs and outcomes posterior beliefs.

936
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:43,934
Eventually, everything becomes

937
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:43,934
measurable.

938
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:46,937
Bleu: Thank you.

939
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,938
Yeah.

940
00:35:47,938 --> 00:36:09,954
And so Bijean makes this claim that once

941
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:09,954
managers start approaching exploration in

942
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:09,954
the form of an active inference linking

943
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:09,954
in circular causality all four states

944
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:09,954
conditioned by the Markov blanket and

945
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:09,954
governance by free energy minimization,

946
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:09,954
we can straightaway see that success and

947
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:09,954
exploration is critically determined by

948
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:09,954
the level of sophistication of a few

949
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:09,954
things.

950
00:35:47,938 --> 00:36:17,962
First, prediction models a self

951
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:17,962
evidencing eco niche model that connects

952
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:17,962
corporate purpose with the very

953
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:17,962
predictions the firm stipulates.

954
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:28,973
Second, the bounded set of external

955
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:28,973
states that the firm decides to act upon

956
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:28,973
to bottom up, sample the world and test

957
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:28,973
hypotheses with the least required

958
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:28,973
computational resource investment.

959
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:35,980
And third, belief updating resulting from

960
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:35,980
the consequences posterior beliefs that

961
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:35,980
the firm's actions generate.

962
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:49,994
And so this was also, like a nice little

963
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:49,994
summary section, I thought, and he

964
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:49,994
continues to say it is now self evident

965
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:49,994
to appreciate that action is central to

966
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:49,994
perception.

967
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:55,000
More importantly, the firm's generative

968
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,000
model and actions control ambiguity and

969
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,000
uncertainty.

970
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:58,003
The firm's generative model is the firm's

971
00:36:58,003 --> 00:36:58,003
eco niche.

972
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,000
The firm is more in control than it

973
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,000
traditionally resists to believe.

974
00:36:58,003 --> 00:37:05,004
The perception of uncertainty is after

975
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:05,004
observer I.

976
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:05,004
E.

977
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:06,005
Firm specific.

978
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:14,013
And I did like that real uncertainty

979
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:14,013
versus the perception of uncertainty.

980
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:23,022
And when we're talking about embodied,

981
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:23,022
enacted, extended cognition, it's all

982
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:23,022
about your perception of uncertainty

983
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:23,022
versus actual uncertainty.

984
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:34,033
So unless you can count cards, you're

985
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:34,033
uncertain of like if you're playing

986
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:34,033
blackjack, you don't you don't know what

987
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:34,033
your chances are of getting 21.

988
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:38,037
But if you can count cards, that's just

989
00:37:38,037 --> 00:37:38,037
one example.

990
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:46,045
You're less uncertain if it's a single

991
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:46,045
deck blackjack, you're less uncertain as

992
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:46,045
to what are the possibilities as the game

993
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:46,045
continues to unfold.

994
00:37:39,037 --> 00:38:05,058
Daniel: It's also interesting there with

995
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:05,058
the kind of Declaration of Independence

996
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:05,058
like self evident appreciation that

997
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:05,058
reflects the real bright line between

998
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:05,058
passive inference and active inference.

999
00:37:48,047 --> 00:38:09,062
And it's like that claim does one agree

1000
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:09,062
or disagree?

1001
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:22,075
And then if they did agree, then they

1002
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:22,075
have already seen their own eye movement

1003
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:22,075
and decision to seek out this information

1004
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:22,075
as central to their perception of that

1005
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:22,075
expression.

1006
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:26,079
So it kind of serves as like a co on of

1007
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:26,079
self evidencing.

1008
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:29,082
And then there are some downstream

1009
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:29,082
implications.

1010
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:37,090
For example, one that he attacks many

1011
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:37,090
times throughout is that the external

1012
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:37,090
world is not uncertain.

1013
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:39,092
There's not uncertainty in the

1014
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:39,092
commodities market.

1015
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:47,100
There's an observer dependent uncertainty

1016
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,100
about external states and about action

1017
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,100
selection.

1018
00:38:40,093 --> 00:39:01,108
Active Inference Lab is a generic family

1019
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:01,108
of strategies for jointly resolving

1020
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:01,108
uncertainty about external states and

1021
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:01,108
actions that bring alignment aka provide

1022
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:01,108
pragmatic value.

1023
00:38:47,100 --> 00:39:10,117
So many of those implications of feg are

1024
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:10,117
downstream of the acceptance or

1025
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:10,117
acknowledgment that action is central to

1026
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:10,117
perception.

1027
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:17,124
Bleu: Very nice.

1028
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:18,125
Thank you.

1029
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:27,134
Okay, so he lists these requirements for

1030
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:27,134
outperformance and survival.

1031
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:29,136
Tyler, do you want to read these for me?

1032
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:30,137
Tyler: Yes.

1033
00:39:30,136 --> 00:39:31,138
All right.

1034
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:34,141
One, a timeless deep purpose.

1035
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:40,147
Two generative top down, bottom up,

1036
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
prediction error, minimization form of

1037
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
free energy minimizing active inference

1038
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:40,147
lab.

1039
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:45,152
Three principled values and aspirations

1040
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,152
determining go niche prosperity and

1041
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,152
sustainability.

1042
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:58,165
If all three elements are articulated in

1043
00:39:58,165 --> 00:39:58,165
simple explainable, Lagrange and

1044
00:39:58,165 --> 00:39:58,165
communicated to all members within and

1045
00:39:58,165 --> 00:39:58,165
beyond the firm's boundaries, then the

1046
00:39:58,165 --> 00:39:58,165
firm's long term prospects will be

1047
00:39:58,165 --> 00:39:58,165
sustainably enhanced in form of self

1048
00:39:58,165 --> 00:39:58,165
organizing generative model.

1049
00:39:46,153 --> 00:40:04,165
The board of directors, rather than

1050
00:40:04,165 --> 00:40:04,165
executive leadership only, must ensure

1051
00:40:04,165 --> 00:40:04,165
that those elements come to life and more

1052
00:40:04,165 --> 00:40:04,165
importantly, stay alive.

1053
00:39:58,165 --> 00:40:09,170
Bleu: Thanks.

1054
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:13,174
Sorry.

1055
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:16,177
So this goes back to, like, we were

1056
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:16,177
talking about purpose earlier.

1057
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:17,178
Where does purpose come from?

1058
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:19,180
Who decides what the purpose is?

1059
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:24,185
So it was more talked about, I think, a

1060
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:24,185
lot in this chapter.

1061
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:27,188
And we've also talked about it before

1062
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:27,188
through the book.

1063
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:31,192
So this is a nice little wrap up

1064
00:40:31,192 --> 00:40:31,192
section.

1065
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:39,200
And then Bijean goes on to make the claim

1066
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,200
that free organization okay.

1067
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:41,202
I've said organization so many times.

1068
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:46,207
I think if I were to count, like, I

1069
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:46,207
probably have said the word organization

1070
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:46,207
like a thousand times in this live

1071
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:46,207
stream.

1072
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:48,209
Maybe not, maybe 150.

1073
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:59,220
Energy governance is as valid for

1074
00:40:59,220 --> 00:40:59,220
business organizations as it is for

1075
00:40:59,220 --> 00:40:59,220
political constructs, or for that matter,

1076
00:40:59,220 --> 00:40:59,220
navigating geopolitical dislocations and

1077
00:40:59,220 --> 00:40:59,220
debt cycle disruptions.

1078
00:40:49,210 --> 00:41:05,220
Any organism that suffers from a one top

1079
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,220
down, bottom up disconnectivity.

1080
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:10,225
Two top down dominance of ideological and

1081
00:41:10,225 --> 00:41:10,225
supervised content prescriptions.

1082
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:16,231
Three, dominant logic to adapt to the

1083
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:16,231
outer world amid a self inflicted

1084
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:16,231
incapacity for an active inference.

1085
00:41:10,225 --> 00:41:33,248
And not least, four, non existence of a

1086
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:33,248
timeless purpose, as well as

1087
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:33,248
medicabilities such as listening to what

1088
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:33,248
wants to emerge in the web of random

1089
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:33,248
interactions and observing the observer

1090
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:33,248
is naturally entropy bound and

1091
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:33,248
incapacitated to navigate macro

1092
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:33,248
disruptions.

1093
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:44,259
So he gives that recipe for survival and

1094
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:44,259
outperformance here in the last

1095
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:44,259
requirements for outperformance and

1096
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:44,259
survival.

1097
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:46,261
So I think that those are just like the

1098
00:41:46,261 --> 00:41:46,261
three.

1099
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:51,266
Those are just like the inverse

1100
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:51,266
statements of each other, like, this is

1101
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:51,266
what we need, this is what we can't

1102
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:51,266
have.

1103
00:41:46,261 --> 00:42:06,275
So that's a nice way to wrap up how free

1104
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:06,275
energy governance will contribute to the

1105
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:06,275
firm's outperformance and survival in the

1106
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:06,275
world, competing with other firms and

1107
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:06,275
such.

1108
00:41:52,267 --> 00:42:08,277
Do you guys have any thoughts here?

1109
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:11,280
Good.

1110
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:14,283
Okay.

1111
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:20,289
And then I just pulled this final quote

1112
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:20,289
out, and we kind of alluded to this

1113
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:20,289
earlier.

1114
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:31,300
It says, does the uncertainty that human

1115
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:31,300
space come from the inherent instability

1116
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:31,300
of the human landscape or from the

1117
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:31,300
perceptions and belief systems that we

1118
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:31,300
have about the human environment?

1119
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:33,302
And this is kind of nice.

1120
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:37,306
What is it that's unstable?

1121
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:39,308
Where is the uncertainty?

1122
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:44,313
Is the uncertainty in our perception or

1123
00:42:44,313 --> 00:42:44,313
is it in the world somewhere?

1124
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:46,315
So I don't know.

1125
00:42:44,313 --> 00:43:02,324
This is a nice thing to think about, and

1126
00:43:02,324 --> 00:43:02,324
in resolving that uncertainty through

1127
00:43:02,324 --> 00:43:02,324
action, I think, gets to kind of the core

1128
00:43:02,324 --> 00:43:02,324
of free energy governance here at the end

1129
00:43:02,324 --> 00:43:02,324
of the book.

1130
00:42:46,315 --> 00:43:05,328
Thanks for listening.

1131
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:14,337
I don't know if you guys have any final

1132
00:43:14,337 --> 00:43:14,337
thoughts on any of the content presented

1133
00:43:14,337 --> 00:43:14,337
here in these two chapters or on the book

1134
00:43:14,337 --> 00:43:14,337
overall or questions that are brewing

1135
00:43:14,337 --> 00:43:14,337
through your mind.

1136
00:43:05,328 --> 00:43:15,338
Nothing like that.

1137
00:43:14,337 --> 00:43:16,339
All right.

1138
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:29,352
We're quick through the concluding

1139
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:29,352
sections, and we look forward to having

1140
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:29,352
an open discussion with the author in a

1141
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:29,352
few weeks, as well as other participants

1142
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:29,352
who have been keeping up with the

1143
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:29,352
content.

1144
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:32,355
So thanks, guys.

1145
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:34,357
Daniel: Thank you, Tyler.

1146
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:34,357
Thank you.

1147
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:37,360
Bleu farewell.
