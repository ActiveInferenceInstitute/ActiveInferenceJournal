1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,711
Daniel: Hello?

2
00:00:04,916 --> 00:00:08,924
It's February 7, 2023.

3
00:00:05,893 --> 00:00:13,475
We're here in Active Bookstream number

4
00:00:13,475 --> 00:00:13,475
1.09.

5
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:15,636
Off to you, Bleu.

6
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:19,010
Bleu: Hi, I'm Bleu Knight.

7
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:30,109
I am a researcher in New Mexico, and we

8
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:30,109
are the Active Active Inference

9
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:30,109
Institute, participatory online institute

10
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:30,109
that is communicating, learning, and

11
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:30,109
practicing applied active inference.

12
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:33,491
You can reach us at our social media

13
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:33,491
links here.

14
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:38,921
And just a reminder, this is a recorded

15
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:38,921
and an archived Livestream.

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,277
So please provide us with feedback so

17
00:00:41,277 --> 00:00:41,277
that we can improve on our work.

18
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:48,968
All backgrounds and perspectives are

19
00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:48,968
welcome here, and we will be following

20
00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:48,968
good video etiquette for live streams.

21
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:57,841
And just as we're mentioning that all

22
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:57,841
backgrounds and perspectives are welcome

23
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:57,841
here, we will be having our final

24
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:57,841
discussion coming up in about four

25
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:57,841
weeks.

26
00:00:48,974 --> 00:01:05,011
So if you would really like to

27
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:05,011
participate, if you've watched some of

28
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:05,011
the live streams and have some questions,

29
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:05,011
we would really like to get some outside

30
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:05,011
perspective.

31
00:00:57,852 --> 00:01:10,535
So please get in touch with us so that

32
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:10,535
you can participate in our final

33
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:10,535
discussion.

34
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:14,947
So, like I said, if you want to

35
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:14,947
participate, this is how.

36
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:19,401
And so we are still discussing governing

37
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:19,401
continuous transformation.

38
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:23,863
And today our goal is to discuss section

39
00:01:23,863 --> 00:01:23,863
nine.

40
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:24,996
So, chapter nine.

41
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:30,506
And we will be doing Bookmap roadmap and

42
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:30,506
all of the typical things.

43
00:01:25,012 --> 00:01:32,743
So, I already introduced myself.

44
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:34,903
Daniel just gave us the date.

45
00:01:32,763 --> 00:01:35,061
Why don't you introduce yourself?

46
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:41,680
Daniel: It's Daniel in California.

47
00:01:39,443 --> 00:01:43,848
I'll pass to Tyler.

48
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:47,025
Tyler: I'm Tyler in California.

49
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:52,070
I am a dow researcher and protocol

50
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,070
designer.

51
00:01:47,027 --> 00:01:53,085
All right, Bleu.

52
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:55,099
Bleu: All right.

53
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:58,134
So here we are at the end of part two.

54
00:01:55,101 --> 00:02:07,164
So next week, the author is going to join

55
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:07,164
us for a discussion over part two, the

56
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:07,164
Free Energy governance section of the

57
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:07,164
book.

58
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:09,189
And then we'll be moving into part

59
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:09,189
three.

60
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:15,240
I think we're going to do two chapters at

61
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,240
a time as we go through part three.

62
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:21,308
And I don't think we'll be discussing the

63
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:21,308
engaged scholarship interviews, but if

64
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:21,308
you're curious about them, I encourage

65
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:21,308
you to read the text.

66
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:23,328
Okay.

67
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:27,363
Tyler, do you want to read this first

68
00:02:27,363 --> 00:02:27,363
part of the abstract for us?

69
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:27,368
Tyler: Sure.

70
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:28,371
All right.

71
00:02:27,368 --> 00:02:30,398
So beneath all chaos is an underlying

72
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:30,398
structure.

73
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:32,417
Our challenges to exploit disorder's.

74
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,431
Underlying order survive.

75
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:36,456
Living organisms are encoded to resist

76
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:36,456
disorder.

77
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:37,460
I.

78
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:37,462
E.

79
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,486
Entropy by way of self organization.

80
00:02:37,462 --> 00:02:43,527
Firms are nothing more than molecules and

81
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:43,527
are subject to obeying the very same

82
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:43,527
laws.

83
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:46,558
Thermodynamics entropy will eventually

84
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:46,558
rise.

85
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:52,616
Three specific propositions previously

86
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:52,616
developed as part of this book's

87
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:52,616
underlying dissertational research are

88
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:52,616
outlined.

89
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:54,630
One structure.

90
00:02:52,618 --> 00:03:02,653
The stronger, affirm's, cross

91
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:02,653
hierarchical, top down, bottom up

92
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:02,653
cognitive throughput coupling between and

93
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:02,653
within governance and operational

94
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:02,653
channels.

95
00:02:54,631 --> 00:03:08,713
The less dominant, affirm's, top down

96
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:08,713
approach cultivating a form of CEO

97
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:08,713
centrism and strategy ownership.

98
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:10,738
Bleu, you want to take the next one?

99
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:15,786
Bleu: Yes.

100
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,805
So, two cognition.

101
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:24,873
The stronger a firm's cognitive

102
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:24,873
disposition toward environmental

103
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:24,873
enactment and innovative abduction, as

104
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:24,873
opposed to adaptation.

105
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:30,929
The stronger the firm's strategic control

106
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:30,929
and the smaller the risk of falling for

107
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:30,929
the financial control trap.

108
00:03:24,874 --> 00:03:43,064
Three capabilities the stronger the

109
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:43,064
board's dmn centric duality stewardship

110
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:43,064
empowering upper echelon to sustainably

111
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:43,064
balance exploitation versus exploration

112
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:43,064
as well as financial versus strategic

113
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:43,064
control.

114
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:51,145
The stronger the sustainability of

115
00:03:51,145 --> 00:03:51,145
successful and continuous strategic

116
00:03:51,145 --> 00:03:51,145
renewal and hence the firm's prospects

117
00:03:51,145 --> 00:03:51,145
for survival.

118
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:59,220
Strategy is less macroscopic but more

119
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,220
subatomic, less linear and deterministic,

120
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,220
but more quantum and discontinuous.

121
00:03:51,146 --> 00:04:09,262
There is a dominant tendency of

122
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:09,262
glorifying the realist beauty of top down

123
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:09,262
linear cause effect relationships to the

124
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:09,262
very detriment of quantum self

125
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:09,262
organization.

126
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:21,380
And I'm going to start off just reading

127
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:21,380
Thomas Parr from the book so Bijean says,

128
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:21,380
I'm trying to see it over my screen

129
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:21,380
order.

130
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:23,402
Anywhere in the cosmos is so singular.

131
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:32,492
It always requires an exemplary mechanism

132
00:04:32,492 --> 00:04:32,492
or a process, while randomization

133
00:04:32,492 --> 00:04:32,492
requires no, I can't read the word.

134
00:04:23,403 --> 00:04:34,512
It is simply the way of the world.

135
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:49,662
When particles are allowed to act

136
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:49,662
randomly, whether it's the contents of a

137
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:49,662
glass of club soda on the rocks or the

138
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:49,662
countless atoms making up the air in the

139
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:49,662
room they slam into each other,

140
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:49,662
exchanging energy until complete

141
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:49,662
randomizations of their positions and

142
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:49,662
velocities is observed.

143
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:52,691
And so Bijean quotes this Lanza et al.

144
00:04:49,663 --> 00:05:08,799
2020 paper and I was just like thinking

145
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:08,799
of firms as organizations of people and

146
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:08,799
it really brought this picture to mind of

147
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:08,799
atoms randomly slamming into each other

148
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:08,799
like people randomly slamming into each

149
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:08,799
other like the mosh pit versus the board

150
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:08,799
meeting.

151
00:04:52,692 --> 00:05:19,908
I just wanted to bring this juxtaposition

152
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:19,908
of what is it to minimize free energy in

153
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:19,908
terms of assembling humans as opposed to

154
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:19,908
assembling atoms.

155
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:22,934
Anyway, I should have to share with this

156
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:22,934
mental image.

157
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:24,956
Okay.

158
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,979
Tyler, do you want to read this one for

159
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:26,979
us?

160
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,985
Tyler: Sure.

161
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,010
So beneath all chaos is an underlying

162
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,010
structure.

163
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:33,043
Our challenge is to exploit disorders

164
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:33,043
underlying order to survive.

165
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:35,067
Living organisms are encoded to resist

166
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:35,067
disorder I.

167
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:36,069
E.

168
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:38,092
Entropy by way of self organization.

169
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:43,145
Firms are nothing more than molecules and

170
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:43,145
are subject to bang the very same laws

171
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:43,145
thermodynamics.

172
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:55,267
And so yeah, I thought the connection

173
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:55,267
here that was interesting was comparing

174
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:55,267
saying that the laws of thermodynamics

175
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:55,267
apply to firms and that's what's really

176
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:55,267
going on.

177
00:05:45,162 --> 00:05:57,283
And we talked about this in previous

178
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:57,283
streams.

179
00:05:55,268 --> 00:06:09,349
I know we have Blues kind of talk about a

180
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:09,349
little more in detail here but whether

181
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:09,349
that's more of like an analogy comparing

182
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:09,349
to thermodynamics or something like a

183
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:09,349
real underlying structure of

184
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:09,349
thermodynamics and we'll talk about that

185
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:09,349
more shortly.

186
00:05:57,284 --> 00:06:13,384
Bleu: That also brings to mind like the

187
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:13,384
mosh pit.

188
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:24,498
And I wonder in our base case as humans,

189
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:24,498
is our natural inclination to be

190
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:24,498
increasingly chaotic and we override

191
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:24,498
that?

192
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:26,515
I don't know.

193
00:06:25,508 --> 00:06:29,547
I had all these mental images as I was

194
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:29,547
reading this as well.

195
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:33,582
Yeah, Tyler put this in.

196
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,597
So I love this.

197
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,616
I'm going to read it because I love it.

198
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:43,681
He actually quotes Gould et al.

199
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,711
2016 in the quote.

200
00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:50,755
He says if physical theories were people

201
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:50,755
thermodynamics would be the village

202
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:50,755
witch.

203
00:06:46,711 --> 00:06:55,803
Over the course of three centuries she

204
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:55,803
smiled quietly as other theories rose.

205
00:06:50,756 --> 00:07:06,859
And withered surviving major revolutions

206
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:06,859
in physics, like the advent of general

207
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:06,859
relativity and quantum mechanics, the

208
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:06,859
other theories find her somewhat odd,

209
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:06,859
somehow different in nature from the

210
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:06,859
rest.

211
00:06:55,804 --> 00:07:10,895
Yet everyone comes to her for advice, and

212
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:10,895
no one dares to contradict her.

213
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:20,998
Einstein, for instance, called her the

214
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:20,998
only physical theory of universal

215
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:20,998
content, which I am convinced that within

216
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:20,998
the framework of applicability of its

217
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:20,998
basic concepts will never be overthrown.

218
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:24,038
Her power and resilience lay mostly on

219
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:24,038
her frank intentions.

220
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:34,139
Thermodynamics has never claimed to be a

221
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:34,139
means to understand the mysteries of the

222
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:34,139
natural world, but rather a path toward

223
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:34,139
efficient exploitation of said world.

224
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:36,157
Yeah.

225
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:39,179
Do you want to add comments here, Tyler?

226
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:49,287
Tyler: Yeah, I liked about this was that

227
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:49,287
the kind of, like, mystical business

228
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:49,287
leader, like a Steve Jobs character, is

229
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:49,287
kind of like a trope in the business

230
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:49,287
world, and it's kind of like almost like

231
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:49,287
a joke at this point.

232
00:07:39,181 --> 00:08:12,453
But there's also a real case mystical

233
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:12,453
business leader, which is almost kind of

234
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:12,453
what I think Dejan is describing here, is

235
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:12,453
that the real state of the world, of

236
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:12,453
operating as a firm in a very uncertain

237
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:12,453
is probably not the word I should use,

238
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:12,453
but in an ActInf sense, it's a very

239
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:12,453
mystical, receptive way of engaging with

240
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:12,453
the world.

241
00:07:49,288 --> 00:08:19,529
And I really like making that connection

242
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:19,529
of mysticism with business, with

243
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:19,529
corporations.

244
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:26,594
Daniel: One other angle there is

245
00:08:26,594 --> 00:08:26,594
organizations are doing work.

246
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:28,619
They're doing hopefully useful work.

247
00:08:26,594 --> 00:08:45,783
And Thermodynamics is concerned with how

248
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:45,783
thermal energy that uncorrelated

249
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:45,783
exchangeable entropic dissipation can be

250
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:45,783
channeled into moving the steamboat

251
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:45,783
forward or lifting up the weight on the

252
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:45,783
crane.

253
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:59,925
And so sometimes with the amount of

254
00:08:59,925 --> 00:08:59,925
seething activity in formal firms or

255
00:08:59,925 --> 00:08:59,925
informal groups, it's like, but if we all

256
00:08:59,925 --> 00:08:59,925
just went in this exact direction at this

257
00:08:59,925 --> 00:08:59,925
exact time, we could do this.

258
00:08:45,784 --> 00:09:03,908
It's like, well, if all the air molecules

259
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:03,908
just slammed against the wall, it would

260
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:03,908
fall over.

261
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:08,959
Or if they all formed into a droplet,

262
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:08,959
you'd get rain in the room.

263
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:16,036
Like Thermodynamics helps us understand

264
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:16,036
what is likely to happen given those

265
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:16,036
interacting state spaces.

266
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:23,108
And again, interestingly, it has to do

267
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:23,108
with extracting work, useful work from

268
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:23,108
this background of just vibration.

269
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:25,123
That's not work.

270
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:31,179
Tyler: Yeah.

271
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:38,256
The other thing I like to just to build

272
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:38,256
on that is it's okay to not know what's

273
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:38,256
going on is that that doesn't necessarily

274
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:38,256
need to be a source of stress.

275
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:47,342
It's just like you can harness those

276
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:47,342
energies and kind of see which way the

277
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:47,342
wind is blowing, so to speak, without

278
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:47,342
necessarily understanding all the

279
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:47,342
underlying principles.

280
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:48,354
And that's totally okay.

281
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:54,413
And I think that's generally something

282
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:54,413
that gives a lot of people, both in the

283
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:54,413
business world and even in our personal

284
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:54,413
lives, a lot of stress.

285
00:09:48,355 --> 00:10:00,412
But this is also, I think, a very freeing

286
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:00,412
way to approach an uncertain world.

287
00:09:54,414 --> 00:10:05,466
Bleu: Yeah.

288
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:11,527
Maybe to close the loop or maybe open it

289
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:11,527
up a little bit more.

290
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:16,576
There's also the prospect of doing work

291
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:16,576
that you don't know is going to be

292
00:10:16,576 --> 00:10:16,576
fruitful.

293
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:18,599
And so that is this uncertainty.

294
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:24,654
Minimization you could spend your whole

295
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:24,654
an hour trying to crack open a nut.

296
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,669
And the nut is empty.

297
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:27,684
That's also possible, right?

298
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:33,746
So even though you're doing work that may

299
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:33,746
be useful work, it might not bear fruit.

300
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:40,814
So there's that uncertainty element as

301
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:40,814
just a human or also as a firm?

302
00:10:33,747 --> 00:10:55,960
So I just wanted to bring back these

303
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:55,960
slides while we're talking about

304
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:55,960
thermodynamics we talked about this a

305
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:55,960
long time ago, and we talked about the

306
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:55,960
difference between thermodynamic entropy

307
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:55,960
and information.

308
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:57,981
Theoretic entropy?

309
00:10:55,962 --> 00:11:04,993
And so I just wanted to kind of bring

310
00:11:04,993 --> 00:11:04,993
this back and just remind everyone that

311
00:11:04,993 --> 00:11:04,993
there's a difference.

312
00:10:57,986 --> 00:11:14,098
There is relationships between the two

313
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:14,098
that are still being hashed out, like

314
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:14,098
mathematically and not totally

315
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:14,098
understood.

316
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:22,176
But the second law of thermodynamics is

317
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:22,176
that this entropy like disorder in the

318
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:22,176
universe is always increasing.

319
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:29,240
And here the energy is always lost in a

320
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,240
transfer.

321
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:37,322
In work, as heat to the environment less

322
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:37,322
and less usable energy becomes

323
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:37,322
available.

324
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:38,333
All Right?

325
00:11:37,324 --> 00:11:47,424
And then in information theory, we kind

326
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:47,424
of talked about entropy with an inverse

327
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:47,424
relationship with information.

328
00:11:38,335 --> 00:11:54,496
So here you can see like event that is

329
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:54,496
low probability is high information.

330
00:11:47,426 --> 00:12:00,495
So if you're decoding a stream of letters

331
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:00,495
I always like to think about it like this

332
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:00,495
because it was explained to me like that

333
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:00,495
and it made so much sense.

334
00:11:54,497 --> 00:12:03,525
If you're decoding a stream of letters

335
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:03,525
and you're expecting a message.

336
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:10,598
And this was Claude Shannon and kind of

337
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:10,598
like how he or how it was explained to me

338
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:10,598
how he kind of came up with this.

339
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:13,620
So you're decoding a message and you get

340
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:13,620
the letters.

341
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:18,679
Th It would be really freaking weird if

342
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:18,679
the next letter was Z.

343
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:21,707
I don't know any words that have THC.

344
00:12:19,684 --> 00:12:23,727
That's a very low probability event.

345
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,733
Right?

346
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:27,762
So it would be like a very high

347
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:27,762
information thing.

348
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:30,793
Or maybe something came before the th and

349
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:30,793
you missed it.

350
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:31,803
But there's some probability.

351
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:34,836
Like th e would be great or like thi.

352
00:12:31,804 --> 00:12:36,857
But thz wouldn't make any sense.

353
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:39,883
Unless the th was at the end of some

354
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:39,883
previous word.

355
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:43,929
And so you can kind of deduce what to

356
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:43,929
expect in those kinds of situations.

357
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:51,007
The probability distribution is like when

358
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:51,007
there's 50 50 probability.

359
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:53,027
So this is the second graph on the

360
00:12:53,027 --> 00:12:53,027
right.

361
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:55,043
When there's 50 50 probability.

362
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:58,072
Like the flip of a fair coin.

363
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:59,087
That's super high entropy.

364
00:12:58,073 --> 00:13:04,071
Like you don't have any idea if it's

365
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:04,071
going to be heads or if it's going to be

366
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:04,071
tails.

367
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:07,101
But here it's low entropy.

368
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:11,143
If It's like a Coin with two heads,

369
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:11,143
there's heads On Both sides.

370
00:13:07,102 --> 00:13:12,157
Like you can only come out with heads.

371
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:17,204
So there's very low entropy in such a

372
00:13:17,204 --> 00:13:17,204
coin flip because the outcome is always

373
00:13:17,204 --> 00:13:17,204
heads.

374
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:18,213
Right.

375
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:20,233
If there's no distinction between the two

376
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:20,233
sides.

377
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:24,271
So I don't know that's the thermodynamic

378
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:24,271
dynamic entropy versus information.

379
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:25,285
Theoretic entropy.

380
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:36,397
And I think we talk a lot about

381
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:36,397
thermodynamic entropy, but maybe forget

382
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:36,397
that the FEP is really kind of founded in

383
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:36,397
the information theoretic entropy as

384
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:36,397
well.

385
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:39,426
Do you guys have anything to add here?

386
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:40,436
No?

387
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:41,445
Okay.

388
00:13:40,438 --> 00:14:00,573
All right, so Bijean makes this claim in

389
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:00,573
this section, and I'm not going to read

390
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:00,573
the claim, but I'm just going to point

391
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:00,573
out that here we kind of have a really

392
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:00,573
concise definition of like he's been

393
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:00,573
emphasizing the structure, cognition, and

394
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:00,573
capabilities for a few chapters now.

395
00:13:43,461 --> 00:14:12,694
And so here he defines structure as the

396
00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:12,694
circular coupling of governance

397
00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:12,694
predictions and operational stimuli

398
00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:12,694
channels in the form of prediction,

399
00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:12,694
error, minimization.

400
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:18,758
He defines cognition as environmental

401
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:18,758
engagement in the form of enactment

402
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:18,758
rather than adaptation.

403
00:14:12,696 --> 00:14:24,817
And he defines capabilities as sensing

404
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:24,817
and sense making in the form of duality

405
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:24,817
management.

406
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:38,957
And so this chapter was really kind of a

407
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:38,957
good summary chapter, I thought, and kind

408
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:38,957
of gives us a chance to go back and

409
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:38,957
revisit a couple of the concepts that we

410
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:38,957
talked about before, but maybe need to

411
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:38,957
highlight one more time.

412
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:43,002
Do you want to read this one, Tyler, for

413
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:43,002
us?

414
00:14:40,977 --> 00:14:44,011
Tyler: Sure.

415
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:56,130
So, yeah, through the rest of the

416
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:56,130
chapter, Bajan is going through each

417
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:56,130
structure cognition, and he's really kind

418
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:56,130
of going deep and kind of recapping what

419
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:56,130
he's been covering through the previous

420
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:56,130
the rest of the book.

421
00:14:44,011 --> 00:15:08,194
So for structure, he says, the stronger a

422
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:08,194
firm's cross hierarchical, top down,

423
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:08,194
bottom up cognitive throughput coupling

424
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:08,194
between and within governance and

425
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:08,194
operational channels, the stronger the

426
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:08,194
firm's orientation towards free energy.

427
00:14:56,132 --> 00:15:12,230
Surprise minimization based on self

428
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,230
organization.

429
00:15:08,195 --> 00:15:25,363
The less dominant a firm's top down

430
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:25,363
approach cultivating a form of

431
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:25,363
Ceocentrism and strategy ownership, the

432
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:25,363
stronger the sustainability of successful

433
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:25,363
and continuous strategic renewal and

434
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:25,363
hence the firm's prospects for survival.

435
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:28,399
Bleu: Cool, thanks.

436
00:15:27,388 --> 00:15:32,436
And so this is kind of like the punchline

437
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:32,436
of the structure.

438
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:38,499
And so I pulled out maybe just a couple

439
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:38,499
of topics from before the punchline to

440
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:38,499
talk about.

441
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:48,591
And so this kind of like top down, bottom

442
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:48,591
up coupling, I was like looking for a

443
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:48,591
picture of what does top down, bottom up

444
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:48,591
coupling look like?

445
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:49,608
How do you see that?

446
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:51,619
Can I visualize that?

447
00:15:49,609 --> 00:16:03,682
Actually, I was looking for a picture to

448
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:03,682
put on the previous slide and I came

449
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:03,682
across this 2008 paper, from Emotion

450
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:03,682
Resonance to Empathic Understanding a

451
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:03,682
Social Developmental Neuroscience

452
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:03,682
Account.

453
00:15:51,620 --> 00:16:07,727
And my background is neuroscience, but

454
00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:07,727
it's definitely like cellular and

455
00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:07,727
molecular neuroscience.

456
00:16:03,683 --> 00:16:14,791
So I don't really have a good

457
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:14,791
comprehensive reading of social and

458
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:14,791
developmental neuroscience and what that

459
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:14,791
looks like.

460
00:16:07,728 --> 00:16:24,896
And I loved this figure because it just

461
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:24,896
was so encompassing of so many of the

462
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:24,896
things that we've talked about so far.

463
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:25,908
Daniel, have you read this paper?

464
00:16:24,897 --> 00:16:27,921
Have you ever seen this before?

465
00:16:25,908 --> 00:16:31,961
I hadn't either, and I came across the

466
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:31,961
figure and I was like, oh, I have to get

467
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:31,961
the paper now.

468
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:38,034
And so it was nice to kind of just delve

469
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:38,034
into this and it's really about what's

470
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:38,034
required for empathy.

471
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:41,068
And I'll talk more about it.

472
00:16:40,056 --> 00:16:44,094
But here you see like the top down,

473
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:44,094
bottom up coupling.

474
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:54,192
So it's bottom up information processing,

475
00:16:54,192 --> 00:16:54,192
top down information processing relation

476
00:16:54,192 --> 00:16:54,192
to relative to the individual and then

477
00:16:54,192 --> 00:16:54,192
the context or situation.

478
00:16:44,096 --> 00:16:59,243
And there's this perception action

479
00:16:59,243 --> 00:16:59,243
coupling in 2008.

480
00:16:55,203 --> 00:17:02,212
I'm like the perception action loop from

481
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:02,212
2008.

482
00:16:59,243 --> 00:17:03,222
This is cool.

483
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:16,356
And they talk about shared representation

484
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:16,356
and this self other awareness, which we

485
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:16,356
talked about a couple of bookstreams ago,

486
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:16,356
how distinguishing the self versus the

487
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:16,356
other self and non self.

488
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:18,377
So I thought that this was really cool.

489
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:27,466
And executive functions, regulation and

490
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:27,466
control metacognition, that's like double

491
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:27,466
loop learning the metacognition aspect.

492
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:35,544
So I thought that this paper was really

493
00:17:35,544 --> 00:17:35,544
cool and it really was like, wow, all of

494
00:17:35,544 --> 00:17:35,544
this is grounded in empathy.

495
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:38,571
Anyway, it was neat, it was a good read.

496
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,596
It's destiny and Meyer, 2008.

497
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:44,637
And the link is up there if you want the

498
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:44,637
DOI or any of that stuff.

499
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:48,676
And it made me think, all of this is

500
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:48,676
grounded in empathy.

501
00:17:44,638 --> 00:18:04,774
We know, or at least it's thought in

502
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:04,774
business, that to be successful as a

503
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:04,774
business person, your emotional potion,

504
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:04,774
your EQ, is way more important than your

505
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:04,774
IQ, like your ability to relate to others

506
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:04,774
and interact with people.

507
00:17:49,687 --> 00:18:12,859
So a good emotional high emotional

508
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:12,859
quotient versus like an intelligence

509
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:12,859
quotient is way more crucial to business

510
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:12,859
success.

511
00:18:04,775 --> 00:18:20,938
And so I just wonder about the

512
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:20,938
relationship between, if any, between

513
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:20,938
free energy governance and the emotional

514
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:20,938
quotient.

515
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:31,004
Never talked about this directly in the

516
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:31,004
book, but it just made me think how

517
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:31,004
important is empathy for this kind of

518
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:31,004
governance structure?

519
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:34,007
I don't know if you guys have any

520
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:34,007
thoughts here on this.

521
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:42,015
Tyler: Yeah, I think empathy is just

522
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:42,015
really like sensitivity to your

523
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:42,015
environment or sensitivity to other

524
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:42,015
actors and their internal states.

525
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:57,030
And so in the context of a firm, it

526
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,030
doesn't necessarily need to be like you

527
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,030
could think of an emotion necessarily as

528
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,030
for another firm, maybe the internal

529
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,030
state of this external other firm.

530
00:18:43,015 --> 00:19:00,027
So maybe you are dependent on this other

531
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:00,027
firm.

532
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:04,031
Things aren't going the way you would

533
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:04,031
expect them to go with this other firm.

534
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:09,036
Maybe orders are backlogged or their API

535
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:09,036
is being kind of intermittently down.

536
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:17,044
Maybe that is like a signal into the

537
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:17,044
internal state of that firm and the

538
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:17,044
internal state of the ecosystem as well.

539
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:23,050
And so I think that might be analogous to

540
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:23,050
an emotion in a human context.

541
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:24,051
Maybe.

542
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:41,068
Bleu: They had a bunch of definitions

543
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:41,068
actually in the paper, and I can't pull

544
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:41,068
it up because I'm screencasting, so I'm

545
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:41,068
not going to let you guys go through all

546
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:41,068
my 25,000 open windows, but maybe we'll

547
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:41,068
pull them out.

548
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:48,075
And this is maybe a good question for

549
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:48,075
Brian about the relationship between

550
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:48,075
empathy and the free energy governance

551
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:48,075
when we get to see him next week.

552
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:58,084
But they had several different

553
00:19:58,084 --> 00:19:58,084
definitions of empathy too in the paper,

554
00:19:58,084 --> 00:19:58,084
which I thought was interesting they

555
00:19:58,084 --> 00:19:58,084
really tried to take a very logical

556
00:19:58,084 --> 00:19:58,084
approach to it and it was cool.

557
00:19:48,075 --> 00:20:02,083
Okay, so here is a claim from the paper.

558
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:22,103
Bajan says the higher the organizational

559
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,103
friction in terms of obstructing bottom

560
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,103
up error messages, traveling to and

561
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,103
reaching top down prediction generators,

562
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,103
the higher free energy, the potential for

563
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,103
surprise, and the more likely that top

564
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,103
down dominant logics fossilize prediction

565
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,103
models, and hence reinforce a firm's

566
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:22,103
entropy.

567
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:28,109
And this is something that maybe Tyler

568
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:28,109
and I have brought up either on stream,

569
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:28,109
but we've talked about it off stream a

570
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:28,109
lot.

571
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:31,112
How do we reduce this organizational

572
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:31,112
friction?

573
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:42,123
Where are the examples that show us what

574
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:42,123
is the best way to reduce this friction

575
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:42,123
to create a good top down, bottom up

576
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:42,123
coupling?

577
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:46,127
We know that this coupling is super

578
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:46,127
important, like at all layers across the

579
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:46,127
hierarchy.

580
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:54,135
But can we find an empirical way that

581
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:54,135
works in all situations to build that

582
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:54,135
structure?

583
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:59,140
And that, I think, is like a challenge or

584
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,140
maybe a future research question?

585
00:20:55,136 --> 00:21:09,144
Tyler: I guess another thing that is a

586
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:09,144
little counterintuitive about this too,

587
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:09,144
is that oftentimes the things that will

588
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:09,144
reduce friction and maybe like the longer

589
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:09,144
term, feel high friction in that moment.

590
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:15,150
So, for example, in previous streams,

591
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
we've been talking about dissonance as

592
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
being like a way of thinking about that

593
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
friction, right?

594
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:25,160
Well, the easiest way to deal with

595
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,160
dissonance, the lowest friction way you

596
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,160
could deal with it personally is just

597
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,160
like not thinking about it, just like

598
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,160
tunnel vision and just ignore it and

599
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,160
don't worry about these weird feelings

600
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,160
that you have.

601
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:31,166
But that obviously doesn't help the

602
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:31,166
friction of the organization as a whole.

603
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:40,175
And so, yeah, there's this kind of

604
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:40,175
especially in your personal life too, by

605
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:40,175
analogy, is like confronting your own

606
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:40,175
emotions that you don't want to think

607
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:40,175
about in the short term.

608
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:43,178
Really easy to just power through and

609
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:43,178
just keep doing what you're doing.

610
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:48,183
But if you can process these and

611
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:48,183
integrate these emotions, that's a lot

612
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:48,183
healthier for you long term.

613
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:57,192
So it's an interesting kind of tension

614
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:57,192
between your individual tendencies of not

615
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:57,192
wanting friction and friction in the

616
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:57,192
organization as a whole.

617
00:21:49,183 --> 00:22:02,191
Daniel: Also to connect back to the

618
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:02,191
thermodynamics.

619
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:03,192
What is friction?

620
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:16,205
Well, it's when a force is applied on

621
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:16,205
some surface or through some media and it

622
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:16,205
results in heat, which is dissipated,

623
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:16,205
taking away energy from what could have

624
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:16,205
been done for work.

625
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:18,207
And now think about friction

626
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:18,207
engineering.

627
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:22,211
Do we coat every object with Teflon?

628
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:27,216
Do we want everything to just at the

629
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:27,216
lightest touch, fly off into space?

630
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:51,240
So just because we can increase or reduce

631
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,240
friction actually doesn't tell us,

632
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,240
especially over time scales like you're

633
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,240
bringing up Tyler, whether we want

634
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,240
something to have a lot of friction, like

635
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,240
where the rubber hits the road or whether

636
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,240
there are some fundamental trade offs

637
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,240
with how much heat the tire is losing in

638
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,240
contact with a smooth road versus how

639
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,240
much grip it has on a loose road.

640
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:56,245
And so all these different trade offs are

641
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:56,245
where the actual art and science is going

642
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:56,245
to come into play.

643
00:22:51,240 --> 00:23:03,246
But friction is not just a term that's

644
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:03,246
used every day to describe annoying

645
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:03,246
communication patterns.

646
00:22:56,245 --> 00:23:09,252
Feg is pointing towards that potentially

647
00:23:09,252 --> 00:23:09,252
being understood as an actual physical

648
00:23:09,252 --> 00:23:09,252
force.

649
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:14,257
Bleu: Cool.

650
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:16,259
Do you want to read this one for us,

651
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:16,259
Tyler?

652
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:17,260
Tyler: Sure.

653
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,263
So, the second proposition cognition.

654
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:26,269
So the stronger a firm's cognitive

655
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:26,269
disposition towards environmental

656
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:26,269
enactment and innovative abduction as

657
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:26,269
opposed to adaptation.

658
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:43,286
The stronger the firm's orientation

659
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:43,286
towards free energy surprise minimization

660
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:43,286
based self organization the stronger the

661
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:43,286
firm's strategic control and the smaller

662
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:43,286
the risk of falling for the financial

663
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:43,286
control trap, the stronger the

664
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:43,286
sustainability of successful and

665
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:43,286
continuous strategic renewal and hence

666
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:43,286
the firm's prospects for survival.

667
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:47,290
Bleu: All right.

668
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:57,300
And so I'm going to read another quote

669
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:57,300
from this section on cognition, and I

670
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:57,300
brought back this picture because I think

671
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:57,300
it's important.

672
00:23:47,290 --> 00:24:20,317
Okay, so Bijean says, cognition in the

673
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:20,317
form of world enactment is the purpose,

674
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:20,317
directed, action, centric and social

675
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:20,317
construction of shared meaning and shared

676
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:20,317
expectations, anchored in the

677
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:20,317
understanding that a firm's environment

678
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:20,317
is a matter of environmental engagement

679
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:20,317
in the form of interaction, revealing

680
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:20,317
significance, and assigning probabilities

681
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:20,317
to a bounded set of external unknown

682
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:20,317
states.

683
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:25,322
And so I'm coming back to this paper and

684
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:25,322
I'm looking at the information

685
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:25,322
processing, bottom up, top down.

686
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:32,329
And here I see this shared

687
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:32,329
representations, and we've seen this in

688
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:32,329
this figure in this paper.

689
00:24:26,322 --> 00:24:34,331
They're talking about body language.

690
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:41,338
And somatic response like heart rate

691
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:41,338
increase or lower and all these things

692
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:41,338
that have been measured in the generation

693
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:41,338
of empathy.

694
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:46,343
But is empathy maybe something that is

695
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:46,343
required for shared meaning or shared

696
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:46,343
expectation?

697
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:51,348
I wonder, do you have to have that?

698
00:24:46,343 --> 00:25:00,351
Is a sociopath, like, devoid of empathy,

699
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:00,351
like living in a world where things don't

700
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:00,351
mean the same thing and expectations

701
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:00,351
aren't the same?

702
00:24:52,349 --> 00:25:01,352
Maybe, right?

703
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:05,356
There might be a strong link there that I

704
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:05,356
wonder if it's been explored or not.

705
00:25:01,352 --> 00:25:14,365
So I'm just curious if you guys have

706
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:14,365
thoughts on what developing shared

707
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:14,365
meaning and expectation is and if it

708
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:14,365
requires some kind of empathy with

709
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:14,365
others.

710
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:18,369
Tyler: Yeah, I share that feeling.

711
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:30,381
One of the big questions I've had through

712
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
this, and honestly, it's on a personal

713
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
level, I've always been interested on

714
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
whether you could build tooling that

715
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
would help create that shared meaning and

716
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
expectations or whether this is really

717
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:30,381
just constrained by the individual.

718
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:43,394
If you have people who are sociopaths in

719
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:43,394
your organization, maybe it's just like

720
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:43,394
there's certain the way that they're

721
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:43,394
wired kind of limits the way that they

722
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:43,394
can engage and create shared meaning with

723
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:43,394
the rest of the organization.

724
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:46,397
And so, yeah, I'm kind of curious what

725
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:46,397
you all think about that too.

726
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:50,400
I don't have an answer for it, but maybe

727
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,400
that'd be a good question for Sean.

728
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:54,405
Bleu: All right.

729
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:55,406
Daniel, thoughts?

730
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:56,407
No thoughts?

731
00:25:55,406 --> 00:26:02,407
Daniel: Well, to have interpersonal

732
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:02,407
empathy as a behavior, as a feeling,

733
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:02,407
that's one whole area.

734
00:25:56,407 --> 00:26:25,430
But in the creation of organizations,

735
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,430
it's almost like we have to ask not how

736
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,430
strongly we feel or what we feel, but

737
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,430
whether some future person in that

738
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,430
organization outside of our direct

739
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,430
perception, cognition action loop is

740
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,430
going to have some sort of outcome.

741
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:40,445
Because I think it's easy just to sketch

742
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:40,445
out that you could feel really empathetic

743
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:40,445
empathetic or any emotional state, and it

744
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:40,445
could result in a totally discordant

745
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:40,445
state even for somebody you care about or

746
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:40,445
vice versa.

747
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:59,464
So how do we not get lost with just the

748
00:26:59,464 --> 00:26:59,464
introspection of the feeling of empathy

749
00:26:59,464 --> 00:26:59,464
and translate that into systems whose

750
00:26:59,464 --> 00:26:59,464
efficacy is equivalent to what we would

751
00:26:59,464 --> 00:26:59,464
have intended, but that may not feel like

752
00:26:59,464 --> 00:26:59,464
empathy all the time?

753
00:26:40,445 --> 00:27:18,477
Tyler: Yeah, I feel like especially over

754
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:18,477
the last couple of chapters, we keep

755
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:18,477
running to a similar concept of theme of

756
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:18,477
how the individuals wired in terms of

757
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:18,477
empathy and their ability to create

758
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:18,477
shared meaning and how that bubbles up

759
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:18,477
into the rest of the organization.

760
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:32,491
And yeah, I keep feeling like there's no

761
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
way out of like, hey, we're just limited

762
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
as humans in our ability to integrate

763
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
external information and that limits the

764
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
ability of the organization.

765
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:44,503
But sounds like Daniel was maybe sounding

766
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:44,503
more optimistic note of like, well,

767
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:44,503
actually, maybe you can build some maybe

768
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:44,503
there's tooling and systems you can build

769
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:44,503
that can have organizational empathy even

770
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:44,503
if the individual doesn't have it.

771
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:55,514
Bleu: So that brings to light something

772
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:55,514
that Daniel and I have talked about

773
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:55,514
before working on the discussion of

774
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:55,514
memes, like randomly random insertion,

775
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:55,514
random plug for the Eco Meme project.

776
00:27:46,505 --> 00:28:06,519
But when you're really thinking about

777
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:06,519
painting a picture to convey a shared

778
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:06,519
meaning, we talked about the

779
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:06,519
echolocation, how the dolphin literally

780
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:06,519
can paint a picture.

781
00:27:56,515 --> 00:28:12,525
Like, I saw a fish over here and can

782
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:12,525
translate puts the picture of the fish

783
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:12,525
into the other dolphin's mind.

784
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:14,527
Like, there's the picture of the fish,

785
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:14,527
right?

786
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:17,530
And so, like you we literally can paint

787
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:17,530
the entire picture.

788
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:26,538
So like, even if we could do something as

789
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:26,538
remarkable as that, we convey only the

790
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:26,538
semantic content.

791
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:32,545
If you can say the fire hydrant is red,

792
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:32,545
right?

793
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:37,550
And you guys both know can picture in

794
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:37,550
your mind like a red fire hydrant,

795
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:37,550
right?

796
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:41,554
But we don't know what semiotic content

797
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:41,554
is contained in that message.

798
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:44,557
Maybe someone's colorblind, maybe they

799
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:44,557
don't know if it's red or green.

800
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:45,558
They can't help, right?

801
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:58,571
And so the fire hydrant just appears in

802
00:28:58,571 --> 00:28:58,571
this gray thing that they think might be

803
00:28:58,571 --> 00:28:58,571
red or maybe someone has been in a house

804
00:28:58,571 --> 00:28:58,571
that burned down and the fire hydrant

805
00:28:58,571 --> 00:28:58,571
didn't work and they have this trauma

806
00:28:58,571 --> 00:28:58,571
inspiration moment, right?

807
00:28:45,558 --> 00:29:14,581
So the semiotic content, the symbolism

808
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:14,581
behind the message or the picture that

809
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:14,581
you painted, even in a situation where

810
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:14,581
you can perfectly create the tooling to

811
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:14,581
come to this shared meaning or

812
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:14,581
representation, you're never going to get

813
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:14,581
the symbolism that exists for someone

814
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:14,581
else.

815
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:16,583
It's a highly personal thing.

816
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:28,595
We can have shared symbolism too,

817
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:28,595
culturally, for sure, but there's a deep

818
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:28,595
level of personal symbolism in every

819
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:28,595
human that's dependent on your previous

820
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:28,595
life experience, I think.

821
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:45,612
So coming back to abduction, because we

822
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:45,612
did talk about it in the section, I can't

823
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:45,612
remember if it was in the last quote or

824
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:45,612
not, but I just wanted to point out this

825
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:45,612
is a recycled slide.

826
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:49,616
But coming back to abduction, where

827
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:49,616
Bijean talks about it, is abductive

828
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:49,616
reasoning.

829
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:50,617
This is a quote from the book.

830
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:54,621
Abductive reasoning usually begins with a

831
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:54,621
surprising observation or experience.

832
00:29:50,617 --> 00:30:00,621
This is what shatters our habit and

833
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:00,621
motivates us to create a hypothesis that

834
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:00,621
might resolve the anomaly.

835
00:29:54,621 --> 00:30:11,632
Abduction is an inferential procedure in

836
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:11,632
which we create a conjecture that if it

837
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:11,632
would make the surprising anomaly part of

838
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:11,632
our normal world, of our normal

839
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:11,632
understanding of the world.

840
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:16,637
So this picture is, like, the best way

841
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:16,637
for me to always think about abduction.

842
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:20,641
You can have a specific observation and

843
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:20,641
you can come to a general conclusion,

844
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:20,641
right?

845
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:28,649
And then you can have deductive reasoning

846
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:28,649
where you have a general rule, but that

847
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:28,649
leads to a specific conclusion that's

848
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:28,649
always true.

849
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:34,655
And then when you have an incomplete

850
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:34,655
observation, like, you can't see what's

851
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:34,655
going on, you just go to the best guess.

852
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:47,668
And so in Business and Bishop talks about

853
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:47,668
this again and again and again, you have

854
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:47,668
to use abductive reasoning, because we're

855
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:47,668
never going to have a complete picture of

856
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:47,668
the past and future of the market, like,

857
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:47,668
the whole market, or even your target

858
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:47,668
audience.

859
00:30:34,655 --> 00:30:51,672
So you're dealing with the best logical

860
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
guess.

861
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:56,677
Okay.

862
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:58,679
Do you want to read this one for us,

863
00:30:58,679 --> 00:30:58,679
Tyler?

864
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:59,680
This is you?

865
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,675
Tyler: Sure.

866
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:04,679
So the firm's Generative model is the

867
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:04,679
firm's Econich.

868
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:13,688
If uncertainty and unpredictability

869
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:13,688
dominate our worldly perception, well,

870
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:13,688
then this reflects the very limitations

871
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:13,688
and corrosiveness of our models and the

872
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:13,688
underlying processes generating those

873
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:13,688
models.

874
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:15,690
There is no objective uncertainty.

875
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:16,691
There is only your uncertainty.

876
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:18,693
Environment is enacted.

877
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:24,699
Each act opens a new fork of multiple

878
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:24,699
paths, leading to potentially very

879
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:24,699
different outcomes.

880
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:27,702
Reality is subjective algorithm applying

881
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:27,702
an infinite number of worlds.

882
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:28,703
In superposition.

883
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:36,711
Our ActInf not only create the junctures

884
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:36,711
leading to different paths, but we are in

885
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:36,711
control to decide which path to take at

886
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:36,711
each juncture.

887
00:31:28,703 --> 00:31:41,716
So, yeah, I thought this really

888
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:41,716
summarized well, the kind of inactive

889
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:41,716
cognition.

890
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:46,721
So there's a song proposition Two here of

891
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:46,721
Feg.

892
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:57,732
And also just that was, like, a fun quote

893
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:57,732
because we talked about a lot in the last

894
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:57,732
stream, but John's been using kind of

895
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:57,732
quantum language here, and we talked

896
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:57,732
about that in the last stream of K.

897
00:31:46,721 --> 00:32:03,732
What exactly does he mean there by that

898
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:03,732
Bleu?

899
00:31:57,732 --> 00:32:04,733
Daniel, anything to add here?

900
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:08,737
Bleu: I love your Excel spreadsheet.

901
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:11,740
Quantum superposition of an Excel

902
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:11,740
spreadsheet.

903
00:32:08,737 --> 00:32:17,746
Daniel: It's capturing the late night

904
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:17,746
blurry.

905
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:20,749
What action selection to take based upon

906
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:20,749
this spreadsheet?

907
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:23,752
Great.

908
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:30,759
Bleu: All right, so Bajan makes this

909
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:30,759
claim also in this section.

910
00:32:27,756 --> 00:32:33,762
He says, in fact, we are challenged.

911
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:41,770
Not to allow for the human brain's

912
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:41,770
conceptual limits to solely determine

913
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:41,770
perception and sense making, instead

914
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:41,770
outsourcing some of the heavy

915
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:41,770
information.

916
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:48,777
Lifting to the environment in the form of

917
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:48,777
extended cognition is the essence of

918
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:48,777
optimizing prediction error

919
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:48,777
minimization.

920
00:32:41,770 --> 00:33:03,786
The more exponential and hence

921
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:03,786
discontinuous a market environment, the

922
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:03,786
more we need self organizing mechanisms

923
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:03,786
that leverage the world as a supervisory

924
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:03,786
signal, challenging in circular causality

925
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:03,786
the very perceptual content of our

926
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:03,786
predictions.

927
00:32:48,777 --> 00:33:10,793
And so we've talked a lot about cognitive

928
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:10,793
offloading or extended cognition in terms

929
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:10,793
of cumulative cultural evolution.

930
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:17,800
Not in this bookstream per se, but over

931
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:17,800
the course active inference lab from the

932
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:17,800
very first beginning live streams.

933
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:25,808
We've talked about it a lot because now

934
00:33:25,808 --> 00:33:25,808
so much thinking is done externally.

935
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:32,815
It's encultured at some point with the

936
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:32,815
smartphone, we don't have to know how to

937
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:32,815
get anywhere anymore, we'll just map it.

938
00:33:25,808 --> 00:33:44,827
So I just am thinking like this self

939
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:44,827
organizing mechanisms that leverage the

940
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:44,827
world as a supervisory signal,

941
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:44,827
challenging in circular causality the

942
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:44,827
very perceptual content of our

943
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:44,827
predictions.

944
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:47,830
I'm so amazed by Chat GPT.

945
00:33:45,828 --> 00:33:52,835
I'm using it so much just because it's

946
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:52,835
like what does everybody know?

947
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:55,838
Chat GPT tells you what everybody knows.

948
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:59,842
It is like the selective synthesis of all

949
00:33:59,842 --> 00:33:59,842
information, right?

950
00:33:55,838 --> 00:34:04,841
And so if you know something that Chat

951
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:04,841
Gpt-3 doesn't know, that's great, you can

952
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:04,841
write a blog about it.

953
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:08,845
But now Chat GP Three can just write all

954
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:08,845
the blogs about every other thing.

955
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:12,849
It knows everything, right?

956
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:18,855
It's got all of the information synthesis

957
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:18,855
except the rare pockets of knowledge.

958
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:28,865
So is this, this self organizing

959
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:28,865
mechanism, this Chat Gpt-3 like a Global

960
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:28,865
search synthesis information management

961
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:28,865
system?

962
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:28,865
Daniel: I don't know.

963
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:29,866
Bleu: What do you guys think about that?

964
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:35,872
Tyler: Well, this is very out of my depth

965
00:34:35,872 --> 00:34:35,872
both in terms of machine learning and

966
00:34:35,872 --> 00:34:35,872
active inference.

967
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:39,876
But I was thinking about this last night

968
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:39,876
because this is like a huge debate right

969
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:39,876
now.

970
00:34:35,872 --> 00:34:46,883
It's like whether Chat Gpt-3 is actually

971
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:46,883
showing emergent intelligence or whether

972
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:46,883
it's just like a clever algorithm.

973
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:48,885
And I was thinking about this too.

974
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:53,890
Where are the differences between Chat

975
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:53,890
Gbt Three and what I've been learning so

976
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:53,890
far about active inference?

977
00:34:48,885 --> 00:34:58,895
And the crucial things that seems to be

978
00:34:58,895 --> 00:34:58,895
missing is like the inactive aspect of

979
00:34:58,895 --> 00:34:58,895
it.

980
00:34:53,890 --> 00:35:01,892
It's not really in dialogue with its

981
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:01,892
world.

982
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:04,895
It's like stringing together information

983
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:04,895
that's like a static, right?

984
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:05,896
It doesn't even incorporate new

985
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:05,896
information.

986
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:09,900
Like if you were to ask it about the news

987
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:09,900
yesterday, it couldn't do that.

988
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:12,903
And it's not taking actions in the world

989
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:12,903
and giving feedback.

990
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:16,907
It's just like the static model of how

991
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:16,907
the world works.

992
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:22,913
And so I don't know, it feels like

993
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:22,913
fundamentally different to me and I'm not

994
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:22,913
sure what that means.

995
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:28,919
I'm not sure if something has to display

996
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:28,919
active inference to have true

997
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:28,919
intelligence.

998
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:31,922
I'm sure this is like a big hotly

999
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:31,922
contested topic.

1000
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:34,925
I'm sure you guys have many live streams

1001
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:34,925
about this.

1002
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:34,925
Yeah.

1003
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:35,926
Daniel Bleu.

1004
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:38,929
I'm curious what you guys think in.

1005
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:46,937
Daniel: The space of communication, the

1006
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:46,937
response it provides to you is an action

1007
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:46,937
that's not moving, a mechanical arm on a

1008
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:46,937
table.

1009
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:56,947
But in our Internet of everything, it's

1010
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:56,947
not so hard to see how the digital

1011
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:56,947
outputs from a generative algorithm do

1012
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:56,947
translate to physical objects moving.

1013
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:58,949
But it may not even need to do that.

1014
00:35:56,947 --> 00:36:13,958
It can send out messages on social media

1015
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:13,958
and definitely meriting further

1016
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:13,958
discussion as things will continue to

1017
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:13,958
develop and gain more access to recent

1018
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:13,958
information, world model learning and

1019
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:13,958
action capacity soon.

1020
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:23,968
Bleu: I have a little bit of a technical

1021
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:23,968
response here.

1022
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:35,980
I think that the question is not about

1023
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:35,980
true intelligence, maybe, but the

1024
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:35,980
question that I hear talked about a lot

1025
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:35,980
is Sentience, right?

1026
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:40,985
But I have read this big article about is

1027
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:40,985
Gpt-3 Sentient?

1028
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:46,991
And I think it was like from one of the

1029
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:46,991
inside Google people, the one that was

1030
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:46,991
released, and now they're talking about

1031
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:46,991
it because everybody's using it.

1032
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:51,996
And Sentient, they just said able to

1033
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:51,996
think and act independently.

1034
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:53,998
But that's not the definition of

1035
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:53,998
Sentient.

1036
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:57,002
I'm not sure what the definition of

1037
00:36:57,002 --> 00:36:57,002
Sentient is, but it's not like

1038
00:36:57,002 --> 00:36:57,002
autonomous.

1039
00:36:53,998 --> 00:37:00,999
They're using Sentient and autonomous the

1040
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:00,999
same way.

1041
00:36:57,002 --> 00:37:03,002
And Sentient is like, able to feel

1042
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:03,002
things.

1043
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:03,002
Right?

1044
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:05,004
So I think let's look it up right now.

1045
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:08,007
Let's define Sentient for the world at

1046
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:08,007
large.

1047
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:10,009
What does that mean?

1048
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:15,014
Because intelligent Sentient and

1049
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:15,014
autonomous are all different.

1050
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:16,015
So hold on, I'm looking on my.

1051
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:22,021
Daniel: Phone because I'm screen sharing

1052
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:22,021
words, words humpty.

1053
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:24,023
Alice in Wonderland, people will use

1054
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:24,023
them.

1055
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:26,025
Bleu: How they want, but that's

1056
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:26,025
everything.

1057
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:30,029
So a Sentient is able to perceive or feel

1058
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:30,029
things, right?

1059
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:33,032
And so is Gpt-3 feeling anything?

1060
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:37,036
I highly doubt it perceiving a lot,

1061
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:37,036
sure.

1062
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:43,042
But as to your thing about updating,

1063
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:43,042
Tyler, I'm sure the model will update at

1064
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:43,042
some regular interval.

1065
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:54,052
So just think about we're not there yet

1066
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:54,052
in terms of compute power, but maybe in

1067
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:54,052
ten years it will be training on the

1068
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:54,052
entire Wikipedia catalog every single

1069
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:54,052
day.

1070
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:57,056
So does Wikipedia have a date entry for

1071
00:37:57,056 --> 00:37:57,056
every day?

1072
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:58,057
I think it does, right?

1073
00:37:57,056 --> 00:38:06,059
So when you ask, what was the news

1074
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:06,059
yesterday, it'll know that that's just a

1075
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:06,059
matter of what's encoded and what's being

1076
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:06,059
processed through silicone.

1077
00:37:58,057 --> 00:38:07,060
It's only time, right?

1078
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:09,062
We're way close.

1079
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:15,068
So it will be able to update with some

1080
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:15,068
regularity will it update itself?

1081
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:16,069
I don't know.

1082
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:19,072
That gets into autonomous acting.

1083
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:21,074
I don't know.

1084
00:38:20,073 --> 00:38:22,075
All those things are different.

1085
00:38:21,074 --> 00:38:30,083
Tyler: That reminds me, though, because

1086
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:30,083
we've had this discussion over the past

1087
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:30,083
15 minutes about empathy and do

1088
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:30,083
organizations have empathy?

1089
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:39,092
And it's kind of like the same

1090
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:39,092
conversation as Gpt-3 of like, okay,

1091
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:39,092
well, maybe organizational empathy, it

1092
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:39,092
looks and just feels differently than

1093
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:39,092
individual empathy.

1094
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:40,092
Right?

1095
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:43,096
And so you can imagine the same thing

1096
00:38:43,096 --> 00:38:43,096
happening in Gpt-3.

1097
00:38:40,093 --> 00:38:50,103
And I don't know what that version of

1098
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:50,103
empathy would look like in Gpt-3, but

1099
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:50,103
maybe it's just like something that we

1100
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:50,103
can't quite wrap our hands around.

1101
00:38:43,096 --> 00:38:53,106
Daniel: It'll be awesome.

1102
00:38:52,104 --> 00:39:14,121
Again, I think a further discussion would

1103
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
be very timely, especially if, for

1104
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
example, communication from one person's

1105
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
syntax could move into a semantic space

1106
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
or a rhetorical space from the eco meme

1107
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
direction, as Bleu mentioned, and then be

1108
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
translated back into another semantic

1109
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:14,121
space for the listener.

1110
00:38:53,106 --> 00:39:19,126
That might be changing the amount of math

1111
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:19,126
detail or in a different human natural

1112
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:19,126
language.

1113
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:22,129
So there's a lot of incredible

1114
00:39:22,129 --> 00:39:22,129
opportunities.

1115
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:26,133
Bleu: Yeah, definitely.

1116
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:32,139
I think it'll be interesting to see to

1117
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:32,139
interrogate Bajan with such esoteric

1118
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:32,139
questions.

1119
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:35,142
With such esoteric questions.

1120
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:37,144
See what he thinks.

1121
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:39,146
Does the firm have empathy?

1122
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:40,147
Where did you even get this?

1123
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:41,148
Well, we got it.

1124
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:44,151
Sorry, we're off to ask anyway.

1125
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:47,154
All right, so moving on.

1126
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:49,156
Tyler, do you want to read this one

1127
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:49,156
proposition?

1128
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:50,157
Tyler: Sure.

1129
00:39:49,156 --> 00:40:14,175
So the stronger the board's dmn centric

1130
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
duality stewardship empowering upper

1131
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
echelon, sustainably balanced

1132
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
exploitation versus exploration, as well

1133
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
as strategic or financial versus

1134
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
strategic control, the stronger the

1135
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
firm's orientation towards free energy

1136
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
surprise minimization based self

1137
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
organization, the stronger the

1138
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
sustainability of successful and

1139
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
continuous strategic renewal and hence

1140
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:14,175
the firm's prospects for survival.

1141
00:39:50,157 --> 00:40:17,178
Bleu: Cool.

1142
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:19,180
And so we talked about this last week a

1143
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,180
lot.

1144
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:32,193
I didn't put a lot of extra information

1145
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:32,193
in here because we did, like, the

1146
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:32,193
antagonistic neural that perspective last

1147
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:32,193
week, but I did just want to include the

1148
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:32,193
summary.

1149
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:46,207
So Bijean, at the end of the chapter,

1150
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:46,207
summarizes it by saying, in summary, the

1151
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:46,207
board must assume the role of sponsor or

1152
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:46,207
enforcer of three categorical imperatives

1153
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:46,207
defining the success and sustainability

1154
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:46,207
of strategic renewal and firm survival.

1155
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:51,212
First, foster cognitive coupling between

1156
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:51,212
and within all hierarchical layers.

1157
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:55,216
I'm really excited to find out exactly

1158
00:40:55,216 --> 00:40:55,216
how to do this.

1159
00:40:51,212 --> 00:41:04,219
Second, embrace environment as action

1160
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:04,219
generated and socially constructed shared

1161
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:04,219
meaning and shared expectations, which

1162
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:04,219
we've talked about a lot today.

1163
00:40:56,217 --> 00:41:15,230
And third, DeChane the firm from thinking

1164
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,230
in terms of antagonisms, but embrace real

1165
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,230
time duality management as a critical

1166
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,230
determinant of performance and survival.

1167
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:18,232
That's pretty much it.

1168
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:22,237
Do you guys have any final thoughts?

1169
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:26,241
Daniel: The overtime period?

1170
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:30,245
The generative AI speculation moment?

1171
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:33,248
The hashtag 2023?

1172
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:36,251
Questions that we all have.

1173
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:43,258
Bleu: Good times.

1174
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:47,262
So we talked about quantum.

1175
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:55,270
So I'm leaving us with this one quote

1176
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,270
from this chapter because it's just kind

1177
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,270
of, like, thrown in there.

1178
00:41:47,262 --> 00:42:03,272
Bijan says, classical linear cause effect

1179
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:03,272
thinking is no match for quantum

1180
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:03,272
exponentiality.

1181
00:41:56,271 --> 00:42:06,275
I wonder what he means by quantum

1182
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:06,275
exponentiality.

1183
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:10,279
Like, are we again talking about

1184
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:10,279
superposition or are we talking about,

1185
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:10,279
like, super?

1186
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:13,282
Because that's, like, I guess, the many

1187
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:13,282
states existing at once.

1188
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:15,284
Is that what he means by exponentiality?

1189
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:17,285
What do you guys think?

1190
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:20,289
Tyler: Think Jean has a poetic bent in

1191
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:20,289
him.

1192
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:22,291
Not sure if we're meant to take this

1193
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:22,291
fully literally.

1194
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:34,303
Daniel: Exponents are used in a lot of

1195
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:34,303
quantum mechanics, so there could be

1196
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:34,303
various readings just like any other good

1197
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:34,303
poem.

1198
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:40,309
So we should jump in with these kinds of

1199
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:40,309
questions.

1200
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:43,312
Bleu: Cool.

1201
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,313
Well, that's next week.

1202
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:47,316
So, yeah.

1203
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:52,321
Excited to wrap up this part and just a

1204
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:52,321
couple more book streams left for us.

1205
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:53,322
Winding down again.

1206
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:57,326
Get in touch if you would like to

1207
00:42:57,326 --> 00:42:57,326
participate in our final discussion.

1208
00:42:53,322 --> 00:43:01,324
We would really welcome any external

1209
00:43:01,324 --> 00:43:01,324
perspectives.

1210
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:03,326
Daniel: All right, thanks.

1211
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:04,327
See you next time.
