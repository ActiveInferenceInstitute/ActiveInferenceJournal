00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,704
Hello everyone. It's December 13,

2
00:00:09,752 --> 00:00:12,792
2022. We're in active bookstream.

3
00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:16,172
Number 1.2 on the book

4
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:18,024
governing continuous transformation.

5
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:21,804
Off to Bleu. Hi everyone.

6
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:24,712
We are the Active Coherence Institute,

7
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:27,432
participatory online learning institute

8
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:29,204
that is learning, practicing and

9
00:00:29,242 --> 00:00:31,456
thinking about applied active inference.

10
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:33,716
You can reach us here at all of our

11
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:37,044
media links. This is a recorded and an

12
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:39,492
archived live stream, so please provide

13
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:41,956
us with feedback so we can improve upon

14
00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:43,864
our work. All backgrounds and

15
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:46,296
perspectives are welcome here and we

16
00:00:46,318 --> 00:00:48,564
will be following good video etiquette

17
00:00:48,612 --> 00:00:52,168
for live streams. Hopefully get in

18
00:00:52,174 --> 00:00:54,040
touch if you want to participate either

19
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,390
in this book stream or the zero

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,180
contextualization streams or in another

21
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,096
Livestream or maybe in the discussion

22
00:01:03,128 --> 00:01:04,716
stream. You can reach us

23
00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:08,210
always@active.org or by email.

24
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,720
Okay, so here we are, bookstream 1.2.

25
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,764
The action will go through the Bookmap

26
00:01:14,812 --> 00:01:17,088
and the roadmap, the keywords and the

27
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:19,776
claims, and we'll be continuing the

28
00:01:19,798 --> 00:01:21,504
discussion of Governing Continuous

29
00:01:21,552 --> 00:01:24,676
Transformation. So I don't know if we

30
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:27,476
want to just maybe mention a couple of

31
00:01:27,498 --> 00:01:29,024
things, one or two things that we're

32
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:31,364
excited to discuss more today or learn

33
00:01:31,402 --> 00:01:32,996
more about from this section of the

34
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:34,456
book. Tyler, is there anything that

35
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:36,296
stood out for you specifically or if

36
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:38,004
maybe you want to give an introduction

37
00:01:38,052 --> 00:01:40,648
and then maybe say one or two words

38
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,304
about the book, the chapter? Yeah,

39
00:01:43,342 --> 00:01:46,108
sure. So I'm Tyler. I work more on the

40
00:01:46,114 --> 00:01:47,644
applied side of thinking about

41
00:01:47,682 --> 00:01:50,284
governance, organizational design. Both

42
00:01:50,322 --> 00:01:52,444
work in the Dow tooling space and also

43
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:54,556
protocol design also works in a lot of

44
00:01:54,578 --> 00:01:56,648
like corporate settings or as a strategy

45
00:01:56,664 --> 00:01:59,248
consultant. I think for today what I'm

46
00:01:59,254 --> 00:02:01,712
excited about is that I went to business

47
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:04,416
school, something that I hear a lot

48
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:06,348
about some of these organizational

49
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:09,020
design framework that Bijan references

50
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,740
in the book. But it's really interesting

51
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,500
to compare that directly to free energy

52
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,596
governance and compare contrast to see

53
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:16,084
where the gaps are. So I'm excited about

54
00:02:16,122 --> 00:02:18,756
exploring that more today. What about

55
00:02:18,778 --> 00:02:22,230
you, Bleu? I am really excited to

56
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,384
kind of link and so I'll do this right

57
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:27,192
up in the very beginning, but to link

58
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:29,544
what we have talked about in Active

59
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,304
Coherence Lab Institute over the last

60
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:33,392
couple of years about biological

61
00:02:33,476 --> 00:02:35,900
organization and hierarchical

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,728
information flow in biological systems.

63
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:41,164
I'm excited to connect that to how that

64
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,556
works in an organization. As I was

65
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:45,576
reading the book, that was something

66
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:47,388
that stood out to me as something that's

67
00:02:47,404 --> 00:02:51,196
maybe necessary for a more elaborate

68
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:53,904
discussion of the text. Cool.

69
00:02:54,022 --> 00:02:57,330
Daniel, anything? All the

70
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,968
comments at the Road Map, but I'm

71
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:02,144
Daniel, I'm a researcher in California

72
00:03:02,192 --> 00:03:03,652
and just looking forward to this

73
00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:06,550
discussion. Cool, thanks.

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,416
Okay, so here we are at the book map.

75
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:13,512
We are in Chapter two, sensing Sense

76
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:17,368
Making and Strategic Renewal. And the

77
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:19,972
roadmap for today is just two sections.

78
00:03:20,036 --> 00:03:21,576
These were structured actually by the

79
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,188
author strategic cognitive scientist and

80
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:26,236
sense making. And the second section is

81
00:03:26,258 --> 00:03:29,276
strategic renewal. Did you want to make

82
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:32,380
a comment here. Daniel at the roadmap.

83
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,090
Not yet. Thank you. Okay,

84
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,680
so lots of keywords in today's

85
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,816
discussion. So we'll just jump right in

86
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:48,464
and hopefully we put them in an order

87
00:03:48,502 --> 00:03:51,108
that aligns with the order in the book

88
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:53,856
and included some commentary and claims

89
00:03:53,888 --> 00:03:56,884
from the text as well. All right. So,

90
00:03:56,922 --> 00:03:58,516
Tyler, do you want to read this first

91
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:01,030
part of the abstract? Sure.

92
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,836
Sense making form one utary act together

93
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:07,152
consider non operational cognitive

94
00:04:07,216 --> 00:04:09,680
medicaidability or dynamic capability.

95
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,672
There's no sensing without sense making

96
00:04:11,726 --> 00:04:13,464
and vice versa. And there is no

97
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:15,036
organizational sense making in the

98
00:04:15,058 --> 00:04:16,872
absence of a clearly defined, deep

99
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:18,840
existential corporate purpose.

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,844
Generally, the processes of top down,

101
00:04:20,882 --> 00:04:22,616
bottom up, hypothesis testing,

102
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:24,844
prediction error minimization rather

103
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:26,652
than top down heuristic simplification

104
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:28,528
are grabbing the path, navigating a

105
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,396
discontinuous world. There's

106
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:32,496
neurosciences predictive coding that

107
00:04:32,518 --> 00:04:34,876
allows us to take management researches,

108
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:36,624
strategic cognition, and more

109
00:04:36,662 --> 00:04:38,848
specifically connected to structure and

110
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:40,484
cognitive niche. Step further to provide

111
00:04:40,522 --> 00:04:42,656
a more complete and practice relevant

112
00:04:42,688 --> 00:04:44,484
framework for applying sensing and sense

113
00:04:44,522 --> 00:04:46,336
making in the concept of strategic

114
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:49,844
renewal. I want to take the next part.

115
00:04:49,962 --> 00:04:51,528
Sure. Thanks. Daniel, do you want to

116
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:55,050
read this Parr? No. Okay, I'll do it.

117
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,040
Effectively, sensing and sense making

118
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,404
are empowered by the circular causality

119
00:05:00,452 --> 00:05:02,292
of top down knowledge structures,

120
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,136
prediction, action, prediction,

121
00:05:04,248 --> 00:05:07,372
hypotheses and guesses, and bottom up

122
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:09,384
stimuli data stemming from resource

123
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:11,836
markets by default. Uncertainty and

124
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:13,916
complexity are subjective concepts that

125
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,784
are consistently deployed in management

126
00:05:15,832 --> 00:05:17,964
research as objectively determined

127
00:05:18,092 --> 00:05:20,224
environment. Sensing and sensemaking are

128
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:22,704
nonsensical in the absence of having set

129
00:05:22,742 --> 00:05:24,688
the firm's purpose and context in the

130
00:05:24,694 --> 00:05:27,260
first place. Once we define sensing,

131
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,668
sense making, and strategic renewal in

132
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:31,712
form of action, centric circular

133
00:05:31,776 --> 00:05:34,016
causality linking purpose, prediction

134
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:35,856
models, predictions, and prediction

135
00:05:35,888 --> 00:05:38,196
error minimization, the new logic of

136
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,844
strategic renewal emerges. Dynamically

137
00:05:40,912 --> 00:05:42,692
connecting structure, hierarchy,

138
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:44,520
cognition, and capabilities.

139
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,704
I just really wanted to bring this in

140
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:52,776
here. We're talking here about top down

141
00:05:52,798 --> 00:05:54,884
and bottom up. And I know that there's

142
00:05:54,932 --> 00:05:56,796
management styles and structures that

143
00:05:56,818 --> 00:05:58,732
are associated with top down and bottom

144
00:05:58,786 --> 00:06:01,596
up like management styles, but I really

145
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:03,516
wanted to bring up this paper, the

146
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:05,612
Information Theory of Individuality by

147
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,328
David Krakauer and colleagues at the

148
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,504
Santa Fe Institute. And I bring this up

149
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:12,368
because really they try to define what

150
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:15,612
is an individual, even in a biological

151
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,736
system, an individual, we have more or

152
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:21,520
just as many cells inside of our body

153
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,844
that are not human as we do cells that

154
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:26,068
are human, right? But if you were to

155
00:06:26,074 --> 00:06:28,148
take all of those non human cells out of

156
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,628
my body, I would not be the same person.

157
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:33,016
I would not function optimally at all.

158
00:06:33,118 --> 00:06:36,424
So I'm more maybe than just what is my

159
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,940
DNA, I'm a colony. Not necessarily.

160
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,864
Like, I'm one organism. I'm many

161
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,860
organisms to function appropriately.

162
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,756
And so really, these guys tried to

163
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:49,356
define how you contain an

164
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:51,436
individual, like, what is worthy of this

165
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,068
Markov blanket. Like, we talk about the

166
00:06:53,074 --> 00:06:55,180
Markov blanket as the boundary between

167
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,356
internal and external. But where do you

168
00:06:57,378 --> 00:06:59,196
put that? Am I drawing it around my

169
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,216
human cells? Between my human cells and

170
00:07:01,238 --> 00:07:03,264
my non human cells? That doesn't really

171
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:05,616
make sense, right? So they talk in this

172
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:08,176
paper a lot about and they do it in a

173
00:07:08,198 --> 00:07:09,856
hierarchical way, which is why the

174
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:11,776
biological levels of organization are

175
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,536
here, because you can define an

176
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,908
individual at the level of a cell or a

177
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:18,512
tissue or an organism, population,

178
00:07:18,576 --> 00:07:20,164
community, and so forth. And this even

179
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:22,890
applies to organizations like a company.

180
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,588
So here what is critical to be defined

181
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:30,132
as an individual is this bi directional

182
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:33,096
information flow. I think that this

183
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:34,536
paper is very elegant and great. So you

184
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:36,252
have to have information flowing top

185
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:38,172
down, and you also have to have

186
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:40,556
information flowing bottom up to be

187
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:43,356
worthy of a Markov blanket and

188
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:45,772
considered an individual in this paper.

189
00:07:45,826 --> 00:07:47,228
And so I really just kind of wanted to

190
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,860
bring that in because they talk about

191
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,784
Bijan, talks a lot about how you need

192
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:52,848
this bottom up and top down, and they

193
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:54,876
have to work together. And he talks

194
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,436
about that a lot in the book for a firm

195
00:07:57,468 --> 00:08:00,252
to persist. And so really it's necessary

196
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:02,868
for anything to persist, you have to

197
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:04,276
have that bi directional information

198
00:08:04,378 --> 00:08:07,236
flow to earn your Markov blanket, so to

199
00:08:07,258 --> 00:08:09,076
speak. I just wanted to kind of bring

200
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:11,816
that up here before we jump into the

201
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:13,256
additional context. Talking about top

202
00:08:13,278 --> 00:08:16,328
down and bottom up in the book. Did you

203
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:20,440
guys have any comments here? Daniel yes,

204
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,976
but I was going to suggest that The

205
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:26,216
Roadmap was a quote from the abstract

206
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:28,216
subjective concepts pragmatically

207
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:30,476
applied, which I think deals with a lot

208
00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:32,844
of informational concepts. And then like

209
00:08:32,882 --> 00:08:35,150
you brought up, if you define self

210
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,024
spatially or genetically, you're going

211
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:41,808
to get some boundaries which may be

212
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:44,112
relevant in certain situations, but also

213
00:08:44,246 --> 00:08:46,560
might give a misleading or Attial view

214
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,916
of the total system. And then the

215
00:08:48,938 --> 00:08:50,740
challenge is when we move to this

216
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,484
informational or statistical theory of

217
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:57,796
nested Selves, then organizations and

218
00:08:57,818 --> 00:08:59,940
their niches can have many different

219
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,236
looking causes and components. So it's

220
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:06,920
very challenging and it's not the chart,

221
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,684
it's not the computer access chart.

222
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:12,008
It's something that's somehow different.

223
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,668
And I think that will be relevant to

224
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:16,092
pull out what is being described and

225
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:18,188
what should people's consideration be?

226
00:09:18,354 --> 00:09:20,508
What do we actually gain by saying that

227
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:22,392
systems are nested, which isn't a novel

228
00:09:22,456 --> 00:09:23,260
insight?

229
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,666
Yeah, that's great. And then also in

230
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:31,258
talking about that bi directional

231
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:33,694
information flow, there's a certain

232
00:09:33,732 --> 00:09:35,374
amount of salience that has to be there.

233
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:37,018
Also, like information can be flowing

234
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,398
both directions, but if the information

235
00:09:38,484 --> 00:09:41,954
is irrelevant, then that's going to not

236
00:09:41,992 --> 00:09:44,740
be the cause for perseverance. Right?

237
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,700
Okay, cool. Okay, so here we are.

238
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,662
Strategic cognition, sensing and sense

239
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:55,574
making and just and early quote from

240
00:09:55,612 --> 00:09:56,886
this chapter. Do you want to read this?

241
00:09:56,908 --> 00:09:58,040
Tyler? Is that okay?

242
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,198
All right. Strategy initiation and

243
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:04,882
formulation defined as a complex

244
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:06,674
activity consisting of scanning. Sense

245
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,194
making and strategic decision making are

246
00:10:09,232 --> 00:10:10,566
at the heart of the firm's collective

247
00:10:10,598 --> 00:10:12,406
interpretive power, emphasizing its core

248
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:14,358
capabilities, timely and accuracy

249
00:10:14,374 --> 00:10:15,846
reading of expected environmental

250
00:10:15,878 --> 00:10:17,646
change, and the corresponding need for

251
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:19,806
resource reconfiguration in pursuit of

252
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,550
the adaptation. Cool.

253
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,402
Thank you. Okay, so strategic cognition,

254
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:30,746
they use the definition presented

255
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:33,134
in this paper, the Cognitive Perspective

256
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:35,346
in Strategy and Integrated Review, and

257
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,674
they referenced this paper quite a bit.

258
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:39,586
So I just pulled out this diagram of

259
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:42,146
strategic cognition and pulled up the

260
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:43,974
definition that was used in this paper.

261
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:46,294
So they say strategic cognition is

262
00:10:46,332 --> 00:10:48,914
discussed in terms of its constituents,

263
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:51,766
structure and process. By structure we

264
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:53,362
refer to the relatively stable

265
00:10:53,426 --> 00:10:56,074
characteristics and repeated patterns of

266
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:58,662
behavior and by process to the cognitive

267
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:00,570
activities taking place in

268
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,786
organizations. Just to

269
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:06,950
note on that, the focus in this

270
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,766
book is on kind of a

271
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:13,694
certain type of corporation with a board

272
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:16,046
of directors, for example, which is an

273
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:19,422
important category. This I'm also just

274
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:22,586
imagining someone who is navigating

275
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:26,350
spatially as part of working in a taxi

276
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,506
service. Also, strategic cognition is

277
00:11:29,528 --> 00:11:31,246
coming into play, though the wording

278
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:32,946
might be framed a little differently,

279
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:35,782
but it's similar questions about sense

280
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:37,750
making and just different

281
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,646
implementations of different kinds of

282
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:44,920
organizations. And I wonder how

283
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,626
strategy in terms of this kind of

284
00:11:47,648 --> 00:11:49,898
strategic cognition is related to the

285
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:52,186
systems engineering approach. Is it

286
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:55,046
align with that or maybe not? That's

287
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:57,406
something to be interesting to know more

288
00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:59,534
about. Do you have any comments here,

289
00:11:59,572 --> 00:12:03,102
Tyler? Yeah, that's actually something

290
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,774
that to build on Daniel's point, like

291
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,094
how specific what Bijan is talking about

292
00:12:08,132 --> 00:12:10,606
is to board specifically versus other

293
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:12,366
organizational structures. And just like

294
00:12:12,388 --> 00:12:14,042
a comment on that, my initial feelings

295
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:15,874
on so far where we are in the book is

296
00:12:15,912 --> 00:12:18,130
that it's really not. And I'm not seeing

297
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,514
why we need to reduce the scope of just,

298
00:12:20,552 --> 00:12:22,206
like, organizations that have boards,

299
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:24,306
especially since most companies I've

300
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:26,226
been in, a lot of the important decision

301
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:28,070
making is really happening at the level

302
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,446
of really more of the

303
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:34,226
executives and the C suite. And Bijan

304
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:35,718
might argue like, hey, that's actually a

305
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:37,334
problem, it should be more coming from

306
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:39,498
an active board. But it's kind of

307
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:41,226
interesting to see where the limits of

308
00:12:41,248 --> 00:12:42,746
what Pajama is talking about and how

309
00:12:42,768 --> 00:12:44,314
specific is it to a specific kind of

310
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:47,226
organizational structure. Or another

311
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:50,526
angle is in the body. The decisions are

312
00:12:50,548 --> 00:12:52,446
being made in a distributed, nested way.

313
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:54,206
And so that kind of organization, I

314
00:12:54,228 --> 00:12:57,054
think we'll read on to find, will have

315
00:12:57,092 --> 00:13:00,034
resonance with this. However, who should

316
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:03,678
the strategic communication and cutting

317
00:13:03,694 --> 00:13:05,742
edge research on the strategy,

318
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:08,740
governance, upstream decision making.

319
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,026
There's a very certain audience I think

320
00:13:11,048 --> 00:13:13,862
it makes sense to communicate that to.

321
00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:17,238
And also this is the threads being

322
00:13:17,324 --> 00:13:19,766
linked for a first time in a

323
00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:23,334
dissertation style book. And I could

324
00:13:23,372 --> 00:13:26,310
imagine different kinds of presentations

325
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,286
and implementations being presented

326
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:30,826
differently, not necessarily like an

327
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:32,810
academic published dissertation.

328
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,950
And that leads me to wonder, perhaps

329
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,070
strategic cognition can take place at

330
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,550
many levels in a hierarchical system.

331
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,430
Like maybe an individual, like a project

332
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,002
or a team is doing strategic cognition

333
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:49,406
on the execution of their goals and

334
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,858
tasks. And that happens at the level of

335
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,226
the individual and the team and the

336
00:13:54,248 --> 00:13:57,666
project and the department and then the

337
00:13:57,688 --> 00:14:00,594
firm and then the board. So perhaps it

338
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:04,306
occurs in several places. When I've been

339
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:05,758
reading board one of the Johnson's

340
00:14:05,774 --> 00:14:08,406
board, I read that as like Council, and

341
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:10,038
that's my interpretation of that. And

342
00:14:10,044 --> 00:14:12,200
that can happen at many levels as well.

343
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,918
Funny. Like when you say counsel, I

344
00:14:14,924 --> 00:14:17,014
think attorney. Why do we have lawyers

345
00:14:17,062 --> 00:14:18,714
involved? I mean, Council has been like

346
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:21,370
high counsel, supreme counsel.

347
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,950
All right, awesome. Okay, so sensing

348
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,830
I pulled this out to Tyler's protests.

349
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,198
I wanted to just maybe talk a little bit

350
00:14:35,204 --> 00:14:38,974
about sensing and sense making and

351
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:40,718
talk a little bit about them separately.

352
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:44,018
But they are sensing and sensing and

353
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:46,082
sensing and sense making form one

354
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,226
unitary act and together can be

355
00:14:48,248 --> 00:14:50,622
considered a non operational cognitive,

356
00:14:50,686 --> 00:14:53,902
metacapability or dynamics capability.

357
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:56,326
And this reminds me of the time that I

358
00:14:56,348 --> 00:14:58,882
asked Karl about like when I'm sensing,

359
00:14:59,026 --> 00:15:00,918
what am I sensing? Like if I am I

360
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:02,374
sensing like when I look at a red

361
00:15:02,412 --> 00:15:05,226
balloon, am I sensing red balloon or am

362
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:08,294
I sensing like 700 nanometer

363
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:11,414
wavelength of light and round oval

364
00:15:11,462 --> 00:15:13,274
shape? Like what is actually being

365
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,450
perceived via the senses?

366
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,614
And Karl answered me, he said, red

367
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,406
balloon, go away from the red light and

368
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:22,910
go more toward the red balloon.

369
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,854
That answer really says, okay, there

370
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:30,194
actually is not sensing without sense

371
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:32,174
making. Like they are inextricably

372
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,726
linked because if I'm actually sensing

373
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:37,410
red balloon, then I'm going beyond what

374
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,126
my eyes see or like what my nose smells

375
00:15:40,158 --> 00:15:42,750
or whatever. Okay. And effectively

376
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,726
sensing and sense making is a form of

377
00:15:44,748 --> 00:15:47,314
organizational learning, action centric

378
00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:49,206
hypothesis testing that connects the

379
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:51,990
individual level with that of the firm.

380
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,778
Do you guys have any comments here? We

381
00:15:54,784 --> 00:15:57,962
can move on to sense making or stay in

382
00:15:58,016 --> 00:15:59,180
sense making maybe.

383
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,106
All right, Tyler, this is yours. All

384
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:05,926
right. Sense making. So purpose goal

385
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,926
directed in this so the world's models

386
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,158
underlying prediction model is

387
00:16:11,184 --> 00:16:13,134
fundamental to sensing and sense making.

388
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:15,194
So dissonance is a function of a preset

389
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:16,766
goal generating predictions and

390
00:16:16,788 --> 00:16:18,446
submitting those predictions to

391
00:16:18,628 --> 00:16:20,914
continuum error. Minimization sense

392
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:23,134
making models are constantly adjusted

393
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,686
through error and deviation clearing

394
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:26,514
feedback loops, coupling top down

395
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,658
predictions and bottom up Simuli and

396
00:16:28,744 --> 00:16:30,734
circular causality. The sole objective

397
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,706
in minimizing prediction errors and

398
00:16:32,728 --> 00:16:34,658
surprise, ie. Free energy.

399
00:16:34,824 --> 00:16:37,122
Fundamentally, sensemaking is about

400
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:40,606
designing noticing systems. And so what

401
00:16:40,648 --> 00:16:43,014
I really liked from the paper that is

402
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:45,506
actually from Wake, I'm not sure if I'm

403
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,962
pronouncing that right, is sense making

404
00:16:48,016 --> 00:16:49,798
is about how people deal with situations

405
00:16:49,814 --> 00:16:51,802
where there are too many or too few

406
00:16:51,856 --> 00:16:54,538
meanings. And this is something that

407
00:16:54,544 --> 00:16:55,706
I've experienced a lot, especially in

408
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:57,386
like startup context. Like you could

409
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:58,826
think of it and they're actually kind of

410
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:00,906
the same situation, too many or too few

411
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:02,298
meanings. Like if you're in a startup

412
00:17:02,394 --> 00:17:03,726
and you're trying to figure out what you

413
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:06,750
do next, your strategic directions are

414
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,106
kind of infinite because you haven't

415
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:09,806
really built that many. So there's like

416
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,614
all these things, directions you can go,

417
00:17:11,652 --> 00:17:13,066
things you're hearing in the ecosystem

418
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,466
like, oh look, we did this, look, we did

419
00:17:14,488 --> 00:17:16,606
this and that all could be meaningful.

420
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:18,734
But at the same time it all collapses

421
00:17:18,782 --> 00:17:20,578
into like, what are we actually doing?

422
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,210
Are we even building anything right now?

423
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,930
What's the point of any of this? And so

424
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,102
a lot of how that kind of shows up in

425
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:30,614
your, like, for example, in a health

426
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:32,118
context that show up in the body is kind

427
00:17:32,124 --> 00:17:33,686
of like illness or this feeling of

428
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,606
agitation and anxiety. And you kind of

429
00:17:35,628 --> 00:17:37,258
have that same embodied feeling both in

430
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,874
yourself and in the organization of

431
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:41,014
like, hey, what we're doing isn't

432
00:17:41,062 --> 00:17:43,066
working. We're having all these

433
00:17:43,168 --> 00:17:46,906
communication kind of issues where

434
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:49,434
there are breakdowns, where you're not

435
00:17:49,472 --> 00:17:51,326
receiving what I'm telling you the

436
00:17:51,348 --> 00:17:52,494
information I'm telling you about

437
00:17:52,532 --> 00:17:54,826
problem isn't being received correctly

438
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:57,694
and acted upon. And this like boils up

439
00:17:57,732 --> 00:17:59,166
to becoming a bigger issue to where

440
00:17:59,188 --> 00:18:01,182
something needs to happen and some

441
00:18:01,236 --> 00:18:03,546
action needs to be taken. And so it's

442
00:18:03,578 --> 00:18:05,874
really like the social process, not

443
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:08,146
something that's like the CEO being

444
00:18:08,168 --> 00:18:10,930
like, wow, let me go in here and figure

445
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,118
out the root issue like a plumber would

446
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:15,286
and then tell the organization what

447
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:17,174
happened. But it's more of this kind of

448
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:19,750
feeling of agitation that happens

449
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,966
throughout the organization and through

450
00:18:22,988 --> 00:18:24,806
this social process being like, what is

451
00:18:24,828 --> 00:18:26,522
going on? What are we doing? People

452
00:18:26,576 --> 00:18:28,806
getting increasingly blustered.

453
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:32,090
Something is birthed in that process and

454
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,306
something that actually had like a

455
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:35,398
personal realization when I was reading

456
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:38,266
this chapter because I used to work as a

457
00:18:38,288 --> 00:18:40,678
strategy consultant and strategy

458
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:42,106
consultant, what I kind of realized

459
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:44,110
about that job is that it's purely about

460
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,646
sense making. So a lot of times people

461
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:47,310
think of strategy consultants as like,

462
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,738
oh, you're doing like a complicated

463
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:51,918
quantitative analysis. You give that to

464
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:53,538
the board of directors, they make a

465
00:18:53,544 --> 00:18:56,162
decision super top down. But actually

466
00:18:56,216 --> 00:18:58,178
where we spent most of our time on was

467
00:18:58,264 --> 00:19:00,578
socialization, like kind of talking to

468
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:02,066
people, like kind of knowing when we

469
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:03,314
went into the organization, like,

470
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:05,334
roughly what was going on in a certain

471
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:07,526
way. We collect data, kept talking to

472
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:09,254
people. But even when we were pretty

473
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:12,102
sure we had the answer, most of the job

474
00:19:12,156 --> 00:19:14,514
was actually framing and communication

475
00:19:14,642 --> 00:19:16,934
and talking to a bunch of people and

476
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:19,114
using the language that they use and

477
00:19:19,152 --> 00:19:20,630
making sure that there is a shared

478
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,066
narrative between everyone. And so that

479
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:24,858
was where the real work is. And I was

480
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,058
like, oh, that's interesting.

481
00:19:26,224 --> 00:19:28,374
Management consultants are professional

482
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:31,358
sense makers. And I think a lot of times

483
00:19:31,444 --> 00:19:32,830
a lot of organizations are actually

484
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,702
embedding management consultants within

485
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,342
the organization as a way of sense

486
00:19:37,396 --> 00:19:40,414
making, as a capability that an

487
00:19:40,452 --> 00:19:43,646
organization would have. And so an

488
00:19:43,668 --> 00:19:44,818
example of something I had as a

489
00:19:44,824 --> 00:19:46,146
agreement consultant where you kind of

490
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:48,898
feel this dissonance was like, I work

491
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:49,890
for a lot like health insurance

492
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,650
companies. And so health disturbance

493
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,730
companies were having this problem where

494
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,886
at least in the US. Skyrocketing

495
00:19:55,918 --> 00:19:57,206
Healthcare Costa and if you're a health

496
00:19:57,228 --> 00:19:58,598
insurance company, you're basically a

497
00:19:58,604 --> 00:19:59,958
payment processor. And so you don't

498
00:19:59,964 --> 00:20:02,566
really have any levers to fix that. And

499
00:20:02,588 --> 00:20:03,942
so there is this issue of like, okay,

500
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:06,598
well, we need training. Costa but we

501
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:09,274
don't have any levers to do that. And so

502
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:10,698
what that means is that you have to

503
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:13,146
become more of, like, a care manager to

504
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:15,814
some extent. And that is a totally

505
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:18,074
different way of textualizing who you

506
00:20:18,112 --> 00:20:19,994
are, both on the organization level and

507
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:22,458
on the individual level of like, what is

508
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:24,846
my purpose here in this role in this

509
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:26,122
organization? What this organization

510
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:28,254
trying to do? And getting to the care

511
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:30,426
management side totally needs to shift

512
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,006
that. And so that shows up in the

513
00:20:33,028 --> 00:20:34,146
organization. That's a lot of

514
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:36,514
dissonance, a lot of angst, and also,

515
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:39,566
like, a lot of pain. And it ends

516
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:41,150
up meaning that both the communication

517
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,594
needs to change, but also this

518
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:44,818
individual needs to change themselves

519
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:45,846
and how they relate to that

520
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:47,126
organization. And so that's why I like

521
00:20:47,148 --> 00:20:48,774
this cartoon of like, I've been

522
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:51,814
restructured a lot of times. It's like

523
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:53,766
you have to recontextualize yourself

524
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:55,126
while so the organization is

525
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:57,226
recontextualizing what it's trying to

526
00:20:57,248 --> 00:21:00,458
do. So, yeah, I'll leave it

527
00:21:00,464 --> 00:21:02,130
there. Daniel and Lewis, do you have

528
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,886
anything to add on the slide? That's

529
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:07,946
very insightful and it reminds me of the

530
00:21:07,968 --> 00:21:11,226
two ways that the entities can reduce

531
00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:13,214
free energy by changing their mind and

532
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:16,062
changing the world through action. And

533
00:21:16,196 --> 00:21:17,646
this is an approach where we can

534
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:19,666
describe that process happening at

535
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:23,570
multiple nested and interacted levels.

536
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,562
And even if the niche changed around

537
00:21:26,616 --> 00:21:29,298
one, the world would be different. The

538
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:30,978
regime of attention would be different,

539
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:32,886
the action perception loop would be

540
00:21:32,908 --> 00:21:34,214
different, and that would, at the very

541
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:37,122
least, induce anxiety and uncertainty.

542
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:39,878
Cognitive niche. It's really interesting

543
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:43,254
what you added, and. I just love your

544
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:44,230
cartoon.

545
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,498
Okay, so here is a claim

546
00:21:50,594 --> 00:21:53,178
from the book, from the chapter. On a

547
00:21:53,184 --> 00:21:55,338
more operational level, sense making

548
00:21:55,424 --> 00:21:57,534
very effectiveness is shaped by three

549
00:21:57,572 --> 00:22:00,202
critical dimensions. First, the clarity

550
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:02,330
of a timeless corporate purpose.

551
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,742
Second, a dissonance centric quest for

552
00:22:05,796 --> 00:22:08,810
and optimization of filtering anomalies

553
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,274
as anomalies become shared sensibleness

554
00:22:11,322 --> 00:22:14,162
should become stronger. And C, an an

555
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:17,474
activist worldview I e environment is

556
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:19,826
not exogenously predetermined, but is

557
00:22:19,848 --> 00:22:21,834
enacted through the social and action

558
00:22:21,902 --> 00:22:25,190
centric construction of shared meaning.

559
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,406
Let's talk about disturbance a little

560
00:22:30,428 --> 00:22:31,000
bit.

561
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,610
Going back to this quote, unless you

562
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,900
guys have comments here. No? Okay, so

563
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,666
fundamentally firm level sensing and

564
00:22:40,688 --> 00:22:42,486
sense making grounded in dissonance

565
00:22:42,518 --> 00:22:44,506
theory are a social process rather than

566
00:22:44,528 --> 00:22:46,906
a singular activity dedicated to

567
00:22:46,928 --> 00:22:48,774
detecting anomalies and I think this

568
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,622
goes back to what Tyler was actually

569
00:22:50,676 --> 00:22:52,798
just talking about. But I looked up,

570
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,954
like the theory and this is the citation

571
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,400
that Bijan used. And in this text,

572
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,386
Festinger says in short, I'm proposing

573
00:23:01,418 --> 00:23:03,478
the dissonance, that is, the existence

574
00:23:03,514 --> 00:23:06,254
of non fitting relations among cognition

575
00:23:06,382 --> 00:23:08,754
is a motivating factor in its own right.

576
00:23:08,872 --> 00:23:10,658
By the term cognition here and in the

577
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:11,826
remainder of the book, I mean any

578
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,606
knowledge, opinion or belief about the

579
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:15,762
environment, oneself or one's behavior.

580
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:17,846
Cognitive dissonance can be seen as an

581
00:23:17,868 --> 00:23:20,214
antecedent condition which leads to

582
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:22,834
activity oriented toward dissonance

583
00:23:22,882 --> 00:23:25,094
reduction, just as hunger leads to

584
00:23:25,132 --> 00:23:27,334
activity oriented toward hunger

585
00:23:27,382 --> 00:23:29,162
reduction. It is a very different

586
00:23:29,216 --> 00:23:30,906
motivation from what psychologists are

587
00:23:30,928 --> 00:23:32,438
used to dealing with, but as we shall

588
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,650
see, nonetheless powerful.

589
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,678
And so when we talk about sensing and

590
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:39,614
sense making being grounded in

591
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:41,374
dissonance theory, this is something

592
00:23:41,412 --> 00:23:44,414
Tyler and I had discussed offline back

593
00:23:44,452 --> 00:23:46,286
channel. We were talking about

594
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:48,746
dissonance theory. And what we're

595
00:23:48,778 --> 00:23:51,186
interpreting this to mean here is that

596
00:23:51,368 --> 00:23:54,690
it is this disjoint activity,

597
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,874
like a mismatch between maybe, like,

598
00:23:57,912 --> 00:24:00,386
individual and firm level cognition or

599
00:24:00,408 --> 00:24:02,786
firm level cognition and societal

600
00:24:02,898 --> 00:24:05,910
expectations or and way there's a gap

601
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,106
that causes like a kind of discomfort

602
00:24:09,218 --> 00:24:12,246
that needs to then be filled. But I

603
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:14,798
would be excited to hear maybe Bijan

604
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:17,594
talk more about how it's grounded in

605
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:21,194
dissonance theory just

606
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:23,946
because it was kind of unclear from the

607
00:24:23,968 --> 00:24:27,398
text, like what exactly that might mean.

608
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:29,262
But if you guys have any comments here

609
00:24:29,316 --> 00:24:33,226
Daniel yeah. Active inference

610
00:24:33,258 --> 00:24:36,622
lab. We might think about dissonance as

611
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:39,334
being related to a divergence, like a KL

612
00:24:39,402 --> 00:24:42,702
divergence. And so dissonance isn't

613
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:45,746
a state of exception and kind of a

614
00:24:45,768 --> 00:24:48,734
binary switch. There's always some non

615
00:24:48,782 --> 00:24:51,858
zero level of emergence between

616
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,898
expectation and incoming sensory data,

617
00:24:55,064 --> 00:24:58,114
if only because the generative model is

618
00:24:58,152 --> 00:25:00,146
coarse grained. So in the decimal

619
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:02,230
points, the world always is going to be

620
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,654
somewhat surprising, or at least

621
00:25:03,692 --> 00:25:07,018
evolution in terms of surprise. So

622
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:09,306
again, instead of centering, for

623
00:25:09,328 --> 00:25:12,202
example, absolute value attainment and

624
00:25:12,256 --> 00:25:14,694
then seeing uncertainty as a secondary

625
00:25:14,742 --> 00:25:17,710
characteristic, we use divergence based

626
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,470
statistics to incorporate this idea of

627
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,578
dissonance or divergence driven behavior

628
00:25:25,754 --> 00:25:27,982
and put that at the center of the

629
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:29,550
imperative for action.

630
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,386
Yeah, I interpreted the John's

631
00:25:35,578 --> 00:25:37,518
Dissonance theory as a way of bridging

632
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:39,138
both the individual cognition to the

633
00:25:39,144 --> 00:25:41,986
social cognition and had a feeling of

634
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:43,890
anxiety manifest in and organization.

635
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,686
And so I think Disney's theory, at least

636
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,414
in this quote, might be referring to the

637
00:25:49,452 --> 00:25:52,486
individual specifically and how that

638
00:25:52,508 --> 00:25:55,302
individual but anxiety of like, hey, I

639
00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:56,694
thought I was going to get a promotion

640
00:25:56,742 --> 00:25:58,666
this year. I didn't get a promotion this

641
00:25:58,688 --> 00:26:01,530
year, something is wrong, or like, hey,

642
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,702
I worked really hard on this feature.

643
00:26:03,846 --> 00:26:06,698
It didn't increase conversions in the

644
00:26:06,704 --> 00:26:09,162
way I thought it would. That feels bad.

645
00:26:09,296 --> 00:26:11,290
That's not motivating for me. Right?

646
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,714
That's like on the individual level.

647
00:26:12,752 --> 00:26:14,078
But then you can there's another way you

648
00:26:14,084 --> 00:26:15,678
can interpret that dissonance on the

649
00:26:15,684 --> 00:26:17,886
more of, like a social level as a way

650
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:19,550
and more of a social cognition.

651
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,528
Cool. All right. Non uniformity.

652
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:31,070
Tyler all right.

653
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,664
It's critical that the environment,

654
00:26:34,712 --> 00:26:36,316
throughput listening to what wants to

655
00:26:36,338 --> 00:26:38,156
emerge, is neither logic nor goal

656
00:26:38,188 --> 00:26:40,128
trapped, but open to non uniformity. In

657
00:26:40,134 --> 00:26:42,076
fact, the throughput of non uniformity

658
00:26:42,108 --> 00:26:44,572
is a measure of firm survivability.

659
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:46,528
Uncertainty and surprise are not to be

660
00:26:46,534 --> 00:26:48,340
avoided, but to be minimized through

661
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,112
action hypothesis testing, centric

662
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:51,956
engagement with the world as the

663
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:54,336
underlying world model. Consequently,

664
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:57,216
and generatively gains an informational

665
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,828
edge. And so we talked about this a

666
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:02,444
little bit during the last bookstream,

667
00:27:02,512 --> 00:27:05,236
but a lot of leaders want to imagine

668
00:27:05,268 --> 00:27:07,272
that they're, like, slowly ironing out

669
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:10,516
non uniformity and that you're creating

670
00:27:10,548 --> 00:27:13,384
this perfect organizational design. And

671
00:27:13,422 --> 00:27:14,836
it's actually kind of funny. There's

672
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:16,348
this trap that a lot of leaders get

673
00:27:16,354 --> 00:27:17,724
into, and I've actually gone into this

674
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:20,424
myself, where it's kind of like utopia

675
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,220
design, almost. Actually, it's exactly

676
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,788
the same thing as Utopia design, where

677
00:27:23,794 --> 00:27:25,004
you're like, I'm going to have this

678
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:27,196
model where all these problems I

679
00:27:27,218 --> 00:27:28,716
perceive in the world I'm just going to

680
00:27:28,738 --> 00:27:31,184
fix by just like top down, just like God

681
00:27:31,222 --> 00:27:33,152
mode figuring it out and then everything

682
00:27:33,206 --> 00:27:34,528
is going to be there and we're not have

683
00:27:34,534 --> 00:27:35,936
to worry about anything anymore. So we

684
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:39,808
create and then invariably you

685
00:27:39,814 --> 00:27:42,016
create a new design, two weeks, and it

686
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:43,956
works for like a week and people are

687
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:45,236
excited about it. And then, like, you

688
00:27:45,258 --> 00:27:46,388
start seeing kind of ripples, ant the

689
00:27:46,394 --> 00:27:47,584
edge. You start, like, trying to patch

690
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:48,884
things up and then it like all

691
00:27:48,922 --> 00:27:51,668
disintegrates. And then, like, I think a

692
00:27:51,674 --> 00:27:52,884
lot of leaders are like, oh, well,

693
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,844
like, you know, people we have the wrong

694
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,776
people. People aren't, you know,

695
00:27:57,818 --> 00:27:59,464
following process, like I want them to,

696
00:27:59,502 --> 00:28:01,240
right? And it gets really frustrating.

697
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,932
But I think even when it goes well,

698
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:06,508
it's just like you were missing out on

699
00:28:06,594 --> 00:28:09,912
kind of, like, how generative

700
00:28:09,976 --> 00:28:13,132
that non uniformity can be and where

701
00:28:13,186 --> 00:28:15,256
basically, like, if people are too rigid

702
00:28:15,288 --> 00:28:17,768
in their process, you're, you know,

703
00:28:17,794 --> 00:28:19,568
you're not carving out space for

704
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:20,770
anything new.

705
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,348
The way that John talks about non

706
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:28,864
uniformity in this case is that you

707
00:28:28,902 --> 00:28:30,384
minimize it through kind of action

708
00:28:30,432 --> 00:28:33,476
oriented hypothesis testing. You're not

709
00:28:33,498 --> 00:28:34,976
like, wallowing in this uncertainty.

710
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:37,156
There's a way that you can capture that

711
00:28:37,178 --> 00:28:39,364
and take ownership over uncertainty and

712
00:28:39,402 --> 00:28:40,708
use it for something that's really

713
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:44,150
beautiful and productive. For example,

714
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,192
I've had jobs where I was a product

715
00:28:47,246 --> 00:28:49,156
analyst and I work for this consumer

716
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:50,824
logistics company where we go into

717
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,776
people's homes and pack up all of their

718
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:54,984
things. So it's like a very complicated

719
00:28:55,112 --> 00:28:58,284
job, right? And so we would figure

720
00:28:58,322 --> 00:29:01,308
things out, like, okay, wow, our times

721
00:29:01,394 --> 00:29:04,140
for this kind of job in the city are

722
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,028
going up a lot. And we would see that in

723
00:29:06,034 --> 00:29:07,216
the data and we're like, wow, this is

724
00:29:07,238 --> 00:29:09,136
really inefficient. And that we would

725
00:29:09,158 --> 00:29:11,136
like, that manifest itself as some kind

726
00:29:11,158 --> 00:29:13,216
of anxiety or dissonance. And then we

727
00:29:13,238 --> 00:29:16,428
would start, we do analysis and we'd

728
00:29:16,444 --> 00:29:17,744
be like, oh, it's this kind of job.

729
00:29:17,782 --> 00:29:18,928
It's this kind of job, this kind of

730
00:29:18,934 --> 00:29:21,228
furniture. Then you talk to people to

731
00:29:21,254 --> 00:29:22,308
talk to some of these movers and you

732
00:29:22,314 --> 00:29:24,004
find out, oh, they don't have the right

733
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:26,964
equipment on this. They don't have this

734
00:29:27,002 --> 00:29:29,408
kind of wrench on these particular jobs.

735
00:29:29,424 --> 00:29:30,836
They're like, that's interesting. Then

736
00:29:30,858 --> 00:29:33,064
you socialize that information, figure

737
00:29:33,102 --> 00:29:35,844
out from operations that that wrench

738
00:29:35,892 --> 00:29:37,960
isn't consistently being returned and

739
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,504
they're actually losing a lot of their

740
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:42,088
equipment to be able to do that job.

741
00:29:42,174 --> 00:29:44,772
Then you find out from other operational

742
00:29:44,836 --> 00:29:46,184
leaders that they're not being funded

743
00:29:46,232 --> 00:29:47,452
appropriately. They don't have

744
00:29:47,506 --> 00:29:49,500
discretional spending to be able to

745
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,356
actually pay for those kinds of that

746
00:29:51,378 --> 00:29:53,276
kind of equipment. Right. So it's like

747
00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:56,496
through that anxiety, you kind of are

748
00:29:56,518 --> 00:29:57,856
action oriented and could figure out,

749
00:29:57,878 --> 00:30:00,450
like, hey, this is not something that

750
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,616
the situation isn't totally screwed. We

751
00:30:03,638 --> 00:30:06,048
can actually keep moving forward and

752
00:30:06,214 --> 00:30:08,256
testing, figuring out what's going on

753
00:30:08,358 --> 00:30:11,556
and taking action accordingly. That

754
00:30:11,578 --> 00:30:14,532
makes me think of pain and soreness and

755
00:30:14,586 --> 00:30:17,764
redness in the body. Like,

756
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:21,272
signals have to propagate in order for

757
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:23,448
things to change. And that could be in

758
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:27,096
an allostatic or an anticipatory or in

759
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:30,664
a reactive or in a traumatized way from

760
00:30:30,702 --> 00:30:33,016
the organism's perspective. But the only

761
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:34,124
way that we're going to find out about

762
00:30:34,162 --> 00:30:35,484
it is through this kind of, like,

763
00:30:35,522 --> 00:30:39,064
active perception. Individuals or nested

764
00:30:39,112 --> 00:30:41,544
levels above them making an action

765
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:43,964
oriented decision to sense out different

766
00:30:44,002 --> 00:30:46,828
information and control attention,

767
00:30:47,004 --> 00:30:49,328
which is actually seen as a policy

768
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,410
selection over cognitive states.

769
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,736
Sorry, my mouth was sticky. I am

770
00:31:00,918 --> 00:31:03,276
also reminded of biological systems,

771
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:05,536
but maybe for a different reason. So in

772
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:09,328
biology, non uniformity is critical to

773
00:31:09,414 --> 00:31:12,736
existence. Like, you have a system of

774
00:31:12,758 --> 00:31:14,432
equilibrium in a biological system,

775
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:18,356
that's death. This non uniformity. And I

776
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:21,684
think he even brings it up as

777
00:31:21,722 --> 00:31:23,236
critical. I don't know if I quoted it

778
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,770
here, but he brings it up as critical to

779
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,196
survival. You have to have non

780
00:31:28,228 --> 00:31:29,624
uniformity. If everything's the same.

781
00:31:29,662 --> 00:31:31,960
It's like dull, bored.

782
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,280
It's so important to have variety.

783
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,390
Variety is the spice of life. Right?

784
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,036
Okay, cool. All right. Purpose. So

785
00:31:43,138 --> 00:31:45,996
purpose and goal directedness. I e. The

786
00:31:46,018 --> 00:31:48,296
forward model, underlying prediction

787
00:31:48,328 --> 00:31:51,212
model is fundamental to sensing and

788
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:53,916
sense making. And like, this is the

789
00:31:53,938 --> 00:31:55,968
forward model underlying model. So I

790
00:31:55,974 --> 00:31:56,928
just wanted to point that out that

791
00:31:56,934 --> 00:31:59,056
there's some nestedness going on here.

792
00:31:59,238 --> 00:32:01,256
Dissonance is a function of a preset

793
00:32:01,308 --> 00:32:03,204
goal. Generating predictions and

794
00:32:03,242 --> 00:32:04,676
submitting those predictions to

795
00:32:04,698 --> 00:32:06,660
continuous error minimization.

796
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,332
Environmental sensing and sense making

797
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,732
are nonsensical in the absence of having

798
00:32:11,786 --> 00:32:14,328
set the firm's existential purpose in

799
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:17,092
the first place. Purpose, not strategy,

800
00:32:17,156 --> 00:32:19,348
is the reason an organization exists.

801
00:32:19,524 --> 00:32:22,264
Its definition and articulation must be

802
00:32:22,302 --> 00:32:24,520
top management's first responsibility.

803
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:29,000
And this reminds me of our agreement

804
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,316
organization in the Active Inference

805
00:32:31,348 --> 00:32:33,484
Institute. Like, what is the purpose of

806
00:32:33,522 --> 00:32:35,836
the institute? And just trying to kind

807
00:32:35,858 --> 00:32:37,916
of outline and. Highlight these key

808
00:32:37,938 --> 00:32:40,716
things. We can't have a strategy without

809
00:32:40,818 --> 00:32:44,016
having a goal. What is that

810
00:32:44,038 --> 00:32:45,648
strategy trying to achieve? What is the

811
00:32:45,654 --> 00:32:47,836
point, right? If you guys have comments

812
00:32:47,868 --> 00:32:51,170
here too, that'd be awesome. Just that

813
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,684
is this meant to be a sentence in one

814
00:32:55,722 --> 00:32:58,084
language or another language? Even in

815
00:32:58,122 --> 00:33:00,580
the same language or a formal language?

816
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,356
It will mean different things to

817
00:33:02,378 --> 00:33:04,116
different people. It will be associated

818
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,012
with different envelopes and portfolios

819
00:33:07,156 --> 00:33:09,684
of risk and positive or negative

820
00:33:09,812 --> 00:33:12,968
consequences, also deemed positive and

821
00:33:12,974 --> 00:33:15,032
negative by a different worldview and

822
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:17,224
contingent upon all these unknown

823
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:21,340
unknowns. So I think amidst that is

824
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:25,310
where we can explore a lot of

825
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,444
interesting experiences, I'm sure, in

826
00:33:28,482 --> 00:33:29,952
what has worked and what hasn't worked

827
00:33:30,006 --> 00:33:32,320
in the applied settings, and then also

828
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:35,456
start to synthesize it with the research

829
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:38,000
on cognitive science and organizational

830
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,624
cognition. And that's, I think, what

831
00:33:40,662 --> 00:33:43,440
this book is about, like moving beyond

832
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,084
just recognizing that complexity and

833
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:49,092
starting to apply active inference and

834
00:33:49,146 --> 00:33:51,268
propose free energy governance as an

835
00:33:51,274 --> 00:33:54,064
approach to step in here and be useful

836
00:33:54,112 --> 00:33:57,796
as well as grounded. Yeah, just to add

837
00:33:57,818 --> 00:34:01,416
on that, I'm curious if John ever

838
00:34:01,438 --> 00:34:02,744
gets to a point in the book where he

839
00:34:02,782 --> 00:34:04,296
really gives some guidelines for

840
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:06,644
thinking through how to design purpose

841
00:34:06,772 --> 00:34:10,804
more explicitly. Because journalists

842
00:34:10,852 --> 00:34:12,844
chaos done extremely poorly, even in

843
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:14,348
major corporations where they're like,

844
00:34:14,434 --> 00:34:17,340
our purpose is like bringing smiles to

845
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:18,716
our consumers or something. Like

846
00:34:18,738 --> 00:34:21,436
something just like super big ambiguity

847
00:34:21,548 --> 00:34:23,664
actually doesn't really help you at all.

848
00:34:23,702 --> 00:34:25,436
It's more of actually like a branding

849
00:34:25,468 --> 00:34:28,236
exercise and more of like a corporate

850
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:30,224
social responsibility, maybe. Not really

851
00:34:30,262 --> 00:34:33,036
anything about purpose. And when purpose

852
00:34:33,068 --> 00:34:35,876
is done well, it's really more like you

853
00:34:35,898 --> 00:34:38,164
guys might disagree with this

854
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:40,068
definition, but I think it's kind of

855
00:34:40,154 --> 00:34:41,508
more like a heuristic. It's like a

856
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:43,556
decision rule of like, we do this and

857
00:34:43,578 --> 00:34:46,336
not this. And it's a way of collapsing

858
00:34:46,448 --> 00:34:48,908
information and just being like, let's

859
00:34:48,944 --> 00:34:50,360
not think through everything we could

860
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,816
possibly be doing right now. Like, we

861
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:53,588
already decided this. This is what we're

862
00:34:53,604 --> 00:34:55,112
doing, and it's a way to not think about

863
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:58,588
things too. And so I found this to

864
00:34:58,594 --> 00:35:00,872
be especially important in decentralized

865
00:35:00,936 --> 00:35:03,708
context as well. And I think this is

866
00:35:03,714 --> 00:35:05,276
kind of what free energy governance is

867
00:35:05,298 --> 00:35:07,404
getting towards, where you have more

868
00:35:07,442 --> 00:35:09,688
bottoms up stimuli that you're

869
00:35:09,704 --> 00:35:11,632
processing and changing these top down

870
00:35:11,686 --> 00:35:13,648
models. And it's really important in

871
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:16,096
that context because you can't be

872
00:35:16,118 --> 00:35:18,604
managing everybody really intensely

873
00:35:18,652 --> 00:35:20,416
saying this is exactly what you have to

874
00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:22,016
do, but rather you have to give a

875
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:24,404
decision rule that a decentralized group

876
00:35:24,442 --> 00:35:27,332
of people can use independently. So

877
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:28,596
especially as we get into more of the

878
00:35:28,618 --> 00:35:30,436
free energy governance kind of world,

879
00:35:30,618 --> 00:35:33,124
purpose is super important. But like

880
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:35,224
Daniel touched on, it's not always

881
00:35:35,262 --> 00:35:37,592
totally clear what a good purpose even

882
00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:40,600
looks like. And I hope John has a very

883
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,904
crisp answer later on for what good

884
00:35:42,942 --> 00:35:46,616
purpose is. So here I

885
00:35:46,638 --> 00:35:49,076
am, the non business person, and Tyler,

886
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:50,696
you said you don't read business books

887
00:35:50,728 --> 00:35:53,276
but I've read more than I ever wanted to

888
00:35:53,298 --> 00:35:56,652
read. My own

889
00:35:56,706 --> 00:36:00,288
little startup side venture. But I read

890
00:36:00,374 --> 00:36:02,864
Jim Collins good to great book and he

891
00:36:02,902 --> 00:36:05,344
really talks about purposes really as

892
00:36:05,382 --> 00:36:07,756
defining what you do and what you don't

893
00:36:07,788 --> 00:36:11,868
do. It kind of affronted me. He talks

894
00:36:11,884 --> 00:36:14,676
about the Fox versus the hedgehog. The

895
00:36:14,698 --> 00:36:17,728
Fox does lots of things very well. He's

896
00:36:17,744 --> 00:36:20,036
very clever and can do many things. And

897
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:22,436
the hedgehog only has one thing. They do

898
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:24,676
one thing, that's it. They roll up into

899
00:36:24,698 --> 00:36:26,304
a ball, right. That's all a hedgehog

900
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:29,684
ever does. And so in this Fox hedgehog

901
00:36:29,732 --> 00:36:32,248
analogy, like as a company, he says you

902
00:36:32,254 --> 00:36:33,624
want to be a hedgehog. And I'm like,

903
00:36:33,662 --> 00:36:35,544
but I want to do so many different

904
00:36:35,582 --> 00:36:37,672
things. But really that having

905
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:39,036
especially when I think about a

906
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:42,204
decentralized thing, we do one thing.

907
00:36:42,322 --> 00:36:44,204
Like I don't know. He talked about many

908
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:46,748
different companies but Wells Fargo as a

909
00:36:46,754 --> 00:36:49,656
bank was a good example. We are creating

910
00:36:49,688 --> 00:36:51,468
the best bank in the United States of

911
00:36:51,474 --> 00:36:53,116
America. We're never banking outside.

912
00:36:53,298 --> 00:36:54,908
Maybe it started regionally and expanded

913
00:36:54,924 --> 00:36:56,368
a little bit or even Southwest. We are

914
00:36:56,374 --> 00:36:57,900
only going to fly in the Southwest.

915
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,016
They just defined one thing that they

916
00:37:00,038 --> 00:37:01,088
were good at that they could just be

917
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:03,344
better than everybody else at and just

918
00:37:03,462 --> 00:37:05,556
ran with that. And that is kind of like

919
00:37:05,578 --> 00:37:07,204
one of the defining factors of a great

920
00:37:07,242 --> 00:37:10,516
company in his view. Yeah, exactly. To

921
00:37:10,538 --> 00:37:12,388
build on that a little bit. It's been a

922
00:37:12,394 --> 00:37:14,276
long time since I read it to great, but

923
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,896
Jim Collins is kind of like the

924
00:37:15,918 --> 00:37:19,096
prototypical top down or what some would

925
00:37:19,118 --> 00:37:22,136
call an orange style of management where

926
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:23,668
it's very achievement oriented. It's

927
00:37:23,684 --> 00:37:26,136
very much about the CEO as being the

928
00:37:26,158 --> 00:37:28,696
hero, forcing their way and telling the

929
00:37:28,718 --> 00:37:30,560
organization what to do and focusing

930
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,004
everybody really intensely. And so when

931
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,488
you talk about the Fox and the hedgehog,

932
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:36,188
it's interesting. He says you want to be

933
00:37:36,194 --> 00:37:37,772
the hedgehog because usually when I hear

934
00:37:37,826 --> 00:37:39,368
people talk about Fox and the hedgehog

935
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:40,528
he's like, you don't want to be the

936
00:37:40,534 --> 00:37:42,384
hedgehog. Like forcing everything into

937
00:37:42,422 --> 00:37:45,584
your narrow world model. And so I

938
00:37:45,622 --> 00:37:47,756
think when he says be the hedgehog,

939
00:37:47,788 --> 00:37:49,792
it's really coming from this top down

940
00:37:49,846 --> 00:37:51,664
perspective and it's really not getting

941
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,856
into the free energy governance model of

942
00:37:53,878 --> 00:37:56,164
like where ideally you want to be both

943
00:37:56,202 --> 00:37:58,132
the Fox and the hedgehog. You really

944
00:37:58,186 --> 00:38:01,636
want to have a unified world model that

945
00:38:01,658 --> 00:38:03,316
you're like, hey, this world model is

946
00:38:03,338 --> 00:38:05,444
like not true by the way. We all know

947
00:38:05,482 --> 00:38:07,328
that this is subject to change and we're

948
00:38:07,344 --> 00:38:09,400
going to be actively changing this, but

949
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,048
we all have to be on the same page. And

950
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:12,724
so we're going to have this somewhat

951
00:38:12,772 --> 00:38:15,416
arbitrary belief of what our purpose is

952
00:38:15,518 --> 00:38:17,108
that we're going to continuously evolve

953
00:38:17,124 --> 00:38:20,412
over time in a fox like manner. And so

954
00:38:20,546 --> 00:38:21,676
that's a really hard thing to

955
00:38:21,698 --> 00:38:24,200
communicate and it's like very subtle

956
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,708
and I've tried to communicate this in

957
00:38:25,714 --> 00:38:27,660
the past often ineffectively.

958
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,792
And so I'm really curious if there's

959
00:38:30,856 --> 00:38:33,196
ways to better combine that fox and

960
00:38:33,218 --> 00:38:34,750
hedgehog model.

961
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,768
Now we're spinning out on a tangent but

962
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:42,016
I just have to say, I don't know, like I

963
00:38:42,038 --> 00:38:45,760
get the whole fox thing. I am very much

964
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:48,784
like aligned mentally with how a fox

965
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,516
type of behavior because I'm just like

966
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:54,020
oh swirl, let me go chase that. But the

967
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,004
hedgehog thing I was thinking like okay,

968
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,068
do you really want to be a fox and a

969
00:38:58,074 --> 00:38:59,512
hedgehog or do you want to be like

970
00:38:59,566 --> 00:39:02,200
multiple hedgehogs? I had this vision of

971
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,896
dropping water on the hedgehog like the

972
00:39:03,918 --> 00:39:05,624
little gremlins and you drop the water

973
00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:07,192
and then they multiply and then you have

974
00:39:07,326 --> 00:39:09,100
a little field of hedgehogs that are all

975
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,484
doing many different things in a very

976
00:39:11,522 --> 00:39:14,556
great way but all siloed and they're one

977
00:39:14,578 --> 00:39:17,804
little thing. Okay, we have to go on or

978
00:39:18,002 --> 00:39:20,030
we can talk about gremlins all day long.

979
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,032
So for heuristics, I mean this actually

980
00:39:24,086 --> 00:39:25,296
fits Hinton purpose because you could

981
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:27,628
think of purpose as a heuristic and I'm

982
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:28,736
not sure if John would agree with that

983
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:31,440
but that's how I think about it. And so

984
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:34,304
read at least his definition was

985
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:35,796
cognitive. Heuristics are a form of

986
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:37,428
cognitive simplification or rules of

987
00:39:37,434 --> 00:39:39,636
thumb and tools empower the human mind.

988
00:39:39,738 --> 00:39:41,984
What the poet John Keats called negative

989
00:39:42,032 --> 00:39:43,764
capability, the ability to survive and

990
00:39:43,802 --> 00:39:47,864
thrive in uncertainty. And so

991
00:39:47,902 --> 00:39:49,764
yeah, there's just a way of collapsing

992
00:39:49,892 --> 00:39:52,024
information overload and finding a way

993
00:39:52,062 --> 00:39:54,452
forward despite not having the ability

994
00:39:54,516 --> 00:39:56,810
to process everything at the same time.

995
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,556
But then John goes on later to say that

996
00:40:00,578 --> 00:40:02,156
heuristics are fundamentally anchor in

997
00:40:02,178 --> 00:40:03,256
the world Dean with environmental

998
00:40:03,288 --> 00:40:05,740
adaptation rather than enactment. So

999
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,496
resolving uncertainty is rather treated

1000
00:40:07,528 --> 00:40:08,816
as a matter of adaptation to and

1001
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:11,216
exogenously determined game. This book

1002
00:40:11,238 --> 00:40:13,488
rejects environmental adaptation as a

1003
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,344
viable survival strategy in a

1004
00:40:15,462 --> 00:40:17,436
perpetually discontinuous oneshot

1005
00:40:17,468 --> 00:40:19,920
interactions environment.

1006
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,656
And so to just illustrate this a little

1007
00:40:24,678 --> 00:40:26,948
bit, obviously I think we could all

1008
00:40:26,954 --> 00:40:28,884
understand like a heuristic may not be

1009
00:40:28,922 --> 00:40:30,164
very good, you could use the wrong

1010
00:40:30,202 --> 00:40:31,636
heuristic and how do you know? But just

1011
00:40:31,658 --> 00:40:33,652
like to make this more concrete about

1012
00:40:33,786 --> 00:40:36,408
how heuristics can be confusing is that

1013
00:40:36,494 --> 00:40:39,380
here are two really common heuristics

1014
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,768
force financial planning, especially in

1015
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:43,944
the context of startups. So one is

1016
00:40:43,982 --> 00:40:46,250
called Default alive and this was from

1017
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,888
Paul Graham, he's the founder of

1018
00:40:48,974 --> 00:40:51,788
Combinator and so he says okay, a

1019
00:40:51,794 --> 00:40:53,308
company should cut costs such that if

1020
00:40:53,314 --> 00:40:55,436
you assume constant revenue growth the

1021
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:56,348
company is going to make it a

1022
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:58,124
profitability with the money it has

1023
00:40:58,162 --> 00:41:00,764
left. And so that totally makes sense

1024
00:41:00,802 --> 00:41:02,830
especially in a startup context where

1025
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,028
extreme uncertainty. But then there's

1026
00:41:06,044 --> 00:41:08,816
like another decision rule which is more

1027
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:11,164
about expected value. So a company

1028
00:41:11,222 --> 00:41:12,416
should choose the financial decision

1029
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,700
with the highest expected value,

1030
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:17,236
expected pay off of outcome X and

1031
00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:19,236
outcome times the likelihood of the

1032
00:41:19,258 --> 00:41:22,976
outcome. And so these aren't necessarily

1033
00:41:23,088 --> 00:41:26,676
incompatible. They can be complexity to

1034
00:41:26,698 --> 00:41:28,296
each other but they could tell you to do

1035
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:30,616
very different things. Especially if

1036
00:41:30,638 --> 00:41:32,456
like an expected value of like hey, we

1037
00:41:32,478 --> 00:41:34,136
can crater the business right now is

1038
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,440
like a 10% likelihood but we can also

1039
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:40,364
90% likely but 10% likelihood we make

1040
00:41:40,562 --> 00:41:43,196
100 billion dollar company, right? And

1041
00:41:43,218 --> 00:41:45,852
so that would lead you to do a different

1042
00:41:45,906 --> 00:41:48,180
thing than default alive. And so a lot

1043
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,204
of times business leaders are juggling

1044
00:41:50,252 --> 00:41:51,904
both of these at the same time and not

1045
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:54,176
necessarily realizing that they are

1046
00:41:54,198 --> 00:41:56,576
contradictory heuristics and that there

1047
00:41:56,598 --> 00:42:00,192
are limits to their heuristic. So yeah,

1048
00:42:00,246 --> 00:42:02,976
I'll leave it there. May I say a couple

1049
00:42:02,998 --> 00:42:05,030
of other things that he says to you that

1050
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,260
simple. Heuristics can outperform more

1051
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:11,248
complicated ones as well. And it's,

1052
00:42:11,264 --> 00:42:12,884
like, actually not even clear on

1053
00:42:12,922 --> 00:42:16,116
organizational level how effective

1054
00:42:16,148 --> 00:42:18,200
heuristics are, because a lot of times

1055
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,344
when they do studies on heuristic with

1056
00:42:20,382 --> 00:42:24,136
individuals where everything is, there

1057
00:42:24,158 --> 00:42:26,680
are not other intelligent actors who are

1058
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,480
making anticipations of that Europe

1059
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,172
strategy. Whereas in a business

1060
00:42:32,226 --> 00:42:34,748
setting, there are. And so to take a

1061
00:42:34,754 --> 00:42:37,644
very simple example of this with design

1062
00:42:37,762 --> 00:42:39,308
there for a long time was this movement

1063
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:41,904
of the heuristic for design was like oh,

1064
00:42:41,942 --> 00:42:44,352
everything needs to be super legible and

1065
00:42:44,406 --> 00:42:47,852
clean. And you would use like helvetica

1066
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:51,104
16 point really. We want this to be

1067
00:42:51,142 --> 00:42:53,756
clear and we want information hierarchy

1068
00:42:53,868 --> 00:42:56,016
and that matters far and above

1069
00:42:56,048 --> 00:42:58,036
everything else. But then the problem is

1070
00:42:58,058 --> 00:43:00,084
that everyone was doing that, and it got

1071
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:01,860
really monotonous. And so the actual

1072
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:03,892
optimal strategy in that case was to

1073
00:43:03,946 --> 00:43:05,876
design something totally wacky and

1074
00:43:05,898 --> 00:43:07,864
insane. And so over the last three

1075
00:43:07,902 --> 00:43:09,832
years, there was like this, especially

1076
00:43:09,886 --> 00:43:12,676
with the web three, just, like, absurd

1077
00:43:12,788 --> 00:43:14,580
looked like they were like GeoCities

1078
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,212
pages from the 90s where it looked awful

1079
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:20,156
and it was not accessible and it was

1080
00:43:20,178 --> 00:43:22,236
gross, but it was really interesting to

1081
00:43:22,258 --> 00:43:24,748
look at. And they were using fonts that

1082
00:43:24,754 --> 00:43:26,972
are totally unreadable, but it was

1083
00:43:27,026 --> 00:43:28,824
interesting, and it was this competitive

1084
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:31,520
situation where the obvious heuristic

1085
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,016
but in a competitive situation made the

1086
00:43:34,038 --> 00:43:35,776
optimal strategy doing the opposite of

1087
00:43:35,798 --> 00:43:38,976
that heuristic. Oh,

1088
00:43:38,998 --> 00:43:40,976
just a few notes, there's so many great

1089
00:43:41,078 --> 00:43:43,388
points. One is the game theory.

1090
00:43:43,564 --> 00:43:47,508
Although bar problem where there's a bar

1091
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:49,732
and you want to go if it's under half

1092
00:43:49,786 --> 00:43:52,004
full, but dot one half full, it's not

1093
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:54,608
fun, you can't get a drink and it turns

1094
00:43:54,624 --> 00:43:57,704
out that that's like an unwinnable game.

1095
00:43:57,902 --> 00:44:00,196
Because if you go well, if it was busy

1096
00:44:00,228 --> 00:44:02,116
yesterday or if it was busy three nights

1097
00:44:02,148 --> 00:44:05,384
ago, all decision rules if you just hold

1098
00:44:05,422 --> 00:44:09,244
to them, get adapted around and

1099
00:44:09,282 --> 00:44:12,156
I think then that's a very interesting

1100
00:44:12,258 --> 00:44:16,380
light to reject environmental adaptation

1101
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,668
as a strategy position of the book

1102
00:44:20,834 --> 00:44:22,368
because I think adapting to the

1103
00:44:22,374 --> 00:44:23,872
environment sounds like something

1104
00:44:23,926 --> 00:44:25,520
biological. It sounds like something

1105
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:26,780
that would be successful

1106
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,488
organizationally. And then I think that

1107
00:44:29,574 --> 00:44:31,876
will also lead us to some discussions of

1108
00:44:31,978 --> 00:44:34,048
how does the free energy minimization

1109
00:44:34,144 --> 00:44:37,488
generative transcend the default alive

1110
00:44:37,584 --> 00:44:40,100
expected value dialectic?

1111
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:51,090
All right, so this is an acronym for

1112
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,210
Volatility, uncertainty, Complexity,

1113
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,226
and Ambiguity. Starts with some

1114
00:44:56,248 --> 00:44:57,419
background on this right now, by the

1115
00:44:57,919 --> 00:45:01,526
way. So I'm just

1116
00:45:01,548 --> 00:45:03,046
reading a quote. This is actually a full

1117
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:04,566
disclosure from my aunt, who's a

1118
00:45:04,588 --> 00:45:06,150
leadership and organizational design

1119
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:09,686
consultant. She wrote this post called

1120
00:45:09,868 --> 00:45:11,526
Explore and Vogue Territory, and I

1121
00:45:11,548 --> 00:45:13,606
really liked how she framed this. Where

1122
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:15,178
most of us in the west were trained in

1123
00:45:15,184 --> 00:45:16,934
the professional model that prize

1124
00:45:16,982 --> 00:45:19,658
expertise. Today, being an expert and a

1125
00:45:19,664 --> 00:45:21,386
specialist is not enough. And worse, it

1126
00:45:21,408 --> 00:45:22,810
can make you part of the problem,

1127
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,618
because today we are dealing with the

1128
00:45:24,624 --> 00:45:26,206
frontiers of humanity, a place where no

1129
00:45:26,228 --> 00:45:28,362
one has been and no one could possibly

1130
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:32,046
be a content expert. And so what I

1131
00:45:32,068 --> 00:45:34,554
really like about this is that we're

1132
00:45:34,602 --> 00:45:36,954
entering this world that is increasingly

1133
00:45:37,002 --> 00:45:39,290
volatile, increasingly ambiguous, but at

1134
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,466
the same time, that really runs up

1135
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,638
against how we're individually motivated

1136
00:45:42,814 --> 00:45:44,354
as professionals, where a lot of us

1137
00:45:44,392 --> 00:45:46,626
really want to get good ant a thing and

1138
00:45:46,728 --> 00:45:49,922
have mastery. And it really requires

1139
00:45:49,986 --> 00:45:51,810
handling this uncertainty complexity

1140
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:54,310
that volatility is like a personal

1141
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,402
discipline as well as an organizational

1142
00:45:56,466 --> 00:45:58,534
discipline. As far as that personal

1143
00:45:58,652 --> 00:46:00,406
resilience, handling that uncertainty

1144
00:46:00,438 --> 00:46:02,714
and complexity is what is going to make

1145
00:46:02,752 --> 00:46:05,526
the organization resilient. And that's

1146
00:46:05,558 --> 00:46:07,914
actually quite hard to build. And it's a

1147
00:46:07,952 --> 00:46:11,930
very rare skill set and

1148
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,298
a lot of it's about one. And I hope you

1149
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,686
like how this graph frame this, of,

1150
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:18,286
like, how well can you predict your

1151
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,854
action and how much do you know about

1152
00:46:19,892 --> 00:46:21,966
the situation? And on both of those

1153
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:25,346
axis, it's becoming increasingly so that

1154
00:46:25,368 --> 00:46:26,786
you know very little about the

1155
00:46:26,808 --> 00:46:28,706
situation. You really can't predict your

1156
00:46:28,728 --> 00:46:34,002
actions, and the ability for

1157
00:46:34,136 --> 00:46:37,234
expertise to really navigate through

1158
00:46:37,272 --> 00:46:39,926
that is much less effective, and it's

1159
00:46:39,948 --> 00:46:41,670
much more about cross function

1160
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:45,558
collaboration. Daniel Bleu do you want

1161
00:46:45,564 --> 00:46:46,920
to take anything on that?

1162
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:52,870
Cool. Okay, I'm going to read this claim

1163
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:55,514
from the book. Generative processes of

1164
00:46:55,552 --> 00:46:58,106
top down, bottom up hypothesis testing I

1165
00:46:58,128 --> 00:47:00,522
e. Prediction error minimization rather

1166
00:47:00,576 --> 00:47:02,986
than top down, rule based simplification

1167
00:47:03,098 --> 00:47:05,166
are guiding the path to navigating a

1168
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:07,118
discontinuous world. I'm just going to

1169
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,920
read these yellow parts. In fact,

1170
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:13,134
rather team uncertainty. In fact,

1171
00:47:13,172 --> 00:47:14,918
heuristics rather Team Uncertainty,

1172
00:47:14,954 --> 00:47:17,826
heuristics reinforce dominant logics in

1173
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:20,126
the form of pattern recognition and tend

1174
00:47:20,158 --> 00:47:23,246
to disregard dissonant bottom up stimuli

1175
00:47:23,278 --> 00:47:25,906
as noise. In fact, heuristics may

1176
00:47:25,928 --> 00:47:27,886
reinforce the phenomenon of deliberate

1177
00:47:27,918 --> 00:47:30,482
ignorance and tame curiosity's.

1178
00:47:30,546 --> 00:47:32,278
Information enriching drive as a

1179
00:47:32,284 --> 00:47:34,146
foundation for prediction error

1180
00:47:34,178 --> 00:47:36,834
minimization. I really liked this quote

1181
00:47:36,882 --> 00:47:38,166
from the book and thought that it kind

1182
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:41,290
of maybe sums up the argument against

1183
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,962
heuristics and also this top down,

1184
00:47:44,016 --> 00:47:46,406
bottom up circular causality that we've

1185
00:47:46,438 --> 00:47:48,410
been discussing through the chapter.

1186
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,562
Daniel a little bit uncertain about

1187
00:47:51,616 --> 00:47:54,806
heuristics for information enrichment

1188
00:47:54,918 --> 00:47:58,318
and epistemic drive cannot be a

1189
00:47:58,484 --> 00:48:02,014
heuristic. If so, would that close

1190
00:48:02,052 --> 00:48:04,874
the loop. So that's like, the reward

1191
00:48:04,922 --> 00:48:06,414
function? I mean, we've had this

1192
00:48:06,452 --> 00:48:07,838
discussion many times, like the

1193
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:09,538
epistemic and pragmatic value when you

1194
00:48:09,544 --> 00:48:10,734
knock out one side of the equation,

1195
00:48:10,782 --> 00:48:12,866
what do you have left? So, yeah, can

1196
00:48:12,888 --> 00:48:15,758
your heuristic merely be info sampling?

1197
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:17,606
I think that that's probably fair, but

1198
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:20,166
yeah, a subtle technical detail,

1199
00:48:20,268 --> 00:48:23,890
probably. Tyler cognitive maps.

1200
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:25,714
All right. Cognitive maps are closely

1201
00:48:25,762 --> 00:48:27,398
related to heuristics and can be

1202
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,270
considered a form of visualizing sense

1203
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,566
making in form of graphic

1204
00:48:30,598 --> 00:48:32,266
representations that locate people in

1205
00:48:32,288 --> 00:48:33,258
relation to their information

1206
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:36,346
environments. Maps provide a frame of

1207
00:48:36,368 --> 00:48:38,490
reference for what is known and what is

1208
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,118
believed. So I've

1209
00:48:42,134 --> 00:48:44,634
actually made a lot of cognitive maps

1210
00:48:44,682 --> 00:48:47,226
myself on various consulting projects.

1211
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:49,466
And what's kind of funny about cognitive

1212
00:48:49,498 --> 00:48:52,062
maps is that they're actually really

1213
00:48:52,116 --> 00:48:54,526
useful to make as the person who is

1214
00:48:54,548 --> 00:48:56,318
making them. As you go through the

1215
00:48:56,324 --> 00:48:57,726
process of making a cognitive map, you

1216
00:48:57,748 --> 00:48:59,486
feel like, I understand the complexity

1217
00:48:59,518 --> 00:49:02,226
of this organization pretty well at this

1218
00:49:02,248 --> 00:49:03,986
point, and I can actually hold it all in

1219
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:06,146
my mind at one time. But the problem

1220
00:49:06,168 --> 00:49:07,970
with that is that there's two problems.

1221
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,998
One is that no one has understands your

1222
00:49:10,024 --> 00:49:11,906
cognitive map at all. It's only useful

1223
00:49:11,938 --> 00:49:13,798
to you. And then the other problem is

1224
00:49:13,804 --> 00:49:16,306
that it basically immediately becomes

1225
00:49:16,338 --> 00:49:18,278
outdated and does not reflect how the

1226
00:49:18,284 --> 00:49:21,154
organization actually works. And so even

1227
00:49:21,212 --> 00:49:23,078
like a month, two months later, it's

1228
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:24,458
like completely useless, even to

1229
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:27,914
yourself. John has a good

1230
00:49:27,952 --> 00:49:30,186
quote of this where he really says that

1231
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:33,014
this cognitive map isn't really useful

1232
00:49:33,062 --> 00:49:34,810
for the purposes of free energy

1233
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,246
governance. So he says, cognitive

1234
00:49:36,278 --> 00:49:37,358
mapping is representative of the

1235
00:49:37,364 --> 00:49:39,166
deterministic view of the world, akin to

1236
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:41,646
a physical cause and effect chain, and

1237
00:49:41,668 --> 00:49:43,418
she should be considered rather ants

1238
00:49:43,434 --> 00:49:45,254
clocked in the face of discontinuous

1239
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:48,274
market environments. So, yeah,

1240
00:49:48,312 --> 00:49:49,998
it's really not something that you're

1241
00:49:50,014 --> 00:49:54,274
going to be able to fully map out how

1242
00:49:54,312 --> 00:49:56,398
governance works or how an organization

1243
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,498
works. This is actually something that

1244
00:49:58,504 --> 00:49:59,862
I've been thinking a lot about for the

1245
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:01,766
past couple of months in the context of

1246
00:50:01,788 --> 00:50:04,294
dows, of like, can you model the flow of

1247
00:50:04,332 --> 00:50:07,766
value and power completely within an

1248
00:50:07,788 --> 00:50:10,726
organization as code? And I think what

1249
00:50:10,828 --> 00:50:13,494
John would say is probably not it's not

1250
00:50:13,532 --> 00:50:16,418
fully like this deterministic model of

1251
00:50:16,444 --> 00:50:18,490
cause and effects. It's really something

1252
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,290
more of a social process that's a little

1253
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,586
bit more ambiguity and fluffy and hard

1254
00:50:22,608 --> 00:50:25,146
to nail down. Daniel Bleu, do you have

1255
00:50:25,168 --> 00:50:28,742
anything to add here? So,

1256
00:50:28,896 --> 00:50:30,954
on the one hand, I don't know cognitive

1257
00:50:31,002 --> 00:50:32,526
maps. Like, when I was taught about them

1258
00:50:32,548 --> 00:50:34,046
in college, they made no sense to me. I

1259
00:50:34,068 --> 00:50:35,118
hated them. I was like, this is the

1260
00:50:35,124 --> 00:50:36,606
dumbest thing I've ever heard of. But

1261
00:50:36,628 --> 00:50:39,234
then when you get into process flow in

1262
00:50:39,272 --> 00:50:42,194
writing code and in system design, they

1263
00:50:42,232 --> 00:50:44,446
kind of make sense, like an experimental

1264
00:50:44,478 --> 00:50:46,626
design chart. So I don't know, I'm back

1265
00:50:46,648 --> 00:50:48,326
and forth on the can you read your own

1266
00:50:48,428 --> 00:50:51,746
cognitive map? Sometimes I would argue

1267
00:50:51,778 --> 00:50:52,774
that if you can't read your own

1268
00:50:52,812 --> 00:50:54,598
cognitive map that it's not a good one.

1269
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:55,640
How about that?

1270
00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:00,550
Okay. Claim. Okay.

1271
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:03,030
It is neuroscience's predictive coding

1272
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:04,982
that allows us to take management

1273
00:51:05,046 --> 00:51:07,142
researches, sense making, perspective,

1274
00:51:07,206 --> 00:51:09,146
as well as nexus of structure and

1275
00:51:09,168 --> 00:51:11,658
cognition. One step further to provide a

1276
00:51:11,664 --> 00:51:13,398
more complete and relevant framework

1277
00:51:13,494 --> 00:51:15,342
force applying sensing and sense making

1278
00:51:15,396 --> 00:51:17,498
in the concept of strategic renewal.

1279
00:51:17,594 --> 00:51:19,342
Effectively, sensing and sense making

1280
00:51:19,396 --> 00:51:21,402
are empowered by the circular causality

1281
00:51:21,466 --> 00:51:23,354
between top down knowledge structures,

1282
00:51:23,482 --> 00:51:24,922
prediction models, predictions,

1283
00:51:24,986 --> 00:51:27,294
hypotheses and guesses, and bottom up

1284
00:51:27,332 --> 00:51:29,230
stimuli data stemming from resource

1285
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:31,570
markets. I just thought it was important

1286
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,898
to include this claim here. I feel like

1287
00:51:32,904 --> 00:51:35,698
it sums up a lot of what is written in

1288
00:51:35,704 --> 00:51:39,462
this chapter. Okay, so we'll talk

1289
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:42,178
a little bit about active reasoning.

1290
00:51:42,354 --> 00:51:45,030
And this picture on the left shows like

1291
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,126
inductive reasoning, which is like,

1292
00:51:47,148 --> 00:51:49,854
when you have a specific observation,

1293
00:51:50,002 --> 00:51:53,546
you come to a general conclusion about

1294
00:51:53,728 --> 00:51:56,906
that specific observation. Like,

1295
00:51:57,008 --> 00:52:00,634
if you see three men wearing white

1296
00:52:00,672 --> 00:52:04,266
shirts in a room, and then

1297
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:05,694
you might say, like, oh, all the men

1298
00:52:05,732 --> 00:52:07,118
wear white shirts, but it might just be

1299
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,822
a coincidence, right? And then like

1300
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:12,926
deductive reasoning, where you have a

1301
00:52:12,948 --> 00:52:15,806
general rule and you come to a specific

1302
00:52:15,908 --> 00:52:18,026
conclusion, like, you know, all the men

1303
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:20,402
have to be wearing white shirts in this

1304
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:23,186
situation. And so you conclude that the

1305
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:24,674
men in this room will be wearing white

1306
00:52:24,712 --> 00:52:27,166
shirts. So that's like a deductive

1307
00:52:27,198 --> 00:52:28,562
reasoning. And then you have this

1308
00:52:28,616 --> 00:52:30,342
abductive reasoning where you have this

1309
00:52:30,396 --> 00:52:32,710
incomplete observation where you see

1310
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,962
some of the men in the room wearing

1311
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,694
white shirts and you don't know anything

1312
00:52:36,732 --> 00:52:39,814
about the rules. You have this

1313
00:52:39,852 --> 00:52:41,706
incomplete observation and you make your

1314
00:52:41,728 --> 00:52:42,730
best prediction.

1315
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,514
I guess some percentage of the men here

1316
00:52:47,552 --> 00:52:49,066
like to wear white or something like

1317
00:52:49,088 --> 00:52:51,590
that. So this incomplete observation

1318
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:53,434
coming to this best prediction, I

1319
00:52:53,472 --> 00:52:55,086
probably did a horrible job at specific

1320
00:52:55,188 --> 00:52:56,526
examples, but those were just like,

1321
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:59,386
sorry, off the top of my head. So that's

1322
00:52:59,418 --> 00:53:02,362
like this reasoning logic and a quote

1323
00:53:02,426 --> 00:53:04,794
from the text abductive reasoning

1324
00:53:04,842 --> 00:53:06,598
usually begins with a surprising

1325
00:53:06,634 --> 00:53:08,914
observation or experience. This is what

1326
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:11,026
shatters our habit and motivates us to

1327
00:53:11,048 --> 00:53:13,278
create a hypothesis that might resolve

1328
00:53:13,294 --> 00:53:15,886
the anomaly. Abduction is an inferential

1329
00:53:15,918 --> 00:53:17,398
procedure in which we create a

1330
00:53:17,404 --> 00:53:19,320
conjecture that if it were,

1331
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:23,046
would make the surprising anomaly part

1332
00:53:23,068 --> 00:53:24,726
of our normal understanding of the

1333
00:53:24,748 --> 00:53:28,082
world. So I liked this idea of linking

1334
00:53:28,146 --> 00:53:31,866
action to surprise. And I just wanted to

1335
00:53:31,888 --> 00:53:35,606
point out the Livestream

1336
00:53:35,638 --> 00:53:38,410
number 47 about active coherence and

1337
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,386
abduction. And we discussed more than

1338
00:53:41,408 --> 00:53:43,680
one paper in this live stream. So just

1339
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,446
to read a quick quote from this specific

1340
00:53:46,548 --> 00:53:51,850
paper. This paper. It's Piataran.

1341
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,866
I probably butchered that. And Majid

1342
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,770
Beni, and I think Majid was on that

1343
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,354
stream with us. And this paper says,

1344
00:53:58,552 --> 00:54:01,474
the focus is on the allegiance between

1345
00:54:01,512 --> 00:54:03,934
the nomenclatures of active and active

1346
00:54:03,982 --> 00:54:06,482
inference as the proper place to begin

1347
00:54:06,536 --> 00:54:08,662
reaching at the wider target. The paper

1348
00:54:08,716 --> 00:54:11,314
outlines key concept elements involved

1349
00:54:11,362 --> 00:54:13,346
in a naturalistic rendering of Pierce's

1350
00:54:13,378 --> 00:54:15,542
late semiotic and logical notion of

1351
00:54:15,596 --> 00:54:18,166
abductive reasoning and targeting a

1352
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:20,626
cognitive biological model of abduction

1353
00:54:20,738 --> 00:54:22,802
which preserves the functional integrity

1354
00:54:22,866 --> 00:54:24,658
of an organism and fulfills the

1355
00:54:24,684 --> 00:54:26,886
existential imperative for living beings

1356
00:54:26,918 --> 00:54:30,090
evidence of existence. And this paper

1357
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,006
was awesome. Like totally mind blowing.

1358
00:54:32,038 --> 00:54:34,074
And I can't do it justice in like the 5

1359
00:54:34,112 --> 00:54:35,514
minutes or whatever time we have here.

1360
00:54:35,552 --> 00:54:37,054
So if you want to learn more about

1361
00:54:37,092 --> 00:54:38,366
abduction and the Relationship Active

1362
00:54:38,388 --> 00:54:40,366
Inference lab, I suggest go check out

1363
00:54:40,388 --> 00:54:42,240
this live stream or read this paper.

1364
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,878
Unless you guys have comments here, you

1365
00:54:44,884 --> 00:54:47,378
can move on forward. Yes. One comment on

1366
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,858
that is that I found it really

1367
00:54:50,024 --> 00:54:52,306
challenging often to in an

1368
00:54:52,328 --> 00:54:54,674
organizational context to toggle between

1369
00:54:54,872 --> 00:54:57,006
inductive deductive and abductive

1370
00:54:57,038 --> 00:54:58,962
reasoning where it's like a lot of times

1371
00:54:59,016 --> 00:55:00,386
people get confused which kind of

1372
00:55:00,408 --> 00:55:01,906
reasoning you're actually using. And if

1373
00:55:01,928 --> 00:55:03,174
you do something that is kind of more

1374
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:05,446
adaptive, like, hey, here's what I'm

1375
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,234
seeing, here's my best guess, throwing

1376
00:55:07,282 --> 00:55:08,966
things, ant the wall. Then you get

1377
00:55:08,988 --> 00:55:10,278
tracking these things like, well, how do

1378
00:55:10,284 --> 00:55:12,498
you really know that's true? And you're

1379
00:55:12,514 --> 00:55:14,646
like, yeah, that's the point. I don't

1380
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:16,906
know that's true. But we're really just

1381
00:55:16,928 --> 00:55:18,346
trying to like this is a creative act

1382
00:55:18,368 --> 00:55:20,778
we're doing together of trying to come

1383
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:24,106
up with some hypothesis. This is a

1384
00:55:24,128 --> 00:55:25,638
really specialized skill set and it's

1385
00:55:25,654 --> 00:55:29,446
like quite hard and funny. In the book,

1386
00:55:29,488 --> 00:55:30,686
I don't think we pulled this quote out.

1387
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:32,206
I almost did, but I was like, how do you

1388
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:34,058
be but like, Bijan. I don't know if he's

1389
00:55:34,074 --> 00:55:35,918
quoting someone else or he just says

1390
00:55:36,084 --> 00:55:37,534
objective reasoning is like, any

1391
00:55:37,572 --> 00:55:40,400
hypothesis is good enough, whatever.

1392
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:42,434
It's just kind of like, I don't know,

1393
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,738
shooting arrows in the dark. It kind of

1394
00:55:44,744 --> 00:55:45,986
made it sound like that. But there

1395
00:55:46,008 --> 00:55:48,082
actually can be quite a bit of art and

1396
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,550
science to abductive reasoning.

1397
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:55,334
Okay, cool. So John lays out a few

1398
00:55:55,372 --> 00:55:56,998
different frameworks for thinking about

1399
00:55:57,084 --> 00:55:58,850
collective sense making and specifically

1400
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,566
how you connect different levels of the

1401
00:56:00,588 --> 00:56:02,186
hierarchy together. Like sense making,

1402
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:04,806
it one of the individual and leveling

1403
00:56:04,838 --> 00:56:06,874
that up through organizational sense

1404
00:56:06,912 --> 00:56:10,074
making. And so he talks about these like

1405
00:56:10,112 --> 00:56:11,722
six different models of collective sense

1406
00:56:11,776 --> 00:56:13,914
making and wasn't necessarily saying

1407
00:56:13,952 --> 00:56:16,026
like, hey, I am fully behind each of one

1408
00:56:16,048 --> 00:56:17,214
of these, but he's more just talking

1409
00:56:17,252 --> 00:56:20,206
about prior work and how to think about

1410
00:56:20,308 --> 00:56:22,046
the gaps of how they line up to free

1411
00:56:22,068 --> 00:56:23,502
energy governance. So let's go through

1412
00:56:23,556 --> 00:56:26,320
each one of them. The four I model.

1413
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:31,166
So the four eye models, this is the

1414
00:56:31,268 --> 00:56:33,230
intuitive interpreting, integrating,

1415
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:35,986
and institutionalizing. And so this is

1416
00:56:36,008 --> 00:56:37,486
really thinking about how sensing flows

1417
00:56:37,518 --> 00:56:38,854
through the individual level and then

1418
00:56:38,892 --> 00:56:40,566
bubbles up through different levels of

1419
00:56:40,588 --> 00:56:42,134
socialization up and through

1420
00:56:42,252 --> 00:56:45,174
institutionalization. So Crossings for

1421
00:56:45,212 --> 00:56:46,786
iModel, intuitive interpreting,

1422
00:56:46,818 --> 00:56:48,806
integrating, and Institutionalizing as

1423
00:56:48,828 --> 00:56:50,226
applied to the context of strategic

1424
00:56:50,258 --> 00:56:52,326
renewal provides a framework for the

1425
00:56:52,348 --> 00:56:53,946
process of transmorphing individual

1426
00:56:54,048 --> 00:56:56,346
sensing and sense making cognition to

1427
00:56:56,368 --> 00:56:58,774
firm level strategic action, intuiting

1428
00:56:58,822 --> 00:57:00,858
and interpreting. A hypothesis starts at

1429
00:57:00,864 --> 00:57:02,486
the individual level and subsequently

1430
00:57:02,518 --> 00:57:04,570
the interpretation, sense making process

1431
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,022
becomes socialized, integrated and

1432
00:57:07,076 --> 00:57:10,926
institutionalized at the firm level.

1433
00:57:11,108 --> 00:57:14,622
And so this whole process is

1434
00:57:14,676 --> 00:57:16,640
goal directed. It's not just taking

1435
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:19,086
bombs of stimuli and then somehow

1436
00:57:19,118 --> 00:57:20,980
magically transforming it into

1437
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:23,714
institutional processes. It is really

1438
00:57:23,752 --> 00:57:26,100
goal directed and hypothesis driven of

1439
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:30,246
really inactive and saying, hey, this is

1440
00:57:30,428 --> 00:57:31,974
what we believe about the world and

1441
00:57:32,012 --> 00:57:34,520
seeing this is actually the case.

1442
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:38,342
And I think the John has an interesting

1443
00:57:38,396 --> 00:57:40,358
point about the score. I model that a

1444
00:57:40,364 --> 00:57:42,726
lot of times organizations really don't

1445
00:57:42,758 --> 00:57:45,210
view themselves as being active creators

1446
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:49,050
of their world are really especially

1447
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,794
when you coherence up like the board

1448
00:57:50,912 --> 00:57:52,294
view themselves as more passive

1449
00:57:52,342 --> 00:57:55,246
receptacles of information. And so this

1450
00:57:55,268 --> 00:57:57,726
whole process of sense making from the

1451
00:57:57,748 --> 00:57:59,354
individual level to the organizational

1452
00:57:59,402 --> 00:58:01,742
level is really like an active process

1453
00:58:01,796 --> 00:58:03,600
driven especially driven by the board.

1454
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:05,938
Bleu or Daniel, do you have anything to

1455
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:06,900
add here?

1456
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:12,386
All right, tension based view. So,

1457
00:58:12,488 --> 00:58:13,826
attention based view. This is another

1458
00:58:13,928 --> 00:58:16,146
model that is similarly connecting both

1459
00:58:16,168 --> 00:58:18,754
the individual level of cognition to the

1460
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:20,619
institutional level. It just has like a

1461
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,054
different spit on it and different

1462
00:58:22,172 --> 00:58:25,320
emphasis. And so in this model,

1463
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:27,398
the idea is that you need attention to

1464
00:58:27,404 --> 00:58:29,174
make decisions, like, you need to put

1465
00:58:29,212 --> 00:58:31,046
some focus and energy to make a

1466
00:58:31,068 --> 00:58:33,894
decision, but individuals and

1467
00:58:33,932 --> 00:58:35,874
consequently firms, have limited

1468
00:58:35,922 --> 00:58:38,018
attention. So this is just like the

1469
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:39,542
fundamental constraint on your ability

1470
00:58:39,606 --> 00:58:41,306
to Markov decision is that you just

1471
00:58:41,328 --> 00:58:43,814
don't have the time or energy to devote

1472
00:58:43,862 --> 00:58:47,550
to every single decision. And so

1473
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,806
your individual cognition is

1474
00:58:49,828 --> 00:58:51,278
constrained. And because your individual

1475
00:58:51,364 --> 00:58:53,822
cognition is constrained, so your social

1476
00:58:53,876 --> 00:58:55,202
cognition and like, that social

1477
00:58:55,256 --> 00:58:56,722
cognition is shaped by different

1478
00:58:56,856 --> 00:58:59,022
factors. That is like, social factors,

1479
00:58:59,086 --> 00:59:01,918
cultural factors, economic factors,

1480
00:59:02,094 --> 00:59:05,262
and that social cognition, those forces

1481
00:59:05,326 --> 00:59:07,534
that shape like, situational context

1482
00:59:07,662 --> 00:59:11,298
that shape your social cognition, those

1483
00:59:11,384 --> 00:59:13,618
manifests and are institutionalized in

1484
00:59:13,704 --> 00:59:15,734
the organizational cognition and that

1485
00:59:15,772 --> 00:59:18,294
is, like, rules the positions, the

1486
00:59:18,332 --> 00:59:20,698
players and the resources. So if you

1487
00:59:20,704 --> 00:59:23,142
guys are familiar with Eleanor Ostrom's

1488
00:59:23,206 --> 00:59:26,620
model of thinking about kind of how

1489
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:30,186
common resource organizations develop,

1490
00:59:30,368 --> 00:59:31,722
it's kind of like the same exact

1491
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:35,646
framework that she uses. So this

1492
00:59:35,668 --> 00:59:36,910
is very consistent with free energy

1493
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,814
governance, though it doesn't really

1494
00:59:39,012 --> 00:59:43,034
capture that active process of reality

1495
00:59:43,082 --> 00:59:45,186
construction. It's much more about just

1496
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:46,898
like, thinking about attention and how

1497
00:59:46,904 --> 00:59:48,178
that bubbles up to different levels of

1498
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:51,358
the hierarchy. Bleu.

1499
00:59:51,374 --> 00:59:54,082
Daniel. Anything out here? All right.

1500
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:57,906
Dynamic capability view. So the

1501
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,606
aim of dynamic capabilities research is

1502
00:59:59,628 --> 01:00:01,414
ambitious to understand how firms can

1503
01:00:01,452 --> 01:00:03,766
sustain a competitive advantage by

1504
01:00:03,788 --> 01:00:05,506
responding to and creating environment

1505
01:00:05,538 --> 01:00:08,726
change. This is from Help At, who is one

1506
01:00:08,748 --> 01:00:11,260
of the main components of this type of

1507
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:14,506
Dynamic Capability View. They also go on

1508
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:17,898
to say that dynamic capabilities are the

1509
01:00:17,904 --> 01:00:19,146
capacity of an organization to

1510
01:00:19,168 --> 01:00:22,570
purposefully create, extend and modify

1511
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:26,894
its resource base. So this is very

1512
01:00:26,932 --> 01:00:29,440
consistent with how I learned about

1513
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:33,278
organizational design and evolution in

1514
01:00:33,364 --> 01:00:35,662
a business school. It's much more about

1515
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:38,526
like, hey, we have these kinds of

1516
01:00:38,548 --> 01:00:39,918
resources kind of like the sellers of

1517
01:00:39,924 --> 01:00:41,394
the data model almost like we have these

1518
01:00:41,432 --> 01:00:43,538
resources and these constraints in our

1519
01:00:43,544 --> 01:00:45,874
environment and this is like how we can

1520
01:00:45,912 --> 01:00:47,714
extend that resource base and grow over

1521
01:00:47,752 --> 01:00:50,018
time. And it has a little more like a

1522
01:00:50,024 --> 01:00:53,746
deterministic bent to it and

1523
01:00:53,768 --> 01:00:55,158
it's about like how you survive in a

1524
01:00:55,164 --> 01:00:57,478
quickly changing environment. So in that

1525
01:00:57,484 --> 01:00:58,950
sense it's like similar to free energy

1526
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,686
governance but it's really more about

1527
01:01:01,788 --> 01:01:03,858
strategic change. It's not really about

1528
01:01:03,964 --> 01:01:06,038
the individual cognition. It doesn't

1529
01:01:06,054 --> 01:01:07,018
really talk much about individual

1530
01:01:07,104 --> 01:01:10,186
cognition at all. So it's like an

1531
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,138
interesting theoretical framework but

1532
01:01:12,144 --> 01:01:15,854
it's not really as

1533
01:01:15,892 --> 01:01:18,320
embodied as free energy governance and

1534
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:21,054
it's missing that relationship to the

1535
01:01:21,092 --> 01:01:25,146
individual. Bleu Daniel,

1536
01:01:25,178 --> 01:01:27,760
anything to add here? All right,

1537
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:33,486
so OKRs are objectives and key results.

1538
01:01:33,518 --> 01:01:36,786
So the idea here is that you have a gain

1539
01:01:36,888 --> 01:01:38,402
so at every single level of the

1540
01:01:38,456 --> 01:01:40,802
hierarchy. So let's say that your

1541
01:01:40,856 --> 01:01:43,550
company top level of the hierarchy will

1542
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,270
just use this examples on the slide.

1543
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:46,998
You're the head of the brand, you want

1544
01:01:47,004 --> 01:01:49,640
to get 1000 new sign ups, right? That is

1545
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,546
your objective is increasing brand

1546
01:01:54,578 --> 01:01:56,266
activations and the key result like the

1547
01:01:56,288 --> 01:01:58,026
quantitative way you measure that is get

1548
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:00,138
1000 new sign ups, right? So that's at

1549
01:02:00,144 --> 01:02:01,418
the top level of the organization and

1550
01:02:01,424 --> 01:02:02,886
then in each level of the hierarchy

1551
01:02:02,918 --> 01:02:05,126
below that you have the sub components

1552
01:02:05,158 --> 01:02:07,406
that would need to be true to get 1000

1553
01:02:07,508 --> 01:02:09,838
new sign ups, right? So the things that

1554
01:02:09,844 --> 01:02:11,646
would need to be true to get 1000 new

1555
01:02:11,668 --> 01:02:14,878
sign ups are that one you have to on the

1556
01:02:14,884 --> 01:02:16,474
head of content, you have to get your

1557
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:19,230
click through rate above some threshold,

1558
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:22,594
implement 1012 new mediums post old or

1559
01:02:22,632 --> 01:02:25,026
new content. On the partnership side you

1560
01:02:25,048 --> 01:02:27,794
have to get 10,000 event registers by

1561
01:02:27,832 --> 01:02:28,980
some date, right?

1562
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:34,914
So it's basically a way of thinking

1563
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:37,478
about like how goals cascade from the

1564
01:02:37,484 --> 01:02:39,074
top level of the organization and filter

1565
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:41,100
down through the other level.

1566
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:46,970
Sorry about that. Very persistent.

1567
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:50,198
And so this is actually really popular

1568
01:02:50,294 --> 01:02:51,914
in a like especially like the tech

1569
01:02:51,952 --> 01:02:54,334
world. This is pioneered by like John

1570
01:02:54,372 --> 01:02:57,342
Dor. Larry Page wrote this book about

1571
01:02:57,476 --> 01:02:59,198
measure called Measure What Matters and

1572
01:02:59,204 --> 01:03:00,798
it's about like a quantum tattoo way of

1573
01:03:00,804 --> 01:03:03,326
thinking about organizational design and

1574
01:03:03,428 --> 01:03:06,974
goal setting. And so I've actually done

1575
01:03:07,012 --> 01:03:09,262
this a lot at different organizations

1576
01:03:09,406 --> 01:03:11,458
and it can be powerful and I think the

1577
01:03:11,464 --> 01:03:15,090
genre really likes it. He says OKRs have

1578
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,754
proven to be invaluable and dynamic tool

1579
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:19,282
to foster formal exchanges at the field

1580
01:03:19,336 --> 01:03:21,406
level of resource markets approximating

1581
01:03:21,518 --> 01:03:23,718
self organization. Because each level of

1582
01:03:23,724 --> 01:03:26,774
the hierarchy has the responsibility for

1583
01:03:26,812 --> 01:03:28,966
themselves to set their own OKR that

1584
01:03:28,988 --> 01:03:30,610
aligns with the next level of the

1585
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,794
hierarchy, right? So it can be really

1586
01:03:32,832 --> 01:03:36,234
dynamic and have that self

1587
01:03:36,432 --> 01:03:39,450
organizing quality. However, a problem

1588
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,162
with it, and this is not something that

1589
01:03:41,216 --> 01:03:42,666
John brought up, this is something from

1590
01:03:42,688 --> 01:03:45,998
my own experience is that especially in

1591
01:03:46,004 --> 01:03:47,822
a startup context, things are moving so

1592
01:03:47,876 --> 01:03:51,166
quickly that OKRs very often

1593
01:03:51,268 --> 01:03:52,766
become outdated pretty much. Like

1594
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:54,586
immediately. And so you'll set an OKR

1595
01:03:54,618 --> 01:03:56,334
for a quarter and then you're a month

1596
01:03:56,372 --> 01:03:58,646
down the line and so much has changed,

1597
01:03:58,698 --> 01:04:01,474
the context is so different that this

1598
01:04:01,512 --> 01:04:04,306
OKR obviously doesn't matter anymore and

1599
01:04:04,328 --> 01:04:06,354
that's a huge problem. And so you need

1600
01:04:06,392 --> 01:04:08,206
some way of changing your OKRs

1601
01:04:08,238 --> 01:04:10,398
dynamically. But the problem is that

1602
01:04:10,424 --> 01:04:12,966
OKRs take a lot of work to set up and to

1603
01:04:12,988 --> 01:04:16,166
socialize and to measure and so

1604
01:04:16,188 --> 01:04:18,066
then you really don't have the resources

1605
01:04:18,098 --> 01:04:20,378
necessarily to do that and that is a

1606
01:04:20,384 --> 01:04:23,674
huge challenge. There's also huge issues

1607
01:04:23,712 --> 01:04:26,954
with doing OKRs and that it's like some

1608
01:04:26,992 --> 01:04:30,938
version of good ants law where your

1609
01:04:30,944 --> 01:04:32,298
measure becomes a target, it ceases to

1610
01:04:32,304 --> 01:04:34,798
be a good measure. Whereas these

1611
01:04:34,964 --> 01:04:36,734
different levels of the organization can

1612
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:39,850
over optimize for some arbitrary metric

1613
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:42,766
that they need to get a promotion which

1614
01:04:42,788 --> 01:04:43,918
sometimes that can be aligned with the

1615
01:04:43,924 --> 01:04:46,074
organization, but in quickly changing

1616
01:04:46,122 --> 01:04:49,374
environments it can become quickly not

1617
01:04:49,412 --> 01:04:51,006
aligned with what the organization

1618
01:04:51,198 --> 01:04:54,626
actually needs. So there's a lot

1619
01:04:54,648 --> 01:04:56,926
of pushback for OKRs right now it's

1620
01:04:56,958 --> 01:05:00,434
unclear. I think there's probably some

1621
01:05:00,472 --> 01:05:02,546
formulation of OKRs that's more dynamic

1622
01:05:02,578 --> 01:05:04,870
and more responsive to bottom up stimuli

1623
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:09,158
but they can

1624
01:05:09,164 --> 01:05:11,786
be really hard to operationalize but

1625
01:05:11,808 --> 01:05:14,006
theoretically amazing way of connecting

1626
01:05:14,198 --> 01:05:15,574
different levels of the communication.

1627
01:05:15,702 --> 01:05:17,738
Christ all right, different levels of

1628
01:05:17,744 --> 01:05:20,826
the organization. All right,

1629
01:05:20,848 --> 01:05:22,054
let's go to the next one. Collaborative

1630
01:05:22,102 --> 01:05:26,014
intelligence. So the drive for self

1631
01:05:26,052 --> 01:05:27,818
organizing mechanisms gradually moved

1632
01:05:27,834 --> 01:05:29,546
from employee empowerment and cognitive

1633
01:05:29,578 --> 01:05:31,514
intelligence in form of crowdsourcing

1634
01:05:31,562 --> 01:05:32,846
deploying the journey of the power of

1635
01:05:32,868 --> 01:05:34,926
information technologies to tap into the

1636
01:05:34,948 --> 01:05:37,486
collective knowledge base to

1637
01:05:37,508 --> 01:05:38,990
collaborative intelligence. CQ

1638
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:40,946
emphasizing the need for a shift in the

1639
01:05:40,968 --> 01:05:42,178
leadership model from having all the

1640
01:05:42,184 --> 01:05:44,450
answers to raising the right questions.

1641
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,014
As digital tools are increasingly

1642
01:05:46,062 --> 01:05:47,746
deployed to enable goal directed

1643
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:49,158
intelligence deliberations and

1644
01:05:49,164 --> 01:05:52,070
distributed multi intelligence systems.

1645
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:55,958
And so to think about what this actually

1646
01:05:56,044 --> 01:05:59,298
means, like in practice oftentimes it's

1647
01:05:59,314 --> 01:06:01,062
not the case where it's like you have

1648
01:06:01,116 --> 01:06:03,706
some really huge robust system where

1649
01:06:03,728 --> 01:06:05,242
every person in the organization is

1650
01:06:05,296 --> 01:06:07,626
seamlessly sharing their insights and

1651
01:06:07,648 --> 01:06:09,658
their data. That's not really how it

1652
01:06:09,664 --> 01:06:12,262
works. It much more works that it's like

1653
01:06:12,416 --> 01:06:14,574
you have specialized sense makers within

1654
01:06:14,612 --> 01:06:17,518
the organization and consistent ways of

1655
01:06:17,524 --> 01:06:19,838
processing data and sharing that data.

1656
01:06:19,924 --> 01:06:22,446
So, for example, you'll have, like, an

1657
01:06:22,468 --> 01:06:26,238
It team. They have, like,

1658
01:06:26,244 --> 01:06:29,006
a central data warehouse where they put

1659
01:06:29,028 --> 01:06:30,786
all the data together, they clean it and

1660
01:06:30,808 --> 01:06:32,834
sanitize it in a consistent way. And

1661
01:06:32,872 --> 01:06:34,482
then you have embedded kind of sense

1662
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:36,226
makers, like kind of consultants or

1663
01:06:36,248 --> 01:06:37,506
analysts at different levels of the

1664
01:06:37,528 --> 01:06:39,510
organization processing that data,

1665
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:40,950
sharing insights with each other,

1666
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:42,674
socializing across the organization.

1667
01:06:42,802 --> 01:06:44,486
And that tends to be kind of like how

1668
01:06:44,508 --> 01:06:46,758
it's generally structured, especially a

1669
01:06:46,764 --> 01:06:47,640
lot of tech companies.

1670
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:53,226
All right, and open strategy is kind of

1671
01:06:53,248 --> 01:06:54,810
an extension of that. It's like the

1672
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,694
extreme extension of collaborative

1673
01:06:56,742 --> 01:06:59,546
intelligence. So open strategy is

1674
01:06:59,568 --> 01:07:01,642
categorically different traditional top

1675
01:07:01,776 --> 01:07:05,066
level strategizing and qualitatively

1676
01:07:05,098 --> 01:07:06,874
different from bottom up strategizing.

1677
01:07:07,002 --> 01:07:08,686
So open strategy is unique in its

1678
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:10,378
overall transparency, wide,

1679
01:07:10,394 --> 01:07:12,590
inclusiveness, and central use of social

1680
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,414
it to effectively enable mass

1681
01:07:14,452 --> 01:07:17,930
participation. In summary, open strategy

1682
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:20,410
is rather project centric rather than a

1683
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:21,806
coherent new strategy governance

1684
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:23,742
framework. The very limitations

1685
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:25,266
transpiring through the various case

1686
01:07:25,288 --> 01:07:26,866
studies suggest that open strategy is

1687
01:07:26,888 --> 01:07:29,794
likely to battle with schwarmers three

1688
01:07:29,832 --> 01:07:32,378
enemies or inner voices of resistance

1689
01:07:32,574 --> 01:07:33,926
the voice of judgment, voice of

1690
01:07:33,948 --> 01:07:37,302
cynicism, and the voice of fear. So open

1691
01:07:37,356 --> 01:07:38,978
Strategy is this kind of idea where it's

1692
01:07:38,994 --> 01:07:41,286
like, the strategy can emerge through

1693
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:42,774
this kind of like, bottoms up

1694
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,682
information processing. If we all have

1695
01:07:44,736 --> 01:07:46,298
the information available to us, it

1696
01:07:46,304 --> 01:07:48,486
wouldn't be purely on top down decision

1697
01:07:48,518 --> 01:07:50,634
maker for synthesizing all of this, but

1698
01:07:50,672 --> 01:07:52,426
rather we could all do that together and

1699
01:07:52,448 --> 01:07:54,858
something more robust will emerge

1700
01:07:54,874 --> 01:07:56,846
through that process. And this is like

1701
01:07:56,868 --> 01:07:59,226
especially a popular concept like Teal

1702
01:07:59,258 --> 01:08:02,126
organizations or Holocracy. That kind of

1703
01:08:02,148 --> 01:08:04,234
decision making is like the gold

1704
01:08:04,282 --> 01:08:06,020
standard for how it should happen.

1705
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:09,714
Though he brought some interesting use

1706
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:12,546
cases about things like IBM, I think

1707
01:08:12,568 --> 01:08:13,986
it's Pepsi, a few other different use

1708
01:08:14,008 --> 01:08:16,514
cases where their experience with this

1709
01:08:16,632 --> 01:08:18,946
is mixed. And when he says this is a

1710
01:08:18,968 --> 01:08:21,086
project centric rather than a coherent

1711
01:08:21,118 --> 01:08:23,458
use strategy governance framework, it's

1712
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:24,870
easy to do this more in a project

1713
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:27,286
setting because you can think about what

1714
01:08:27,308 --> 01:08:29,414
the relevant pieces of information are

1715
01:08:29,532 --> 01:08:31,410
and who all the stakeholders are that

1716
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,834
you want to involve. But to do that

1717
01:08:33,872 --> 01:08:35,430
dynamically means that you're

1718
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:37,114
continuously bringing in new

1719
01:08:37,152 --> 01:08:39,542
information, changing a new stakeholder,

1720
01:08:39,606 --> 01:08:41,286
finding a new decision making processes

1721
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:43,574
between those stakeholders that's super

1722
01:08:43,632 --> 01:08:46,254
hard to do on a continuous basis rather

1723
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:48,062
than, like a limited scope project

1724
01:08:48,116 --> 01:08:52,078
basis. So it's kind of unclear how

1725
01:08:52,084 --> 01:08:54,622
to make up a strategy work over a long

1726
01:08:54,676 --> 01:08:56,160
indefinite period of time.

1727
01:08:58,690 --> 01:09:02,420
Yeah. Bleu Daniel one thing to add here

1728
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:06,258
yeah, just like one last point here is

1729
01:09:06,264 --> 01:09:07,938
that I really like My brought up the

1730
01:09:07,944 --> 01:09:10,126
voice of the inner voices of resistance,

1731
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:11,846
the voice of judgment, the voice of

1732
01:09:11,868 --> 01:09:14,166
cynicism, and the voice of fear. And

1733
01:09:14,188 --> 01:09:16,866
that's really been kind of this feeling

1734
01:09:16,898 --> 01:09:18,294
I've had as I've been reading this book

1735
01:09:18,332 --> 01:09:20,594
of, like, yes, this way of integrating

1736
01:09:20,642 --> 01:09:22,890
top down and bottom up stimuli together

1737
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,714
sounds great, and it's totally the right

1738
01:09:24,752 --> 01:09:28,502
way to do it. But sometimes the reality

1739
01:09:28,566 --> 01:09:30,646
of being an organization is that you're

1740
01:09:30,678 --> 01:09:33,530
dealing with people's personal fear and

1741
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,114
that really holds you back from being

1742
01:09:35,152 --> 01:09:38,622
able to dynamically. Chang Kim people

1743
01:09:38,676 --> 01:09:41,710
want stability, people want mastery.

1744
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:44,798
People want things to be the way that

1745
01:09:44,804 --> 01:09:47,166
they were the same in the past. And

1746
01:09:47,268 --> 01:09:49,762
that's a very deeply, I think, human

1747
01:09:49,816 --> 01:09:51,122
thing. I'm not sure if that's something

1748
01:09:51,176 --> 01:09:53,970
that's unique about Modern organizations

1749
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:56,226
and you're really going up against that

1750
01:09:56,248 --> 01:09:57,714
when you're trying to develop these more

1751
01:09:57,752 --> 01:10:00,322
like, dynamic systems of thinking about

1752
01:10:00,376 --> 01:10:02,440
purpose and meaning and sense making.

1753
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:05,062
And to me, in my mind, that feels like

1754
01:10:05,116 --> 01:10:07,670
the central challenge of free energy

1755
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:09,078
governance. I'm not sure if John would

1756
01:10:09,084 --> 01:10:10,806
agree with that, but to me that feels

1757
01:10:10,838 --> 01:10:12,298
like the huge hurdle you have to

1758
01:10:12,304 --> 01:10:13,050
overcome.

1759
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:18,602
Cool. So, moving into the second

1760
01:10:18,656 --> 01:10:21,478
section, which is much smaller so we'll

1761
01:10:21,494 --> 01:10:24,922
try to be fast. Okay, there's a claim

1762
01:10:24,986 --> 01:10:27,594
here strategic renewal is an iterative

1763
01:10:27,642 --> 01:10:30,094
process of belief, action and learning

1764
01:10:30,212 --> 01:10:32,410
where periods of incremental adjustment,

1765
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:34,174
single loop learning are broken by

1766
01:10:34,212 --> 01:10:36,734
bursts of revolutionary change double

1767
01:10:36,782 --> 01:10:39,442
loop learning. It is only when we start

1768
01:10:39,496 --> 01:10:41,358
expressing beliefs as probability

1769
01:10:41,454 --> 01:10:43,874
distributions and action as a state that

1770
01:10:43,912 --> 01:10:46,386
precedes perception conditioned by a

1771
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,726
Markovian boundary intermediating the

1772
01:10:48,748 --> 01:10:51,974
internal and external states, all

1773
01:10:52,012 --> 01:10:54,166
dedicated in circular causality to

1774
01:10:54,188 --> 01:10:56,758
continuously optimizing the updating of

1775
01:10:56,764 --> 01:10:59,074
beliefs, ie. Learning, a mathematically

1776
01:10:59,122 --> 01:11:02,774
self consistent model emerges. So

1777
01:11:02,812 --> 01:11:06,502
strategic renewal he is using Dean

1778
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:08,634
is using a definition put forward in

1779
01:11:08,672 --> 01:11:11,850
this article by Schmidt in 2018.

1780
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:14,682
This book adopts across hierarchical,

1781
01:11:14,746 --> 01:11:17,642
capabilities driven and action centric

1782
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:19,274
learning perspective in defining

1783
01:11:19,322 --> 01:11:21,230
strategic renewal, which is best

1784
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,754
captured by Schmidt. Strategic renewal

1785
01:11:23,802 --> 01:11:25,966
involves a transformation of the firm's

1786
01:11:25,998 --> 01:11:28,034
core capabilities associated with

1787
01:11:28,072 --> 01:11:30,146
competitive advantage, concerns the

1788
01:11:30,168 --> 01:11:32,130
entire organization, and has

1789
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,766
implications across organizational

1790
01:11:34,798 --> 01:11:37,542
levels and is essential to break past

1791
01:11:37,596 --> 01:11:40,262
dependence and ensure the firm's long

1792
01:11:40,316 --> 01:11:43,750
term survival. And another

1793
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:45,970
claim he makes here is to approach

1794
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:48,594
strategic renewal as an upper echelon

1795
01:11:48,642 --> 01:11:50,634
centric, top down only challenge is

1796
01:11:50,672 --> 01:11:53,082
nonsense. Given the importance of social

1797
01:11:53,136 --> 01:11:54,806
interactions to knowledge development

1798
01:11:54,838 --> 01:11:56,874
and organizational learning. We believe

1799
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:59,578
that renewal can be understood best as a

1800
01:11:59,664 --> 01:12:02,006
system of relational or social

1801
01:12:02,128 --> 01:12:04,126
exchanges, which is effectively the

1802
01:12:04,148 --> 01:12:06,090
essence of reality construction.

1803
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:08,446
Indeed, once strategic renewal is

1804
01:12:08,468 --> 01:12:11,134
embraced as a system of relational or

1805
01:12:11,172 --> 01:12:13,742
social exchanges, the need for across

1806
01:12:13,876 --> 01:12:17,266
hierarchical connect emerges. And I just

1807
01:12:17,288 --> 01:12:19,506
wanted to bring up this figure. This is

1808
01:12:19,528 --> 01:12:21,730
like the action perception loop from

1809
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,346
Thinking through Other Minds a

1810
01:12:23,368 --> 01:12:25,554
Variational Approach to Cognition and

1811
01:12:25,592 --> 01:12:28,614
culture. We've had this on the live

1812
01:12:28,652 --> 01:12:30,054
stream before I can't remember and

1813
01:12:30,092 --> 01:12:31,606
didn't look up which live stream number

1814
01:12:31,628 --> 01:12:35,782
it was. But in this paper

1815
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:40,698
they really illustrate how this

1816
01:12:40,864 --> 01:12:43,162
relational and social exchanges, like

1817
01:12:43,216 --> 01:12:45,334
interaction with the niche environment

1818
01:12:45,462 --> 01:12:49,066
helps us come to a mutual consensus in a

1819
01:12:49,088 --> 01:12:52,166
social kind of way. And so if you would

1820
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:53,998
like more information there, I recommend

1821
01:12:54,084 --> 01:12:54,960
this paper.

1822
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:59,342
Okay? And then Bijan talks about top

1823
01:12:59,396 --> 01:13:02,426
down versus bottom up strategic renewal.

1824
01:13:02,618 --> 01:13:05,254
The more dominant a top down directed

1825
01:13:05,322 --> 01:13:07,678
induced rather than bottom up inspired

1826
01:13:07,774 --> 01:13:10,178
autonomous strategic renewal process,

1827
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:11,774
the more likely that critical

1828
01:13:11,822 --> 01:13:14,030
intelligence formed resource markets

1829
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:15,534
maybe that should be from resource

1830
01:13:15,662 --> 01:13:18,134
markets is ignored and transient and

1831
01:13:18,172 --> 01:13:19,794
transformation bearing market signals

1832
01:13:19,842 --> 01:13:22,610
are lost. In the absence of a circular,

1833
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:24,386
top down, bottom up organizational

1834
01:13:24,418 --> 01:13:26,966
learning, the firm may become trapped in

1835
01:13:26,988 --> 01:13:29,106
top leadership's dominant logics,

1836
01:13:29,218 --> 01:13:31,846
highly dependent on MNA joint venture

1837
01:13:31,878 --> 01:13:34,294
driven innovation and increasingly

1838
01:13:34,342 --> 01:13:35,974
disconnected from the very intelligence

1839
01:13:36,022 --> 01:13:38,150
the firm's field close to resource

1840
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:40,870
markets beholds. Eventually financial

1841
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:43,566
control, M and A and Alliancing is

1842
01:13:43,588 --> 01:13:45,550
likely to squeeze out strategic control

1843
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:47,994
in house innovation, making the firm

1844
01:13:48,042 --> 01:13:49,614
potentially rather more than less

1845
01:13:49,652 --> 01:13:51,662
vulnerable to survival risk, as

1846
01:13:51,716 --> 01:13:54,158
innovation can no longer can be

1847
01:13:54,164 --> 01:13:56,578
generated from within the firm. Did you

1848
01:13:56,584 --> 01:13:58,034
guys have any comments here? Top down

1849
01:13:58,072 --> 01:14:02,754
versus bottom up and

1850
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:05,522
financial versus strategic control.

1851
01:14:05,656 --> 01:14:07,026
Tyler, do you want to read this one for

1852
01:14:07,048 --> 01:14:10,126
me? Sure. Financial and strategic

1853
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:12,414
control, respectively, correlate cue

1854
01:14:12,462 --> 01:14:14,742
linearly to firm performance, too little

1855
01:14:14,796 --> 01:14:16,054
or too much of one or the other.

1856
01:14:16,092 --> 01:14:18,246
Potentially entropy bound, the firm is

1857
01:14:18,268 --> 01:14:19,746
challenged to find an optimal balance

1858
01:14:19,778 --> 01:14:21,746
between external and internal innovation

1859
01:14:21,858 --> 01:14:23,766
to power continuous strategic renewal as

1860
01:14:23,788 --> 01:14:25,230
a sustainable foundation for firm

1861
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:27,306
performance and survival. Indeed, the

1862
01:14:27,328 --> 01:14:29,158
question arises Hohwy does this balanced

1863
01:14:29,174 --> 01:14:30,826
financial and strategic control? And

1864
01:14:30,848 --> 01:14:31,894
whether the board of directors

1865
01:14:31,942 --> 01:14:34,106
potentially assumes critical and unique

1866
01:14:34,138 --> 01:14:35,840
strategic role in the process.

1867
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,076
So yeah, I think just something to add

1868
01:14:41,098 --> 01:14:45,172
here too is a lot of times build

1869
01:14:45,226 --> 01:14:49,204
or buy. And the traditional

1870
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:51,972
start wisdom of how you might balance

1871
01:14:52,036 --> 01:14:54,244
these two decisions of like build versus

1872
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:57,464
buy is that build is we call that

1873
01:14:57,502 --> 01:14:58,984
strategic, right? These are the things

1874
01:14:59,022 --> 01:15:01,096
that are like the core and central to

1875
01:15:01,118 --> 01:15:03,256
your purpose. This is like the core

1876
01:15:03,368 --> 01:15:05,116
engine of how you create value in the

1877
01:15:05,138 --> 01:15:08,508
world. And buy are the things where can

1878
01:15:08,514 --> 01:15:09,548
mean a couple of different things. It

1879
01:15:09,554 --> 01:15:10,988
doesn't actually mean necessarily, it

1880
01:15:10,994 --> 01:15:12,784
can mean more like partnerships and

1881
01:15:12,822 --> 01:15:15,228
plugging into the external ecosystem.

1882
01:15:15,324 --> 01:15:17,264
And so that'd be like using someone

1883
01:15:17,302 --> 01:15:19,376
else's API for something that is not

1884
01:15:19,398 --> 01:15:21,276
necessarily central to you, like stripe

1885
01:15:21,388 --> 01:15:23,628
payment processing. Right. And so it's

1886
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:25,556
this way that you can both have a

1887
01:15:25,578 --> 01:15:27,604
sustainable advantage while at the same

1888
01:15:27,642 --> 01:15:31,204
time kind of not

1889
01:15:31,242 --> 01:15:33,556
using your resources and your energy and

1890
01:15:33,578 --> 01:15:35,124
your attention for something that's not

1891
01:15:35,162 --> 01:15:36,650
core to who you are.

1892
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:42,216
Cool. Thank you. Okay, I think

1893
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:44,730
this is our final claim from the book.

1894
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:47,736
Strategic renewal research is in need of

1895
01:15:47,758 --> 01:15:49,208
a more comprehensive framework

1896
01:15:49,304 --> 01:15:51,400
structurally resolving the hierarchical,

1897
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,780
top down, bottom up learning,

1898
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:55,176
disconnect cognitively embracing

1899
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:57,276
environment as a matter of enactment and

1900
01:15:57,298 --> 01:15:59,352
in terms of capabilities, balancing

1901
01:15:59,416 --> 01:16:01,756
financial and strategic control as well

1902
01:16:01,778 --> 01:16:04,156
as exploitation and exploration. The

1903
01:16:04,178 --> 01:16:05,764
board of directors should be integrated

1904
01:16:05,832 --> 01:16:08,112
as a distinct cognitive variable into

1905
01:16:08,166 --> 01:16:10,736
the community of interactions. But more

1906
01:16:10,758 --> 01:16:12,544
importantly, the question arises whether

1907
01:16:12,582 --> 01:16:13,788
the board possesses the right

1908
01:16:13,814 --> 01:16:15,376
capabilities to be of strategic

1909
01:16:15,408 --> 01:16:17,956
relevance in discontinuous market

1910
01:16:18,058 --> 01:16:21,508
environments. I think that that's all.

1911
01:16:21,594 --> 01:16:24,516
So if you guys have any comments, if

1912
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,484
not, we can move into some concluding

1913
01:16:26,532 --> 01:16:27,320
thoughts.

1914
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,230
Sure. Well,

1915
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,716
the book is subtitled reframing the

1916
01:16:40,738 --> 01:16:43,500
strategy governance conversation.

1917
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,136
So I think we're getting chapter by

1918
01:16:47,158 --> 01:16:49,184
chapter, a clear review of the

1919
01:16:49,222 --> 01:16:52,096
positioning and the contribution of free

1920
01:16:52,118 --> 01:16:54,496
energy governance. And towards the

1921
01:16:54,518 --> 01:16:57,830
middle of the book, things get really

1922
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,556
detailed with respect to the

1923
01:17:01,738 --> 01:17:03,536
applications of the active inference

1924
01:17:03,568 --> 01:17:06,436
framework. So far we've seen more of and

1925
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:09,872
introductory opening salvo and a call

1926
01:17:09,946 --> 01:17:12,936
for need for integration above and

1927
01:17:12,958 --> 01:17:15,092
beyond the current existing practices,

1928
01:17:15,156 --> 01:17:17,050
which I think Tyler did a great job

1929
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:19,652
conveying some of the real world's

1930
01:17:19,796 --> 01:17:22,460
strengths and weaknesses and challenges

1931
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,860
of all these different strategies.

1932
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,756
Yeah, I'm really excited for how

1933
01:17:31,778 --> 01:17:33,944
we move this into an applied setting

1934
01:17:33,992 --> 01:17:37,996
because kind of like combining

1935
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:40,528
the fox and the hedgehog model. This is

1936
01:17:40,534 --> 01:17:42,016
something I've actually thought about a

1937
01:17:42,038 --> 01:17:45,712
dot two little success, and it's a huge

1938
01:17:45,766 --> 01:17:47,948
problem, especially things like OPRs

1939
01:17:47,964 --> 01:17:49,636
have quickly become updated. Like, how

1940
01:17:49,658 --> 01:17:52,404
do you create a model of the world while

1941
01:17:52,442 --> 01:17:54,596
simultaneously communicating? Like,

1942
01:17:54,618 --> 01:17:56,436
hey, this model is subject to change.

1943
01:17:56,618 --> 01:17:58,436
This is a work in progress that we're co

1944
01:17:58,458 --> 01:18:02,036
creating together and kind of

1945
01:18:02,058 --> 01:18:03,220
going against people's individual

1946
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:05,284
resistance of not wanting change and

1947
01:18:05,322 --> 01:18:08,048
wanting things to be staple. I don't

1948
01:18:08,064 --> 01:18:09,492
have a clue of how you actually really

1949
01:18:09,546 --> 01:18:11,268
do that. I'm curious. I really hope that

1950
01:18:11,274 --> 01:18:12,830
John has good answer for that.

1951
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,308
Awesome. Well, we'll see you guys next

1952
01:18:17,394 --> 01:18:19,630
week for chapter three.

1953
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,172
Peace and enjoy the rest of your DAG

1954
01:18:24,226 --> 01:18:26,252
or night, wherever you might be in your

1955
01:18:26,306 --> 01:18:27,160
temporal existence.
