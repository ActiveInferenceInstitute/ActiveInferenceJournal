00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,128
Hello and welcome. This is Active

2
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:11,396
Bookstream number 1.6

3
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,824
on governing continuous transformation.

4
00:00:13,952 --> 00:00:17,524
It's January 17, 2023. Off to you.

5
00:00:17,562 --> 00:00:20,852
Bleu good morning everyone or

6
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:23,412
good whatever time of day it is for you.

7
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:26,228
We are the Active Inference Institute of

8
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,364
participatory online institute that is

9
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:30,312
communicating, learning and practicing

10
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:32,956
applied active inference. These are all

11
00:00:32,978 --> 00:00:35,756
of our social media links where you can

12
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:37,404
find us if you're looking for us

13
00:00:37,522 --> 00:00:40,716
outside. This is a recorded and

14
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:42,732
an archived live stream. So please

15
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:44,576
provide us with feedback so that we can

16
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:47,152
improve on our work. All backgrounds and

17
00:00:47,206 --> 00:00:48,736
perspectives are welcome here and we

18
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:50,480
will be trying to follow good video

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,816
etiquette or live streams other than my

20
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:54,876
cat to feel free to interrupt whenever

21
00:00:54,908 --> 00:00:58,516
she said. You can reach out to

22
00:00:58,538 --> 00:01:00,272
us if you would like to get involved

23
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:02,724
with any of our ongoing projects or live

24
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,870
streams or propose a new project.

25
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,576
And today we are going to discuss this

26
00:01:09,598 --> 00:01:12,170
is bookstream number one,

27
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,756
six. So this is our 6th

28
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:16,728
contextualization video, or the

29
00:01:16,734 --> 00:01:19,112
contextualization video over chapter

30
00:01:19,176 --> 00:01:22,664
six. And we are going to study Governing

31
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:25,324
Continuous Transformation reframing the

32
00:01:25,362 --> 00:01:27,484
Strategy Governance conversation by

33
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:31,128
Bijan Khezri who was nice enough to join

34
00:01:31,144 --> 00:01:33,296
us and discuss some of his ideas with us

35
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:35,904
last week. This video is just an

36
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:37,564
introduction to some of the ideas

37
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:39,856
presented in the book. It's not in a

38
00:01:39,878 --> 00:01:42,764
review or a final word in any way.

39
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:46,132
So we're just going to jump right in and

40
00:01:46,186 --> 00:01:50,180
introduce ourselves. So I am Bleu. I am

41
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,076
a researcher in New Mexico, and I will

42
00:01:53,098 --> 00:01:54,980
pass it off to Daniel.

43
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,248
I'm. Daniel I'm, researcher in

44
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:03,208
California and looking forward to the

45
00:02:03,214 --> 00:02:07,624
continuation of the series. Tyler hey,

46
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:10,016
my name is Tyler. I'm a practitioner,

47
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:12,028
not a researcher. So I lead product and

48
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:14,556
protocol design Ant 4K protocol and I

49
00:02:14,578 --> 00:02:16,936
also do governance on the limits of Dow

50
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:19,820
tooling with Medigo. All right. Bleu.

51
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,976
Awesome. So today we're going to get

52
00:02:24,998 --> 00:02:28,192
into part two of the book, so Free

53
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:29,856
Energy Governance. And we're going to

54
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:32,770
discuss the first chapter in part two.

55
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,868
Part Two free Energy Governance. And

56
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:40,516
we're discussing chapter six. And

57
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:41,924
there's kind of two sections and

58
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,908
actually Bijan broke chapter six for us.

59
00:02:43,994 --> 00:02:45,752
So there's two sections of chapter six,

60
00:02:45,806 --> 00:02:47,288
the upper echelon View and the

61
00:02:47,294 --> 00:02:49,240
predictive processing framework.

62
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,376
And here just a little intro to part

63
00:02:52,398 --> 00:02:54,744
two, free Energy Governance. Bijan says

64
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:56,488
free Energy Governance introduction a

65
00:02:56,494 --> 00:02:58,256
novel cross hierarchical generative

66
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:00,156
framework that uniquely applies the

67
00:03:00,178 --> 00:03:01,996
triplet of structure, cognition and

68
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:03,836
capabilities as the building blocks of

69
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:05,256
the firm's generative models.

70
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:06,924
Specifically in the context of

71
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:08,924
continuous strategic renewal in

72
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:11,120
distributed and discontinuous market

73
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,884
environment. Essentially, six force

74
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:16,064
theoretical perspectives together lay

75
00:03:16,102 --> 00:03:18,220
the foundation for this new conversation

76
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,384
structure, upper echelon view, and

77
00:03:20,422 --> 00:03:22,496
prediction processing framework. So

78
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:23,700
that's what we're going to discuss

79
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,556
today. And then I'm assuming that the

80
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:27,908
next chapters going forward are going to

81
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:30,992
focus on cognition, which encompasses

82
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:33,360
attention based view and an activist

83
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,740
approach and capabilities encompassing

84
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,840
dynamic capability, view and

85
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,676
antagonistic neural networks.

86
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,576
Perspective, structure, cognition, and

87
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,088
capabilities form one integrated system.

88
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:48,340
Under Free Energy Governance, failure in

89
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,296
any one domain is likely to challenge

90
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:52,504
firm survival. The framework's core

91
00:03:52,552 --> 00:03:54,476
propositions outlined at the end of this

92
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:56,460
chapter summarize Free Energy

93
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,744
Governance's ambition for a practice

94
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:00,936
relevant theoretical contribution as

95
00:04:00,978 --> 00:04:02,416
both the generative logic of

96
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:04,416
organizational governance as well as an

97
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:06,364
early warning system predicting

98
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,808
corporate decay. So Tyler, do you want

99
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:12,450
to jump in and read the abstract here?

100
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,944
Except to the apprentice loan view and

101
00:04:19,982 --> 00:04:21,480
prediction processing framework address

102
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,916
Free Energy Governance structural

103
00:04:22,948 --> 00:04:25,208
dimension. Indeed, upper Echelon is the

104
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:26,856
size of strategic decision making.

105
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:29,716
However, UEV suffers from several

106
00:04:29,748 --> 00:04:31,496
limitations. There is no explicit

107
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:33,096
consideration for the board of directors

108
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:34,168
and the linkage between the upper

109
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:35,836
Echelon and to the rest of the

110
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,436
organization. I. E. The coupling of

111
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,564
Governance and operational challenges is

112
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:41,528
unidirectionally top down and therefore

113
00:04:41,624 --> 00:04:44,800
at best, incomplete. How the field data

114
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,636
can systematically topped up or Echelon

115
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:48,188
and influence their values, precession

116
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,936
and attention remains a black box.

117
00:04:50,118 --> 00:04:52,512
Prediction processing framework embraces

118
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:54,736
structure more holistically addressing

119
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:56,468
the hierarchical disconnect and more

120
00:04:56,474 --> 00:04:58,064
importantly, the circular causality

121
00:04:58,112 --> 00:04:59,856
between top down predictions and bottoms

122
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:01,060
up stimuli.

123
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,100
Sparing messages.

124
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,336
Dissonance bearing messages occur at the

125
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:15,624
firm stimuli level bottom close to its

126
00:05:15,662 --> 00:05:18,172
resource markets long before top

127
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:20,056
leadership has any sense of a looming

128
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,816
challenge. Prediction processing

129
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:23,292
framework is determined by three

130
00:05:23,346 --> 00:05:25,816
categorical imperatives. First, upper

131
00:05:25,848 --> 00:05:27,596
Echelon's prediction models and

132
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,512
predictions must be explainable.

133
00:05:29,656 --> 00:05:31,784
Second, each of the hierarchical layers

134
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:35,316
must have formal and informal spaces,

135
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,388
coupling each layer to the next layer.

136
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:39,648
And third, the firm's generative model

137
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:42,236
is the firm's eco niche. Prediction

138
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:43,788
processing framework provides an

139
00:05:43,814 --> 00:05:45,712
entirely new perspective and language

140
00:05:45,776 --> 00:05:47,604
embracing strategic renewal as a matter

141
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:49,984
of bottom up, top down prediction errors

142
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:52,292
minimization, not least, setting free

143
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:54,464
the full potential of the human machine

144
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:56,932
interface. And it's interesting here,

145
00:05:56,986 --> 00:05:59,800
like, I wonder what he means by human

146
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,096
machine interface. Like humans as a

147
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:05,780
functioning machine, as an organism

148
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,310
maybe, or as like,

149
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,340
I don't know, or directly like the human

150
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,516
computer introduction, like how we

151
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:16,636
interface with our technology. So I was

152
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:18,744
curious. I found this human machine

153
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:21,996
interface clause kind of like threw me

154
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:23,884
force a loop a little bit. You guys know

155
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:24,860
any comments?

156
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,760
I kind of been inferring that Bijan

157
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,276
imagines a world where you're very tied

158
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:37,056
in with the AI and I personally haven't

159
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:38,996
witnessed this myself. Like being in and

160
00:06:39,018 --> 00:06:40,548
organization where that is like a

161
00:06:40,554 --> 00:06:43,220
seamless integration where you might use

162
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,380
a machine learning framework, but rather

163
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,328
that it is like a dialogue between the

164
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:50,984
ML model and then the human. I think

165
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:54,152
that's what he's kind of imagining, but

166
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,288
I think it's a little bit unclear. I

167
00:06:55,294 --> 00:06:59,224
think you're right. Bleu so I've

168
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,276
studied and taken courses and

169
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:02,988
intelligence with people who study.

170
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:04,652
Their course of study is like human

171
00:07:04,706 --> 00:07:06,316
computer introduction, like the

172
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:08,120
interface between humans and machines.

173
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,204
And it's always like their topics

174
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:15,010
of study are very different than

175
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,640
thinking about themselves. As a firm.

176
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,472
They think about their topic of study,

177
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:24,204
like interacting with a wellness robot.

178
00:07:24,252 --> 00:07:25,924
Like, you've seen the health little

179
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:28,756
robot for elderly people that checks up

180
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:32,244
on them. And how do elderly people best

181
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:34,820
interact with computers and children?

182
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,356
And they have a very different level of

183
00:07:36,378 --> 00:07:37,588
interaction, both like the older

184
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:39,624
generation and kids. They have different

185
00:07:39,662 --> 00:07:41,976
ways to interact and interface with

186
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:44,136
computers and they do it best in an

187
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:46,600
embodied kind of machine, which I found

188
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,976
super interesting in the mid range. We

189
00:07:49,998 --> 00:07:52,812
can just talk to, we have no problem

190
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:54,524
talking to Alexa and it could just be

191
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:56,988
like a microchip like speaker in the

192
00:07:56,994 --> 00:07:58,476
wall and it wouldn't be a big deal. But

193
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,668
they want something in a teddy bear or

194
00:08:00,754 --> 00:08:03,036
some kind of machine that looks as a

195
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:04,556
face or something like that and they

196
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:05,952
interact with it in a much different

197
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:08,080
way, much more efficiently, actually.

198
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,712
So I found that super interesting. But

199
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:10,896
this is what I think about when I think

200
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:12,544
about the human machine interface is

201
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:17,024
like the actual Markov boundary between

202
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:19,668
humans and machines. And so what is the

203
00:08:19,674 --> 00:08:21,968
potential of a Markov boundary? I don't

204
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:24,496
know. Anyway, so sorry I'm rambling.

205
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:26,632
Okay, so just a few keywords here.

206
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:28,356
Upper echelon view prediction processing

207
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:30,004
framework. We'll go back and revisit

208
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,748
double learning, look into optimization,

209
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,760
organizational sense making and I think

210
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,280
the biggest chunk of new information

211
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,648
that Bijan brought into this chapter.

212
00:08:38,744 --> 00:08:42,284
What were these habits of mind? Okay,

213
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:44,636
so do you want to read this from

214
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:47,452
retailer Upper Echelon view? Cool. So

215
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:49,308
UEB defines the organization as a

216
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:51,704
reflection of its upper Echelon, ie.

217
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:53,916
Its top management team. Ueb's central

218
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:55,564
premise is that generative experiences,

219
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:57,136
values and personalities affect their

220
00:08:57,158 --> 00:08:58,608
field of vision, their one field of

221
00:08:58,614 --> 00:09:00,256
vision. The directors they look and

222
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:02,704
listen selective exteroception what they

223
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,320
actually see in here and three,

224
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,336
interpretation how they attach meaning

225
00:09:06,368 --> 00:09:07,764
to what they see in here. So

226
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:09,828
essentially, UEV re embraces sensing and

227
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:11,264
sense making not only as an essential

228
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:13,028
leadership qualities, but as a

229
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:14,696
foundation for strategic choices and

230
00:09:14,718 --> 00:09:15,720
firm performance.

231
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,496
Cool. And so there are a couple of

232
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,192
claims kind of associated with this

233
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:25,130
upper Echelon view. Bijan says however,

234
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,004
upper Echelon view suffers from several

235
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:30,172
limitations. In particular, there is no

236
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:32,076
explicit consideration for the board of

237
00:09:32,098 --> 00:09:34,248
directors as part of the upper Echelon.

238
00:09:34,344 --> 00:09:35,948
The many dimension by which a

239
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:37,596
nonexecutive chairman relates to the

240
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,836
CEO, for example, are likely to

241
00:09:39,858 --> 00:09:42,224
determine strategic choices. He goes on

242
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:45,216
to say while Upper Echelon view has

243
00:09:45,238 --> 00:09:47,104
neglected the board of directors, free

244
00:09:47,142 --> 00:09:49,232
energy governance emphasizes the

245
00:09:49,286 --> 00:09:51,248
importance of the board as part of a

246
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:53,604
firm's upper Echelon top management here

247
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:55,252
and the board of directors here,

248
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:57,556
jointly labeled as the upper Echelon are

249
00:09:57,578 --> 00:09:59,824
together the locus of strategic decision

250
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:02,436
making. More importantly, the board of

251
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,036
directors can potentially assume a

252
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:06,176
unique cognitive role in strategy

253
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,912
process in the form of dynamic board

254
00:10:07,966 --> 00:10:09,684
capabilities that is highly

255
00:10:09,732 --> 00:10:11,364
complementary to that of senior

256
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:14,308
executive leadership. Strategic capacity

257
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:15,848
and I was wondering, Tyler, maybe if you

258
00:10:15,854 --> 00:10:18,584
have any concepts here on like normally

259
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:20,648
the board is not included as the upper

260
00:10:20,664 --> 00:10:23,196
echelon and Bijan is making the case for

261
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:25,470
their inclusion. Is that typical in

262
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,190
organizations or what do you think here?

263
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,672
No, that's not common. And I think Bijan

264
00:10:31,736 --> 00:10:33,516
touched on this in our last call with

265
00:10:33,538 --> 00:10:35,520
him. The last discussion is that usually

266
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,976
you see the board as more of like a

267
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:40,528
sounding board, as that they give a

268
00:10:40,534 --> 00:10:42,976
final sign off a rubber stamp, they make

269
00:10:42,998 --> 00:10:44,464
sure you're not doing anything totally

270
00:10:44,512 --> 00:10:47,088
illegal and irresponsible, but they're

271
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,868
not really there to really be in the

272
00:10:48,874 --> 00:10:51,568
weeds with you. Whereas what the genre

273
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:55,044
is arguing is like, no, actually, by

274
00:10:55,082 --> 00:10:56,484
virtue of being kind of separate from

275
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,616
the day to day work, they can give you a

276
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:01,096
more unbiased view of what you should be

277
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,248
doing strategically, like the

278
00:11:02,254 --> 00:11:03,656
capabilities you should be building,

279
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:05,128
and that they actually are, like, a

280
00:11:05,134 --> 00:11:06,824
really integral part of your whole

281
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:09,304
strategic process. And so it's unusual

282
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:12,412
to think of them as these two really

283
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,236
critical halves. Usually people think of

284
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:15,788
the board as this nuisance that they

285
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:18,984
have to appease, not as a real thing

286
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:20,128
that can actually add value to the

287
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:20,880
organization.

288
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,280
Awesome. Thank you for that input.

289
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,824
Okay, so a couple more things to say

290
00:11:31,862 --> 00:11:34,284
about UEV and we just kind of excerpted

291
00:11:34,332 --> 00:11:37,204
from the text. Upper echelon view is far

292
00:11:37,242 --> 00:11:39,572
too restrictive and one sided top down

293
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:41,108
to explain through the lens of

294
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:42,676
leadership qualities the anatomy of

295
00:11:42,698 --> 00:11:44,096
success and failure of strategic

296
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:46,436
renewal. This book invites to a new

297
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,336
stream of upper echelon youth centric

298
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:50,368
research that operationalize upper

299
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:51,876
echelon youth impact on firm

300
00:11:51,908 --> 00:11:53,544
performance. Not so much in terms of

301
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:55,464
antecedents and consequences of team

302
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:57,292
diversity, but as a function of

303
00:11:57,346 --> 00:11:59,624
structure, cognitively coupling,

304
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:01,308
governance and operational channels in

305
00:12:01,314 --> 00:12:02,828
the form of top down, bottom up,

306
00:12:02,914 --> 00:12:04,136
circular prediction, error,

307
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:06,248
minimization, second cognition,

308
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:07,916
embracing environment. As a matter of

309
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:10,092
action centric enactment and third

310
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:11,916
capabilities. Developing duality

311
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:13,264
management as a dynamic board.

312
00:12:13,302 --> 00:12:15,376
Capability to rewire the plane while

313
00:12:15,398 --> 00:12:17,616
flying it. He goes on to say the

314
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:19,196
prediction processing framework allows

315
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:20,752
us to embrace structure more

316
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,636
holistically. I don't know if you guys

317
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:26,880
have any comments here. Daniel?

318
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,772
Let's just say that we're in a

319
00:12:28,826 --> 00:12:32,752
tripartite firm with the upper etchelon

320
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:35,592
consisting of the higher management and

321
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:37,912
or the board of directors, middle

322
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,952
management and then the front lines, as

323
00:12:41,086 --> 00:12:44,292
Bijan mentioned last week, overly

324
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:47,672
emphasizing in a given eco niche.

325
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:51,132
Any one of those three sections is going

326
00:12:51,186 --> 00:12:54,748
to lead to maladaptive decision making

327
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:58,252
and implementation. So the question

328
00:12:58,306 --> 00:13:01,804
that I see these repeated structure

329
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:05,584
cognition capabilities returning to is

330
00:13:05,622 --> 00:13:09,520
about striking an adaptive balance

331
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,380
amongst the upper etchelon.

332
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,792
The middle management implementation

333
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:18,928
layers and the frontline DayToday

334
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:22,036
experience, just like the body and the

335
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:25,528
organism, strike a balance between the

336
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:28,792
primary perceptual organs, the

337
00:13:28,846 --> 00:13:31,368
intermediate processing and then the

338
00:13:31,454 --> 00:13:33,080
central processing.

339
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,482
Cool. Thank you. All right, so moving

340
00:13:39,536 --> 00:13:42,294
on to the prediction processing

341
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,682
framework tyler, do you want to read

342
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:47,370
this for us? Do you mind? All right. So

343
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,926
neither governance or strategic renewal

344
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,482
research have addressed the hierarchical

345
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:53,246
disconnect of the top down, bottom up

346
00:13:53,268 --> 00:13:55,198
circular causality servant and

347
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:57,230
exceptional contributions aside,

348
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,174
PPF opens the processual black box

349
00:14:02,212 --> 00:14:03,934
of how shared meaning and expectations

350
00:14:03,982 --> 00:14:05,458
are constructed and optimized and

351
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:06,926
pursued optimizing the performance

352
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,186
sustainability of strategic renewal in

353
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:12,014
management science. PPF's biological

354
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:15,742
origins can be traced to Argus Agris's

355
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:17,326
theory of action perspective,

356
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:19,186
specifically the concept of double loop

357
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:20,662
learning. Defined as a form of learning

358
00:14:20,716 --> 00:14:22,162
that challenges the existing routines

359
00:14:22,226 --> 00:14:24,582
and status quo action centric learning

360
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:26,146
is at the heart of crosshair goal

361
00:14:26,178 --> 00:14:28,246
prediction processing framework. There

362
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,058
is a need for fundamentally for a

363
00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:32,230
fundamentally new organizing framework

364
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,966
system's preparedness to unlearn powers

365
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:36,982
the receptivity to correlation feedback

366
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:39,306
of the decisionmaking unit and hence is

367
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:41,138
critical to PPF's top down, bottom UPUP

368
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:42,890
learning prediction error minimization

369
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,790
challenge.

370
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,074
Cool. Daniel, do you have any comments

371
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:51,710
here? Yes. In Bayesian,

372
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,258
learning really is unlearning. You have

373
00:14:56,264 --> 00:14:59,602
to move the distribution around. And so

374
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:01,934
Bayesian learning isn't just throwing

375
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:05,266
more papers onto a stack or onto a

376
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:07,734
knowledge pile, but when we have to

377
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:10,534
update how likely we think things are.

378
00:15:10,732 --> 00:15:13,106
That is an unlearning. So it's

379
00:15:13,138 --> 00:15:14,914
interesting to see how it's connected

380
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:18,642
here to openness to the unknown negative

381
00:15:18,706 --> 00:15:21,946
capabilities and the way in which in the

382
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:23,802
single loop, which I know we'll get to,

383
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,514
you can implement and do local

384
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:28,406
maximization and maybe be locally

385
00:15:28,438 --> 00:15:30,026
adaptive. But if we really want to pull

386
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:32,758
back and amidst these discontinuities

387
00:15:32,854 --> 00:15:34,606
continue to find success, then we need

388
00:15:34,628 --> 00:15:36,186
to engage in that kind of double loop

389
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:36,800
learning.

390
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,968
You totally took the words out of my

391
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,536
mouth and actually just said it so much

392
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:45,936
better. So I also was like really

393
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,324
reminded of Bayesian learning here with

394
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:50,976
unlearning because for all the reasons

395
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:54,336
we just stated. Okay, so double loop

396
00:15:54,368 --> 00:15:55,796
learning just to read that. I think we

397
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:57,236
talked about this maybe not last week

398
00:15:57,258 --> 00:15:59,384
with bjanda just a couple of weeks ago.

399
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:01,736
So double loop learning occurs when in

400
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:03,156
order to correct an error, it's

401
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:05,764
necessary to alter the governing values

402
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:08,824
of the master program. So in this little

403
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:10,836
figure, it's just like single loop

404
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:12,108
learning is action assess the

405
00:16:12,114 --> 00:16:13,516
consequences, actions assess the

406
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:14,876
consequences, actions assess the

407
00:16:14,898 --> 00:16:16,696
consequences, where the double loop

408
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:18,924
learning zooms out to kind of see like,

409
00:16:18,962 --> 00:16:21,836
what governing variables influence the

410
00:16:21,858 --> 00:16:24,636
actions that are being taken. So it's

411
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:27,088
kind of like the setback in a

412
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:30,636
hierarchical control model. And Bijan

413
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:32,508
says that we need error feedback loops

414
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,336
to adjust predictions and more

415
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:36,160
importantly, to eventually update

416
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,816
prediction models, aka double loop

417
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:39,430
learning.

418
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,814
So Bijan goes on to make the claim. He

419
00:16:47,852 --> 00:16:49,478
says upper echelon remains the

420
00:16:49,484 --> 00:16:51,526
centralized purveyor of predictions as

421
00:16:51,548 --> 00:16:53,430
well as trustee of prediction models.

422
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,206
Hence, the prediction processing powered

423
00:16:55,238 --> 00:16:56,794
free energy governance framework is

424
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:58,394
distributed at the bottom but

425
00:16:58,432 --> 00:17:00,586
centralized at the top. However, for

426
00:17:00,608 --> 00:17:02,010
prediction error minimization to work,

427
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,046
each hierarchical layer must be

428
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:05,774
dedicated to one simple first order

429
00:17:05,812 --> 00:17:07,806
principle minimize free energy to

430
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:09,658
minimize error and surprise.

431
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:11,566
Consequently, prediction models will

432
00:17:11,588 --> 00:17:13,902
generatively evolve by way of self

433
00:17:13,956 --> 00:17:16,082
learning. This is the essence of

434
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,610
unsupervised self organization.

435
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:23,826
Any comments here? Sure. So in

436
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:25,410
terms of communication,

437
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,454
what are the different parts of the

438
00:17:30,492 --> 00:17:32,646
organization or organism sharing with

439
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:35,846
each other? So they might just be

440
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:38,002
representing what they're perceiving.

441
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:40,522
Like everyone is just filling others in

442
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:42,730
on what they're getting. So that's one

443
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,114
imperative. It's just unbiased pass

444
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:48,220
through a communication. Another

445
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,114
generative might be give the other

446
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:54,334
person what they expect. So here the

447
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:56,366
management is saying we expect that

448
00:17:56,388 --> 00:17:58,542
you're going to sell ten chaos and then

449
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:00,942
the front line says yes, we sold ten

450
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:01,710
cars.

451
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,050
Where free energy minimization as

452
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,946
a way to minimize or bound errors and

453
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:13,090
surprise comes in is that it says

454
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,598
actually the communication imperative

455
00:18:15,774 --> 00:18:18,886
shouldn't be simple passthrough and it

456
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:22,440
also shouldn't be conformist. But rather

457
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,846
what is communicated should provide

458
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:29,478
information about to what extent the

459
00:18:29,564 --> 00:18:32,774
expectations of your communicating

460
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:36,346
partner are being violated. So if

461
00:18:36,368 --> 00:18:39,238
they say we expect ten cars,

462
00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:41,642
the minimum communication might just be

463
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:44,462
yes, if that's true. And then maybe

464
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:47,418
there's a dial that can be turned

465
00:18:47,514 --> 00:18:49,086
depending on whether it's fewer than

466
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:51,674
that or more than that. And so that puts

467
00:18:51,722 --> 00:18:54,240
communication into an interesting

468
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:58,194
setting where we're explicit about what

469
00:18:58,232 --> 00:19:00,382
the, in this case, top down predictions

470
00:19:00,446 --> 00:19:03,602
are and then we situate the bottom up

471
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:07,470
communication as reflecting the adequacy

472
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,722
of those expectations rather than just

473
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:12,646
being plain passed through or

474
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:16,550
conformist. Yeah, just to

475
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,486
build on that a little bit. Because in

476
00:19:18,508 --> 00:19:20,166
my experience there's, like you said,

477
00:19:20,188 --> 00:19:21,314
they only two kinds of communication.

478
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:24,342
There's one of very clear, like hey,

479
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:25,786
this is what we're expecting, did you

480
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:27,366
meet that like a very clear prediction.

481
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:28,746
And there's another one that's more just

482
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,614
like dissonance. Like things just aren't

483
00:19:30,662 --> 00:19:32,566
working well and people don't fully

484
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:35,486
understand why. And this is my

485
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,834
experience really trying to communicate

486
00:19:37,882 --> 00:19:40,014
in a very clear linear way through each

487
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:42,958
stack of the hierarchy about trying to

488
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:45,230
warn someone of an issue, for example,

489
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,746
or communicate like the new world or how

490
00:19:47,768 --> 00:19:49,506
you should update your generative model.

491
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,146
That tends to not work nearly as well as

492
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:54,162
just things not working well. And people

493
00:19:54,216 --> 00:19:57,266
bumping up against discontinuities and

494
00:19:57,288 --> 00:19:59,074
dissonance themselves and people feel

495
00:19:59,112 --> 00:20:00,598
like, oh, there's like a problem in the

496
00:20:00,604 --> 00:20:02,678
system, this is a signal that we need to

497
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:04,886
fix it. And usually that's in my

498
00:20:04,908 --> 00:20:06,354
experience, like how communication

499
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:09,574
happens between the hierarchies and it

500
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:11,674
feels really bad and it feels very

501
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,178
chaotic. But ant the end of the day, I

502
00:20:13,184 --> 00:20:14,746
think that's how the organism of the

503
00:20:14,768 --> 00:20:16,380
firm processes information.

504
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,146
Yeah. It's asking too much for the

505
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:24,522
skin cell to provide a situational

506
00:20:24,586 --> 00:20:28,654
report on the wound. All it can and

507
00:20:28,772 --> 00:20:32,094
must do is report a difference from

508
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:34,814
expectation that gets clustered with

509
00:20:34,852 --> 00:20:37,134
other incoming sensory modalities and

510
00:20:37,172 --> 00:20:39,886
integrated by the upper echelon to make

511
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:41,378
a decision about, okay, now we're going

512
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:44,306
to get a bandaid. So understanding that

513
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,666
the skin cell is not going to tell you

514
00:20:45,688 --> 00:20:48,674
to get a band and but also the bandaid

515
00:20:48,722 --> 00:20:51,302
decision making unit isn't going to have

516
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:53,110
direct access to the skin,

517
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,458
can that be implemented at the firm

518
00:20:57,554 --> 00:20:58,200
level?

519
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,410
I also am reminded of communication here

520
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,074
and how that coupling between

521
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:11,098
different layers of the hierarchy can I

522
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,826
talk today? The coupling between the

523
00:21:12,848 --> 00:21:14,266
different layers of the hierarchy, how

524
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:17,806
should that work? So just for example,

525
00:21:17,908 --> 00:21:19,806
the skin cell doesn't necessarily need

526
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:22,762
to know what is happening in the liver,

527
00:21:22,826 --> 00:21:25,386
right? It's not like a direct coupling

528
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:29,294
there. How do you selectively

529
00:21:29,342 --> 00:21:32,674
choose as a management, like what

530
00:21:32,712 --> 00:21:35,218
to communicate down the chain? If I'm in

531
00:21:35,224 --> 00:21:37,122
the upper echelon, what does the board

532
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:38,782
communicate to the top management tier?

533
00:21:38,846 --> 00:21:40,374
What is the top management tier then

534
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:42,566
communicate downstream? And how do you

535
00:21:42,588 --> 00:21:44,530
filter that information so that it's

536
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,406
like how do you prioritize salient here

537
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:52,358
and just not open up a

538
00:21:52,364 --> 00:21:54,138
fire hose here's all the information?

539
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,394
Because that's not effective for

540
00:21:56,432 --> 00:22:00,118
communicating. But also that disconnect,

541
00:22:00,214 --> 00:22:03,166
like any kind of filtering can lead to a

542
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,526
level of disconnect that may be

543
00:22:04,548 --> 00:22:07,774
unwanted. So how do you prioritize that

544
00:22:07,812 --> 00:22:10,478
information flow down layers of the

545
00:22:10,484 --> 00:22:13,646
hierarchy? And I always am interested in

546
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:16,526
this, whether it's biological or

547
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:18,686
organizational. I have a couple of

548
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,834
examples to allostat that. So for

549
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,090
example, I worked at a company called I

550
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,978
won't name any names here, but it was a

551
00:22:24,984 --> 00:22:27,986
tech company and it was like very like

552
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:29,694
400 people. And it was like structured

553
00:22:29,742 --> 00:22:32,530
very hierarchically. And so basically

554
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,658
from the bottom rungs to the top, you

555
00:22:34,664 --> 00:22:36,466
would have each person would report up

556
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,986
to their unit and have like, hey, this

557
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:39,962
is what we did. These are like we're

558
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:41,306
risks you should be aware of, right?

559
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:42,326
And this would be happen on a weekly

560
00:22:42,358 --> 00:22:45,226
basis and then that would get bubbled up

561
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,886
into the next running of the hierarchy,

562
00:22:46,918 --> 00:22:48,586
which keeps getting synthesized and

563
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:49,926
refined at each level of the hierarchy

564
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,706
until you get up to the CEO, right?

565
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:54,620
Which is presumed like ostensibly like

566
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,586
condensing all of this information from

567
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:59,402
400 people up to one report, but the CEO

568
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:02,090
gets up like five bullets of takeaways,

569
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,690
right? And so like, what happens Bijan

570
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,518
even talks about this in the chapter is

571
00:23:07,524 --> 00:23:09,934
that it gets so filtered by that point.

572
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,666
And also each rung in the hierarchy has

573
00:23:11,688 --> 00:23:13,074
like their own incentives and things

574
00:23:13,112 --> 00:23:15,022
that they're trying to like politically

575
00:23:15,086 --> 00:23:17,186
maximize for that becomes like not even

576
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:20,786
that useful. So what's a lot more

577
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:23,574
useful though is when things, I guess

578
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:25,622
two things. One is if things go wrong,

579
00:23:25,676 --> 00:23:28,166
let's say there's a bug in the app and

580
00:23:28,268 --> 00:23:29,766
something, a firing needs to be put out

581
00:23:29,788 --> 00:23:31,654
right away. That's information that

582
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:32,990
skips all the wrongs and goes straight

583
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,242
to the CEO. Another one is when people

584
00:23:35,296 --> 00:23:37,194
would a lot of times executives would

585
00:23:37,232 --> 00:23:38,966
schedule meetings, but just random

586
00:23:38,998 --> 00:23:41,146
people in the organization. So you have

587
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:44,570
an executive who's like the CFO would

588
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,214
schedule a meeting with some engineer

589
00:23:46,262 --> 00:23:48,766
and just to basically cross the chasm of

590
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:49,678
all the different levels of the

591
00:23:49,684 --> 00:23:50,766
hierarchy. Just be like, hey, like,

592
00:23:50,788 --> 00:23:52,654
what's going on? Like, tell me like,

593
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:54,446
what you perceive the problems to be in

594
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:56,686
your subunit. And that's a way for them

595
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,590
to kind of get like this unfiltered view

596
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,118
of like random people by sampling random

597
00:24:01,134 --> 00:24:03,266
people across the organization. So I

598
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:04,818
think there are ways you can do this,

599
00:24:04,904 --> 00:24:06,740
but yeah, it's really difficult.

600
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:14,438
Cool. Okay, so moving on, we'll talk a

601
00:24:14,444 --> 00:24:17,414
little bit about optimization and I just

602
00:24:17,532 --> 00:24:21,270
put up here, like the distributed versus

603
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,018
hierarchical levels,

604
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:29,566
the networks. Okay, so Bijan

605
00:24:29,618 --> 00:24:31,114
the challenge is not only one of

606
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:33,242
building intra firm connections between

607
00:24:33,296 --> 00:24:35,514
upper echelon's top down predictions and

608
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:38,062
field management bottom up stimuli, but

609
00:24:38,116 --> 00:24:39,854
optimizing the top down, bottom up

610
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:41,646
process within each and every layer of

611
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:45,086
the hierarchy. Why did you say that?

612
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,214
Of the hierarchy? In form of feedback

613
00:24:47,262 --> 00:24:49,666
connections, optimization is central to

614
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,394
prediction processing framework. This

615
00:24:51,432 --> 00:24:53,458
optimization makes every level in the

616
00:24:53,464 --> 00:24:56,034
hierarchy accountable to others. While

617
00:24:56,072 --> 00:24:58,014
the generative sense making processes

618
00:24:58,062 --> 00:24:59,714
and capabilities are a critical

619
00:24:59,762 --> 00:25:01,638
performance element at every level of

620
00:25:01,644 --> 00:25:04,294
the hierarchy, the efficacy of such

621
00:25:04,332 --> 00:25:06,502
capabilities is determined by top down

622
00:25:06,556 --> 00:25:08,630
belief propagation and bottom up message

623
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,526
passing within and across organizational

624
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:13,370
layers or business units.

625
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,220
Yeah, so I think that optimization for

626
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:22,346
maybe information or I

627
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:25,358
don't know, what are you optimizing the

628
00:25:25,364 --> 00:25:26,926
connection, optimizing the flow of

629
00:25:26,948 --> 00:25:30,094
information, optimizing the link between

630
00:25:30,212 --> 00:25:32,350
up and down? What are we really

631
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,360
optimizing for? I don't know.

632
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,698
Yeah, it's a little bit vague in how he

633
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,878
talks about it and it's honestly

634
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:42,146
something I got kind of a little bit

635
00:25:42,168 --> 00:25:44,210
frustrated with because actually

636
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,226
building that top down, bottom up kind

637
00:25:46,248 --> 00:25:49,122
of connective tissue is like a huge area

638
00:25:49,176 --> 00:25:50,494
of research and there's all these

639
00:25:50,552 --> 00:25:53,158
different approaches for it. So like a

640
00:25:53,164 --> 00:25:55,958
really famous one is Holocracy. I'm not

641
00:25:55,964 --> 00:25:56,678
sure you guys are familiar with

642
00:25:56,684 --> 00:25:58,486
Holocaust. Holocracy got famous because

643
00:25:58,508 --> 00:26:01,990
it was implemented by Zappos to like mix

644
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,778
results potentially. But a cool way that

645
00:26:04,784 --> 00:26:06,954
they do it is that it's not like a very

646
00:26:06,992 --> 00:26:08,534
traditional pyramid hierarchical

647
00:26:08,582 --> 00:26:11,290
structure that each subunit will kind of

648
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,610
dynamically form bonds with other levels

649
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,074
of the hierarchy, kind of arbitrarily

650
00:26:16,122 --> 00:26:19,406
depending on needs as they arise. But

651
00:26:19,428 --> 00:26:22,094
they have a whole system for how those

652
00:26:22,132 --> 00:26:24,234
bonds can form and how you generate

653
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,758
links across different levels of the

654
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:28,466
hierarchy. And so that's just to say

655
00:26:28,648 --> 00:26:30,818
this is like a huge area of research and

656
00:26:30,824 --> 00:26:32,306
experimentation that no one really has

657
00:26:32,328 --> 00:26:36,578
like a great answer for. And yeah,

658
00:26:36,744 --> 00:26:39,894
this is like a huge open

659
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:40,760
ended question.

660
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,350
There's no general strategy for a bug,

661
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,746
so it doesn't seem like there's going to

662
00:26:50,768 --> 00:26:54,266
be a general organization chart or

663
00:26:54,368 --> 00:26:55,820
Communications platform.

664
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,390
And technology is changing so rapidly.

665
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,834
And intelligence augmentation. This is

666
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,802
helping us sketch the first lines

667
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:11,486
on our notebook that takes us into a

668
00:27:11,508 --> 00:27:14,974
discussion and an adaptive process and

669
00:27:15,012 --> 00:27:16,954
that is the reframing of the strategy

670
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:20,354
governance conversation. It's not this

671
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:23,650
is the strategy playbook,

672
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,534
it's not the homework problems but

673
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,850
it's bringing some ideas to the table

674
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,520
that are mixing it up.

675
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,234
So I don't know, I think about

676
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:43,420
optimizing sense making at each level

677
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,754
because of the quote that's stated here

678
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,962
and so how do you optimize sense

679
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:52,666
making across layers? It definitely has

680
00:27:52,688 --> 00:27:55,066
to do with information prioritization,

681
00:27:55,178 --> 00:27:58,826
I think, but it's

682
00:27:58,858 --> 00:28:01,246
like how to selectively choose. I guess

683
00:28:01,268 --> 00:28:03,150
it's like a very open ended question but

684
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,226
I don't know. I would like some concrete

685
00:28:05,258 --> 00:28:06,786
examples. It's something like I would

686
00:28:06,808 --> 00:28:09,074
like to drill Bijan on have you ever

687
00:28:09,112 --> 00:28:10,786
seen this done and like what worked and

688
00:28:10,808 --> 00:28:14,626
what didn't? As far as optimizing this

689
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:18,934
hierarchy flow. As to

690
00:28:18,972 --> 00:28:22,342
what is being optimized. One sort of

691
00:28:22,476 --> 00:28:24,982
capital maximalist approach is like

692
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,634
profit is to be maximized or risk

693
00:28:27,682 --> 00:28:29,702
discounted profit or a triple bottom

694
00:28:29,756 --> 00:28:32,154
line. There are imperatives for the

695
00:28:32,192 --> 00:28:34,634
organization to optimize but that

696
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:36,298
doesn't Dean that. That becomes the

697
00:28:36,304 --> 00:28:39,820
imperative at every communication step.

698
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:44,378
And kind of the dream or direction

699
00:28:44,554 --> 00:28:47,294
of informational free energy

700
00:28:47,412 --> 00:28:51,326
minimization would be you'll be doing

701
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:54,782
as good as you can in the niche. From

702
00:28:54,836 --> 00:28:57,790
like an energetics and metabolism

703
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:01,570
perspective when you're informationally

704
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,778
optimizing, if you're a bear making the

705
00:29:05,784 --> 00:29:07,974
best possible decisions, you will

706
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:11,286
survive in the niche. And so it's kind

707
00:29:11,308 --> 00:29:13,846
of like recognizing the difference

708
00:29:13,948 --> 00:29:17,446
between the ecological success of

709
00:29:17,468 --> 00:29:19,838
an communication or organism.

710
00:29:20,034 --> 00:29:22,170
Recognizing that that embodied success

711
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,462
and death isn't the informational

712
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:28,762
imperative but for things

713
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:31,450
that work and not things that don't,

714
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,586
fulfilling the informational imperative

715
00:29:34,778 --> 00:29:38,160
should lead to the embodied success

716
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,960
because it's defined in that way.

717
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,886
So it's easy to turn to maximizing

718
00:29:47,918 --> 00:29:49,954
profit as a firm objective. But I think

719
00:29:49,992 --> 00:29:53,282
that is short sighted. I definitely

720
00:29:53,336 --> 00:29:55,090
think that there's many other things

721
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,538
like if you're making the most possible

722
00:29:57,624 --> 00:30:00,718
money of producing light bulbs, say I'm

723
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:02,786
making a light Bull and I'm maximizing

724
00:30:02,818 --> 00:30:04,274
profit on the light Bull and I'm

725
00:30:04,322 --> 00:30:05,922
producing a million of them for pennies,

726
00:30:05,986 --> 00:30:08,054
right? And they're selling for $10 each

727
00:30:08,092 --> 00:30:10,518
or whatever. But I'm like polluting a

728
00:30:10,524 --> 00:30:12,358
river because I'm making the light Bull

729
00:30:12,374 --> 00:30:15,078
so cheap. I'm not adequately disposing

730
00:30:15,094 --> 00:30:17,338
of waste or whatever. Then that's going

731
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,610
to have blowback later either through

732
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,898
EPA or through customers saying I don't

733
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:24,750
want that because it's not sustainable.

734
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,734
So if you're just exploitative or

735
00:30:28,852 --> 00:30:32,462
exploitative then it's not going to work

736
00:30:32,516 --> 00:30:34,106
out in the long run. So maximizing

737
00:30:34,138 --> 00:30:35,650
profit is a very delicate thing,

738
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,730
especially in terms of company

739
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,778
persistence and sustainability. Like

740
00:30:39,864 --> 00:30:41,758
sustainability not like an eco friendly

741
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:43,058
way but like sustainability of the

742
00:30:43,064 --> 00:30:43,940
company itself.

743
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,126
Sorry, I was thinking of fermenting

744
00:30:48,158 --> 00:30:50,994
bacteria. Initially certain strategies

745
00:30:51,042 --> 00:30:52,646
work but then that can lead to the

746
00:30:52,668 --> 00:30:54,662
production of metabolites that that

747
00:30:54,716 --> 00:30:57,318
strategy will no longer be optimal in.

748
00:30:57,484 --> 00:30:59,014
So one has to consider like

749
00:30:59,052 --> 00:31:01,466
externalities in the niche. And of

750
00:31:01,488 --> 00:31:03,382
course all of this is just a statistical

751
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:05,866
framework. That's way before we get into

752
00:31:06,048 --> 00:31:08,410
ethical imperatives or preferences.

753
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,186
Yeah, this is what I think we covered in

754
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:13,866
the third Livestream. But it's like,

755
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:17,526
okay, how do you hurt cats

756
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:18,782
basically and get all these different

757
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,318
levels of the organization to move in

758
00:31:20,324 --> 00:31:22,122
the same direction and kind of balance

759
00:31:22,186 --> 00:31:23,326
that these different things. You might

760
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,006
want to optimize for that in the long

761
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:27,086
term. Maybe it goes for profit but you

762
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:28,638
might have sub problems that you need to

763
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:30,466
solve that are not strictly profit. And

764
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,066
so one of the most famous ways of doing

765
00:31:32,088 --> 00:31:34,034
this is OKR, so like objective key

766
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:36,418
results at your top level of the

767
00:31:36,424 --> 00:31:38,306
organization. Maybe it is profit or

768
00:31:38,328 --> 00:31:39,486
maybe it is like some kind of double

769
00:31:39,518 --> 00:31:42,514
bottom line. But then as you go into sub

770
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:43,926
units of the organization like say you

771
00:31:43,948 --> 00:31:46,230
have customer service, your customer

772
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,766
service team is not optimizing for

773
00:31:47,788 --> 00:31:49,766
profit. They're optimizing for a

774
00:31:49,788 --> 00:31:52,050
customer experience score like CSAT for

775
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,154
example, right? And your legal team is

776
00:31:54,192 --> 00:31:56,554
not optimizing for profit. They have

777
00:31:56,592 --> 00:31:57,798
their own measure that they're

778
00:31:57,814 --> 00:31:59,706
optimizing for the number of cases they

779
00:31:59,728 --> 00:32:02,998
win or legal risk avoided. I don't

780
00:32:03,014 --> 00:32:05,326
know how you quantify that, but there

781
00:32:05,348 --> 00:32:07,326
are ways that you can kind of break the

782
00:32:07,348 --> 00:32:09,054
bigger the problem of profit into sub

783
00:32:09,092 --> 00:32:12,560
problems and rather than having

784
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,298
everyone going towards profit ant the

785
00:32:15,304 --> 00:32:16,100
same time.

786
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,370
All right, so perfectly perfect setting

787
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,066
into organizational sense making. So

788
00:32:26,088 --> 00:32:27,522
I'll read this organizational sense

789
00:32:27,576 --> 00:32:29,282
making is not about optimally

790
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:31,394
approximating an objectively defined

791
00:32:31,442 --> 00:32:33,638
external reality but developing and

792
00:32:33,644 --> 00:32:35,574
enacting models of reality by way of top

793
00:32:35,612 --> 00:32:37,522
down, bottom up predictive coding.

794
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,638
Effectively the future arrives in the

795
00:32:39,644 --> 00:32:42,806
present and becomes the past. Time moves

796
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:44,406
at different rates in the brain's

797
00:32:44,438 --> 00:32:47,366
hierarchy as is true for the firm.

798
00:32:47,478 --> 00:32:49,942
While time has strictly no speed.

799
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:51,994
Humans project speed onto time as

800
00:32:52,032 --> 00:32:54,366
relations and interactions increase in

801
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:56,862
intensity and complexity. A firm's very

802
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:59,402
existence is determined by its curiosity

803
00:32:59,466 --> 00:33:02,074
field interaction with its external

804
00:33:02,122 --> 00:33:04,574
environment. Fast at the reflex low

805
00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:07,714
level I. E. Resource markets and more

806
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,242
slowly at higher cognitive levels I. E.

807
00:33:10,296 --> 00:33:12,994
Strategic decision making. And this

808
00:33:13,112 --> 00:33:16,686
reminds me of like a paper that Daniel

809
00:33:16,718 --> 00:33:20,740
and I have been working on and just how

810
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:24,386
temporarily active inference and the FEP

811
00:33:24,418 --> 00:33:27,670
operates at different fast and slow.

812
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,806
It kind of reminds me of how in pretty

813
00:33:32,828 --> 00:33:33,946
much every company I think I've ever

814
00:33:33,968 --> 00:33:36,054
worked ant there's always this tendency

815
00:33:36,102 --> 00:33:37,462
for the bottom rung of the organization

816
00:33:37,526 --> 00:33:38,938
to think that the top wrong are just

817
00:33:38,944 --> 00:33:41,210
like a bunch of flow bumbling idiots.

818
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,298
There's this temporal disconnect of the

819
00:33:44,304 --> 00:33:46,046
bottom rung of the organization is

820
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:47,738
getting feedback immediately and they're

821
00:33:47,754 --> 00:33:49,646
running little tiny experiments every

822
00:33:49,668 --> 00:33:50,926
single day where they're getting

823
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:53,098
immediate feedback whereas the top rung

824
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,066
is like the board. Maybe they're meeting

825
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:56,574
quarterly and then they have some

826
00:33:56,612 --> 00:33:58,174
mandate and they don't really get

827
00:33:58,212 --> 00:33:59,938
feedback synthesized to them until like

828
00:33:59,944 --> 00:34:01,998
another three months. And so there's

829
00:34:02,014 --> 00:34:03,714
always this tendency for there's always

830
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:05,570
this temporal disconnect and it always

831
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,454
creates this kind of boundary disconnect

832
00:34:07,502 --> 00:34:08,750
between the bottom and. Top of the

833
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,310
organization. This point

834
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,558
of time having no speed is quite

835
00:34:15,644 --> 00:34:18,726
interesting. We talk about the food is

836
00:34:18,748 --> 00:34:21,914
taking too slow or slower time

837
00:34:21,952 --> 00:34:24,698
scales. Faster time scales, longer

838
00:34:24,784 --> 00:34:28,486
distances. It feels natural

839
00:34:28,518 --> 00:34:32,170
to talk about the rate of speed,

840
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:36,560
but even without going into too much

841
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,614
reconceptualizations of speed, it just

842
00:34:39,652 --> 00:34:43,166
isn't necessarily that way. And then in

843
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:45,346
the brain as to like, time moves at

844
00:34:45,368 --> 00:34:46,286
different rates in the brain's

845
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:50,414
hierarchy, we could think about a neural

846
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:53,474
firing pattern that takes place over

847
00:34:53,512 --> 00:34:54,946
some number of milliseconds. And then

848
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:57,250
there's slower waves and rhythms.

849
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,446
They compose and they influence each

850
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:03,480
other. They're all happening at once.

851
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,478
Technically it's all happening in the

852
00:35:05,484 --> 00:35:07,382
same way at the same place, the same

853
00:35:07,436 --> 00:35:10,794
exact input outputs. But still

854
00:35:10,832 --> 00:35:13,146
it makes sense to talk about some of

855
00:35:13,168 --> 00:35:16,618
these slower or larger waves and some

856
00:35:16,704 --> 00:35:20,330
faster waves, like in the EEG rhythms.

857
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:25,758
So striking a balance between everything

858
00:35:25,844 --> 00:35:29,230
all at once, real time unfolding.

859
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,686
And then these day, week, month,

860
00:35:32,788 --> 00:35:36,658
year, decade, nested timescales is a

861
00:35:36,664 --> 00:35:38,340
big part of sense making.

862
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:47,240
Definitely. Okay, habits of mind. So I

863
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,576
like this because I've read good to

864
00:35:49,598 --> 00:35:51,976
great. The Jim Collins book. And when

865
00:35:51,998 --> 00:35:53,516
Tyler and I were first starting out this

866
00:35:53,538 --> 00:35:55,836
series, we talked about how that's very

867
00:35:55,938 --> 00:35:59,516
leader centric and very top down the

868
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:01,550
ideas that are presented in that book.

869
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,224
And so I was excited to see this book.

870
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:07,964
Good to great to Gone by Alan Wertzel.

871
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:10,464
I have not read it, but he talks about

872
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,524
companies like, I think specifically

873
00:36:12,572 --> 00:36:14,720
like Circuit City is the company,

874
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,384
right? Oh, yeah, it's here on the COVID

875
00:36:16,422 --> 00:36:18,336
of the book. But Circuit City was like

876
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:20,416
one of the companies that Jim Collins

877
00:36:20,448 --> 00:36:21,924
went through and Good to Great and then

878
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:24,148
now there is no more Circuit City. And

879
00:36:24,154 --> 00:36:26,596
so he, I guess, kind of outlines the

880
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:28,708
failings of what makes a good company a

881
00:36:28,714 --> 00:36:30,964
great company, and now they're obsolete

882
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:33,400
and maybe why they're obsolete. And so

883
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:37,896
he outlines these habits of mind and

884
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:39,384
I haven't read the book and I don't know

885
00:36:39,422 --> 00:36:41,276
enough, but they're listed here if you

886
00:36:41,298 --> 00:36:43,948
want to read them and maybe read the

887
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:47,324
book. But these habits of mind that are

888
00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:51,630
necessary to stay relevant maybe

889
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,712
so. Bijan says that habits of mind may

890
00:36:55,766 --> 00:36:58,256
equally explain why upper echelon is

891
00:36:58,278 --> 00:37:00,656
generally resisting strategy process as

892
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:03,216
a matter of top down, bottom up,

893
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:06,016
prediction, error, implication. And he

894
00:37:06,038 --> 00:37:08,608
goes on to make the claim that five out

895
00:37:08,614 --> 00:37:11,252
of work sold. Twelve habits of mind are

896
00:37:11,306 --> 00:37:13,216
foundational to prediction processing

897
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:15,492
framework, fostering success of

898
00:37:15,546 --> 00:37:18,304
strategic renewal. And he briefly

899
00:37:18,352 --> 00:37:20,628
summarizes these habits. Tyler, do you

900
00:37:20,634 --> 00:37:23,768
want to read these for us? Sure. So,

901
00:37:23,854 --> 00:37:25,944
first one be humble, run scared. So

902
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:27,416
continuously doubt your understanding of

903
00:37:27,438 --> 00:37:29,448
things. Business success contains the

904
00:37:29,454 --> 00:37:31,912
seeds of its own destruction. Two,

905
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:33,836
curiosity sustains the cat. The world is

906
00:37:33,858 --> 00:37:35,624
constantly changing. Be open and curious

907
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:37,916
and stretch to learn from others. Three

908
00:37:38,018 --> 00:37:39,980
evidence trump's ideology. In business,

909
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,092
as in politics, decisions are too often

910
00:37:42,146 --> 00:37:43,724
based on unproven assumptions about what

911
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,484
works and what doesn't. We all need

912
00:37:45,522 --> 00:37:46,604
operating assumptions about human

913
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:48,624
nature, the economy and the like. But

914
00:37:48,662 --> 00:37:49,996
when things do not work out as planned,

915
00:37:50,028 --> 00:37:51,296
we need to determine whether our

916
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:52,896
assumptions were based on evidence or

917
00:37:52,918 --> 00:37:56,236
ideology. Four confront the Ronen facts.

918
00:37:56,348 --> 00:37:57,796
The worst person you can fool is

919
00:37:57,818 --> 00:37:59,616
yourself. Ignoring or denying reality

920
00:37:59,648 --> 00:38:01,984
does not help it go away. Five chasing

921
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:04,516
possible dream do not be limited by the

922
00:38:04,538 --> 00:38:06,310
tyranny of the or.

923
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,168
So I thought this was cool. I think a

924
00:38:12,174 --> 00:38:14,536
lot of these habits of mind speak to the

925
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:17,076
ability to rewire the plane while flying

926
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:20,368
it. I don't know what the Dean stressed

927
00:38:20,404 --> 00:38:22,396
earlier in the chapter. Do you guys have

928
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:24,590
any additional comments here?

929
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:33,850
All right. Okay. So another

930
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,820
claim, and this might be who might be

931
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,582
getting close to agent? Okay. Bijan says

932
00:38:39,636 --> 00:38:42,266
it is the circular causality of belief

933
00:38:42,298 --> 00:38:44,014
propagation message passing where

934
00:38:44,052 --> 00:38:45,434
prediction processing framework

935
00:38:45,482 --> 00:38:47,214
effectiveness in the organizational

936
00:38:47,262 --> 00:38:49,234
context most likely breaks down.

937
00:38:49,352 --> 00:38:51,246
Neither the bottom up message passing

938
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:53,554
nor the top down belief propagation are

939
00:38:53,592 --> 00:38:56,194
unobstructed. We fail to appreciate how

940
00:38:56,232 --> 00:38:58,546
organizational friction, which he

941
00:38:58,728 --> 00:39:00,920
defines as high levels of free energy,

942
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,022
compromise firm performance due to,

943
00:39:04,156 --> 00:39:06,646
first, top down enforced predictions and

944
00:39:06,668 --> 00:39:08,786
prediction models that are not receptive

945
00:39:08,818 --> 00:39:11,654
to bottom up challenge. Second, leak top

946
00:39:11,692 --> 00:39:13,522
down, bottom up lateral generative

947
00:39:13,586 --> 00:39:15,866
sensing and sense we can capabilities in

948
00:39:15,888 --> 00:39:17,338
the form of error signaling and

949
00:39:17,344 --> 00:39:19,782
processing and third, poor communication

950
00:39:19,846 --> 00:39:21,386
and absence of a language that is

951
00:39:21,408 --> 00:39:23,766
suitable to leverage prediction

952
00:39:23,798 --> 00:39:25,546
processing framework for strategic

953
00:39:25,578 --> 00:39:29,406
renewal. So I thought that that was kind

954
00:39:29,428 --> 00:39:33,374
of neat, like how

955
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:36,606
these are the faults, right? And then he

956
00:39:36,628 --> 00:39:39,374
goes on to say, in the organizational

957
00:39:39,422 --> 00:39:41,214
context, prediction processing framework

958
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:43,102
is determined by three categorical

959
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:45,442
imperatives. And I've abbreviated these

960
00:39:45,496 --> 00:39:46,898
kind of just shortening them so that

961
00:39:46,904 --> 00:39:49,006
they fit on the slide. First, upper

962
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:50,566
echelon's prediction models and

963
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,214
corresponding predictions must be

964
00:39:52,252 --> 00:39:54,610
explainable and explicitly articulated.

965
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:58,934
And yeah,

966
00:39:58,972 --> 00:40:00,626
so that goes into the communication

967
00:40:00,738 --> 00:40:03,546
salience prioritization. He says the

968
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,434
language and Communications layers are

969
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:07,846
critical to resource conversation, firm

970
00:40:07,878 --> 00:40:10,214
performance, and eventually firm

971
00:40:10,262 --> 00:40:13,466
survival. He also says each of the

972
00:40:13,488 --> 00:40:16,474
hierarchical layers must have formal and

973
00:40:16,512 --> 00:40:18,254
informal interfaces that couple each

974
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:20,222
layer to the next layer. For a given

975
00:40:20,276 --> 00:40:22,254
hierarchical structure of a firm to have

976
00:40:22,292 --> 00:40:24,862
any legitimacy, generative, top down,

977
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:26,894
bottom up sensing and sense making at

978
00:40:26,932 --> 00:40:29,182
every hierarchical level should equally

979
00:40:29,246 --> 00:40:30,978
make sense before an error message

980
00:40:31,064 --> 00:40:33,426
travels to the next level. There should

981
00:40:33,448 --> 00:40:35,682
not and cannot be any bypassing of

982
00:40:35,736 --> 00:40:38,686
hierarchical layers. I guess that's,

983
00:40:38,718 --> 00:40:41,654
like, don't go over someone's head. But

984
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:45,174
also, I wonder about

985
00:40:45,212 --> 00:40:47,638
the bypassing, about the information

986
00:40:47,724 --> 00:40:49,846
flow and the throughput and how big does

987
00:40:49,868 --> 00:40:52,006
that channel have to be? And lastly, he

988
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:53,786
says the firm's generative model is the

989
00:40:53,808 --> 00:40:55,546
firm's eco niche. When we perceive the

990
00:40:55,568 --> 00:40:57,494
world as uncertain and unpredictable,

991
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,338
it is a mere reflection of the

992
00:40:59,344 --> 00:41:02,086
inadequacy of our generative reality

993
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:05,822
model. So I think that that's how to

994
00:41:05,876 --> 00:41:07,966
avoid the errors mentioned in the

995
00:41:07,988 --> 00:41:09,310
previous slide.

996
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,222
Any comments here. Final thoughts on the

997
00:41:14,276 --> 00:41:17,934
material. One thought is I like number

998
00:41:17,972 --> 00:41:19,406
one, we're talking about how you get to

999
00:41:19,428 --> 00:41:21,114
articulate and communicate top down,

1000
00:41:21,172 --> 00:41:22,962
like what your actual model is so it can

1001
00:41:23,016 --> 00:41:24,638
be challenged. And something that I've

1002
00:41:24,654 --> 00:41:26,386
noticed is that oftentimes people will

1003
00:41:26,408 --> 00:41:27,986
communicate their predictions, but not

1004
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:30,066
necessarily how those predictions were

1005
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,682
generated or the components of that,

1006
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:32,926
like the components of the assumptions

1007
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,786
that went into that prediction. And that

1008
00:41:34,808 --> 00:41:36,198
makes it really hard for other levels of

1009
00:41:36,204 --> 00:41:38,006
the hierarchy to even know what was

1010
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:39,606
going on and what they should be

1011
00:41:39,628 --> 00:41:41,126
challenging at all. And a lot of times

1012
00:41:41,148 --> 00:41:42,486
you'll just assume like, okay, they

1013
00:41:42,508 --> 00:41:43,254
probably know what they're talking

1014
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,758
about, they're the experts, so let's

1015
00:41:44,774 --> 00:41:46,634
just hope for the best. But I really

1016
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:48,106
like that he said no, you have to

1017
00:41:48,128 --> 00:41:50,426
explicitly say what your model is so it

1018
00:41:50,448 --> 00:41:51,450
can be challenged.

1019
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,800
To the going over someone's head.

1020
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,550
On a previous slide it said

1021
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,014
organizational friction is high free

1022
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,806
energy. We might want to finesse that by

1023
00:42:03,828 --> 00:42:06,078
saying relatively high free energy

1024
00:42:06,164 --> 00:42:07,618
because in general we're not interested

1025
00:42:07,704 --> 00:42:10,850
in the absolute value of a free energy

1026
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,886
calculation, but rather the gradients

1027
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,642
and the direction at which we could act

1028
00:42:16,696 --> 00:42:20,338
to improve or increase it. So it's not

1029
00:42:20,344 --> 00:42:21,446
about the total amount, it's about the

1030
00:42:21,468 --> 00:42:23,606
relative amount. So let's just say it

1031
00:42:23,628 --> 00:42:25,586
turned out that somebody from an.org

1032
00:42:25,618 --> 00:42:27,366
chart perspective did go over their

1033
00:42:27,388 --> 00:42:30,294
head. That could be understood as a

1034
00:42:30,332 --> 00:42:33,914
policy selection authorized or dot two,

1035
00:42:34,032 --> 00:42:37,158
structurally rewire the communication

1036
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,802
architecture of the firm. Now that

1037
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:43,834
rewiring in a situation may

1038
00:42:43,872 --> 00:42:45,934
be associated with a decrease in

1039
00:42:45,972 --> 00:42:48,046
organizational friction and therefore a

1040
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,894
decrease in the free energy. So it may

1041
00:42:50,932 --> 00:42:53,738
be an adaptive decision because no chaos

1042
00:42:53,834 --> 00:42:56,786
is the final word. But that doesn't mean

1043
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:59,982
that every time somebody tries to rewire

1044
00:43:00,046 --> 00:43:02,354
the Communications architectures, it

1045
00:43:02,392 --> 00:43:05,634
would decrease friction if people were

1046
00:43:05,672 --> 00:43:07,938
just getting all these side messages and

1047
00:43:08,024 --> 00:43:10,038
there would be so many issues as well.

1048
00:43:10,124 --> 00:43:13,606
So it's not to say to do or not to

1049
00:43:13,628 --> 00:43:16,534
do. It's giving the areas of

1050
00:43:16,572 --> 00:43:19,074
consideration, the structure, cognitive

1051
00:43:19,122 --> 00:43:23,114
and capacity oriented aspects that we

1052
00:43:23,152 --> 00:43:27,674
can have that ongoing conversation and

1053
00:43:27,712 --> 00:43:31,194
some principles that help us take

1054
00:43:31,232 --> 00:43:35,294
selection and still do things in an

1055
00:43:35,332 --> 00:43:38,110
uncertain world with this little fun

1056
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,278
caveat that the perception of the world

1057
00:43:41,364 --> 00:43:43,822
as uncertain and unpredictable is

1058
00:43:43,876 --> 00:43:45,534
actually and inadequacy of our

1059
00:43:45,652 --> 00:43:48,894
generative reality. I mean, even

1060
00:43:48,932 --> 00:43:50,986
skipping different levels of hierarchy

1061
00:43:51,018 --> 00:43:52,206
could be something that you explicitly

1062
00:43:52,238 --> 00:43:54,254
plan for as well and build processes

1063
00:43:54,302 --> 00:43:56,306
around. So for example, I worked at a

1064
00:43:56,328 --> 00:43:58,274
company that they call it like the big

1065
00:43:58,312 --> 00:44:00,178
red button. Whereas if you were at the

1066
00:44:00,184 --> 00:44:01,586
bottom right of the organization and you

1067
00:44:01,608 --> 00:44:02,686
saw something that was going terribly

1068
00:44:02,718 --> 00:44:04,934
wrong, you could basically push this big

1069
00:44:04,972 --> 00:44:07,638
red button and it would file this report

1070
00:44:07,724 --> 00:44:10,066
directly to the C suite and would skip

1071
00:44:10,098 --> 00:44:11,126
all the levels and then they would

1072
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,494
follow up with you directly. And so they

1073
00:44:13,532 --> 00:44:15,354
explicitly said like, hey, we know that

1074
00:44:15,472 --> 00:44:16,598
there can be things that are shielded

1075
00:44:16,614 --> 00:44:18,042
from our view and we want to know about

1076
00:44:18,096 --> 00:44:20,566
it. And they build a process explicitly

1077
00:44:20,598 --> 00:44:21,500
around it.

1078
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,766
Sorry. Go ahead, Daniel. That reminds me

1079
00:44:26,788 --> 00:44:30,254
of cells signaling. And then the

1080
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,206
ultimate red button is like when the

1081
00:44:32,228 --> 00:44:34,222
cellular contents are spilling out,

1082
00:44:34,356 --> 00:44:36,654
it's like my only message to share is

1083
00:44:36,692 --> 00:44:39,966
that I am no longer and all

1084
00:44:39,988 --> 00:44:42,338
my insides are spilling on to you. So

1085
00:44:42,344 --> 00:44:44,046
it's like if there's a protein that's

1086
00:44:44,078 --> 00:44:46,606
usually internal and you're being bathed

1087
00:44:46,638 --> 00:44:49,166
in it, that's the red button that you

1088
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:51,750
needed. So, yes, that kind of emergence

1089
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:54,710
or conditional rewiring,

1090
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:00,690
maybe there's many patterns and motifs

1091
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:02,986
where we might want to embed that kind

1092
00:45:03,008 --> 00:45:05,322
of flexibility. Hinton the

1093
00:45:05,376 --> 00:45:07,594
Communications architectures. So even

1094
00:45:07,632 --> 00:45:09,942
though it is a dynamic Communications

1095
00:45:10,006 --> 00:45:12,406
architecture at a higher level, it's

1096
00:45:12,438 --> 00:45:14,854
actually not changing in its dynamics.

1097
00:45:14,902 --> 00:45:16,334
Like, different people are going to be

1098
00:45:16,372 --> 00:45:18,654
in different video calls, but that

1099
00:45:18,692 --> 00:45:19,882
doesn't mean that the Communications

1100
00:45:19,946 --> 00:45:22,366
architectural plan is changing. It just

1101
00:45:22,388 --> 00:45:24,526
means that different individuals are

1102
00:45:24,548 --> 00:45:25,870
connected differently.

1103
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,182
So in terms of sharing the model,

1104
00:45:31,236 --> 00:45:33,120
Tyler, when you were talking about

1105
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,370
sharing how the top level will share

1106
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,806
their predictions, but not necessarily

1107
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:39,374
how those predictions were generated,

1108
00:45:39,502 --> 00:45:42,286
I'm, like, really reminded of academic

1109
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:45,282
research in which it's like, I feel like

1110
00:45:45,336 --> 00:45:47,494
everyone is so, like, shielded from

1111
00:45:47,532 --> 00:45:49,046
what's going on. Like, you have the

1112
00:45:49,068 --> 00:45:50,838
principal investigator, they write a

1113
00:45:50,844 --> 00:45:51,974
grant. The grant has like, three

1114
00:45:52,012 --> 00:45:54,550
specific games. Just an example. So then

1115
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,866
those three specific games, each grad

1116
00:45:56,898 --> 00:45:58,186
student will be working on one of the

1117
00:45:58,208 --> 00:45:59,898
aims, right? Or maybe they'll have a

1118
00:45:59,904 --> 00:46:01,498
team working on achieving one of the

1119
00:46:01,504 --> 00:46:03,514
three specific aims. Right? And like,

1120
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,754
these teams are doing totally, like,

1121
00:46:05,792 --> 00:46:07,174
work that they think is totally

1122
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,810
unrelated. Like, they have no idea,

1123
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,478
like, the overarching process of the

1124
00:46:10,484 --> 00:46:13,546
grant. I wonder how often the Pi shares

1125
00:46:13,658 --> 00:46:16,046
the entire grant with every student.

1126
00:46:16,228 --> 00:46:18,250
That's not something that I typically

1127
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:20,378
see. And I think that there's a lot of

1128
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:22,434
shielding going on and I don't really

1129
00:46:22,472 --> 00:46:25,186
know why. Is it because it's just too

1130
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:27,474
much information or because they just

1131
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:29,570
want the focus to be on that one thing

1132
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,506
they want the students to have this

1133
00:46:31,528 --> 00:46:33,934
myopic view, and I just wonder Daniel,

1134
00:46:33,982 --> 00:46:35,718
what is your experience there? Do you

1135
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:38,214
think that PiS generally share the

1136
00:46:38,252 --> 00:46:40,134
entire model or they just share a piece

1137
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,406
of it? What is your experience, and do

1138
00:46:42,428 --> 00:46:43,450
you think that that makes research

1139
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,570
dysfunctional?

1140
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:48,700
Interesting? I've seen some

1141
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:52,522
investigators who shared the grants or

1142
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,874
other encoding strategy documents or

1143
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:57,998
not. It reminds me of a computer

1144
00:46:58,084 --> 00:47:01,722
program. Like if you could perfectly

1145
00:47:01,786 --> 00:47:04,394
isolate every variable and for loop,

1146
00:47:04,442 --> 00:47:06,846
and you can really clearly say, this is

1147
00:47:06,868 --> 00:47:08,946
the scope of this script and all of

1148
00:47:08,968 --> 00:47:13,346
that. That may work in a computer

1149
00:47:13,528 --> 00:47:16,674
system, but humans are

1150
00:47:16,712 --> 00:47:19,362
always curious about the concept and the

1151
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:21,426
past and the culture and alternate

1152
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:24,822
futures. So that kind of

1153
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:27,122
strict indoctrination, encapsulation

1154
00:47:27,186 --> 00:47:30,818
approach might increase overhead,

1155
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:34,246
decrease concept, have to spend a lot of

1156
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,980
time re explaining things.

1157
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,928
It's not that one strategy is going to

1158
00:47:40,934 --> 00:47:42,672
be, in general, better than the other,

1159
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:46,428
but it seems like it could be a better

1160
00:47:46,534 --> 00:47:49,780
professional conversation if the lab

1161
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,724
strategy governance were framed in a way

1162
00:47:52,762 --> 00:47:55,360
that accounting for people's differences

1163
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,132
in, like, familiarity with grant writing

1164
00:47:59,216 --> 00:48:01,912
or with experiment design, at least

1165
00:48:01,966 --> 00:48:05,188
giving lab level awareness. Doesn't seem

1166
00:48:05,204 --> 00:48:08,356
like it'd be a bad thing. Yeah, there's

1167
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:11,352
an analogous problem within a business

1168
00:48:11,406 --> 00:48:12,728
organization and some of the type of

1169
00:48:12,734 --> 00:48:14,708
like OKRs, where you take this big goal

1170
00:48:14,724 --> 00:48:16,476
you have, let's say it's growth and you

1171
00:48:16,498 --> 00:48:18,184
split it up into sub component parts.

1172
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,996
So one problem I've had in one

1173
00:48:20,018 --> 00:48:20,936
organization actually multiple

1174
00:48:20,968 --> 00:48:22,744
organizations, is on the growth funnel.

1175
00:48:22,792 --> 00:48:24,476
So like how you get leads and then how

1176
00:48:24,498 --> 00:48:27,304
you convert them into actual conversions

1177
00:48:27,352 --> 00:48:30,672
and sales. Right? And so what often

1178
00:48:30,726 --> 00:48:31,984
happens is that there's a trade off

1179
00:48:32,022 --> 00:48:33,648
between getting more leads and the

1180
00:48:33,654 --> 00:48:35,456
quality of those leads. And so what

1181
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:36,880
you'll do is you'll have a top level

1182
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,244
growth initiative, like we have to grow

1183
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:40,404
by 10% and then you're like cool. Like

1184
00:48:40,442 --> 00:48:43,076
marketing people increase your leads and

1185
00:48:43,098 --> 00:48:45,876
then product people increase the

1186
00:48:45,898 --> 00:48:48,148
conversion on this funnel. But what

1187
00:48:48,234 --> 00:48:49,508
actually happens though is if the

1188
00:48:49,514 --> 00:48:51,408
marketing team increases their leads,

1189
00:48:51,424 --> 00:48:54,276
they often get more poor quality leads.

1190
00:48:54,308 --> 00:48:55,880
Like you're dipping into lower quality

1191
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:57,816
leads to increase your leads. And so

1192
00:48:57,838 --> 00:48:59,812
that actually reduces the conversation

1193
00:48:59,956 --> 00:49:02,248
of the next step of the funnel. And so

1194
00:49:02,334 --> 00:49:04,264
they're both narrowly optimized on their

1195
00:49:04,302 --> 00:49:05,724
one little piece of the puzzle, but they

1196
00:49:05,762 --> 00:49:07,356
actually really directly impact each

1197
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:08,876
other. And then you get into these like

1198
00:49:08,898 --> 00:49:10,764
really painful conversations between

1199
00:49:10,882 --> 00:49:13,464
your marketing team and your growth

1200
00:49:13,512 --> 00:49:15,436
product team, which is like really like

1201
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:17,244
if they were just had this like more

1202
00:49:17,282 --> 00:49:18,668
holistic view to begin with, it's like,

1203
00:49:18,674 --> 00:49:20,172
no, we're just trying to grow guys.

1204
00:49:20,226 --> 00:49:21,856
Like that's what we're trying to do. We

1205
00:49:21,878 --> 00:49:23,136
don't care about your little piece of

1206
00:49:23,158 --> 00:49:25,616
the puzzle. And so there's often this

1207
00:49:25,638 --> 00:49:28,292
time where by breaking things off too

1208
00:49:28,346 --> 00:49:30,688
narrowly, you really miss the bigger

1209
00:49:30,704 --> 00:49:32,550
picture. And this is super common.

1210
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,110
Yeah.

1211
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,932
Well, having the a priori

1212
00:49:43,076 --> 00:49:46,920
partitioning means that you are saying

1213
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:47,610
like.

1214
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,708
Not. Even the structure of the problem

1215
00:49:53,794 --> 00:49:56,412
is going to change again, if you only

1216
00:49:56,466 --> 00:49:58,590
have to partition the problem one time,

1217
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,420
then maybe it can be cut and dry.

1218
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,624
But those kinds of dependencies are

1219
00:50:06,662 --> 00:50:09,920
why we need these kinds of composable

1220
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,392
partitioning strategies so that

1221
00:50:13,446 --> 00:50:16,416
different parts of a Bayes graph can be

1222
00:50:16,438 --> 00:50:19,108
identified because we're looking at a

1223
00:50:19,114 --> 00:50:21,956
lot of text, but all of these notions of

1224
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:23,990
a generative model, generative process.

1225
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,336
We can also see that kind of a Bayes

1226
00:50:28,368 --> 00:50:30,972
graph representation in the background,

1227
00:50:31,136 --> 00:50:32,824
especially as these types of

1228
00:50:32,862 --> 00:50:34,970
perspectives move closer to application.

1229
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:41,528
Awesome. Well, that's the end of the

1230
00:50:41,614 --> 00:50:44,088
content here for chapter six. We will

1231
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:47,228
delve into chapter seven next week.

1232
00:50:47,394 --> 00:50:49,516
Unless you guys have any final things to

1233
00:50:49,538 --> 00:50:52,844
say, that's it for me. So thanks for,

1234
00:50:52,882 --> 00:50:54,332
for being here. And I'm looking forward

1235
00:50:54,386 --> 00:50:56,540
to Carrying on Pushing forward,

1236
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:57,772
learning more about free energy

1237
00:50:57,826 --> 00:51:00,364
governance and future discussions with

1238
00:51:00,402 --> 00:51:01,260
the author.

1239
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:10,140
All right, thank you. Till next time.
