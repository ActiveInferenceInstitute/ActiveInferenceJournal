00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,910
Hello and welcome everyone. It's

2
00:00:09,955 --> 00:00:13,390
December 6, 2022. We're in ActInf

3
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:17,312
Livestream number 001.01, a

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,415
numbering convention that will be

5
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:22,910
explained soon. It's a discussion on the

6
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:24,610
book "Governing Continuous Transformation:

7
00:00:24,655 --> 00:00:27,225
by Bijan Khezrey. And I'll pass the Bleu.

8
00:00:30,162 --> 00:00:32,427
Hi everyone. I guess that's my job is to

9
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:35,247
explain the bookstream numbering. So

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,617
this is our first bookstream. That's why

11
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:39,822
it's bookstream zero, zero, one. And

12
00:00:39,855 --> 00:00:42,827
this is our first Dot-Zero contextualization

13
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:45,822
video for this bookstream series. So

14
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:48,167
each week we will present a chapter-ish,

15
00:00:48,227 --> 00:00:51,327
- a chapter or so - of the book. And then

16
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:53,502
periodically we will get together for

17
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:57,492
the dot one,

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,987
dot two and so forth. Those discussion

19
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:02,012
action. So if you want to participate

20
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:04,287
either in a contextualization video or

21
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,332
in a discussion video, please get in

22
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:09,102
touch with us and we would love to have

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,077
you on the stream. And I'm Bleu. I've

24
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:13,577
been here before so hopefully you've

25
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,792
seen me before and know me by now. And

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,547
I'm an independent researcher in New

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,092
Mexico and I will pass it off to Tyler.

28
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,232
First time appearance, I think, in the

29
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:25,307
active Coherence Institute. So Tyler,

30
00:01:25,322 --> 00:01:26,652
do you want to introduce yourself?

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,332
Yeah. Cool. Thanks for having me. This

32
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:30,107
is my first time here, active inference

33
00:01:30,122 --> 00:01:32,307
lab. So I have an unusual background. I

34
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,827
actually dot one from an academic

35
00:01:33,857 --> 00:01:35,352
background at all. A lot chaos been

36
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,392
about applied governance. So I actually

37
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,567
started as a strategy consultant working

38
00:01:39,615 --> 00:01:41,957
in major correlation. More recently

39
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:44,127
gotten more into Dow governance. I

40
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,752
currently lead product and protocol

41
00:01:45,782 --> 00:01:47,697
design for the 4K protocol. It's a

42
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,622
project that's connecting the physical

43
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:51,452
world to the on chain world. And I'm

44
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:53,352
also a contributor at Metagov where I

45
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,497
think about how we can model these

46
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:59,142
abstract formalisms about governance in

47
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,732
a real world setting. It's a lot of

48
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:02,322
times I think about Dow governance but

49
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,642
most recently it's Beren thinking about

50
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,567
active inference and implications for

51
00:02:06,615 --> 00:02:07,987
real world settings.

52
00:02:12,987 --> 00:02:16,742
Conor awesome. So we are a participatory

53
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:19,187
online lab that is communicating,

54
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:21,032
learning and practicing applied active

55
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:23,202
coherence. These are all of our media

56
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:25,947
links and we will be recording and

57
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,567
archiving this Livestream for future

58
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:30,417
reference. Everyone is welcome and

59
00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:31,947
hopefully we will be following good

60
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,297
etiquette for live streams and not

61
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,202
arguing or talking over each other for

62
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,312
the duration of the bookstreams.

63
00:02:39,837 --> 00:02:43,982
Okay, so this is our first book stream.

64
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:47,052
Our goal is to learn and discuss this

65
00:02:47,145 --> 00:02:48,872
textbook governing Continuous

66
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:51,467
Transformation reframing the strategy

67
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:54,717
Coherence conversation. It's a 2022 book

68
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,572
by Bijan Kesri and this video like

69
00:02:58,605 --> 00:03:00,777
always is just an introduction to some

70
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:03,267
of the ideas, not a review or a final

71
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:06,447
word at all. So we will just go through

72
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,842
here the sections of this bookstream

73
00:03:09,902 --> 00:03:11,382
we're going to do the Bookmap and the

74
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:14,507
roadmap, some keywords, the preface,

75
00:03:14,597 --> 00:03:16,772
part one and chapter one will be covered

76
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:18,972
in today's video and in the coming weeks

77
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:20,712
we will be continuum to discuss this.

78
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:23,177
So get in touch if you want to partake

79
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:26,442
in these conversations. So I guess we

80
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,987
introduction ourselves briefly

81
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:33,432
backwards. So if either you guys want to

82
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:34,967
maybe mention something you're excited

83
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:36,602
about or that you liked or remembered

84
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:38,887
from the book from these first sessions,

85
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,927
otherwise we can go on to discover it.

86
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:43,847
I think we have a lot of material.

87
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:45,700
Tyler, what are you most excited about?

88
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:47,562
Yeah. I mean, I think for me,

89
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,127
especially being in real world

90
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:52,632
organizations, nonprofits, a lot of

91
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:54,027
times we think of uncertainty as

92
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:55,257
something that can be wished away or

93
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,547
something that we're incrementally going

94
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,047
to solve. Like, oh, if we only were

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,477
collecting more information, we would be

96
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:02,472
in a better spot, or we had more

97
00:04:02,505 --> 00:04:04,647
capabilities, we wouldn't have this

98
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,022
problem. But a lot of times we kind of

99
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:10,172
get very anxious about that uncertainty

100
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:11,402
rather than we're an active

101
00:04:11,432 --> 00:04:12,767
infrastructure force. Energy governance,

102
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:14,202
that uncertainty is placed at the

103
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,552
center, and it's something you can

104
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,652
actually take ownership over but also be

105
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,952
a source of creative growth. And so I

106
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,122
think that's really exciting and

107
00:04:22,155 --> 00:04:24,732
inspirational and really excited to be

108
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:27,402
here today. Cool. I'm excited, too, to

109
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,077
unify some of the concepts of active

110
00:04:30,107 --> 00:04:31,647
inference with governance, which I know

111
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,192
a little bit about, but not very much.

112
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,547
And now that we're formalizing our

113
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,082
structure as an institutional entity in

114
00:04:38,085 --> 00:04:40,502
active Inference Lab Institute, I'm

115
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:41,972
excited to learn more about governance

116
00:04:42,017 --> 00:04:43,825
and how things should work.

117
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:48,342
Okay, so this book has four parts. So

118
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,697
we're here. We're not even in part one

119
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,932
yet, but we're going to go over to the

120
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:54,657
beginning of part one today. So part one

121
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,297
is reframing the strategy governance

122
00:04:56,342 --> 00:04:58,647
conversation. Part two is about free

123
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,202
energy governance, and part three is a

124
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,627
conclusion for the book. And then there

125
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:06,147
are some interviews in Parr four, along

126
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,547
with acknowledgements and analog. And

127
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,247
this is from the Bookmap software. So

128
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,077
this is like our roadmap for a book.

129
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,627
But this Bookmap software is used in

130
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:17,022
trading. So if you guys have never seen

131
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:18,942
it, that's what these graphs are from.

132
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,547
So when I think about Bookmap, I always

133
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,017
think about that. Okay, so our roadmap

134
00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:26,247
for today. So we're going to get into

135
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,697
the preface. There are no action

136
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:30,452
headings, so we just kind of chunked

137
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:33,357
out, like, what makes sense in terms of

138
00:05:33,435 --> 00:05:35,207
the text and how it reads. So we're

139
00:05:35,222 --> 00:05:37,527
going to go over a summary of FET, how

140
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,702
to ground firms in the framework of

141
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,167
active inference, strategy governance

142
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:44,922
models versus meta governance, the

143
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:46,737
triplet structure of free Energy

144
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,127
governance, and then realist and anti

145
00:05:49,157 --> 00:05:52,167
realist in Management science. And then

146
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:54,312
just a brief intro to part one. And then

147
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,592
chapter one, which is pretty short

148
00:05:56,715 --> 00:05:58,862
thinking, born of Curiosity, Revolt,

149
00:05:58,937 --> 00:06:02,472
and change. So here is a

150
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:06,137
huge list of preorders of keywords

151
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:08,247
that we're going to get into today. And

152
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,600
I think Tyler is going to start us off

153
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,112
in section one in the preface, in the

154
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:15,842
summary of the free energy principle,

155
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:17,937
tyler is going to start us off talking

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,162
about the FEP.

157
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:29,030
Tyler. All right,

158
00:06:29,152 --> 00:06:30,790
so the free energy principle, or FEP,

159
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,185
as we're going to be calling it, this is

160
00:06:33,217 --> 00:06:34,985
John's definition that he gives in the

161
00:06:35,017 --> 00:06:38,320
preface. So the FEP is a mathematical

162
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,935
formulation that explains from first

163
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,465
principles the characteristics of

164
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:43,340
biological systems that are able to

165
00:06:43,357 --> 00:06:46,070
resist decay and persist over time. It

166
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,560
rests on the idea that all biological

167
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:49,255
systems instantiate a hierarchical,

168
00:06:49,315 --> 00:06:50,990
generative model of the world and

169
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:52,465
personally minimizes its internal

170
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,512
entropy by minimizing free energy.

171
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,737
Bleu anything you want to add there?

172
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,830
No, I think it's best. Like, we could

173
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:03,035
take a deep dive into the FEP. There are

174
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:05,240
many live streams where that's done. So

175
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:06,740
if you want to learn more about the free

176
00:07:06,757 --> 00:07:08,705
energy principle, I would just refer out

177
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:10,415
to other live streams. It's best here to

178
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:12,940
take what Bijan presents, the aspects

179
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,810
that he's using, and go forward from

180
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:18,205
there. Cool. And I think similarly,

181
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:20,135
we'll do a similar cursory treatment of

182
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:23,015
Markoblindas. And so Markov blanket, we

183
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:24,395
could think about it is that it's a

184
00:07:24,472 --> 00:07:26,510
statistical correlation for defining the

185
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:29,165
internal versus the external. So the

186
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,970
definition that he gives is Markov

187
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:32,785
blanket's establish a conditional

188
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,340
independent between internal and

189
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:36,785
external states that renders the inside

190
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:39,215
open to the renders the inside open to

191
00:07:39,232 --> 00:07:40,780
the outside, but only in a conditional

192
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,205
sense. So the internal states only see

193
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:45,620
the external states through the veil of

194
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:48,310
the Markov blanket. Again, huge topic.

195
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:49,570
Not going to go super into it. What's

196
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:51,490
going to add anything? Bleu no, it's

197
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,280
great. And there are many live streams,

198
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:55,850
really, if you want to get into probably

199
00:07:55,912 --> 00:07:58,040
the Emperor's new Markov blanket. So

200
00:07:58,057 --> 00:07:59,615
it's maybe where we undertake, like, a

201
00:07:59,632 --> 00:08:02,215
very thorough discussion of the Markov

202
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:03,740
blanket. If you want more information

203
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:07,435
there. Cool. All right. So grounding

204
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,640
firms in the framework of active

205
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:13,490
inference. So here is a claim from

206
00:08:13,582 --> 00:08:16,225
the book. Learning to active coherence

207
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,160
will determine the firm's competitive

208
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:20,240
advantage and survival in a

209
00:08:20,257 --> 00:08:22,475
discontinuous and distributed world.

210
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:24,500
The more fluid the boundaries between

211
00:08:24,562 --> 00:08:26,825
firm and eco niche, the more important

212
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:28,940
the definition of what constitutes a

213
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:31,480
system and how nondisciplinative

214
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,165
Markovian boundary preserve the firm's

215
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:37,130
integrity. I e belief systems. Our

216
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:39,760
interest is shifting away from pursuing

217
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:41,980
deterministic truth through clever

218
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,440
analysis towards designing entailing a

219
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:47,885
generative selforganizing model that

220
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:50,890
empowers the firm to master the shifting

221
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,540
cognition independencies between the

222
00:08:53,557 --> 00:08:56,000
known and unknown and what lies within

223
00:08:56,062 --> 00:08:59,740
and beyond its control. So there's

224
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,150
a lot there. So I think these next

225
00:09:02,212 --> 00:09:04,730
keyword slides hopefully will unpack it

226
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:08,485
a little bit. Active inference,

227
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,520
which we've seen many times in active

228
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:13,400
inference lab institute, is a process

229
00:09:13,462 --> 00:09:14,900
theory grounded in the free energy

230
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:17,185
principle that explains behavior,

231
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:19,640
perception, planning, and action in

232
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:22,210
terms of probabilistic coherence.

233
00:09:22,405 --> 00:09:24,445
Bijan doesn't yet mention active

234
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,105
inference, but he talks about learning

235
00:09:26,152 --> 00:09:28,265
to actively, infer which I'm going to

236
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:30,675
actively infer means active inference.

237
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:34,180
And here we see this classic action

238
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:37,090
perception loop where we have internal

239
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,055
states and external states separated by

240
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:42,835
a Markov blanket or a nondisciplinative

241
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,120
Markovian boundary, and we have sensory

242
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,395
input and action. And these are the ways

243
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:51,410
in which an agent can interact with this

244
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:53,090
world. Do either of you guys have

245
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:54,587
anything to add here?

246
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,925
Daniel.

247
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,590
Sure. In that foraging,

248
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,085
I found it really interesting when

249
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:06,805
there's increased fluidity or fuzziness

250
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:09,410
or blurriness of the engagement of the

251
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,440
firm with the niche or the context of

252
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:16,025
the community. In those cases, it's like

253
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:18,670
more important to have and uncertainty

254
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,630
oriented definition of what the thing

255
00:10:20,677 --> 00:10:23,855
is. And that is what confronts every

256
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:26,237
organization today.

257
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:31,612
Yeah, interesting.

258
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,180
Okay, so he talked a little bit about

259
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:39,945
shifting away from deterministic truth.

260
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:42,835
And so I like Googled because I'm a

261
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,695
truth person, I'm weird about truth, if

262
00:10:44,697 --> 00:10:46,240
you've ever listened to me talk about it

263
00:10:46,257 --> 00:10:48,595
before. So deterministic truth is like

264
00:10:48,672 --> 00:10:52,435
the truth. And I liked this paper.

265
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:54,190
I just googled it. What do people talk

266
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:56,875
about? What is deterministic truth? And

267
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:58,925
I found this paper approaching

268
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:02,140
deterministic and Probabilistic truth a

269
00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:04,285
unified account. And in this paper,

270
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:07,390
it's a 2021 paper. So pretty new. In

271
00:11:07,407 --> 00:11:09,255
this paper, they talked about the truth

272
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:11,830
itself, like the truth being either

273
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:13,975
deterministic I think about that like

274
00:11:14,037 --> 00:11:16,300
hitting Abel's eye, like the truth is

275
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:19,065
the number seven. And then probabilistic

276
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,565
truth is more like a probability

277
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,750
distribution around that truth, like

278
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:24,775
hitting seven plus or minus the standard

279
00:11:24,837 --> 00:11:27,885
deviation or like a probability density.

280
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,925
Right. And this paper talks about,

281
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:32,640
like, deterministic and probabilistic

282
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,620
truth like that. The truth is one of

283
00:11:35,622 --> 00:11:37,135
those things. And then also there are

284
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,490
ways to approach it, like you're

285
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,560
approaching your search of the truth in

286
00:11:41,592 --> 00:11:43,210
either a determinalistic or

287
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:45,640
probabilistic way. So I thought that

288
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:47,410
this was an interesting read and kind of

289
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:49,215
you are interested in delving deeper

290
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:51,735
into, like, deterministic versus

291
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,400
probabilistic and these theories and

292
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:57,130
approaches and truth likeness. I thought

293
00:11:57,177 --> 00:12:01,135
this was a cool read. Yeah, I think.

294
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:03,865
Oh, sorry. One thing to add there is, I

295
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:06,415
think our personal ideas about what

296
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:07,540
truth are, like, whether it's

297
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:09,135
terminalistic versus a probabilistic

298
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,885
conception of truth really carry over

299
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:12,760
onto the organization level. And so

300
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:14,335
whatever kind of delusions you have

301
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,135
about your personal truth in your

302
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,055
personal life, a lot of times they view

303
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:20,160
the organization as like the CEO views

304
00:12:20,205 --> 00:12:21,955
the organization as an extension of

305
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:24,535
their own self. And so their own

306
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,015
worldview gets carried over and strapped

307
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:29,770
onto the organization's worldview. And

308
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:30,895
so it's really interesting that you

309
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:32,985
could kind of frame these philosophical

310
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,785
Dean about truth that are often applied

311
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,490
at an individual level and then kind of

312
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:37,840
like, scale that up into an

313
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:38,525
organization.

314
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,965
Yeah, very cool. And we see that in

315
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:48,690
this generative self organizing

316
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,470
model. Again, this is kind of like it

317
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:52,120
was cool to just search up what is a

318
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:54,535
self organizing model. And we see

319
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:57,310
generative model a lot. We don't really

320
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,080
see self organizing model. We see

321
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:00,880
generative model in terms of self

322
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:02,400
organization. But a generative

323
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:04,630
selforganizing model, like, what is this

324
00:13:04,677 --> 00:13:08,530
really? And so this is just from this

325
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:12,135
Stanford machine

326
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,440
learning cheat sheet. Supervised

327
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,400
learning cheat sheet. So here it says

328
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,905
discriminative models divide the data

329
00:13:17,952 --> 00:13:19,765
space into classes by learning the

330
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:21,040
boundaries. And this is like the

331
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:23,235
different neural networks, whereas

332
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,165
generative models understand how the

333
00:13:25,182 --> 00:13:27,715
data is embedded into the space like an

334
00:13:27,732 --> 00:13:29,755
auto encoding or boltsman machine or

335
00:13:29,802 --> 00:13:31,720
self organizing maps. So this is like a

336
00:13:31,722 --> 00:13:34,165
self organizing model. And you can

337
00:13:34,182 --> 00:13:36,405
really see here this is like a decision

338
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:37,735
boundary on the left in the

339
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:40,915
discriminative model and either it's a

340
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:44,185
cat or a dog. And on the right

341
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:46,960
there's a generative model like it's a

342
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,015
cat with some degree of certainty or

343
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:51,370
it's a dog with some degree of

344
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:53,020
certainty. And so you see these like

345
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:55,090
probability distributions. Like probably

346
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:56,785
it's a cat but then there's like some

347
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:58,720
fuzzy like if your data point lands like

348
00:13:58,722 --> 00:14:00,115
a little bit in the red or a little bit

349
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:01,915
in the Bleu, like then it might be a cat

350
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:03,195
or it might be a dog. Maybe we don't

351
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,695
have enough information to tell. So I

352
00:14:05,697 --> 00:14:08,025
thought that this was a cool replication

353
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,005
of the probabilistic truth versus

354
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:11,820
deterministic truth. Like either you're

355
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:13,555
looking for cat or dog or you're looking

356
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,820
for with what probability. Is this a cat

357
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,265
or a dog? Do you guys have anything to

358
00:14:18,282 --> 00:14:19,162
add here?

359
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:25,510
Cool. Okay, so this is moving on

360
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:28,700
out of this claim into the next claim.

361
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,875
The firm is envisioned as an inactive,

362
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,185
sophisticated and resource dependent

363
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,415
inference machine in the form of a

364
00:14:36,432 --> 00:14:38,490
generative learning model. Essentially

365
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:41,530
is a statistical model linking in

366
00:14:41,577 --> 00:14:44,145
circular causality action perception,

367
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:46,665
firm resources and the unknown external

368
00:14:46,695 --> 00:14:48,765
world. And I just put this active

369
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:50,620
inference loop up here again. So you

370
00:14:50,622 --> 00:14:52,965
have the firm and the world. The firm

371
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:54,115
would be the agent and then you have the

372
00:14:54,132 --> 00:14:55,615
resources of the firm which would be

373
00:14:55,632 --> 00:14:57,985
like the internal states and then the

374
00:14:58,017 --> 00:15:00,505
external world which is everything

375
00:15:00,552 --> 00:15:02,835
that's not the firm. And I highlighted

376
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,475
these terms inactive and sophisticated

377
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,062
because there's a dot, two unpack here,

378
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:10,090
and I think it's kind of in the

379
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:12,790
textbook. Maybe like, you can say the

380
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:14,830
words, but unless you open them up and

381
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:16,735
look what they mean inside, look inside

382
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:18,010
of them, like, you don't have any idea

383
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,960
the kind of Seth that goes behind these

384
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:23,590
things. Do you guys have

385
00:15:23,607 --> 00:15:25,087
anything to add there on that?

386
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,710
Enactivism is a position in cognitive

387
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:30,630
evidence that argues that cognition

388
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,835
arises through a dynamic interaction

389
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:35,230
between an acting organism and its

390
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:37,825
environment. And so these are the four

391
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:41,755
es of cognitive science or

392
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:44,325
cognition. And they're embodied,

393
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,285
active, extended and encultured. So

394
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:48,715
cognition is grounded in our senses and

395
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:51,775
concrete experience that's enacted means

396
00:15:51,837 --> 00:15:53,860
it's goal directed action in the real

397
00:15:53,892 --> 00:15:57,840
world. Extended is cognitive systems

398
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,740
include the tools, the devices, the

399
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:02,380
people around us, our smartphone, these

400
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:04,965
kinds of things and embedded or that's

401
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:06,805
kind of what we always refer to as

402
00:16:06,852 --> 00:16:08,545
encultured. But I think that they kind

403
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:10,510
of mean the same thing. So this is

404
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:12,385
cognition is woven into culture, and

405
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:14,715
learning is done in a social concept.

406
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,245
So these are the embodied so when you

407
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:20,590
say the firm is active yeah, that's it.

408
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:22,465
It's good for goal directed. It's doing

409
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,250
goal directed action in the real world,

410
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:27,795
inactive and sophisticated,

411
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:29,290
or do you guys have anything to add

412
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:30,910
there on the Four East? Okay,

413
00:16:31,092 --> 00:16:34,735
sophisticated is from this paper,

414
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:38,305
I believe, sophisticated inference by

415
00:16:38,352 --> 00:16:40,312
Friston and colleagues. And we've done

416
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,840
sophisticated aspects of inference, I

417
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:45,720
think, on a live stream, but I don't

418
00:16:45,735 --> 00:16:46,980
think we've ever done sophisticated

419
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,780
inference. But the aspect of inference

420
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,060
is like a later paper and covers this

421
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:55,765
one a lot. So sophisticated inference is

422
00:16:55,857 --> 00:16:59,140
really, like, in deep time. Right here,

423
00:16:59,232 --> 00:17:01,465
I'll just read the figure caption. So I

424
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:03,355
have this, like, decision tree model

425
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:06,640
picture from the paper, and it says this

426
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:08,935
schematic summarizes the accumulation of

427
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:11,515
expected free energy over past and

428
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:13,345
trajectories into the future. This can

429
00:17:13,347 --> 00:17:15,565
be construed as a deep tree search where

430
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:17,785
the tree branches of reliable actions at

431
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:20,055
each point in time and the likely

432
00:17:20,115 --> 00:17:22,800
outcomes consequent upon each action.

433
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,040
So this is 1234 time steps

434
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,640
here and going off. So this is like a

435
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:29,760
trajectory, the path of least action.

436
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,490
So we talk about the way that a

437
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:35,545
system can decide and go forward in

438
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,705
space. So that's what's meant by

439
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:39,412
sophisticated, I think.

440
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,255
Anil Seth, the purpose of introducing

441
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,860
these terms from cognitive evidence and

442
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:50,415
neuroscience like the four E cognition

443
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:53,650
and of this type of model, it's not

444
00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:56,550
a novel idea to make a decision tree.

445
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,830
That's how, for examples, early chess

446
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,855
playing, artificial intelligences work.

447
00:18:02,052 --> 00:18:04,360
It's the way that the expected free

448
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:07,285
energy can be calculated across these

449
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:09,805
different paths of consideration with

450
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:13,210
respect to a generative model that are

451
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,220
allowing new ways of thinking about

452
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:17,985
these kinds of deep time and nested

453
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,387
strategic questions.

454
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:26,100
Yeah, definitely. Okay,

455
00:18:26,987 --> 00:18:29,332
so temporal thickness and counter

456
00:18:29,347 --> 00:18:32,362
factual depth here in this claim,

457
00:18:32,437 --> 00:18:35,282
bishop says the proposal on offer here

458
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,592
is that the mind comes into being when

459
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,967
self evidence has a temporal thickness.

460
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:42,097
Models can be thicker and thinner,

461
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:43,967
deeper or shallower, depending on how

462
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:45,812
far forward they predict, or

463
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,377
counterfactuals depth, how far back they

464
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:49,997
postdict. That is, whether they can

465
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,977
capture how things might have ended up

466
00:18:51,995 --> 00:18:53,852
if they had acted differently. There is

467
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,952
no real reason for minds to exist. They

468
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,892
appear to do so simply because existence

469
00:18:57,952 --> 00:19:00,002
itself is the end point of a process of

470
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,362
reasoning. Consciousness, I'd contend,

471
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:04,247
is nothing greater than inference about

472
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,767
my future. And in this this is from

473
00:19:06,815 --> 00:19:08,717
Bijon's book, but he's quoting Karl

474
00:19:08,765 --> 00:19:10,725
Friston 2017 paper.

475
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:15,242
So that temporal thickness goes back to

476
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,722
the Sophistication, which is why so here

477
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:21,092
you can see how far back you can post

478
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,197
it. If I had done something differently,

479
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:24,947
what could have happened? This

480
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,822
counterfactual reasoning and then

481
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,277
prediction going forward into the

482
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:32,537
future. Okay, going on to

483
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,752
strategy governance models versus meta

484
00:19:35,782 --> 00:19:39,532
governance. All right, so I'm

485
00:19:39,547 --> 00:19:41,477
kind of out of my comfort zone here. So

486
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:43,082
I might call and Tyler to help me out a

487
00:19:43,085 --> 00:19:45,737
little bit. But Bijan says the common

488
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,992
understanding underlying entrenched

489
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:49,667
strategy governance models rather

490
00:19:49,715 --> 00:19:52,127
erroneously has been that action is a

491
00:19:52,145 --> 00:19:54,742
coherence of perception and therefore

492
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:57,542
strategy must be environment driven. So

493
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,582
I look up strategy governance model and

494
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:01,802
it gave me like, some figures and this

495
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,050
is one of them, and it appears to be

496
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:08,072
pretty linear, but there's not a lot of

497
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:10,792
feedback happening with the external

498
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:12,107
environment. Like there's vision, a

499
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,747
strategy roadmap design, and then

500
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,967
insights come forward to the design and

501
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,377
back to the vision and then there's like

502
00:20:18,395 --> 00:20:20,567
a performance review. So I don't know.

503
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:21,527
Tyler, do you want to give any

504
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:24,017
additional comments here on this? Yeah,

505
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:25,442
I mean, I think something that could be

506
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,977
potentially confusing for people who are

507
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:29,377
maybe not coming from an academic

508
00:20:29,407 --> 00:20:31,487
background is that like, a lot of times

509
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,092
when business leaders are thinking about

510
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,582
how they're going to plan for the action

511
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:35,852
of the organization to take what the

512
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,967
strategy looks like, they're getting

513
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,682
data, right? And they're having feedback

514
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,357
from the bottom levels of the

515
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,797
organization, feedback to the top

516
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,537
levels. And so that they're taking

517
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,157
information, they're creating a

518
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,752
perception of that and then they're

519
00:20:47,782 --> 00:20:50,027
creating a strategy based on that kind

520
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:51,862
of in a linear fashion the organization

521
00:20:51,937 --> 00:20:53,647
executes and at some point they reflect

522
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:55,727
back like, hey, did this work or not?

523
00:20:55,895 --> 00:20:57,452
What do we do with our new information?

524
00:20:57,545 --> 00:21:00,377
Right? But really what they're not

525
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,372
realizing in the process of that is like

526
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,067
in that linear flow, they're not

527
00:21:04,115 --> 00:21:06,647
recognizing how they're constraining the

528
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,027
perceptions and actions of their

529
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:11,100
organization in a top down fashion and

530
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:14,597
allowing bottom up the information to

531
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,772
change how information and actions can

532
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:19,052
be changed in the future. So that kind

533
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,687
of cyclical nature really to understand

534
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,022
it's really more perceived in this

535
00:21:22,055 --> 00:21:23,957
linear way of like, hey, we're going to

536
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,802
collect as much information as we can.

537
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,077
Our information is going to be

538
00:21:27,095 --> 00:21:28,742
imperfect, but we're going to get better

539
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,877
over time rather than like, hey,

540
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:34,502
fundamentally our actions and

541
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,902
perceptions are constrained by the

542
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,582
actions we're taking right now. So it's

543
00:21:38,585 --> 00:21:40,022
like just a different model for thinking

544
00:21:40,055 --> 00:21:42,197
about it. It's a lot more linear and not

545
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,182
doesn't have that cyclical causality

546
00:21:44,347 --> 00:21:48,152
baked into it. Cool. And I

547
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,977
think about here, it seems like it's

548
00:21:51,007 --> 00:21:53,417
very like tangential, like one after

549
00:21:53,465 --> 00:21:55,067
another after another after another.

550
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,302
Whereas like active coherence lab kind

551
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,177
of method, like you have to sometimes

552
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,327
act in order to perceive, right? Like if

553
00:22:02,345 --> 00:22:04,637
you want to know whether the surface is

554
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,602
rough or smooth, you have to move over

555
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:08,102
the surface with your finger to

556
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,527
determine if it's rough or smooth. So

557
00:22:09,545 --> 00:22:11,447
it's action and perception that are

558
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,277
happening simultaneously. And I think

559
00:22:13,295 --> 00:22:15,917
that is the shift that Bijan is calling

560
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:18,225
for, as he says.

561
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:21,227
Yeah, and I think just to add a little

562
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:22,712
bit, I think a lot of times business

563
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:25,037
leaders cognitive of reality as

564
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,082
independent existing out there. And it's

565
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:28,777
just like a limitation of their tools

566
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,967
and resources to understand reality

567
00:22:31,102 --> 00:22:34,147
rather than the nature of perception

568
00:22:34,192 --> 00:22:35,387
itself, of being able to understand

569
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,142
reality. And so I think that's really

570
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,752
like the fundamental difference and a

571
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,087
lot of times people don't realize that

572
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,177
that's even relevant at all. And so

573
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:45,975
that's why this is fun. To talk about,

574
00:22:47,462 --> 00:22:49,502
that's for sure. Why like, what is

575
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,872
deterministic truth? Where is that

576
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:54,517
reality? And it all kind of links

577
00:22:54,577 --> 00:22:57,602
together. So Bijan goes on to say, in

578
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,202
fact, action upon the firm's eco niche,

579
00:23:00,232 --> 00:23:02,177
akin to pointing the light torch in the

580
00:23:02,195 --> 00:23:04,627
dark, determines perception. Inference

581
00:23:04,657 --> 00:23:06,857
is inactive. The generative model itself

582
00:23:06,935 --> 00:23:08,672
never encodes anything. It just

583
00:23:08,705 --> 00:23:11,047
expresses the circular causality among

584
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:13,402
all four states. The generative models,

585
00:23:13,432 --> 00:23:15,322
hence is a model of the firm's eco

586
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:17,392
niche. If not, it is no good regulator

587
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:19,562
and consequently the firm will rather

588
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,692
sooner than later dissipate in the face

589
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,877
of entropic forces. And so I included

590
00:23:24,907 --> 00:23:26,572
here a different kind of strategy

591
00:23:26,617 --> 00:23:28,717
governance model that's like the Dean

592
00:23:28,777 --> 00:23:30,572
Startup model that's like a little bit

593
00:23:30,605 --> 00:23:33,392
more action and perception happening in

594
00:23:33,515 --> 00:23:35,477
a more simultaneous way. I don't know if

595
00:23:35,495 --> 00:23:37,212
you ant to add anything here, Tyler.

596
00:23:38,387 --> 00:23:40,832
Yeah, I think a lot of the way we talk

597
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:44,027
about like, Dean Startup model of the

598
00:23:44,045 --> 00:23:45,827
Lean Start model is basically like, you

599
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:47,567
don't necessarily know what people want.

600
00:23:47,615 --> 00:23:48,652
And also, it's not that you're

601
00:23:48,682 --> 00:23:50,102
discovering what people want is that

602
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,332
you're putting ideas out there and

603
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:54,077
finding how people respond to them. And

604
00:23:54,095 --> 00:23:55,667
so it's basically truth is something

605
00:23:55,715 --> 00:23:57,947
that you create. You can create a new

606
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,372
state of the world rather than

607
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,872
uncovering it. So it's kind of like a

608
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:03,007
method for uncovering something that's

609
00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:05,152
going to work. And a lot of times it's

610
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:07,952
kind of done couch in very fluffy and

611
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,902
also just like experiential terms like,

612
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,402
hey, this works, we've done this, we

613
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,402
built this company this way. But what's

614
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:15,302
interesting about Active Coherence is

615
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,427
that can take that very fluffy wispy

616
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,327
framework and apply that into a more

617
00:24:20,345 --> 00:24:23,032
rigorous context. A lot of these ideas

618
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:24,082
that we're talking about now, they're

619
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:27,347
not necessarily new, especially like

620
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,747
startup world, but there hasn't been

621
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,650
great language. We're talking about it.

622
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:38,650
Cool. All right, so here's another

623
00:24:38,712 --> 00:24:41,080
claim. Therefore, the firm's true

624
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:43,245
governance challenge is a matter of meta

625
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,415
governing its generative models as an

626
00:24:45,432 --> 00:24:47,035
enacted, sophisticated and

627
00:24:47,067 --> 00:24:48,940
resourcedependent belief system

628
00:24:49,107 --> 00:24:51,030
exercising the entire organization,

629
00:24:51,165 --> 00:24:53,985
quote the body itself in contours.

630
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,630
We should now start seeing a model

631
00:24:55,677 --> 00:24:57,895
emerging that underwrites a form of

632
00:24:58,047 --> 00:25:00,990
autopilotis I eugenization.

633
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,240
Effectively, it is all about casting

634
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,655
inferences optimization mathematically

635
00:25:05,715 --> 00:25:07,255
by way of gradient descent, starting

636
00:25:07,302 --> 00:25:09,520
with two essential constituents. First,

637
00:25:09,597 --> 00:25:11,190
hyperpria, which is the firm's

638
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,865
resistance to entropy in order to

639
00:25:12,882 --> 00:25:15,490
persist. And two, episomic foraging and

640
00:25:15,507 --> 00:25:18,265
hypothesis testing, ie. Acting upon the

641
00:25:18,282 --> 00:25:20,475
eco niche to generate leaf evidencing

642
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,170
data. Do you guys have any comments here

643
00:25:23,172 --> 00:25:24,295
or do you want to delve into this a

644
00:25:24,297 --> 00:25:27,010
little more. Daniel yeah. One

645
00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:31,165
interesting usage of a term there is

646
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:33,105
that the firm's true governance

647
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,970
challenge is meta governance. And that's

648
00:25:35,985 --> 00:25:39,130
a term that is used differently or

649
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:41,455
compatibly, but with a different focus

650
00:25:41,577 --> 00:25:44,415
in metagov. And so just to kind of flesh

651
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:47,980
that out here, meta governance is

652
00:25:48,027 --> 00:25:50,095
being used in the sense of

653
00:25:50,172 --> 00:25:53,130
metacognition, like self reflection,

654
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:55,785
memory, anticipation, action,

655
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:59,170
planning, all of these individual level

656
00:25:59,322 --> 00:26:02,100
cognitive and metacognitive processes

657
00:26:02,175 --> 00:26:04,175
that we model in active inference.

658
00:26:04,825 --> 00:26:08,235
Often metagov in another sense is meant

659
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,885
like social cognition, like

660
00:26:10,992 --> 00:26:13,360
relationships amongst organizations or

661
00:26:13,392 --> 00:26:16,060
amongst teams. So, like, within a team,

662
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:18,480
you have their own governance structure.

663
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,290
Then also there's teams of teams, and

664
00:26:20,307 --> 00:26:21,985
that's a meta governance structure with

665
00:26:22,017 --> 00:26:24,165
respect to the team. And then that's

666
00:26:24,195 --> 00:26:26,275
very interesting because the two times

667
00:26:26,337 --> 00:26:28,695
that we've seen nested models, nested

668
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,865
generative model models in active

669
00:26:29,895 --> 00:26:33,420
inference are the metacognition models

670
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:36,495
and then the ecosystem nested models.

671
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:39,160
So it really brings integrity between

672
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:40,660
thinking about what happens, like,

673
00:26:40,692 --> 00:26:43,325
within and across groups.

674
00:26:46,525 --> 00:26:47,887
Cool. Thank you.

675
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,260
Okay, so hyper prior Bayesian,

676
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:55,465
statistics, physics. Hyperpriator is a

677
00:26:55,482 --> 00:26:57,885
prior distinctions on a hyper parameter

678
00:26:58,005 --> 00:27:00,180
that is on a perimeter of a prior

679
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,550
distinctions. As with the term hyper

680
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:05,590
parameter, the use of hyper is to

681
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:07,305
distinguish it from a prior distribution

682
00:27:07,365 --> 00:27:09,190
of a parameter of the model for the

683
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:12,115
underlying system. So the

684
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:14,505
hyperparameters influence the prior

685
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:18,250
here, and the hyper parameters here

686
00:27:18,312 --> 00:27:20,665
influence the parameters here. And so

687
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:23,812
it's backwards at least one step in time

688
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,825
in this sophisticated format.

689
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,962
This is a better diagnosis or

690
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,695
illustration. The hyper Parr goes to the

691
00:27:32,697 --> 00:27:35,065
prior goes to the data. So it's just in

692
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:38,212
a previous time. Seth in some way,

693
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,012
anything to and here. All right,

694
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:46,900
epistemic foraging. I pulled this from

695
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:48,835
active inference and learning. This

696
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:52,740
quote. It says, Active inference lab

697
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:55,635
behavior has exploration, epistemic,

698
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,765
and exploitative pragmatic aspects that

699
00:27:58,782 --> 00:28:01,725
are sensitive to ambiguity and risk,

700
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,485
respectively, where epistemic,

701
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,710
ambiguity, resolving behavior enables

702
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:10,315
pragmatic, reward seeking behavior and

703
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:13,690
the subsequent emergence of habits. I

704
00:28:13,707 --> 00:28:15,160
just wanted to kind of point out here

705
00:28:15,192 --> 00:28:18,430
that active inference has been

706
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:21,445
illustrated as, like, a balance, a way

707
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:24,435
to balance exploration and exploitation

708
00:28:24,555 --> 00:28:27,910
and epistemic and pragmatic value. And

709
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:29,605
like, in business, is this, like,

710
00:28:29,652 --> 00:28:32,095
knowledge and money? Is that, like,

711
00:28:32,172 --> 00:28:34,210
epistemic and pragmatic value, like,

712
00:28:34,242 --> 00:28:35,710
knowledge of your customers, your

713
00:28:35,742 --> 00:28:37,240
clients? So I was just trying to think

714
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,315
of how this might translate to that

715
00:28:40,482 --> 00:28:42,010
money pragmatic value is like, more

716
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:45,595
resources, and epistemic value is

717
00:28:45,672 --> 00:28:48,190
more knowledge of your client base or of

718
00:28:48,207 --> 00:28:50,835
the future, maybe uncertainty

719
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,290
introduction. Yeah, I could just give a

720
00:28:53,307 --> 00:28:55,140
concrete example of that because it's

721
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,715
especially true in software engineering,

722
00:28:56,745 --> 00:28:58,390
where that is actually framed in

723
00:28:58,407 --> 00:29:01,140
explicitly these terms in growth

724
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,940
organizations. So if you're on a growth

725
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,675
team, you're like, okay, we can either

726
00:29:04,737 --> 00:29:06,165
turn up the dial on this thing that's

727
00:29:06,195 --> 00:29:08,305
working, we're like, okay, we know this

728
00:29:08,352 --> 00:29:11,110
flow is working. This wizards, this

729
00:29:11,142 --> 00:29:12,715
checkout flow is working. Let's make it

730
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:15,460
like 10% faster would be an example of

731
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:17,140
exploration where we know that's going

732
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:18,960
to work in some level, where exploration

733
00:29:19,005 --> 00:29:20,515
could be something we have really no

734
00:29:20,532 --> 00:29:22,185
idea. This is like a shot in the dark.

735
00:29:22,305 --> 00:29:24,340
Let's figure out the minimum amount of

736
00:29:24,357 --> 00:29:26,935
effort we can put out to uncover new

737
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:30,535
territory. And so this exact trade off

738
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:32,545
is very much explicitly thought of in a

739
00:29:32,547 --> 00:29:34,025
lot of type organizations.

740
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:38,415
Very cool. Thank you. Yeah. So epistemic

741
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:42,355
foraging is like searching around for

742
00:29:42,402 --> 00:29:46,312
epistemic, seeking out epistemic value.

743
00:29:48,175 --> 00:29:50,850
Okay, so moving on to the triplet

744
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:53,900
structure of free energy governance.

745
00:29:55,225 --> 00:29:59,287
Tyler, this is for you. I think so

746
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,115
beyond Francesco, really, there's like a

747
00:30:03,132 --> 00:30:05,145
key question of governance. When you're

748
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,565
thinking about your organization, how do

749
00:30:06,582 --> 00:30:09,115
you value the person organization? And

750
00:30:09,132 --> 00:30:10,390
it's really about how you create and

751
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:12,010
update your generative models so that

752
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:14,520
the firm can survive. And he presents

753
00:30:14,535 --> 00:30:15,895
this framework of thinking about it and

754
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,215
he calls it the triplet structure of

755
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,970
free energy governance. There is

756
00:30:19,047 --> 00:30:21,205
structure, cognition and then

757
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:23,560
capabilities. So we'll go through each

758
00:30:23,592 --> 00:30:26,875
of these in turn. All right.

759
00:30:26,937 --> 00:30:31,325
Structure. So sorry, this is confusing.

760
00:30:31,825 --> 00:30:33,370
That header is wrong. Just get to the

761
00:30:33,372 --> 00:30:34,175
next slide.

762
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,957
All right. Structure. So this genre,

763
00:30:43,047 --> 00:30:45,097
that connectivity emerges in flow and

764
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,172
language bottom up stimulating from

765
00:30:48,205 --> 00:30:49,587
resource markets such as clients

766
00:30:49,662 --> 00:30:51,682
Technologies, spires Another are only as

767
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,322
relevant and meaningful to resource

768
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:55,297
reconfiguration asset exploration as

769
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,052
clearly as top down predictions and

770
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,842
prediction models, articulated

771
00:30:58,977 --> 00:31:00,732
communication, and above all programmed

772
00:31:00,747 --> 00:31:03,287
to process bottom up incoming signals.

773
00:31:04,537 --> 00:31:07,077
So we kind of touched on this earlier,

774
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:09,097
but a lot of times decision making

775
00:31:09,205 --> 00:31:12,472
organization is very linear where like,

776
00:31:12,505 --> 00:31:14,542
you have very tough you're coming with

777
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,347
strategy and then like, that's executed

778
00:31:16,392 --> 00:31:19,102
in turn every rung of the hierarchy. A

779
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,797
lot of times like OKRs, if you've ever

780
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,802
heard of this, is like a really good

781
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,572
example of this. It's like objective key

782
00:31:23,605 --> 00:31:25,327
results where, like, there's an

783
00:31:25,345 --> 00:31:27,087
objective that the top organization

784
00:31:27,162 --> 00:31:28,467
comes with and then, like, the Minions

785
00:31:28,527 --> 00:31:31,602
the next run have their subsequent parts

786
00:31:31,632 --> 00:31:33,382
of that tree and it kind of filters down

787
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:36,037
to the rest. Of the organization where

788
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,572
sometimes what's not as clearly

789
00:31:37,617 --> 00:31:39,492
articulated is about the introduction

790
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:41,032
between different parts of the

791
00:31:41,035 --> 00:31:42,657
hierarchical and how the different parts

792
00:31:42,672 --> 00:31:45,877
of the stack have to relate to each

793
00:31:45,895 --> 00:31:47,377
other. So like a really good example of

794
00:31:47,395 --> 00:31:50,122
this is that this is very true in tech

795
00:31:50,155 --> 00:31:51,547
companies. Tech companies collect a ton

796
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,842
of data and none of that data is ever

797
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,677
processed in a meaningful way. And so a

798
00:31:56,695 --> 00:31:58,522
lot of times we'll say like, we're data

799
00:31:58,555 --> 00:32:00,202
driven company, we collect all this

800
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,452
information, but in reality a lot of

801
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,982
information is trapped at the bottom

802
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,322
rungs of the communication. It may not

803
00:32:06,355 --> 00:32:08,842
have like the political ability or also

804
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,312
even the technical ability to process

805
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,097
that in a meaningful way and bubble that

806
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,852
up through the organization. And a lot

807
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,502
of times there's a huge gap in being

808
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,702
able to actually process that

809
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,172
information and bubble it up.

810
00:32:18,205 --> 00:32:20,407
Appropriately in a way that can actually

811
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:23,557
crater the organization. This is like

812
00:32:23,635 --> 00:32:25,047
designing this in a really thoughtful

813
00:32:25,092 --> 00:32:28,402
way is much harder than it

814
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,752
would seem. And even if you call

815
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,542
yourself a data driven organization,

816
00:32:31,602 --> 00:32:32,572
there's a good chance you're not

817
00:32:32,605 --> 00:32:34,522
processing data in a way that can

818
00:32:34,555 --> 00:32:38,172
actually generative new top down models

819
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:42,217
later on. Anything to add there?

820
00:32:42,415 --> 00:32:43,487
Virginia?

821
00:32:45,412 --> 00:32:46,672
Alright, let's go to the next one.

822
00:32:46,705 --> 00:32:49,992
Cognition. Alright, so cognition

823
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:51,972
embraces the environment as enacted

824
00:32:52,017 --> 00:32:53,487
through relationships and interactions

825
00:32:53,562 --> 00:32:55,497
constructed in our brains. Environment

826
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:57,447
is not objectively, act or independently

827
00:32:57,492 --> 00:32:59,052
exists, but is revealed by a firm's

828
00:32:59,082 --> 00:33:02,047
action or perceptions that those very

829
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,802
actions generate. In fact, the

830
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,517
consequences of a firm's activity

831
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:09,022
controls its eagle niche. We've already

832
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,422
touched on this on some of the earlier

833
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:13,842
slides, but a lot of times these firms

834
00:33:13,902 --> 00:33:16,527
cognitive of external reality existing

835
00:33:16,557 --> 00:33:18,127
independently of their own actions and

836
00:33:18,145 --> 00:33:19,552
perceptions and then it's just like up

837
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,322
to them to get better tools and

838
00:33:21,355 --> 00:33:24,457
information to be able to understand

839
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,347
that reality. Like understanding this

840
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,002
fog of war that they're slowly

841
00:33:28,032 --> 00:33:31,032
uncovering. But they actually don't

842
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:33,202
really often understand how the world

843
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,717
that they're perceiving is very much

844
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:37,797
constrained by one, like how they're

845
00:33:37,842 --> 00:33:40,372
structured in gathering information and

846
00:33:40,405 --> 00:33:42,382
perceiving that information into real

847
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,127
insights, then also the actions that

848
00:33:45,145 --> 00:33:47,707
they're able to take. So to make it a

849
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,400
little bit more concrete, you can say

850
00:33:50,587 --> 00:33:52,822
this very much applies in a real sense

851
00:33:52,855 --> 00:33:54,322
on a website where if you're not

852
00:33:54,355 --> 00:33:56,377
collecting information on views on your

853
00:33:56,395 --> 00:33:58,477
page in a very basic level, it's really

854
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,352
hard to generate actual information out

855
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,402
of that, right? And so you have to

856
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,277
basically make a decision of like, this

857
00:34:03,295 --> 00:34:05,187
is the information we want to gather,

858
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:07,227
this is what we care about and that's

859
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:09,052
going to structure the insights you can

860
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,032
Dean in the future and what you can do

861
00:34:11,035 --> 00:34:12,697
with that information in a similar way.

862
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,922
Like if you're not putting resources out

863
00:34:15,955 --> 00:34:17,947
for interacting with the world, like

864
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,582
creating a new department that's maybe a

865
00:34:19,585 --> 00:34:21,402
little bit more exploratory, that's

866
00:34:21,432 --> 00:34:22,927
going to constrain the actions you can

867
00:34:22,945 --> 00:34:24,427
take in the future. So all this is

868
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:27,102
saying is that the reality doesn't exist

869
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:28,747
independent of you. It's something that

870
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,252
you actively perceive through your

871
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,462
action or perceptions.

872
00:34:34,762 --> 00:34:36,937
Daniel in Bleu and, and anything there.

873
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,872
Is it like actively perceive or

874
00:34:38,905 --> 00:34:42,157
actively. Create active sorry,

875
00:34:42,235 --> 00:34:43,717
active states a better. Way of saying

876
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:46,477
it, or both. I mean, I think you have to

877
00:34:46,495 --> 00:34:50,107
be actively perceiving, but I

878
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:53,407
don't know, I think it's a

879
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,892
rare treat when someone takes

880
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,007
responsibility or even like a company

881
00:34:57,085 --> 00:34:59,847
takes responsibility for the reality

882
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:03,052
that they're creating. And like we see

883
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,552
this especially like in tech companies,

884
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:06,757
like, I don't know, Facebook and I mean,

885
00:35:06,835 --> 00:35:09,247
just like a lot of the technology has

886
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,292
been life changing and world changing.

887
00:35:11,352 --> 00:35:13,197
So like they're really actively creating

888
00:35:13,242 --> 00:35:16,700
reality. Daniel yeah, this is

889
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:20,392
interesting about the revealing of the

890
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,282
firm's generative models through its

891
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,132
actions. And we've talked about that

892
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,552
fourfold partition with the internal

893
00:35:27,582 --> 00:35:29,227
external states and then the sense and

894
00:35:29,245 --> 00:35:31,867
action blanket states. So the firm has

895
00:35:31,915 --> 00:35:35,572
access to sense and internal states to

896
00:35:35,605 --> 00:35:38,962
some extent, but the world or others

897
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,650
have access to one's action and or

898
00:35:43,162 --> 00:35:45,877
inference on their consequences in the

899
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:49,192
niche. And so it's a way to talk

900
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,917
about what the entire action perception

901
00:35:52,977 --> 00:35:56,232
loop is with all of its different inward

902
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:59,087
facing and outward facing dynamics.

903
00:36:01,687 --> 00:36:03,427
Yeah, just to add a little more Beren

904
00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:06,292
too, there's a lot of focus on around

905
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,277
this idea as well and like startup

906
00:36:08,307 --> 00:36:11,127
culture and so I'm a totally butcher.

907
00:36:11,157 --> 00:36:12,472
There's like a Steve Jobs but I'm a

908
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:13,822
totally butcher. But something around

909
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:14,932
the lines of like if you had done a

910
00:36:14,935 --> 00:36:17,002
marketing survey of people before they

911
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,277
made the ipod and asked them how they

912
00:36:18,295 --> 00:36:19,302
want to listen to music, they wouldn't

913
00:36:19,332 --> 00:36:21,357
have told you that they wanted an ipod,

914
00:36:21,372 --> 00:36:22,522
they would have told you something else

915
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,217
that was conditioned based on their

916
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,002
previous experiences products. And so

917
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,922
the idea is that you just put something

918
00:36:27,955 --> 00:36:30,052
out in the world to create an act and

919
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,342
that you create something in the world

920
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,072
and then the world responds to it. And

921
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:36,667
so there's this big idea, especially in

922
00:36:36,715 --> 00:36:38,872
tech culture around reality is something

923
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,200
that you will into existence rather than

924
00:36:42,637 --> 00:36:44,387
discover independently.

925
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:49,327
Yeah, it's interesting too to think

926
00:36:49,345 --> 00:36:51,037
about especially you think about Google

927
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,627
Glass that came out like, I don't know,

928
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:54,562
ten years ago or something. Now probably

929
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:56,182
not that long ago, but it's been a

930
00:36:56,185 --> 00:36:57,702
little while and I think now there's

931
00:36:57,732 --> 00:37:00,127
like the rerelease of Google Glass or

932
00:37:00,145 --> 00:37:02,527
some kind of similar product like the

933
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,617
just wasn't ready when the Google Glass

934
00:37:04,677 --> 00:37:06,622
version came out, but we'll be ready

935
00:37:06,655 --> 00:37:09,022
soon. They've wielded into existence and

936
00:37:09,055 --> 00:37:10,550
it'll be that way soon.

937
00:37:12,937 --> 00:37:16,717
Definitely. All right, the last one is

938
00:37:16,765 --> 00:37:19,932
capabilities. So the inferring firm

939
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:21,252
is constantly optimizing belief

940
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:23,802
propagation as well as updating beliefs.

941
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:26,527
Sophistication that process of

942
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:28,522
optimizing cognition densities is only

943
00:37:28,555 --> 00:37:30,667
as good as the firm's share of the world

944
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,572
model. So we are no longer just

945
00:37:32,605 --> 00:37:34,497
interested in the actions consequences

946
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:37,062
per se, but how the actions consequences

947
00:37:37,137 --> 00:37:41,617
impact ulterior beliefs. So another

948
00:37:41,665 --> 00:37:43,222
way of saying this is that the firm has

949
00:37:43,255 --> 00:37:45,882
to actively balance this exploiting

950
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:49,402
versus exploring. And I think

951
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,492
there's like a lot of again, folk wisdom

952
00:37:51,552 --> 00:37:53,502
and especially in Silicon Valley culture

953
00:37:53,682 --> 00:37:55,882
around this trade off. Whereas like a

954
00:37:55,885 --> 00:37:58,297
lot of times we say hey, failure is good

955
00:37:58,405 --> 00:37:59,572
as long as you're learning and

956
00:37:59,605 --> 00:38:03,575
integrating those insights. And so

957
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:08,767
yeah, it blew anything to add? That no

958
00:38:08,815 --> 00:38:12,052
good. Okay,

959
00:38:12,145 --> 00:38:14,797
so realists and anti realists in

960
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,352
Management Science all right, so here's

961
00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:19,947
a claim from Bishop management science

962
00:38:19,992 --> 00:38:22,072
is equally divided along not too

963
00:38:22,105 --> 00:38:24,372
dissimilar realist in the antirealist

964
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:27,312
fault lines. It is best captured by Karl

965
00:38:27,387 --> 00:38:29,797
Weak 1977 when he states that

966
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,582
environment is located in the mind of

967
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:33,772
the actor and is imposed by him on

968
00:38:33,805 --> 00:38:35,917
experience in order to make the

969
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,072
experience more meaningful. It seldom

970
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:40,852
dawns on organizational theorists to

971
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,627
look for environment inside the heads

972
00:38:42,657 --> 00:38:44,667
rather than outside of them. Indeed,

973
00:38:44,727 --> 00:38:46,722
the rise of cognitive lens in strategy

974
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:48,472
management and governance research has

975
00:38:48,505 --> 00:38:50,257
enriched our understanding around

976
00:38:50,335 --> 00:38:51,972
improving the design of strategy

977
00:38:52,017 --> 00:38:54,072
governance processes, but has largely

978
00:38:54,117 --> 00:38:56,497
remained constrained by the notion that

979
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,372
environment is something objective out

980
00:38:58,405 --> 00:39:01,047
there waiting to be analyzed and adapted

981
00:39:01,092 --> 00:39:05,232
too. And in the section,

982
00:39:05,397 --> 00:39:08,272
Bijan talks about blitz scaling and

983
00:39:08,455 --> 00:39:11,977
mentions some like examples of

984
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:14,962
this ants realist claim. So he says,

985
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,527
Google, Uber, Airbnb and Facebook are

986
00:39:17,545 --> 00:39:19,827
the products of a fundamentally ants

987
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,267
realist enactment of an interaction with

988
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,847
their respective eco niches, powered by

989
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,127
unique and continuum evolving sets of

990
00:39:27,145 --> 00:39:29,487
capabilities fostering actiongenerated.

991
00:39:29,637 --> 00:39:31,527
Topdown bottom up prediction. Error

992
00:39:31,557 --> 00:39:33,747
inclination to iteratively, optimized

993
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:36,027
their very generative models and implied

994
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:38,272
recognition posterior probabilities of

995
00:39:38,305 --> 00:39:40,377
beliefs about the actions consequences

996
00:39:40,557 --> 00:39:42,942
these companies redesign while they fly,

997
00:39:43,077 --> 00:39:45,657
which is, in the words of Silicon Valley

998
00:39:45,747 --> 00:39:47,947
veteran Reid Hoffman, equivalent to

999
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:49,852
throwing yourself off a cliff and

1000
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,427
assembling your airplane on the way

1001
00:39:51,445 --> 00:39:54,352
down. Sullivan, 2016 in fact, we are

1002
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:55,927
more in control than we resist to

1003
00:39:55,945 --> 00:39:58,497
believe. Blitz scaling has been integral

1004
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:00,337
to the founding DNA of these super

1005
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,857
outperformers. They listen to and sense

1006
00:40:02,935 --> 00:40:05,002
what wants to emerge. They are the

1007
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,777
enacting designers of their very eco

1008
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:09,067
niche. For these companies, strategy is

1009
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,497
rather a matter of ex postsense making

1010
00:40:11,605 --> 00:40:14,452
than ex ants long term planning. It is a

1011
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,602
matter of survival. And I just thought

1012
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,057
that that was maybe a good example of

1013
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,372
this ants realism thing that

1014
00:40:22,555 --> 00:40:25,252
he was talking about here. Do you guys

1015
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:28,657
have an idea that. Kind of arose as you

1016
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,397
Beren talking about this, is that one

1017
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,657
interesting point about Google is that

1018
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,937
they're also kind of famous for trying

1019
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,277
really hard to do this, but failing to

1020
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,152
create new products. So they have a

1021
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,997
generative and killed like hundreds of

1022
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,767
different new products that people

1023
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:44,302
genuinely, truly loved even that were

1024
00:40:44,395 --> 00:40:46,327
quite innovative. And so it's kind of

1025
00:40:46,345 --> 00:40:48,350
interesting of how you even think about

1026
00:40:49,162 --> 00:40:50,722
what is trying to emerge and whether

1027
00:40:50,755 --> 00:40:52,717
that's best done in like a single

1028
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,102
monolithic organization versus in a more

1029
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,425
like decentralized distributed way.

1030
00:40:58,462 --> 00:41:00,582
So I don't know. There's been attention,

1031
00:41:00,597 --> 00:41:01,807
I've been kind of feeling throughout the

1032
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:05,452
book as well. Is it that this entity is

1033
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,477
trying to exist or needs to exist? Or is

1034
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:09,147
it something that is more distributed

1035
00:41:09,192 --> 00:41:10,752
and decentralized, is more appropriate

1036
00:41:10,782 --> 00:41:14,152
in certain cases? So having loved and

1037
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:17,675
lost several Google things in the past,

1038
00:41:18,862 --> 00:41:23,002
Google Reader or

1039
00:41:23,095 --> 00:41:24,922
Google App Maker, like the LowCode app

1040
00:41:24,955 --> 00:41:26,632
developing app development thing, I

1041
00:41:26,635 --> 00:41:28,372
mean, just like tons of things having

1042
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:30,397
loved and lost, I wonder if this is like

1043
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,227
epistemic exploration on the part of

1044
00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:33,275
Google, really.

1045
00:41:35,887 --> 00:41:37,672
I don't know. I feel like people come in

1046
00:41:37,705 --> 00:41:39,262
and like, I'm going to build this app

1047
00:41:39,325 --> 00:41:40,602
and Google gives them a lot of freedom

1048
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:41,602
and they're like, go ahead, build the

1049
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,982
app or build the platform or build the

1050
00:41:42,985 --> 00:41:44,347
thing and do the thing. And they build

1051
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,012
it and it's great and people love it,

1052
00:41:46,075 --> 00:41:47,692
and then they move on and do something

1053
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,222
else, and then nobody steps up to

1054
00:41:49,255 --> 00:41:51,802
support the love of this or what was

1055
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,202
this person's child at Google. Right.

1056
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,152
So I feel like maybe that might be a lot

1057
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:58,342
of what's happening, but perhaps in this

1058
00:41:58,465 --> 00:42:00,477
creation and then unsupporting creation

1059
00:42:00,507 --> 00:42:02,967
and unsupporting, Google is continuously

1060
00:42:03,027 --> 00:42:06,022
generating epistemic knowledge. Right?

1061
00:42:06,055 --> 00:42:08,467
It's epistemic foraging and learning

1062
00:42:08,515 --> 00:42:10,117
about the niche and what people like and

1063
00:42:10,165 --> 00:42:13,227
what they will use on the grand scheme.

1064
00:42:13,257 --> 00:42:15,502
Well, I think that's true, but I'm not

1065
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,627
going to make this argument, but a lot

1066
00:42:16,645 --> 00:42:18,127
of people have made the argument that

1067
00:42:18,145 --> 00:42:19,207
what they should have been doing the

1068
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,752
whole time is exploiting because their

1069
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,257
whole business is just ads and they're

1070
00:42:22,272 --> 00:42:24,147
like, just run that till you die.

1071
00:42:24,192 --> 00:42:25,842
That's the only thing that matters.

1072
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:28,447
Your resources aren't well used here by

1073
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:30,650
trying to do all these random things.

1074
00:42:31,012 --> 00:42:33,402
And so there is a legitimate argument,

1075
00:42:33,432 --> 00:42:35,512
too, of the limits to which you can

1076
00:42:35,575 --> 00:42:37,467
explore. Maybe I don't know, that's

1077
00:42:37,527 --> 00:42:39,027
probably out of scope for our discussion

1078
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:42,517
today. But Daniel? Yeah. Just one short

1079
00:42:42,565 --> 00:42:45,102
note. The entire discussion of epistemic

1080
00:42:45,132 --> 00:42:48,727
and pragmatic value is motivated by

1081
00:42:48,745 --> 00:42:51,472
the fact that they're unified in the

1082
00:42:51,505 --> 00:42:54,682
free energy functions that are used to

1083
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,797
determine perception, cognition, and

1084
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:59,677
action in an integrated way. So at the

1085
00:42:59,695 --> 00:43:02,362
very least, conversation can be had

1086
00:43:02,425 --> 00:43:05,392
about adaptive changes in these

1087
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,147
variables at different levels of the

1088
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,567
organization in a different,

1089
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,867
if not better way. That's very

1090
00:43:13,915 --> 00:43:15,727
integrated with how we think about the

1091
00:43:15,745 --> 00:43:18,072
world internally and built upon

1092
00:43:18,117 --> 00:43:20,497
neuroscience in that area, as well as

1093
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,092
about thinking about the complex

1094
00:43:22,152 --> 00:43:24,952
dynamics and the relational dynamics of

1095
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,887
the niche, which for information,

1096
00:43:27,025 --> 00:43:29,002
doesn't exist until you're seeking it

1097
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,547
out and in feedback with it and

1098
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,752
attention of your previous data in

1099
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:35,107
anticipation of future data. All of

1100
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,227
these cognitive dynamics. So the anti

1101
00:43:37,257 --> 00:43:40,477
heuristic doesn't need to be someone who

1102
00:43:40,495 --> 00:43:41,997
doesn't think like a real world exists

1103
00:43:42,042 --> 00:43:43,702
or anything like that. Even that's like

1104
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,447
too deep for this current discussion.

1105
00:43:45,492 --> 00:43:48,442
It's just a purely pragmatic approach to

1106
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,157
thinking about and modeling these kinds

1107
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:51,362
of scenarios.

1108
00:43:55,312 --> 00:43:57,892
Very cool. All right, what else? Okay,

1109
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,332
so here we are. We got through the

1110
00:43:59,335 --> 00:44:01,417
preface. That was the preface. And so

1111
00:44:01,465 --> 00:44:03,052
getting into part one of the book,

1112
00:44:03,145 --> 00:44:04,852
there's just a small quote which I'll

1113
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:07,452
read. It says, reframing the strategy

1114
00:44:07,482 --> 00:44:09,222
governance conversation. The evidence

1115
00:44:09,267 --> 00:44:11,152
suggests that we are in the midst of an

1116
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,177
evolutionary punctuation. We are

1117
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:14,782
witnessing a mass extinction in the

1118
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:16,507
corporate world in the early decades of

1119
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:20,077
the 21st century. Since 2052% of the

1120
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,027
Fortune 500, companies have either been

1121
00:44:22,045 --> 00:44:23,547
acquired, merged, or have declared

1122
00:44:23,592 --> 00:44:26,227
bankruptcy. It is estimated that 40% of

1123
00:44:26,245 --> 00:44:27,802
the companies in evidence today will

1124
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,572
shutter their operations in the next ten

1125
00:44:29,605 --> 00:44:31,627
years. Merely following the trends of

1126
00:44:31,645 --> 00:44:33,097
change is not enough. Just like

1127
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,947
organisms facing the Great Oxidation

1128
00:44:34,992 --> 00:44:37,482
events, organizations need to reinvent

1129
00:44:37,497 --> 00:44:39,072
the way they interact with the changing

1130
00:44:39,117 --> 00:44:41,397
world. And this is a quote from Digital.

1131
00:44:41,442 --> 00:44:43,372
Transformation survive and thrive in an

1132
00:44:43,405 --> 00:44:47,687
era of mass extinction 2019 by Siebel.

1133
00:44:48,262 --> 00:44:49,977
All right, chapter one. Thinking. Beren

1134
00:44:50,007 --> 00:44:52,507
of curiosity. Revolt and change. All

1135
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:54,207
right, here's our abstract. Tyler, I'm

1136
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:55,475
going to let you read this one.

1137
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,715
All right? Environmental complexity and

1138
00:45:03,732 --> 00:45:05,635
velocity have the dominant monitors in

1139
00:45:05,667 --> 00:45:08,110
strategy. In governance research. The

1140
00:45:08,142 --> 00:45:09,765
underlying structure of environmental

1141
00:45:09,795 --> 00:45:11,190
Chang Kim become increasingly

1142
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,090
distributed and continuous. The

1143
00:45:13,107 --> 00:45:14,620
disintermediating nature of information

1144
00:45:14,697 --> 00:45:16,290
technologies is challenging entrenched

1145
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,265
business models as well as the logics of

1146
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,260
organizing. Specialized top down

1147
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:22,995
strategy processes are rather and clark

1148
00:45:23,085 --> 00:45:24,660
and less dynamically and generative

1149
00:45:24,705 --> 00:45:26,590
intertwined in real time with bottom up

1150
00:45:26,607 --> 00:45:28,810
stimuli and data emanating from field

1151
00:45:28,842 --> 00:45:30,510
operations in pursuit of prediction

1152
00:45:30,555 --> 00:45:33,045
error minimization. Matter established

1153
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,635
logic of organizing or prevalent

1154
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,505
corporate governance models are a match

1155
00:45:36,552 --> 00:45:38,290
for wholesale digital reinvention and

1156
00:45:38,307 --> 00:45:41,800
continuous strategic renewal. Nice and

1157
00:45:41,862 --> 00:45:44,665
going on, he says, in fact,

1158
00:45:44,757 --> 00:45:46,840
align to the Kai evolution from a

1159
00:45:46,857 --> 00:45:48,705
supervised to deep learning logic.

1160
00:45:48,765 --> 00:45:50,590
Corporate governance is challenged to

1161
00:45:50,607 --> 00:45:53,020
evolve from a supervised and rule based

1162
00:45:53,097 --> 00:45:55,810
best practices learning system to one of

1163
00:45:55,842 --> 00:45:58,105
unsupervised unlearning, ie. Self

1164
00:45:58,152 --> 00:46:00,865
communication. To survive, the firm must

1165
00:46:00,882 --> 00:46:03,150
be conceived as one cross hierarchically

1166
00:46:03,225 --> 00:46:05,100
integrated inference machine.

1167
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,215
Organizing is generative, prediction

1168
00:46:07,245 --> 00:46:10,015
errors minimization. Strategy is

1169
00:46:10,032 --> 00:46:12,010
redefined as topdown bottom up

1170
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:14,335
predictions. Processing the search for

1171
00:46:14,367 --> 00:46:16,765
knowledge is nourished, not nourished by

1172
00:46:16,782 --> 00:46:18,855
certainty. It is nourished by a radical

1173
00:46:18,915 --> 00:46:21,535
absence of certainty. Thinking born of

1174
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:23,815
curiosity, revolt, and change. And

1175
00:46:23,832 --> 00:46:26,512
that's a quote from Cerritelli 2021.

1176
00:46:30,325 --> 00:46:34,315
All right, so one

1177
00:46:34,332 --> 00:46:36,565
of the core premises of the abstract is

1178
00:46:36,582 --> 00:46:37,665
saying, hey, the environmental

1179
00:46:37,695 --> 00:46:38,965
complexity and velocity have been

1180
00:46:38,982 --> 00:46:40,390
increasing over time and that makes it

1181
00:46:40,407 --> 00:46:42,940
more challenging for organizations to

1182
00:46:42,957 --> 00:46:44,365
survive. So what he says is

1183
00:46:44,382 --> 00:46:45,885
environmental complexity and velocity

1184
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,215
have been dominant moderators and

1185
00:46:47,232 --> 00:46:48,775
strategy and governance research.

1186
00:46:48,912 --> 00:46:50,665
Indeed, the rate of change has not only

1187
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,035
been accelerating, but the underlying

1188
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,715
stress of change has become increasingly

1189
00:46:53,745 --> 00:46:55,915
distributed and distinguished. Sense of

1190
00:46:55,932 --> 00:46:58,240
urgency and heathle interrelating are

1191
00:46:58,257 --> 00:46:59,845
critical to survival in the world that

1192
00:46:59,847 --> 00:47:03,115
is now commonly perceived as full of

1193
00:47:03,132 --> 00:47:05,515
surprises. And so this is something just

1194
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:07,165
by being on the inside of a lot of these

1195
00:47:07,182 --> 00:47:08,850
organizations, including corporations,

1196
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,530
a lot of times it's perceived as, hey,

1197
00:47:11,652 --> 00:47:13,870
it's a scary world out there. We just

1198
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,310
need to get our information better to

1199
00:47:15,342 --> 00:47:17,350
kind of understand what's actually

1200
00:47:17,412 --> 00:47:20,962
happening so we don't have any problems.

1201
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:23,215
But I think that the problem is that the

1202
00:47:23,232 --> 00:47:25,420
world is changing so much faster than it

1203
00:47:25,422 --> 00:47:27,445
had been before, where, like this kind

1204
00:47:27,447 --> 00:47:29,370
of relentless approach of, hey, we're

1205
00:47:29,385 --> 00:47:30,295
just going to get more in. We're going

1206
00:47:30,297 --> 00:47:32,770
to gradually improve our prophecies to

1207
00:47:32,847 --> 00:47:35,460
wash away the uncertainty that doesn't

1208
00:47:35,505 --> 00:47:37,390
work as well anymore. And I think this

1209
00:47:37,407 --> 00:47:40,735
kind of former approach of strategy is

1210
00:47:40,767 --> 00:47:42,660
very much encapsulated by like Six Sigma

1211
00:47:42,705 --> 00:47:43,570
design. I don't know if you guys are

1212
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:44,710
familiar with that. That's kind of like

1213
00:47:44,742 --> 00:47:46,900
a manufacturing idea of like, hey,

1214
00:47:46,962 --> 00:47:48,790
we're just going to slowly and

1215
00:47:48,807 --> 00:47:50,440
incrementally increase the precision of

1216
00:47:50,457 --> 00:47:53,812
our techniques and our processes because

1217
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,725
any disturbance you have cascades across

1218
00:47:56,787 --> 00:47:58,390
your whole supply chain and all of your

1219
00:47:58,407 --> 00:48:00,265
other processes. So we just need to

1220
00:48:00,282 --> 00:48:02,305
figure everything out and so everything

1221
00:48:02,352 --> 00:48:03,760
will be perfect and we won't have any

1222
00:48:03,792 --> 00:48:07,150
issues. And that may be like

1223
00:48:07,212 --> 00:48:09,640
somewhat of an illusion that you can

1224
00:48:09,657 --> 00:48:11,340
tell yourself if things aren't changing

1225
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:13,420
that quickly and maybe they'll work for

1226
00:48:13,497 --> 00:48:15,595
some constrained amount of time. But in

1227
00:48:15,597 --> 00:48:17,395
the Modern world, it's really hard to

1228
00:48:17,397 --> 00:48:18,865
have that illusion. You have to have a

1229
00:48:18,882 --> 00:48:20,587
different mental model of the world.

1230
00:48:22,825 --> 00:48:24,885
All right, move on to the less Bleu

1231
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:29,065
Daniel had anything? All right, so the

1232
00:48:29,082 --> 00:48:30,655
second piece of this is like, yes, the

1233
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:33,340
world is changing really quickly, and

1234
00:48:33,357 --> 00:48:34,630
that means that there's going to be more

1235
00:48:34,677 --> 00:48:36,790
discontinuities. And so he says our

1236
00:48:36,807 --> 00:48:38,485
discontinuities are fundamentally a

1237
00:48:38,517 --> 00:48:40,165
function of the cost of interacting with

1238
00:48:40,182 --> 00:48:42,135
the outer world in form of generating

1239
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,365
and testing predictions. And so we say

1240
00:48:44,382 --> 00:48:45,805
it's not discontinuity. It's really

1241
00:48:45,852 --> 00:48:48,415
about this gap between perceiving the

1242
00:48:48,432 --> 00:48:51,565
world and saying, okay, how are we going

1243
00:48:51,582 --> 00:48:53,005
to take action? How are you going to

1244
00:48:53,052 --> 00:48:55,700
update our generative model accordingly?

1245
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,260
And we're saying is that as the world

1246
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:01,060
becomes more complex, changes much

1247
00:49:01,092 --> 00:49:03,565
faster than ever before, there are more

1248
00:49:03,582 --> 00:49:05,140
of these discontinuities, but also the

1249
00:49:05,157 --> 00:49:06,715
discontinuities are larger. There's just

1250
00:49:06,732 --> 00:49:09,340
more information to integrate. And so on

1251
00:49:09,357 --> 00:49:11,230
one level, you say, this is really

1252
00:49:11,277 --> 00:49:12,865
terrifying, the world's changing. What

1253
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:15,010
do we do? But he also sounds this

1254
00:49:15,042 --> 00:49:16,945
optimistic note saying, well, yes, the

1255
00:49:16,947 --> 00:49:18,010
Modern world creates more

1256
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,785
discontinuities, but it also creates

1257
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,355
more tools for navigating business

1258
00:49:21,402 --> 00:49:23,440
continuum. And so the first one, he

1259
00:49:23,457 --> 00:49:26,845
says, is about this interpretation and

1260
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,235
decentralization. So it's a lot easier

1261
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,510
to aggregate data and process that

1262
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:33,640
information and have backup plans in

1263
00:49:33,657 --> 00:49:36,685
case plan A fails, you have plans B

1264
00:49:36,717 --> 00:49:39,415
through Z instead. The other aspect of

1265
00:49:39,432 --> 00:49:42,850
this is AI, and so it's a lot easier to

1266
00:49:42,912 --> 00:49:45,070
process bigger and deeper sets of data.

1267
00:49:45,147 --> 00:49:46,990
And so he's trying to sound this

1268
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,985
optimistic note that, hey, not all is

1269
00:49:49,017 --> 00:49:50,800
lost. There is a way to update through

1270
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:51,950
this uncertainty.

1271
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,735
I just have to say I love this meme as

1272
00:49:58,767 --> 00:50:00,790
someone who's tried to organize and

1273
00:50:00,807 --> 00:50:02,325
restructure my life probably, I don't

1274
00:50:02,825 --> 00:50:05,190
know, 500,000 times at this point. It's

1275
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,090
like, do I just do the work or do I

1276
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:09,385
spend time agonizing about how to

1277
00:50:09,492 --> 00:50:12,190
document and structure and time plan my

1278
00:50:12,207 --> 00:50:13,925
day into five minute blocks?

1279
00:50:15,475 --> 00:50:18,030
I invest so much time in some method,

1280
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,135
right? And then I'm just like, okay,

1281
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:20,860
well, I methodized it, and then I never

1282
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,165
used the method. I just go back to doing

1283
00:50:22,182 --> 00:50:24,775
the work. So it's like the weird, like

1284
00:50:24,912 --> 00:50:27,865
all this time analyzing or dumping it

1285
00:50:27,882 --> 00:50:30,070
into moderating my efficiency is like

1286
00:50:30,147 --> 00:50:31,625
wasting my efficiency.

1287
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:35,460
To connect that to the earlier

1288
00:50:35,505 --> 00:50:38,300
discussion about the two senses of meta,

1289
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,300
this time cost associated with strategy

1290
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:44,110
and with consequences. In the real

1291
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:46,665
world, that time cost can be understood

1292
00:50:46,695 --> 00:50:49,825
as a cognitive cost and something

1293
00:50:49,887 --> 00:50:51,040
internal that's happening.

1294
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:52,870
Metacognitive. How should I decide how

1295
00:50:52,872 --> 00:50:55,240
to decide how to perceive this. Some of

1296
00:50:55,257 --> 00:50:57,835
those are variables and knobs you can

1297
00:50:57,867 --> 00:51:00,130
understand and change. Other ones are

1298
00:51:00,177 --> 00:51:03,280
really subliminal. And then also that

1299
00:51:03,402 --> 00:51:06,430
time cost strategy nexus of course

1300
00:51:06,477 --> 00:51:09,160
exists for organizations and teams and

1301
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:11,025
all of these nested and complex

1302
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,290
interactions. So we want to use active

1303
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,945
inference as and generative principle

1304
00:51:16,035 --> 00:51:17,565
because it helps us connect what's

1305
00:51:17,595 --> 00:51:19,665
happening on either side of the Markov

1306
00:51:19,695 --> 00:51:22,060
blanket, which might be like a data set

1307
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:25,510
pass between two areas of a community or

1308
00:51:25,542 --> 00:51:27,760
of an communication. Understanding how

1309
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:29,805
the emission model and the reception

1310
00:51:29,865 --> 00:51:33,235
model work together. Yeah.

1311
00:51:33,267 --> 00:51:35,362
To DAG that a little more is that like

1312
00:51:36,025 --> 00:51:39,040
I've been a product analyst at a couple

1313
00:51:39,057 --> 00:51:40,855
of different startups, and you actually

1314
00:51:40,902 --> 00:51:42,520
see this in a real way where sometimes

1315
00:51:42,597 --> 00:51:44,290
you can get an okay answer by just

1316
00:51:44,307 --> 00:51:47,475
taking a super simple average

1317
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:49,690
of a couple of different categories. Or

1318
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:50,905
you could try to do something really

1319
00:51:50,952 --> 00:51:53,665
clever and create like and ML model or

1320
00:51:53,682 --> 00:51:56,260
something over to predict something.

1321
00:51:56,367 --> 00:51:59,005
And a lot of times the predictive power

1322
00:51:59,052 --> 00:52:01,240
you gain doesn't match the time cost of

1323
00:52:01,257 --> 00:52:03,310
that. And by the time you created this

1324
00:52:03,342 --> 00:52:05,685
really sophisticated like publishable

1325
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,860
model, the world has fundamentally

1326
00:52:07,905 --> 00:52:09,885
changed so much that your model doesn't

1327
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:12,910
matter anymore. And so you're very time

1328
00:52:12,942 --> 00:52:15,115
bounded in how you can even use the

1329
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,340
information you gather and the results

1330
00:52:17,445 --> 00:52:19,960
you glean. So for example even if you

1331
00:52:19,992 --> 00:52:23,140
have like a checkout flow and you say oh

1332
00:52:23,157 --> 00:52:26,040
yeah, like with this button the checkout

1333
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:28,210
flow is 10% more effective than with

1334
00:52:28,242 --> 00:52:31,390
this button it will very likely be the

1335
00:52:31,407 --> 00:52:33,640
Chang Kim six months. The context of

1336
00:52:33,657 --> 00:52:34,960
that check out flow chaos changed so

1337
00:52:34,992 --> 00:52:36,970
much that it's actually just kind of

1338
00:52:36,972 --> 00:52:39,265
meaningless information and so like the

1339
00:52:39,282 --> 00:52:41,095
time boundedness of the information you

1340
00:52:41,097 --> 00:52:42,685
collect and the perceptions you can form

1341
00:52:42,717 --> 00:52:44,737
of that matter a lot.

1342
00:52:49,825 --> 00:52:53,155
All right, so the inference machine so

1343
00:52:53,202 --> 00:52:54,910
to survive the firm must become one

1344
00:52:54,942 --> 00:52:57,015
cross hierarchical integrated inference

1345
00:52:57,045 --> 00:52:58,890
machine that continuously builds

1346
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,640
predictions which are gain to be bottom

1347
00:53:00,732 --> 00:53:04,135
of challenge. And so I think this

1348
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:05,440
very much aligns with what we talked

1349
00:53:05,457 --> 00:53:07,090
about before like agile methodology just

1350
00:53:07,107 --> 00:53:08,740
kind of lean start the method of

1351
00:53:08,832 --> 00:53:12,385
rebuild, see if it worked you

1352
00:53:12,417 --> 00:53:15,540
kind of like integrate those perceptions

1353
00:53:15,645 --> 00:53:18,270
and learn from it. Use that to ideate

1354
00:53:18,285 --> 00:53:19,735
and something that is a creative act

1355
00:53:19,767 --> 00:53:21,385
into the world not necessarily something

1356
00:53:21,417 --> 00:53:24,280
that is fully informed by data and then

1357
00:53:24,327 --> 00:53:26,812
you build and act on it.

1358
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,490
And he uses this quote a few times both

1359
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:31,965
in the premise I think he actually opens

1360
00:53:31,995 --> 00:53:34,270
the book with this he says this is a

1361
00:53:34,272 --> 00:53:36,645
Carlovel quote the search for knowledge

1362
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,035
is not nourished by certainty is

1363
00:53:38,067 --> 00:53:39,490
nourished by radical absence of

1364
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:42,105
certainty thinking born of curiosity,

1365
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,685
revolt and change. So this is

1366
00:53:45,792 --> 00:53:47,790
actually very important because I've

1367
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,275
actually encountered this attention very

1368
00:53:50,337 --> 00:53:52,285
often in a lot of organizations where

1369
00:53:52,467 --> 00:53:54,160
like a lot of organizations want to be

1370
00:53:54,192 --> 00:53:57,100
data driven and they don't actually

1371
00:53:57,237 --> 00:53:59,815
another way to say, this is this is the

1372
00:53:59,832 --> 00:54:01,762
best product advice that was ever given.

1373
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:04,015
It was from CEO of my last company, he

1374
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,425
Sajid. There's two types of product

1375
00:54:05,487 --> 00:54:08,000
work. There's art and there's science.

1376
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:10,885
And the science work is like, hey, we

1377
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:12,565
know this works. We know we can speed up

1378
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:13,900
this checkout flow and it might get

1379
00:54:13,962 --> 00:54:15,895
incrementally better. We kind of can

1380
00:54:15,897 --> 00:54:17,140
just keep going on. It's like the

1381
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:18,985
exploit path. But then there's art,

1382
00:54:19,017 --> 00:54:21,115
which is really just not informed by the

1383
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,935
data. And a lot of times organizations

1384
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,880
have trouble with this because it is

1385
00:54:24,927 --> 00:54:27,385
truly a creative act and they're not

1386
00:54:27,417 --> 00:54:29,400
comfortable taking that leap of faith.

1387
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:31,810
And that's really what you have to do to

1388
00:54:31,842 --> 00:54:34,120
do anything meaningful. And a lot of

1389
00:54:34,122 --> 00:54:35,515
people are much more comfortable in the

1390
00:54:35,532 --> 00:54:38,365
exploit path, which is a lot easier to

1391
00:54:38,382 --> 00:54:40,585
sell to your bosses. It's a lot more

1392
00:54:40,617 --> 00:54:43,735
comfortable. And you have to really very

1393
00:54:43,767 --> 00:54:45,610
consciously create a culture within your

1394
00:54:45,642 --> 00:54:48,880
firm that the explore path is even okay

1395
00:54:49,002 --> 00:54:50,825
and something that can be rewarded.

1396
00:54:53,725 --> 00:54:55,495
All right, anything that you guys want

1397
00:54:55,497 --> 00:54:57,875
to add here before we go? Next slide.

1398
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:04,285
All right, so something

1399
00:55:04,317 --> 00:55:05,962
I found that was interesting with

1400
00:55:06,775 --> 00:55:09,310
reading this preface and the first

1401
00:55:09,342 --> 00:55:11,130
chapter is, like, a lot of the themes

1402
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:13,755
are kind of emerging in a less technical

1403
00:55:13,815 --> 00:55:15,985
framework and also kind of like

1404
00:55:16,017 --> 00:55:18,295
pseudospiritual ideas about business

1405
00:55:18,372 --> 00:55:20,790
management. And so this is like a quote

1406
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,215
that was from the paper or from the

1407
00:55:23,232 --> 00:55:24,955
book. It says that firms are called to

1408
00:55:25,002 --> 00:55:27,270
open up all four channels of listening,

1409
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,785
listen to what you know, what surprises

1410
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:32,590
you from the whole and what

1411
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:34,290
you sense wants to emerge the emerging

1412
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,085
home. Right? And so if we kind of think

1413
00:55:36,117 --> 00:55:38,215
about integrating information across

1414
00:55:38,307 --> 00:55:40,030
different levels of the hierarchy like

1415
00:55:40,152 --> 00:55:42,115
John was talking about, you can think

1416
00:55:42,132 --> 00:55:43,605
about that from a more, like, rigorous

1417
00:55:43,665 --> 00:55:45,895
academic perspective. But there's like a

1418
00:55:45,897 --> 00:55:47,710
lot of other books, especially that come

1419
00:55:47,742 --> 00:55:49,465
over the last five years that are

1420
00:55:49,482 --> 00:55:52,000
conceiving the organization allostat

1421
00:55:52,062 --> 00:55:55,290
like a pseudospiritual lens where it's

1422
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,490
conceiving the organization not as the

1423
00:55:57,507 --> 00:56:00,280
extension of the CEO's ego, but really

1424
00:56:00,327 --> 00:56:02,985
as this entity that needs to be nurtured

1425
00:56:03,105 --> 00:56:05,185
and cultivated and understood on its own

1426
00:56:05,217 --> 00:56:07,455
terms. One of the most famous books

1427
00:56:07,515 --> 00:56:09,285
about this is called Reinventing

1428
00:56:09,405 --> 00:56:12,015
Organizations. And Reinventing

1429
00:56:12,045 --> 00:56:13,390
Organizations introduced the idea of

1430
00:56:13,407 --> 00:56:14,665
kill organizations. These are like

1431
00:56:14,682 --> 00:56:16,965
nonhierarchical heterogeneous

1432
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:20,545
organizations. So in that book, he says,

1433
00:56:20,622 --> 00:56:21,955
instead of trying to predict and control

1434
00:56:22,002 --> 00:56:23,760
the future, members of the organization

1435
00:56:23,805 --> 00:56:25,525
are invited to listen in and understand

1436
00:56:25,587 --> 00:56:27,280
what the organization wants to become,

1437
00:56:27,402 --> 00:56:29,935
what purpose it wants to serve, which,

1438
00:56:29,967 --> 00:56:32,530
like, on first reading, that can feel

1439
00:56:32,727 --> 00:56:36,040
very, like, pseudospiritual and kind of

1440
00:56:36,057 --> 00:56:39,160
like hand wavy. There's actually a very

1441
00:56:39,267 --> 00:56:41,670
real thing that can actually be modeled

1442
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,095
in a more rigorous way with active

1443
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:44,110
coherence. I think that's really

1444
00:56:44,142 --> 00:56:46,660
exciting. Another way that this has been

1445
00:56:46,692 --> 00:56:48,865
talked about has been in bronze. J.

1446
00:56:48,882 --> 00:56:50,845
Robertson's book Callocracy Holocracy is

1447
00:56:50,847 --> 00:56:54,415
another similar to organizations, is a

1448
00:56:54,582 --> 00:56:57,125
nonhierarchical form of governance.

1449
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,100
So he says each tension human being sent

1450
00:57:00,162 --> 00:57:01,720
the signpost telling us how the

1451
00:57:01,722 --> 00:57:03,550
organization could evolve to better

1452
00:57:03,612 --> 00:57:05,000
express its purpose.

1453
00:57:07,737 --> 00:57:09,717
All right, anything you guys want to and

1454
00:57:09,765 --> 00:57:12,475
in. Conor.

1455
00:57:15,012 --> 00:57:16,902
So I don't know, anything else that you

1456
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,842
guys want to add. Just thanks for being

1457
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:22,647
here and going over this stuff with me.

1458
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:24,302
And is there anything else you're

1459
00:57:24,332 --> 00:57:26,950
looking forward to or what's next?

1460
00:57:29,937 --> 00:57:32,867
I'm really excited. Just logistically,

1461
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,900
how is the series going to continue?

1462
00:57:36,462 --> 00:57:40,077
Sure. So we'll finish one chapter a

1463
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:42,632
week is the goal, maybe like we're

1464
00:57:42,647 --> 00:57:44,027
trying to still work out the logistics

1465
00:57:44,057 --> 00:57:45,567
of the holiday, but I think it looks

1466
00:57:45,615 --> 00:57:48,462
consistent. So one chapter of the book

1467
00:57:48,525 --> 00:57:50,277
per week, something about that,

1468
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:51,852
something like along those lines, and

1469
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:54,702
then a discussion after each section of

1470
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,247
the book. So there's part one, part two,

1471
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,422
part three, and we will get in touch

1472
00:57:58,455 --> 00:58:00,417
with the author and see maybe if he is

1473
00:58:00,465 --> 00:58:02,532
willing to come and discuss some of

1474
00:58:02,535 --> 00:58:04,652
these ideas with us and hopefully we'll

1475
00:58:04,682 --> 00:58:06,627
have other people that want to

1476
00:58:06,645 --> 00:58:08,127
participate in the discussions of the

1477
00:58:08,145 --> 00:58:08,725
work.

1478
00:58:13,137 --> 00:58:15,100
Tyler and then I'll give a thought.

1479
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:17,367
Yeah. I think the thing I'm looking

1480
00:58:17,415 --> 00:58:20,252
forward to is so far we've been excited

1481
00:58:20,282 --> 00:58:23,852
about is that putting a concrete

1482
00:58:23,882 --> 00:58:25,872
framework behind ideas that have so far

1483
00:58:25,905 --> 00:58:27,477
been expressed in very abstract kind of

1484
00:58:27,495 --> 00:58:30,207
hand, lazy terms across different kind

1485
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:33,597
of startup folklore and kind of business

1486
00:58:33,705 --> 00:58:36,947
type business books. And so I'm curious

1487
00:58:37,067 --> 00:58:38,622
as the next step about Hohwy, it can

1488
00:58:38,655 --> 00:58:40,227
become a little more like tangible and

1489
00:58:40,245 --> 00:58:43,032
practical for someone who is in the

1490
00:58:43,035 --> 00:58:44,972
perspective of being in an organization,

1491
00:58:45,167 --> 00:58:46,452
how do you actually design an

1492
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:48,792
organization to embody free energy

1493
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:52,127
governance? And so I'm really excited

1494
00:58:52,157 --> 00:58:53,322
to see how that can become a little more

1495
00:58:53,355 --> 00:58:57,117
concrete and clear. Cool. The part

1496
00:58:57,165 --> 00:59:00,702
I'm looking forward to is continuing to

1497
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,612
explore that Explore exploit dialectic.

1498
00:59:05,337 --> 00:59:09,522
Both of those in the extreme lead to

1499
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:12,767
failure in some way or at least increase

1500
00:59:12,827 --> 00:59:15,597
risk. And so this frames are

1501
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:18,822
strategizing as being like in some sort

1502
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,777
of landscape with explore and exploit,

1503
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,302
which of course is really complex with

1504
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,887
these nested organizations. And then you

1505
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:28,617
brought in the art and science, or

1506
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,077
science and engineering or just art and

1507
00:59:31,095 --> 00:59:33,087
communication or whatever other

1508
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:35,652
dialectic. And then even within an

1509
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:38,982
artist's day there's realities like

1510
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:41,897
accounting and the mixing of the paint

1511
00:59:41,942 --> 00:59:43,797
and even the prompt engineering for

1512
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,132
someone who's using those kinds of

1513
00:59:45,135 --> 00:59:48,552
artistic forms. So it lets there be sort

1514
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:52,457
of a light and adaptive

1515
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:55,712
quote explore explore scenario

1516
00:59:55,787 --> 00:59:57,552
happening within the concept of

1517
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:59,267
something that's a lot more meaningful,

1518
00:59:59,402 --> 01:00:01,407
which is the integration of like art,

1519
01:00:01,485 --> 01:00:03,497
science, personal meaning, collective

1520
01:00:03,542 --> 01:00:05,997
meaning and so on, without denying that

1521
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:08,972
those kinds of Explore exploit attention

1522
01:00:09,017 --> 01:00:12,250
and strategic dynamics must happen also.

1523
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,555
Cool. Well, thanks for participating

1524
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,637
guys, and we'll see you next time.
