00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,620
number 1.2

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,160
it's February 15 2023.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,660
welcome to the active inference

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,940
Institute we're a participatory online

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,279
Institute that's communicating learning

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,920
and practicing applied active inference

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,080
this is recorded in archived live stream

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,660
so please provide us with feedback so we

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,640
can improve our work

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,320
all backgrounds and perspectives are

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,120
welcome and will be following video

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,579
etiquette for live streams

14
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,040
check out

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,540
activeinference.org to get involved with

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,660
live streams and other projects

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,339
blue to you

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,340
great well this is our second discussion

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,379
of the book governing continuous

20
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,680
transformation we are here with the

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,160
author Bijan kazri today and we will be

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,359
discussing part two of the textbook

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,400
so I think we want to maybe go around

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,920
and introduce ourselves I am blue Knight

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,619
and independent research consultant in

26
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,200
New Mexico and I will pass it off to

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,240
Tyler

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,860
my name is Tyler I'm a protocol designer

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,500
and DOW researcher in California I said

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,840
to Daniel

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,540
I'm a researcher in California and pass

32
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,759
it to be Jean

33
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,280
okay so

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,460
um obviously an author uh really coming

35
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,880
much more from the Practical side of the

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,560
world having been serving on the boards

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,360
and eventually taking a strong interest

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,820
in the theory and being inspired by

39
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,040
active inference and in particular the

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,200
free energy minimization

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,280
principle to adopt that and apply it to

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,259
the world of corporate governance so

43
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,540
hence the book I very much appreciate

44
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,720
that you invited me today uh and

45
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,939
hopefully being in a having another

46
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,100
stimulating discussion I always love to

47
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,720
see how

48
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,979
um you know there's so much work which

49
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,659
goes into writing a book it's a very

50
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,940
lonely journey and when it's ones out

51
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,520
and you see actually such a gifted group

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,920
of people looking at it reading it

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,840
critically reviewing it and engaging in

54
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,239
a dialogue it's a great gift for an

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,700
authors so I'm I'm very very happy to be

56
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,540
here thank you

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,760
awesome well

58
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,739
Carry It Forward blue

59
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,520
so we are here um discussing part two of

60
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,260
free energy governance so over the last

61
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,739
four weeks we have discussed these last

62
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,900
four chapters

63
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,120
um and so today's discussion is going to

64
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,060
just Encompass those sections

65
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,879
so a bit of a road map we um had some

66
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,000
kind of category questions uh regarding

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,980
the role of empathy and free energy

68
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,260
governance the role of artificial

69
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,000
intelligence in free energy governance

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,260
and also on Duality management

71
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,019
um so starting off with empathy we got

72
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,280
here

73
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,920
um so I just actually was I think

74
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,860
looking up a photo for for like top down

75
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,780
bottom up like what does that look like

76
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,000
top down bottom-up organization

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,640
um and communication and and so like in

78
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,519
my photo scrolling I found this this old

79
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,060
paper right so it's from 2008

80
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,739
um and and it's about

81
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,400
um it's really about empathy and

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,879
emotional uh resonance so so

83
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,200
um this picture I thought was a great

84
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,000
picture and it had perception action

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,340
coupling and shared representation and

86
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,540
kind of like the self and other

87
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,400
distinction and I don't know John if

88
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,840
you've read this paper but but for me

89
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,640
like it was a figure that kind of

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,900
encompassed all these things that we've

91
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,780
been talking about in the book all along

92
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,799
um and so uh to quote bijan's book uh he

93
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,319
says cognition in the form of world

94
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,120
enactment is the purpose-directed

95
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,739
action-centric and social construction

96
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,540
of shared meaning and shared

97
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,180
expectations anchored in the

98
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,680
understanding that a firm's environment

99
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,780
is a matter of environmental engagement

100
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,420
in the form of interaction revealing

101
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,519
significance and assigning probabilities

102
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,760
to a bounded set of external unknown

103
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,780
States

104
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,478
and and I just was wondering like about

105
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,899
maybe the role of empathy in like

106
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,960
gaining a shared representation or a

107
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,280
shared

108
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,440
um understanding so I don't know if you

109
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,020
want to flip to the next there we go

110
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,560
um and so like here is empathy required

111
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,199
for this shared meaning and shared

112
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,320
expectations and I'm curious to know um

113
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,080
Bijan what your thoughts are maybe on on

114
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,840
either this or maybe I know we hear also

115
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,680
a lot about uh the role of emotional

116
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,040
intelligence in business success and so

117
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,720
where does maybe emotional intelligence

118
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,419
come into free energy governance like it

119
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:58,620
is that

120
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,960
um also essential or what are your

121
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,180
thoughts Theory okay now I think it's a

122
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,320
very good question first of all I did

123
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,300
not come across the paper I think it is

124
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,479
a brilliant uh illustration having said

125
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:10,979
so it's interesting to see it puts

126
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,440
perception and then action I put it the

127
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,479
other way around I see the action is

128
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,419
really determining our our perceptions

129
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,220
but I um

130
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,740
I I think it's a very very good question

131
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,020
because what you're doing is you're

132
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,600
opening something which I think as part

133
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,520
of my work I consider the Black Box

134
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,580
because when you look at

135
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,320
you know I don't like really bottom I

136
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,639
think I said this in one of our previous

137
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,280
discussions I prefer Frontline workers I

138
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,539
mean people are really in the front line

139
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,539
having said this the the top down

140
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,580
bottom-up Dynamic you have at every

141
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,660
hierarchical level and effectively

142
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,340
sometimes it's a question of how you

143
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,759
literally work together so then you open

144
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,600
up the black box of teamwork of

145
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,820
um how do you how do you engage actually

146
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,860
which is how do you understand each

147
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,440
other and I think that's where empathy

148
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,060
plays a very important role I think

149
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,440
that's where

150
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,600
um in emotional intelligence starts

151
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,300
playing a very important role what I

152
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,560
have done

153
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,960
for the purposes of the book for the

154
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,759
purposes of the free energy governance

155
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,300
concept I really focused on I think

156
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,860
communication

157
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,080
but there is a lot in communication

158
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,479
which is also empathy related You could

159
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:28,620
argue

160
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,539
um to make sure that actually

161
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,180
people hear what you're saying uh and

162
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,919
and obviously sometimes there needs to

163
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,100
be an empathetic dimension in it but

164
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,979
what I I think the

165
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,979
that the waterfall here is

166
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,759
you start really with a purpose when you

167
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,520
don't have a purpose then it becomes a

168
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,680
little bit fuzzy but if the purpose is

169
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,960
very clear that we want to go to Rome

170
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,240
then there's many ways that are leading

171
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,880
to wrong but as you're going on this

172
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,160
journey and keeping actually the team

173
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,560
together keeping the team energized

174
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,979
motivated of going through a lot of

175
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,740
Hazards maybe crossing the Alps from

176
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,060
from Europe uh to you to on the way to

177
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,319
Rome

178
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,479
um communication becomes very essential

179
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,580
and when you look at the Practical side

180
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,039
of the work even when you take a

181
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,660
publication like have a business review

182
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,000
which in my view is one really of the

183
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,099
leading business Publications which

184
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:32,220
addresses really current issues managers

185
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,740
company leaders but including Frontline

186
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,259
workers are focusing on and you see that

187
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,780
empathy emotional intelligence and

188
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,000
communication are really critical things

189
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,500
in making the most complex strategies

190
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,800
work because there is no point

191
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,900
um of being very smart about analyzing

192
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,000
where the world is going if you're not

193
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,240
able to align and motivate all the

194
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,979
resources all the dots of intelligence

195
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:03,240
in The Firm to join this so I stayed

196
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,860
away as part of the work of looking now

197
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,620
into the

198
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,720
microcosm of communication of what's

199
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,280
happening between

200
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,139
you know let's say a leader and a

201
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,599
Frontline worker how much empathy you

202
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,660
show in certain situations to ensure

203
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,360
that actually the whole flow is going to

204
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,560
work so I think to answer to summarize

205
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,319
the answer when you look at emotional

206
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,679
intelligence when you look at empathy

207
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,779
there are dimensions you would consider

208
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:42,059
more on a micro level in the way things

209
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,520
are being translated which I stayed away

210
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,040
from and really considered it as a black

211
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,200
box of how

212
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,260
the how probably

213
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,839
the communication is best done in very

214
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,980
specific circumstances

215
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,160
so that's clear because it's a it's a

216
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,779
very unusual I think it's a very good

217
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,399
question because it's a question which

218
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,339
really strikes the heart of management

219
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,500
um and has become obviously in recent

220
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,019
years a very popular theme

221
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,760
um

222
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,380
and nobody has ever asked me that

223
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,240
question in this context so I really

224
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,839
appreciate it

225
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,399
and I do remember um

226
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,060
I'm not sure if you've read

227
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,720
France that was like one of the very

228
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,839
first papers that we did at the

229
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,060
institute in our live streams but you

230
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,160
know it still is communication as like a

231
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,260
necessary tool and how communication is

232
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,660
used to kind of establish that that

233
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,839
shared meaning and shared expectation

234
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,420
um but as for like the nuts and bolts of

235
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,740
it it's still

236
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,660
um oh and then we didn't we did another

237
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,779
recent paper dealing with communication

238
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,519
as active inference kind of like the

239
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,560
follow-up but by a different author like

240
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,240
the Counterpoint to that paper I can't

241
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,920
remember the name of it um that was an

242
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,240
interesting thing I would really

243
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,440
appreciate if you could send me the

244
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,380
links to those papers sure sure

245
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,880
um Daniel I'm sure remembers and I can

246
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,800
go back through the live streams if uh I

247
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,060
don't remember

248
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,360
um I appreciate it thank you

249
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,360
um and so just do you think that

250
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,019
um

251
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,180
in human cognition we have we have

252
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,459
empathy in in human cognition and it

253
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,279
plays a role do you think that there's

254
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,040
an analog in organizational cognition

255
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,779
like do you think when a firm has

256
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,480
cognition that there's what would be

257
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,220
what would take like the equivalent role

258
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,980
of empathy in a firm if if anything or

259
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,620
or maybe that's kind of esoteric or what

260
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,899
what are your thoughts there

261
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,260
no I do think um

262
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,440
you know I mean what what is a firm a

263
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,560
firm is a legal fiction and it's it's

264
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,660
really a bunch of people and a bunch of

265
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,680
assets

266
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,079
and sometimes actually the only as it

267
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,820
could be the people let's say in a

268
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,200
Services business where there's no

269
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,380
Machinery or anything so

270
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,480
um I think it really comes down to

271
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,100
people I think it comes down to

272
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,060
leadership

273
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,180
it comes down to the identity it comes

274
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,480
down to the culture and in recent years

275
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,040
you've seen that many many companies I

276
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,860
mean through their leaders have paid a

277
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,720
lot of lip service to being an

278
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,519
empathetic organization having

279
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,740
understanding for the needs of the

280
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,160
workers um of the front liners of the

281
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,800
asset really of the company so I do

282
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,760
think that today

283
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,899
I cannot imagine that a firm which is

284
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,800
not empathetic and or or integrates

285
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,360
empathy

286
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,240
as a as an important pillar

287
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,100
of the values and the culture

288
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,320
it lives it doesn't have a great chance

289
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,779
to survive and when you look at at

290
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,959
culture what is culture in a corporate

291
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,260
in an organizational setting it's really

292
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,420
behavioral benchmarks which determine

293
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,899
really what we would expect of people in

294
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,100
this particular setting you know and uh

295
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,279
um and and I and I think this uh uh

296
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,680
empathy today is incredibly important

297
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,660
and by the way I do think that the

298
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,700
concept of empathy

299
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,300
has gained an entirely new dimension

300
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,820
following the pandemic you know when you

301
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,640
start seeing um people being locked up

302
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,399
having to when you have two working

303
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,880
parents kids sitting at home all of a

304
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,920
sudden there's so many things to juggle

305
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,700
where a company an employer needs to

306
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,639
show empathy and understanding for the

307
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,440
very particular challenges people face

308
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,260
and if you don't

309
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,420
um you you will eventually lose

310
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,540
sometimes even the best of your people

311
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,760
so another follow-up question on that

312
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,560
and maybe just to pose the question in a

313
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,139
slightly different way so a lot so far

314
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,820
we've been talking about empathy in

315
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,200
terms of like an individual human

316
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,420
cognition right and like hey that should

317
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,560
be an important part of your culture

318
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,839
because it allows communication to flow

319
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,660
within and without the form the firm

320
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,639
but I'm curious if there's an analog on

321
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,860
the The Firm organizational level scale

322
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,899
so in the same way that on an individual

323
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,060
scale you're mirroring the Motions of

324
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,399
another person of an external

325
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,200
um individual is there a way in which

326
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,860
the organization as its own entity

327
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,680
mirrors the outside world and mirrors

328
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,060
kind of its own perception of the

329
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,560
environment and what you could call the

330
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,839
emotions of other firms or other

331
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,579
processes happening in this external

332
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,740
environment it's a very like maybe

333
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,380
strange question but I'm kind of curious

334
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,920
in what way do you think that the firm

335
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,240
under free energy governance is

336
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,380
receptive

337
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,660
and can integrate information in this

338
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,940
external environment uh and is that a

339
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,560
different in a way to how people

340
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,300
traditionally think of like Gathering

341
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,160
data about the environment

342
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,560
well when you look at actually if you

343
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,620
were to dissect empathy and what is it

344
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,440
really I think there's two

345
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,019
this two two three dimensions I could

346
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:24,000
instantly think of you you a you say

347
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,380
a person matters so somebody matters

348
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,680
secondly you respect that person

349
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,040
and certainly you really

350
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,680
um you listen I think the listening part

351
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,660
is an incredibly important part how can

352
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,459
you be empathetic if you haven't

353
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,680
listened in the first place so when you

354
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,120
look at all these three dimensions

355
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,760
respect

356
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,920
listening

357
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,699
um

358
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:54,480
the idea that some some somebody and

359
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,680
what somebody has to say matters is

360
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,540
an essential Foundation of free energy

361
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,639
governance because free energy

362
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,699
governance effectively says even the

363
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:08,760
weak signals bear the transformative

364
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,000
potential we need to listen to so first

365
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,160
of all you need to open all your senses

366
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,279
in free energy governance

367
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,279
to listen to what actually frontliners

368
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,480
have to say

369
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,760
and

370
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,639
start was the working assumption that

371
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,339
what they have to say matters

372
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,639
doesn't matter what in in what area uh

373
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,199
they address it

374
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,880
um to be able to read in between the

375
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,399
lines so that's the only way I could

376
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,800
stretch the the concept the dimension of

377
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,800
empathy and really link it into

378
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,779
um into free energy governance by

379
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,579
dissecting it into let's say these three

380
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,339
dimensions what empathy stands for and

381
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:51,959
then pull it back into the free energy

382
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,240
governance framework which effectively

383
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,199
says

384
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,079
the

385
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:59,940
strategy fundamentally is a generative

386
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,320
process

387
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,019
of prediction error minimization

388
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,620
and so you may articulate predictions at

389
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,740
the top but they are only as good as you

390
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,720
can challenge them with bottom-up data

391
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,139
and the bottom-up data to access it to

392
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,279
make it

393
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,240
flow from the bottom to the top probably

394
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,800
requires an element of empathy because

395
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,620
my personal experience is the more you

396
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,779
go the closer you go to the front lines

397
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,519
in an organization

398
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,880
the stronger is actually the resistance

399
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,639
to sharing valuable information

400
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,399
and the reason it's not that people

401
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,019
don't want to share

402
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:46,560
the reason is that people prefer not to

403
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,820
stick out

404
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,579
people prefer not necessarily to assume

405
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:53,220
responsibility now for for something

406
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,279
they say or even if it becomes a project

407
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,139
in its own right that they may have to

408
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,060
execute but they wouldn't want to

409
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,240
execute it so what you find is unlocking

410
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,119
the valuable intelligence which is at

411
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,220
the front lines of an organization

412
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,500
is a management challenge in its own

413
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,780
right and I think it requires very

414
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,939
strong communication and it certainly

415
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,419
requires empathy and the empathy and

416
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:21,000
maybe now I can I can close the circle

417
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,459
here to your question Tyler and what

418
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,160
blue was referring to before

419
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,640
maybe it has to be more

420
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,600
than just an empathetic leader maybe it

421
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,679
has to be trust in processes in an

422
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,500
entire culture that I feel comfortable

423
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,140
about for this to work on a continuous

424
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,960
and sustainable basis because when we

425
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,120
look at free energy governance this is

426
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,000
not like a one-off project this is

427
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,120
ingrained into the DNA of the firm of

428
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,059
saying the future of the firm is best

429
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,940
ascertained if we continuously

430
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,700
generatively minimizing prediction error

431
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,340
so predictions at the top but possibly

432
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,740
sometimes at the bottom and we want to

433
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,360
challenge those predictions with

434
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,439
Frontline intelligence

435
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,820
so um just a quick follow-up as you were

436
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,520
um talking about especially about like

437
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,080
the pandemic and I was there like

438
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,400
thinking about

439
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,620
empathy and Leadership

440
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,140
um you know I was just directed back to

441
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,320
the task positive Network versus the

442
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,559
direct default default mode Network and

443
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,720
and so I think maybe like empathy is is

444
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,160
the central

445
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,220
um component in the default mode Network

446
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,260
like empathy like the default mode

447
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,440
network is like the people-centered part

448
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,000
of that

449
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,280
um and and I was I think like now with

450
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,500
the pandemic like it just like Jarred me

451
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,840
into like we're now so I feel like we're

452
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,740
so off task like I mean maybe not in

453
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,840
every organization but I think as a

454
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,260
society like we're so much more centered

455
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,919
we're flipped into heavy on the DMM um

456
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,559
as opposed to the tpn uh just just

457
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,480
culturally because of the the greater

458
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,160
amount of empathy that everyone was just

459
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,100
required to drum up for um people and

460
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,120
and

461
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,260
um their circumstances right

462
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,419
and I do think what has reinforced it's

463
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,880
it's a very good way of looking actually

464
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,020
at the um task specific uh uh uh Network

465
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,240
or in the default mode Network you're

466
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,580
absolutely right the empathy is part of

467
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,260
the default mode when you look now at

468
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,760
the pandemic

469
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,460
it was all about the default mode I mean

470
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,620
because there was so much misery so much

471
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,500
tragedy certainly in the first waves and

472
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,840
the uncertainty and predictability in

473
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,720
our models were overwhelmed because our

474
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,900
world models were not prepared to deal

475
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,940
with this it took a year a year and a

476
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,559
half and we integrated the pandemic

477
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,840
perfectly well into an adjusted a

478
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,120
further evolved model and we developed

479
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,919
new strategies of how to deal with this

480
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,140
but one element is for example home

481
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,080
office and when you think about how hard

482
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,020
it has become for many firms to bring

483
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,120
people back to the office and you could

484
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,178
almost say the office is Maybe

485
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,039
the physical representation of the

486
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,539
task-specific network

487
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,340
you know you go because you're really

488
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,640
executing a specific task in in a

489
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,559
building and then you leave it and then

490
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,900
you know you're out of it so almost

491
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,360
there was a there was a certain Link in

492
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,000
the brain between office

493
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,500
and task specificity

494
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,660
um I do recall another example which is

495
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,220
kind of interesting in that context but

496
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,320
I don't want to drift up too far but I

497
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,620
do recall that Banks introduced

498
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,460
um

499
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,100
you know it was kind of only in the 90s

500
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,140
I think that they introduced that you

501
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,120
can have a casual Friday

502
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,700
so normally it was really just you wear

503
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,820
a suit and then you come on Fridays you

504
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,400
can wear casual smart

505
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,260
and I remember somebody was telling me

506
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,120
actually uh when you go on the Goldman

507
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,640
Sachs trading floor the person who has a

508
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,679
hole in the sweater and all of this on a

509
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,419
Friday that's probably the guy who makes

510
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,940
most the money because he shows like I

511
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,220
don't even have to wear this Market but

512
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,140
a lot of people said when the financial

513
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,360
crisis hit in 2008 and which was really

514
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,520
exuberance of you know all that cheap

515
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,860
money putting a lot of people into

516
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,360
misery uh was was that and and mortgages

517
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,039
that this was partly related to the fact

518
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,179
that

519
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,520
the Casual Friday became almost the

520
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,919
Casual the whole week and it had an

521
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,700
impact on on how uh people were

522
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,799
performing actually their tasks and

523
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,200
their their attitude towards risk so I

524
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,460
do think that form and informality are

525
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,179
very very critical aspects of of you

526
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:08,220
know how an organization works and

527
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,559
sometimes the informal organization

528
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,960
which is obviously a function of the

529
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,640
formal one

530
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,340
can be much more important and sometimes

531
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,380
it can be much more important how

532
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,020
information is Flowing most of the time

533
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,240
in organizations coming back to the free

534
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,159
energy governance framework

535
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,100
the most valuable information does not

536
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,059
come

537
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,700
through the formal channels it comes

538
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,039
through informal channels it may come

539
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,140
through a conversation at the water

540
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,600
cooler

541
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,559
all these things which are not

542
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,960
necessarily documented in the

543
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,700
traditional forms of corporate

544
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,580
communication so I think these are

545
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:52,020
probably also the channels where empathy

546
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,220
can be best

547
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,419
communicated and I think the big loss of

548
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,360
um during the pandemic was that while

549
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,000
the the office work and the office space

550
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,900
was maybe very formal and very

551
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,760
um

552
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,900
tasks specific

553
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,740
I think it was at the same time

554
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,440
underestimated how important it is to

555
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,140
provide to frontliners to even to

556
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,140
leaders the source of empathy in

557
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,820
exchange because I think most people

558
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,799
were confronted with the terrible

559
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,080
loneliness and so we shouldn't

560
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,480
underestimate and we shouldn't

561
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,620
Bash Too Much the physical office space

562
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:39,840
is a very important place not only where

563
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,440
um uh where you perform your task but

564
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,500
could be also a source of of being

565
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,559
energized and receiving understanding

566
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,240
for issues which have nothing to do with

567
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,340
your job and more importantly it's

568
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,700
really the the side of learning I do

569
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,820
recall when Morgan Stanley CEO insisted

570
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,140
that people are coming back to the

571
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,380
office it was really by saying our

572
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,320
future as a company is dependent on

573
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,020
continuing training people and bringing

574
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,299
in young Talent who have to learn on the

575
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,520
job how can they learn on the job when

576
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,520
the office is empty so there is a duty

577
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,700
in the name of firm survival to keep the

578
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,919
firm as a learning side and that means

579
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,799
bringing in the side so that's a long

580
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:26,640
talk

581
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,860
um obviously the the concept of empathy

582
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,020
in the context of free energy governance

583
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,179
it's not an obvious one but I think this

584
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:34,559
is an interesting very interesting

585
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,860
conversation and I do think that we um

586
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,900
we need to dissect

587
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,020
the what really empathy means for and

588
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,780
then we need to look at what is a firm a

589
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,480
firm consisting of people of assets but

590
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,120
also of the physical space and I think

591
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,919
the space is a is a very important

592
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:58,260
Dimension to consider uh and that's

593
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,880
where the pandemic is an interesting

594
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,419
example of how it can be a source of

595
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,179
um of

596
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:08,340
whatever positive we associate was

597
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,418
empathy to provide

598
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,380
awesome so we'll move now into talking a

599
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,880
little bit more about artificial

600
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,440
intelligence

601
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,679
um and do you say in the book you say in

602
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:24,659
fact we are challenged not to allow for

603
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,580
the human brain's computational limits

604
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,039
to solely determine perception and sense

605
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,980
making instead Outsourcing some of the

606
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,659
heavy information lifting to the

607
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,400
environment in form of extended

608
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,860
cognition is the essence of optimizing

609
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,380
prediction error minimization the more

610
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,080
exponential and hence discontinuous a

611
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,059
market environment the more we need

612
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,220
self-organizing mechanisms that leverage

613
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,380
the world as a supervisory signal

614
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,260
challenging and circular causality the

615
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,299
very perceptual content of our

616
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:55,520
predictions

617
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,919
and in reading this I have been having

618
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,260
lots of fun working with GPT chat as I'm

619
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,840
sure you have and many others have have

620
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,840
been um and really as as just kind of a

621
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,440
like a platform or a standing like a

622
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,140
springboard for like where we what we

623
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,600
already know like it's a very big

624
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,059
cognitive synthesis of like you know the

625
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,400
whole internet Circa 2021 or or

626
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,740
something like that and so like this is

627
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,960
really a cognitive extension like our

628
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,659
smartphone and many other things uh um

629
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:30,120
and so I just was wondering what role

630
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,559
you might see for chat GPT or other

631
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,720
automated artificial intelligence I mean

632
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,760
like the you know there's no limit to

633
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,460
um assist us with free energy governance

634
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,400
because I really see like an assisting

635
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,620
with the synthesis and integration of

636
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,900
information like at a very large scale

637
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,140
even just now compared to a year ago so

638
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,799
do you see a role um for AI in free

639
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,140
energy governance or helping us to kind

640
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,919
of

641
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,320
springboard our leadership platforms

642
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,700
yeah

643
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,700
very good question so let me

644
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,220
um uh there's many dimensions to it

645
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,960
number one

646
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,460
um

647
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,620
free energy governance

648
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,240
strictly speaking

649
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,100
that's not consider making use of AI at

650
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,480
the board level

651
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,600
now when you look and let's briefly talk

652
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,840
about an organization applications of AI

653
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,279
you have today

654
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:34,559
I mean so many examples from credit

655
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,779
cards where you have ai I mean which

656
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,299
used to be which has been now automated

657
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:42,900
in in a massive way of how credit checks

658
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,940
are happening on the spot it's no longer

659
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,860
left to the retailer but there's a

660
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,500
central system which can authorize the

661
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,779
credit card transaction instantly or

662
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:55,559
refuse it so there has been predictive

663
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:58,080
algorithms

664
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,460
um being centralized and changing

665
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,900
the way certain tasks have been done in

666
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,179
an organization so I would say the

667
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:10,020
application of AI today is very much at

668
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,860
the front lines where it's probably

669
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,900
a little bit further up the chain also

670
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,480
is if you look at Healthcare so a

671
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,799
radiologist

672
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,380
is possibly redundant today but if you

673
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,900
make the radiologist redundant because a

674
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,179
machine can maybe possibly read

675
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:30,360
uh the image is much better it may have

676
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,860
repercussions of how you're going to

677
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,059
start organizing the whole hospital

678
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:36,120
because who's assuming now what role and

679
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,279
maybe the role of the nurse is going to

680
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:40,860
be upskilled because on the basis of the

681
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,080
machine output uh there will be

682
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,200
direction to the right doctor to to look

683
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,179
really for treatment whatever is the

684
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:51,960
reading from um from the images so I

685
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,880
think we need to

686
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,720
um

687
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,400
see now that AI starts first of all in a

688
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,799
very task specific way

689
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,620
but moves up and all of a sudden has

690
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,000
very systemic changes applying a i

691
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,279
at the board level

692
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,779
um

693
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:14,700
I don't see this

694
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,880
at this moment you know information

695
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,740
processing

696
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,320
will not be done at the board level with

697
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,620
AI tools I I doubt this at this point

698
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,080
when I look now specifically at free

699
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,120
energy governance well free energy

700
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,380
governance if you look at free energy

701
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,960
principle for me that is an artificial

702
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,020
active inference and the way uh

703
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,240
carliferson has been even applying it to

704
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,580
neuroimaging is a machine learning

705
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,320
algorithm so for me free energy

706
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,580
governance

707
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,279
is really a machine learning logic

708
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:52,080
in its entirety now when you look at

709
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,120
what is happening uh chat GPT is not as

710
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,919
smart as a lot of people think at the

711
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,240
end it's just a language model and uh it

712
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,659
it makes statistically very plausible

713
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:09,120
language it produces which it doesn't

714
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,779
understand itself so it poses obviously

715
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,419
great challenges so I think that has

716
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:16,860
been a little bit misleading having said

717
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,880
this

718
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,039
I think it's not misleading to the

719
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,460
extent that chat GPT is an indication

720
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,820
that generative intelligence automated

721
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,399
augmented is the future and this is

722
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,620
going to come and I think we will have a

723
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,320
hard time and humans to catch up how

724
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,539
fast it can evolve and the things it's

725
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:38,039
doing because it's getting better every

726
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,679
day because it's training on the back of

727
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,460
massive training knowledge now

728
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,320
what is happening

729
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,899
and that is definitely a challenge for

730
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:52,080
the board you could ask how can the

731
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,260
board continue fulfilling its most basic

732
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,620
fiduciary duty of monitoring company and

733
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,799
management if itself the board has no

734
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,299
means of understanding what the

735
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:05,760
algorithms do because algorithms can be

736
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,580
potentially very damaging so I do see

737
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,059
that there will be a safety and ethical

738
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:14,220
um a regulatory Dimension which will

739
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,919
probably need to be addressed at the

740
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,779
board level when you look at it from an

741
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:21,539
AI point of view now so that's a little

742
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:23,580
bit to the question of artificial

743
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,559
intelligence and free energy governance

744
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,260
I specific specifically have not

745
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,500
considered any tools at the board level

746
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,700
now when you look at what is artificial

747
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,760
intelligence really about it allows you

748
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,419
to separate two components which make up

749
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,940
a decision it's a predictive component

750
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,640
and it's a judgment component I think

751
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,700
the predictive component can be more and

752
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,860
more done the prediction element by

753
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,460
machines on the back of data but I do

754
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,440
think that it revalues the Judgment

755
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,659
component of the human

756
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:04,740
now it could be that

757
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,559
it's no longer really the top let's say

758
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,659
leaders which are best positioned to

759
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:12,120
make the Judgment component maybe people

760
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,799
on the front lines

761
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,980
now being empowered by artificially

762
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,220
intelligence fueled prediction models

763
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,980
and prediction tools can place a much

764
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,240
better position to make the right

765
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,820
judgment call so I think the impact of

766
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,500
artificial intelligence on the company

767
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,700
will be more distributed decision making

768
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,700
to be really more in real time

769
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,820
now coming back to the quote you

770
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,100
originally were reading out

771
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,980
the the most important element of that

772
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,840
quote is

773
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,059
what you see today

774
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:50,580
is that most people in leadership

775
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,820
positions will tell you the world has

776
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,779
become uncertain and it's unpredictable

777
00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:00,240
and my answer to this is always first of

778
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,539
all uncertainty and unpredictability is

779
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:06,299
a very subjective concept it's not an

780
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:08,159
objective reality

781
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,980
and

782
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:14,100
your perception of uncertainty or

783
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,220
unpredictability is really a function of

784
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,740
how good is your world model how good is

785
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,539
your prediction model so if you're

786
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:23,940
telling me the world is uncertain you're

787
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,399
effectively telling me your model is not

788
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:27,539
good enough

789
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,000
of modeling it and in a generative

790
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,480
actively inferential way going step by

791
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,720
step forward to improve it and make the

792
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,419
world less uncertain

793
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,519
by the way I do believe also for the

794
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,399
pandemic was a brilliant example if you

795
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,860
if you had a world model which maybe

796
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,559
Bill Gates had that pandemics are going

797
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,720
to come they're going to be massive and

798
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,220
they're going to be Global there's no

799
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,200
way you're going to contain in today's

800
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,539
world something which started in China

801
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,460
it's going to stay in Wuhan but it's

802
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,320
going to be Global but if you think

803
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,620
about it it started off in 2019 November

804
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,980
December and people until January

805
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,399
February in the Western Hemisphere still

806
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:14,099
thought this was a Chinese problem

807
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:16,560
and they weren't prepared at all now

808
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,659
think about it some people were smart

809
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,179
enough and they exploited the business

810
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,820
opportunity by going up front into

811
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,879
producing a massive amount of face masks

812
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,099
so when all of a sudden the pandemic hit

813
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:32,580
in March April they were the ones making

814
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,560
fortunes because governments didn't have

815
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,359
the right prediction model and they

816
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:38,339
didn't have enough masks I know actually

817
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:41,339
the guys who did take advantage of this

818
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:43,379
in Switzerland and I think they made 250

819
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:44,879
million dollars or something like this

820
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,460
and they they because they caught really

821
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,679
the government naked so you see the

822
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,540
discrepancy even governments where you

823
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,339
suppose was all the resources they have

824
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:55,320
at hand all the information they have

825
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,619
they have bad prediction models so

826
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:02,400
your prediction model determines

827
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,760
how uncertain and how unpredictable the

828
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,839
world is

829
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,780
and a big problem you have today in

830
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,599
companies is that companies do not

831
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:15,480
Embrace uncertainty but they bury

832
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,720
uncertainty a book which puts this

833
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,460
brilliantly into perspective is from

834
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,760
agaval and Avi Fab

835
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,460
um It's called Power and prediction and

836
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,420
it shows very clearly how companies have

837
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,720
developed as aguiri said uh back in the

838
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,020
60s it's skilled incompetence where you

839
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,720
act in a way which is really contrary to

840
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,599
your intentions or what you really want

841
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,900
to achieve and what has happened is that

842
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,020
companies have created rules best

843
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,880
practices

844
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,240
um you could even argue that putting the

845
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,900
CEO in a super dominant position

846
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,220
controlling everything

847
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,359
is a form of bearing uncertainty because

848
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,119
you look now to one person and you say

849
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,680
that person is going to give me all the

850
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,839
answers of the world instead what we

851
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,980
need to do is we need to make our models

852
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,040
available to testing in the marketplace

853
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,040
in a generative inferential way

854
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,119
by acting and generating new data points

855
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:26,460
that make our model in a generative

856
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,859
fashion better and better and as a

857
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:31,320
result of it our predictions models get

858
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,180
better the predictions they produce get

859
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,820
better and the world will be perceived

860
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,460
as less uncertain and that's really the

861
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,460
essence of the quote you started off

862
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,359
with

863
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:44,820
so we have two elements here one is

864
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,400
really the the uncertainty

865
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,160
um element I I think we need to really

866
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,380
highlight is a subjective concept and

867
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,940
it's a question of world modeling or

868
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,140
prediction modeling and prediction

869
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,839
testing the second uh Dimension you

870
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,880
addressed is the one of artificial

871
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,040
intelligence I do think artificial

872
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,859
intelligence or augmented intelligence

873
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,240
You could argue is it really that

874
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,740
artificial

875
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,680
um uh is is is is just at the very

876
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,660
beginning it's going to be exponential

877
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,640
it's going to be faster evolving and

878
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,980
spreading that anybody can expect and I

879
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,780
do believe that

880
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,599
in around within 10 years

881
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,820
70 to 80 percent of knowledge workers

882
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,119
will disappear and only those people

883
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,079
will survive working in any organization

884
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,440
that can understand manage and

885
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,700
complement

886
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,200
artificial intelligence

887
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,859
and by the way there's so many examples

888
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:46,740
you can see how artificial intelligence

889
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,500
allowed in an incredible way to get rid

890
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,640
of

891
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,220
I mean millions of jobs

892
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,680
you know

893
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,660
already

894
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,359
and even if you think about a

895
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:04,260
radiologist has a very uh intense

896
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,660
training in medical education

897
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,599
and in the book power prediction is a

898
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,400
really good example I think it is in

899
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,079
that book other there is another great

900
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,720
book I recommend on the topic it's all

901
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,920
in on AI by devonport and mittal which

902
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,660
gives you a really good overview good

903
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,240
structure a few good case studies and

904
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,820
you can see that the the the the the the

905
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,760
the job of a radiologist

906
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,300
can be divided into I think roughly 35

907
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,240
or 38 tasks and when you look at each of

908
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,700
the tasks a machine can do this today so

909
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,540
that job is gone

910
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,920
yeah it's interesting the level of

911
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,820
synthesis so so how much of our so for

912
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,280
me the essence of that quote was

913
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,800
um cognitive offloading into systems

914
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,300
that can synthesize and integrate

915
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,520
information

916
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,140
um how much of that task is what is done

917
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,420
by Ai and I do agree with you that we

918
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,140
will um need to be able to work with the

919
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,540
AI like to understand that synthesized

920
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,220
synthesis and integration of information

921
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,440
that's provided by augmented

922
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,300
intelligence systems in order to be

923
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,680
functional in the workplace going

924
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,060
forward

925
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,520
um yeah but you see the big weaknesses

926
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,320
where people don't understand by the way

927
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,020
that quote when I recall

928
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,820
um it's

929
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,700
it's Howie you guys know Howie he wrote

930
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,260
a brilliant book The predictive brain

931
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,320
and how he is probably more structural

932
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,420
Bayesian guy

933
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,900
um but he's really brilliant in the way

934
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,700
he shows

935
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,040
it actually would

936
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,680
the the Bayesian brain is about is

937
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,220
is really you you you you

938
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:00,420
you use the world as a feedback loop

939
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,400
so you you can come up with any

940
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,579
predictions you want let the world

941
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:07,619
you know give you all the feedback you

942
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:09,780
need and that's a that's a very powerful

943
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,500
way of how you start a general in a

944
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,359
generative way

945
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,920
reducing uncertainty

946
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,520
definitely so I don't know I guess we

947
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,680
should maybe go on to our last set of

948
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,520
questions on Duality management

949
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,240
um so here Bijan is it only critical for

950
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,859
the board to understand Duality

951
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:37,079
management or do you think at every

952
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:38,820
level of the hierarchy from the front

953
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,400
line workers up to top tier management

954
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,680
to end the board does everyone need to

955
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,720
understand Duality management and

956
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,000
practice this or is it only necessarily

957
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,040
at the top

958
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,099
well I I I don't think you would explain

959
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:55,680
to anyone in the front line that you

960
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,680
have to engage in Duality but

961
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,619
um because it's a certain degree it's an

962
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:04,680
abstract con concept and I developed

963
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,220
Duality management really at the at the

964
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,760
very very top level almost

965
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,700
you know dynamic capabilities the

966
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,920
concept of dynamic capabilities

967
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,339
in strategy management

968
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:23,460
is defined a dynamic capability as a

969
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,760
non-operational capability so you say

970
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,240
it's a some call it also a meta

971
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,740
capability so it's not a task specific

972
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,900
capability so you would almost say when

973
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,960
we talk about Duality management you

974
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,839
move very quickly into the default mode

975
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:46,680
side of the brain and what it really is

976
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:51,540
about I I used it in the context and I

977
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,720
think I I said it in our last discussion

978
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,480
you can really reduce

979
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,300
everything about a company about two

980
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,599
Dimensions one is exploiting today's

981
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,940
Cash Flow and making the money that's

982
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,099
really the business you have and

983
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,200
developing the future cash flow stream

984
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,420
which is the exploration so you have

985
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,260
exploitation exploration and

986
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,540
there have been so many theories about

987
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,420
and and case studies about can you do

988
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,000
both at the same time how does it work

989
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,520
and sometimes people said oh you do

990
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,980
exploitation here but you create a whole

991
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,900
different new thing over there and you

992
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,460
don't mix them and sometimes they don't

993
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,859
mix that easily I don't think companies

994
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:36,980
have that luxury any longer and I think

995
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:40,140
exploitation focusing on today's Cash

996
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,300
Flow and doing something new is it

997
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,680
really that radical is it more

998
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,260
incremental is happening kind of in real

999
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,040
time

1000
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,859
but it requires very strong leadership

1001
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:52,680
because when you think about exploiting

1002
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,200
today's Cash Flow is a very hardcore

1003
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,280
operational activity so CEOs usually

1004
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,980
immerse very very strongly in the

1005
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,859
exploitative activity when they're

1006
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:07,640
really good they can also do exploration

1007
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,859
and they need to make sure how they

1008
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:13,980
switch between the default mode which is

1009
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,200
probably more for exploration thinking

1010
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,619
creatively about Innovation projects and

1011
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:21,480
at the same time managing

1012
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,420
and optimizing an existing cash

1013
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,400
generating business

1014
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,500
my idea was

1015
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,980
um behind Duality management to say

1016
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,540
the board

1017
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,819
has is actually uniquely positioned

1018
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:37,680
because it's not involved in any

1019
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,540
operational activities really of the

1020
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,579
company the board is not involved in

1021
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:43,260
running today's business

1022
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,200
it can have a great super View

1023
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,260
of saying where should actually maybe

1024
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,020
the CEO be guided towards of maybe

1025
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,020
emphasizing right now more exploitation

1026
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,960
or exploration where people see as a

1027
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,460
board when they analyze the business

1028
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,280
they can see the problems that concerns

1029
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,839
one complex second complex I have is

1030
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:08,819
financial and strategic

1031
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:11,040
um control and they really stand for

1032
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,220
in-house Innovation and Innovation you

1033
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,800
buy through by buying other companies or

1034
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,020
certain things and

1035
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,440
um I the view of the free and or the way

1036
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,180
free energy governance

1037
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:24,980
um

1038
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,839
and this is how the whole section 2 is

1039
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,119
structured you have the structural

1040
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:31,619
component which is really how you

1041
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:34,020
connect the top at the bottom the

1042
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,480
cognition component is really related to

1043
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,339
how you have a an ability to an accurate

1044
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:44,400
World create a model and I always like

1045
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,160
the Googles the Facebooks all these

1046
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,540
companies who have created massive

1047
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,660
businesses but they really created this

1048
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,740
um in in a in an active way they did not

1049
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,440
copy someone they did not do a market

1050
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,079
research or adapt but they had a vision

1051
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:02,940
of their own which I think is essential

1052
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,980
and the third dimension are the

1053
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,640
capabilities and the capabilities I

1054
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,240
developed this Duality management as a

1055
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,859
dynamic capability and dynamic

1056
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:16,800
capability is really a specific meta

1057
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,800
capability in strategy management so I

1058
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,660
think when you look at these two

1059
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,579
complexes how much do I focus on the

1060
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:25,859
business I have how much do I focus on

1061
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:27,119
the business I would like to have

1062
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,579
tomorrow and how much of it is done

1063
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:31,500
in-house and how much of this is done

1064
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,240
possibly by buying it uh

1065
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,660
uh forces which sometimes uh uh uh are

1066
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,420
going against or going in line and I

1067
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,319
think the board in its meta position

1068
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:48,300
supervisory position being above the

1069
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,400
executive leadership has a unique

1070
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,339
position to practice this so that

1071
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:55,920
indirectly answers your question I think

1072
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,920
Duality management the more you go down

1073
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,560
in the hierarchy of a business which

1074
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,079
means the closer you go to the front

1075
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,500
lines where heart tasks are being

1076
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,140
performed the less you have a duality

1077
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,700
management you shouldn't have a duality

1078
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,339
management at all because people are

1079
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:16,920
really focused on very specific tasks

1080
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,520
and the further you move up and the more

1081
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,440
you have to decide are you going to do

1082
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,380
one of this or more of this you may find

1083
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,920
The Duality management challenge so it

1084
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,319
may not be just on the board but it's

1085
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:33,260
certainly on the board when it comes to

1086
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,300
exploitation exploration and financial

1087
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,980
and strategic control

1088
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,020
now that's a long answer I gave I hope

1089
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,740
you could follow me

1090
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,300
that's great thank you so much I try to

1091
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,579
make it simple because obviously

1092
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:49,200
um when you look at the very origins of

1093
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,700
this book it was originally a

1094
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,700
dissertation which started off uh really

1095
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,500
in strategy management

1096
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,520
uh and uh I'm so happy that I found it

1097
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,980
all the way to the more neuroscientific

1098
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,619
Dimension and we're talking the in the

1099
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:06,300
in the context of the active inference

1100
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,800
Institute

1101
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,960
um but obviously when you talk

1102
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,579
specifically about The Duality

1103
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,859
management side we are really pretty

1104
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:17,540
much in in Business Schools

1105
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,200
so getting going from

1106
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,480
um maybe a more uh

1107
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,359
thoughtful to the more practical

1108
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:31,020
um can you give an example of um

1109
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,119
how you can reduce organizational

1110
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,819
friction through this top-down bottom-up

1111
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,859
hierarchical coupling like it gets very

1112
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:39,960
fuzzy for me as I mean even as we're

1113
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,000
talking about like what levels need to

1114
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,640
understand Duality management like the

1115
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,680
the I mean I get the communication

1116
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,900
between the levels is key to like

1117
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,260
organizational maintenance or like the

1118
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,359
Persistence of a firm

1119
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:57,119
um but but like Translating that into

1120
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,280
some kind of practical terms that I

1121
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,800
could apply at my firm for instance is

1122
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,780
maybe a little bit more difficult so so

1123
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,339
do you have

1124
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:08,099
um any advice for us that are you know

1125
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:11,839
down here in the nitty-gritty of it all

1126
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:12,540
[Music]

1127
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,859
um

1128
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:16,440
so

1129
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,560
I do think what tools you apply

1130
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,020
that are practically of relevance is

1131
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,060
maybe a function also of the size of the

1132
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,359
organization so let's start with a

1133
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,099
really big organization take a big

1134
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:30,660
Insurance Company

1135
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,819
and you have the board of an insurance

1136
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:34,859
company which will be very respectable

1137
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:38,339
people who have probably jobs as CEOs on

1138
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:40,440
many different other companies they come

1139
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,960
together four or five times a year they

1140
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,359
take major decisions

1141
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:46,560
um

1142
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,280
how can such a board

1143
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,339
better understand

1144
00:48:52,339 --> 00:48:56,460
independently of CEO framing as a filter

1145
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,859
what overall is going on how can the

1146
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:02,579
board make the CEO stronger to ensure

1147
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:05,220
that the CEO actually is properly

1148
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,819
connected with what's really going on

1149
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:11,460
in in the in the in the in the front

1150
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,660
lines and one concept I I like a lot I

1151
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,599
think I've talked about it before but I

1152
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:20,579
I think the concept

1153
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:22,859
is a good concept to bring as an example

1154
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:25,920
again because it highlights and then you

1155
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,200
can think creatively of what other

1156
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,240
things you can think of but they are

1157
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,780
Shadow boards so having a group of young

1158
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,760
high potential people who are quite far

1159
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,560
removed from the very top

1160
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,700
that they form aboard themselves and

1161
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,920
have board meetings with very similar

1162
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,220
agenda items and can discuss what should

1163
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,160
be maybe the future agenda items and

1164
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,140
that can serve as a tremendous source of

1165
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,780
inspiration from the front lines to the

1166
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,280
main board which is sitting on the very

1167
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,200
top

1168
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,859
and that is a wonderful way I see as

1169
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:04,619
connecting uh the top and the bottom and

1170
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:06,900
leading the information flow companies

1171
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,000
which have done this is like total

1172
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,339
energy one the French one of the biggest

1173
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:14,160
energy companies in the fashion business

1174
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,920
Prada Gucci

1175
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,079
um and when you think about it Prada and

1176
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:21,359
Gucci are obviously companies which are

1177
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,720
living off young Talent people young

1178
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,660
designers something edgy something new

1179
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,240
uh because think about it in fashion

1180
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,240
you've got to come up every season with

1181
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,579
something which is setting a trend so

1182
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:38,040
you're really dependent on being

1183
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,980
connected to the front line and from

1184
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,740
creative people picking up what is the

1185
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,440
next so I like the fashion houses

1186
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,619
because they show how important it is to

1187
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:51,960
be connected to the very front lines a

1188
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,760
big insurance company may not see it but

1189
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,460
a big insurance company may be missing

1190
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,859
what be the next

1191
00:50:58,859 --> 00:51:01,680
big thing maybe young people will be

1192
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,140
asking for as a business model

1193
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,900
for as an interesting Insurance market

1194
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,579
and

1195
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:12,599
um so I think that is a really good

1196
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:15,180
two now let's go into small

1197
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,920
organizations let's take the active

1198
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,619
inference Institute as an example and

1199
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:21,119
you're saying look we have this

1200
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,480
wonderful scientific Advisory Board you

1201
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,240
have uh a wonderful board who is

1202
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,660
advising you uh uh and and and and and

1203
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,760
and and guiding you

1204
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,359
um how to make how to increase I mean

1205
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:38,880
you have I think you have one purpose to

1206
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,500
increase the impact of the active

1207
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,319
Insurance Institute in the marketplace

1208
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,819
and you're looking at various tools

1209
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:46,740
you're looking at very various

1210
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,020
engagement platforms our dialogue is one

1211
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,180
of them you're reaching out through

1212
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:54,839
channels to at every juncture optimize

1213
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:56,940
that and I'm trying to support this as

1214
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,520
well because I really truly believe in

1215
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,780
in the mission of the active

1216
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,819
interference Institute and I do believe

1217
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:05,760
that it is the very beginning

1218
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,040
of a great movement because I see that

1219
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,500
as the future I'm absolutely convinced

1220
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,900
of that so in that regard you're

1221
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,059
definitely Pioneers our community is

1222
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:16,619
still very small

1223
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:19,920
now here's the question of how you

1224
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,020
connect the top

1225
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:25,380
which is you guys now was the was the

1226
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,260
front line and the front line may have

1227
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,359
really interesting

1228
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:33,300
weak signals which could give you some

1229
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,339
really inspirational input where you say

1230
00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:36,960
we should take it on and I think you're

1231
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,760
doing it you're doing it with a

1232
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,280
newsletter you're reaching out you're

1233
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,619
obviously want to make sure people read

1234
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:46,619
it they engage with this and you have

1235
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:48,720
internship programs you have a number of

1236
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,900
ways of how to bring in

1237
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,619
really the the marketplace to challenge

1238
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:59,460
you to improve you was one and only one

1239
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,099
Mission and purpose in mind to make sure

1240
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:04,980
that the products the output from the

1241
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:08,420
active inference Institute has impact

1242
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,880
represents the aspirations you have for

1243
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,359
high quality intelligence

1244
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,460
um that more and more people should

1245
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,339
connect to and I think you're doing

1246
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:22,740
quite a great job with the limited

1247
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,920
resources you have by doing all these

1248
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,680
tools creating these dialogues you are

1249
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:33,180
acting actually to generate great

1250
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,839
data points including our conversations

1251
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:39,300
and the way you then package the outputs

1252
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,540
to reach out and collect input from

1253
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:45,000
people we may not know at this point who

1254
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,280
may connect to the content and I think

1255
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,960
this is a form

1256
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,900
of structure in a very distributed

1257
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,760
environment when you look at how the

1258
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,619
active interference Institute is working

1259
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:58,260
of connecting actually the top which is

1260
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,640
you guys

1261
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,400
the front lines are possibly people like

1262
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,000
myself giving feedback so Frontline is

1263
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,400
not always you know it doesn't imply is

1264
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,599
somebody

1265
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,339
um that's why I don't like the word

1266
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:12,619
bottom

1267
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:14,940
sometimes your most intelligent people

1268
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,460
in the network may be your frontliners

1269
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,000
giving you the right feedbacks and data

1270
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,280
points I hope that's that answers the

1271
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,680
question and puts a little bit more more

1272
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,240
tangibly into your perspective

1273
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,640
most definitely and I think uh thank you

1274
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,140
for all the nice things you have to say

1275
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,480
about the active inference Institute

1276
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,280
that's always uh it's always nice to get

1277
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,720
a compliment

1278
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,540
um and I think that um that's it for

1279
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,859
today unless there's any more like

1280
00:54:43,859 --> 00:54:47,940
burning thoughts or questions

1281
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,599
foreign

1282
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,660
I think the the next chapter goes a

1283
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,619
little bit more into the corporate

1284
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:17,880
governance side

1285
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,760
I I think we've covered quite a bit uh

1286
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,180
of this so when you I think uh next one

1287
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,259
is three conclusion

1288
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,680
um and um

1289
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,780
I think 13 uh

1290
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,300
uh chapter 13

1291
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,700
um which is our performance and survival

1292
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,040
as a matter of self-organization

1293
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,220
is quite philosophical I think is a is a

1294
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,800
topic and um

1295
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,680
I look forward to it

1296
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,319
and thank you so much for for also

1297
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,960
taking interest in my work it means a

1298
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,740
lot to an author

1299
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,960
