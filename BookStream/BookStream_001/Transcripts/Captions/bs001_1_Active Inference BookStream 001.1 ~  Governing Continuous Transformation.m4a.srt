00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,914
Hello and welcome, everyone. It's

2
00:00:09,962 --> 00:00:13,354
January 11, 2023. We're in ActInf

3
00:00:13,402 --> 00:00:16,826
Livestream number 1.1 on governing

4
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:19,486
continuous transformation. Off to the

5
00:00:19,508 --> 00:00:22,862
facilitator. All right,

6
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:25,478
so today we are discussing Parr one, a

7
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:26,802
Governing Continuous Transformation.

8
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:29,154
We're looking enough to have the author,

9
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:31,366
Bijan Kezeri, with us today. I hope I

10
00:00:31,388 --> 00:00:33,798
pronounce that right, Bijan? Yeah. All

11
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:35,906
right, wonderful. So we are the active

12
00:00:35,938 --> 00:00:37,206
inference institute. So we are

13
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:39,146
participatory online institute that is

14
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,854
communicating, learning, and practicing

15
00:00:40,902 --> 00:00:43,034
applied active inference. All those

16
00:00:43,072 --> 00:00:45,738
links are socials, so this is recorded

17
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:49,242
in an archived live stream. So please

18
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:50,758
give us feedback so we can improve our

19
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,746
work. All backgrounds and perspectives

20
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:54,526
are welcome, and we will be doing our

21
00:00:54,548 --> 00:00:57,214
best to follow video etiquette for this

22
00:00:57,252 --> 00:01:00,606
live stream. All right, so this

23
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:03,458
is all active coherence activity are

24
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:04,866
participatory, so if you want to get

25
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:06,740
involved, let us know.

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,220
All right, so this is the one dot one

27
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,590
book stream. So we've been discussing

28
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,302
governing continuous transformation,

29
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:18,046
reframing the strategy governance.

30
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:22,154
Conversation by John Kasri So we've

31
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:24,274
over the past four live streams, we've

32
00:01:24,322 --> 00:01:26,166
been discussing part one of the book

33
00:01:26,268 --> 00:01:29,286
section by section, and it's Beren very

34
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:31,654
methodical unpacking the concepts. And

35
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,598
today we're lucky enough to have Bijan

36
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:35,726
with us in person, where we're going to

37
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,386
be actually kind of unpacking some of

38
00:01:37,408 --> 00:01:40,026
those hairy concepts or questions that

39
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:41,434
came up during those previous four

40
00:01:41,472 --> 00:01:43,006
livestreams. So if you haven't seen

41
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:44,586
those previous four live streams,

42
00:01:44,698 --> 00:01:47,918
definitely recommend watching those or

43
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:49,726
better yet, reading the book, and that

44
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:51,386
will give you some important context.

45
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,494
All right, let's go into it. So before

46
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,898
we get started, let's just do some quick

47
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,118
intros so I can start this off. So let's

48
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:01,570
do an intro, and then quickly just say

49
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,986
what you're excited about today. All

50
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:06,450
right, so my name is Tyler.

51
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,174
I work in Dow governance and protocol

52
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:12,774
design. In a previous life, I also was a

53
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:14,422
strategy consultant at large

54
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:17,318
correlation. So organizational change is

55
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:18,706
something I'm very personally passionate

56
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,518
about, and I'm really excited to kind of

57
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:22,502
dive into some of these thornier

58
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:24,054
questions that came up over the previous

59
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,298
four livestreams and very happy to have

60
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:28,986
John with us here today. I'll pass it

61
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:30,170
off to Bleu.

62
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,074
Bleu Knight. I am an independent

63
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:36,686
research consultant in New Mexico. My

64
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,838
background is largely neuroscience, but

65
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:41,774
I am a founding member and on the board

66
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:43,946
of directors here at the Active

67
00:02:43,978 --> 00:02:46,230
Inference institute. So I'm very excited

68
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,026
to kind of get the perspective of free

69
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:50,498
energy governance. Like, we are the

70
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,146
active inference institute. We should be

71
00:02:52,168 --> 00:02:54,354
using free energy governance in the way

72
00:02:54,392 --> 00:02:57,294
that we kind of drive our institute

73
00:02:57,342 --> 00:02:59,310
forward with our board and our

74
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,606
governance methods. So I'm excited to

75
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:03,366
just be studying this concept and

76
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:05,494
learning how to best apply it to my work

77
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:07,366
here at the institute. And I'll pass it

78
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:10,698
off to Daniel. Hey, I'm Daniel. I'm a

79
00:03:10,704 --> 00:03:12,522
researcher in California. Looking

80
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:15,674
forward to the conversation today to

81
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,994
continuing to develop our relationship

82
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:19,942
with the work and just to check in

83
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:23,226
periodically as the niche continues

84
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:25,886
to develop so rapidly, which is a focus

85
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:28,638
of free energy governance. So, Bijan to

86
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:32,366
you. Okay, so I should address the very

87
00:03:32,388 --> 00:03:33,220
same questions.

88
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:41,250
Well, obviously in life

89
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,522
everything is very past dependent. So I

90
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:47,254
happen to actually, at a very young age,

91
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:50,102
go on the board of directors of public

92
00:03:50,156 --> 00:03:53,766
companies. And as a result of

93
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:55,574
it, I was always fascinated actually how

94
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:58,330
companies are being governed.

95
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,846
And I was many times also astonished

96
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:04,746
about the fact how disconnect at the

97
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:06,794
very top of the company, where all the

98
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:10,466
decision power resides, is disconnected

99
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:15,214
actually from

100
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:18,526
the frontline of the company. I do

101
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:21,886
recall actually one of the boards I

102
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:24,542
have joined in 2019. Very exciting

103
00:04:24,606 --> 00:04:26,786
company, Tsuka. It's a difficult name to

104
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,722
pronounce, but it's a Global leader in

105
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:30,722
innovation services. We do really

106
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:33,618
fascinating projects around the world.

107
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:36,420
And when I introduced myself, I said

108
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,518
this really all the intelligence in a

109
00:04:40,524 --> 00:04:43,254
firm is really at the bottom, it's not

110
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:45,334
at the top. So that was obviously very

111
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:47,542
surprising for board members to listen

112
00:04:47,596 --> 00:04:49,606
to because the very self understanding

113
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:51,546
of board members is that they are the

114
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:54,042
smartest guys in the room and that they

115
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:56,490
obviously are entrusted by the

116
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,066
stakeholders with allocating all the

117
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:01,838
resources. So I'm really excited about

118
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:05,454
how the role of the board has to

119
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:08,542
change in a world which is, and has

120
00:05:08,596 --> 00:05:11,262
become increasingly discontinuous, very

121
00:05:11,316 --> 00:05:14,174
distributed, where a bunch of very smart

122
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:16,674
guys meeting up four to eight times a

123
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:20,146
year to take all the key decisions in

124
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:23,554
a company, is not, in my view,

125
00:05:23,592 --> 00:05:27,240
a recipe for sustainable success. And

126
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,462
that has obviously led to the fact that

127
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:33,426
many times CEOs become very powerful

128
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:36,454
and the board is there to guide, to

129
00:05:36,492 --> 00:05:40,380
advice, to approve and to make sure

130
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,666
kind of things are more or less in

131
00:05:42,688 --> 00:05:46,394
order. But I think, like with

132
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:48,394
everything, with every person, with

133
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,766
every process, it's a little bit like

134
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:53,294
flipping the coin. I mean, as much as

135
00:05:53,332 --> 00:05:55,118
certain things or certain people explain

136
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:57,518
success, they eventually also explain

137
00:05:57,604 --> 00:06:00,702
failure. And the idea really

138
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:02,894
behind the free energy governance

139
00:06:02,942 --> 00:06:05,026
concept, and inspired obviously by

140
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,260
Calfriston's free energy principle is

141
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,546
when you look at biology, you look at

142
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:15,954
nature, you start understanding

143
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:18,034
there's a lot of self organizing

144
00:06:18,082 --> 00:06:20,994
mechanisms which determine the survival

145
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:24,854
of an organism. And my idea

146
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:28,794
and the drive behind free

147
00:06:28,832 --> 00:06:32,314
energy governance is really we should be

148
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:35,254
revisiting a number of self organizing

149
00:06:35,302 --> 00:06:38,586
principles to make the company actually

150
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:43,406
much more resilient in

151
00:06:43,508 --> 00:06:45,470
discontinuous and distributed market

152
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,430
environments.

153
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,086
I'm just looking at the questions, the

154
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:52,058
other questions. I mean, that's

155
00:06:52,074 --> 00:06:53,618
certainly something I'm excited about

156
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,266
that's in a nutshell, really what has

157
00:06:55,288 --> 00:06:59,060
been inspiring from my background and

158
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,066
from a theoretical point of view, the

159
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,850
free energy governance concept.

160
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,206
And I do think and that's why I'm

161
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,114
looking really forward to this session

162
00:07:12,162 --> 00:07:14,034
and I really appreciate the diligence

163
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:15,878
with which you have prepared it and the

164
00:07:15,884 --> 00:07:19,098
questions that when I talk about

165
00:07:19,184 --> 00:07:21,222
the free energy governance concept,

166
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:23,322
people get it because there's really

167
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,178
three simple dimensions. There is a

168
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:28,166
structural dimension which very strongly

169
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,506
inspired from neurosciences, but how do

170
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:32,906
we connect actually our prefrontal

171
00:07:32,938 --> 00:07:35,294
cortex with the nervous system? And how

172
00:07:35,332 --> 00:07:37,454
is it an interactive, top down, bottom

173
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:40,526
up connectivity which has to work. And

174
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:41,994
you can transpose this onto

175
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:43,682
organizations, and you can very quickly

176
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:45,698
see there's tremendous friction in an

177
00:07:45,704 --> 00:07:48,546
organization because the bottom and the

178
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:52,270
top don't really interact

179
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,250
and connect the way our nervous system

180
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,322
and our brain does. The second dimension

181
00:07:58,386 --> 00:08:01,206
is dimension I call cognition. But what

182
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:04,230
it really means is rather than teaching

183
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,614
adaptation, which is really the dominant

184
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:12,358
school MBA programs,

185
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:14,390
we should be analyzing the environment

186
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,594
and then adapt accordingly. I say the

187
00:08:17,632 --> 00:08:20,474
world and strategy is not environment

188
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:22,538
driven, but it's interpretation driven.

189
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,522
So when you take a more interpretation

190
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:27,326
driven approach, you are much more in

191
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:30,080
power to create actually your own.

192
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,694
I. Don'T like the word reality because

193
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:36,546
that's a very relative concept, but you

194
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:39,026
create your own eco niche and the

195
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:41,314
Econiche you really want to compete in.

196
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:44,594
So I do belief we are much more in power

197
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:47,574
than we resist to belief. And the third

198
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:49,970
dimension is related to capabilities.

199
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,606
And capabilities is a big

200
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:56,520
topic in management science. Obviously,

201
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,526
capabilities at the board level haven't

202
00:08:59,558 --> 00:09:02,106
been really addressed. And my work on

203
00:09:02,128 --> 00:09:03,834
the free energy governance side is

204
00:09:03,872 --> 00:09:06,186
trying to develop capabilities at the

205
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,166
board level and certain meta

206
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:10,806
capabilities. And that really leads into

207
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:14,058
the topic when we say in the distributed

208
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:17,070
and continuum world, how does the board

209
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,298
has to evolve in order to be meaningful?

210
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,726
It's either going to be complexity,

211
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:24,306
irrelevant, it could be potentially a

212
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:28,002
source of inertia, or it can allow

213
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:32,718
the company to prosper and to outperform

214
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:36,390
its competitors. I guess for this slide,

215
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,720
I wouldn't say much more.

216
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,392
Awesome. There's a lot to dig into

217
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:46,632
there. And so we'll get to some of those

218
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:49,496
bigger topics in a second. Beren all

219
00:09:49,518 --> 00:09:51,688
right, so this is where we're at in the

220
00:09:51,694 --> 00:09:54,808
book. We've been reading part one up to

221
00:09:54,814 --> 00:09:56,396
now. It's a lot about framing the

222
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:57,692
conversation about what free energy

223
00:09:57,746 --> 00:09:59,180
governance is and the free energy

224
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,356
principle. And right now we're at the

225
00:10:01,378 --> 00:10:02,824
conclusion. So we'll read the abstract

226
00:10:02,872 --> 00:10:04,370
for that in a second here.

227
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,984
All right, so the room app for today.

228
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:09,904
Today is a discussion around these seven

229
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,248
questions. And the beginning of the

230
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:12,752
discussion will be talking more about

231
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:14,656
like, really how do you communicate what

232
00:10:14,678 --> 00:10:16,860
free energy governance is? And then

233
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,324
later in the discussion, we'll be really

234
00:10:18,362 --> 00:10:19,888
more getting into some of the nitty

235
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:21,828
gritty questions about maybe some of the

236
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:24,020
implication of what free energy

237
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,796
governance can look like. And we'll keep

238
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:29,556
it free flowing today. I mean, we'll try

239
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:31,416
to get all to all these questions. If we

240
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:32,984
get off on the tangent, that's actually

241
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:34,488
totally fine. And we can just kind of

242
00:10:34,494 --> 00:10:36,250
take the conversation where it goes.

243
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,850
Very good.

244
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,308
Sorry. We'll start off by reading the

245
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:44,716
abstract, and then we'll kind of get

246
00:10:44,738 --> 00:10:46,124
into the discussion. But is there

247
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:47,404
something that you want to say before we

248
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:50,348
move on? No, I follow you.

249
00:10:50,514 --> 00:10:53,504
Okay, great. So, Bleu, do you want to

250
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:56,416
read the slide for us? Sure. Is that all

251
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,416
that's on the slide? No, there's one

252
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:01,216
more. Okay. Strategic renewal research

253
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:03,008
is now confronted with important

254
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:05,108
challenges concerning process design,

255
00:11:05,194 --> 00:11:07,520
cognition, and dynamic capabilities.

256
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,824
Sensing and sense making of relevant

257
00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:11,952
signals as a basis for initiating

258
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:14,516
strategic renewal are preceded by an

259
00:11:14,538 --> 00:11:16,284
action centric and explorative

260
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:18,552
engagement with the world. We are moving

261
00:11:18,606 --> 00:11:20,504
from coaligning organization with

262
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,856
environment in form of adaptation to co

263
00:11:22,878 --> 00:11:25,624
creation. As firms build agility through

264
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:27,780
distinctive environmental enactment.

265
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,156
All existing frameworks and studies in

266
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:31,676
corporate governance as well as

267
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:34,072
strategic cognition remain characterized

268
00:11:34,136 --> 00:11:35,788
by one or a communication of the

269
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:37,660
following fundamental limitations.

270
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,332
Cool. I could take this slide. So, one,

271
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:43,872
the environment and environmental change

272
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:45,436
are generally treated as objective

273
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:47,788
reality. Two, strategic renewals treated

274
00:11:47,804 --> 00:11:50,304
as a top down content rather than top

275
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,156
down bottom up process challenge.

276
00:11:52,268 --> 00:11:54,416
Strategic renewal is studied at the

277
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:56,308
managerial level, but only marginally at

278
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:58,948
the board level. Formal processes are

279
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:01,380
the focal unit of analysis, and five,

280
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,056
demographic and universally measurable

281
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:04,608
variables dominate with no due

282
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,928
conversation. For strategy relevant meta

283
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:08,564
capabilities. At the board level,

284
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:11,008
reentry governance introduces a novel

285
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:13,028
crosshair called generative coherence

286
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:14,676
centric framework, empowering the firm

287
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,676
as a generative model of its eco niche.

288
00:12:16,788 --> 00:12:18,504
Shareholders and board directors must

289
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:20,024
interpret the board's strategic

290
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,076
relevance in a discontinuous world. If

291
00:12:22,098 --> 00:12:24,156
not, the board is prone to turn into or

292
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:27,500
remain a source of inertia compromising

293
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,580
firm performance and survival.

294
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,330
All right, let's get into it.

295
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,136
So first question here is just free

296
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,336
energy governance. As we've been going

297
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:43,260
through this last four live streams,

298
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,908
it can get very deep, right? There's

299
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:47,136
like a thermodynamic angle to it.

300
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:49,036
There's an information theory angle.

301
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:50,668
There's a machine learning angle,

302
00:12:50,684 --> 00:12:52,128
right? So you can go down the rabbit

303
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:54,148
hole, and you can go very far. But the

304
00:12:54,154 --> 00:12:56,020
end of the day, too, there's a very

305
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,876
intuitive way you can think about free

306
00:12:57,898 --> 00:13:00,388
energy governance. And so I'm curious,

307
00:13:00,484 --> 00:13:02,792
when you meet executives, other business

308
00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:04,164
leaders, and you have to communicate

309
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:06,296
what free energy governance and the free

310
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,776
energy principle are, how do you

311
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:10,472
succinctly communicate that

312
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:11,564
communication? Hey, this is different

313
00:13:11,602 --> 00:13:15,196
from what you're already doing. When you

314
00:13:15,218 --> 00:13:19,196
look ant what has been

315
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,656
happening in the last 2030 years,

316
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:26,032
we see that technology

317
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,724
is not only building incredible

318
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:31,024
connections, but we also do see that the

319
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:32,656
cost of innovation is coming quite

320
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,416
dramatically down. If you take a start

321
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:38,210
up in Silicon Valley in the 1990s

322
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,356
to build something that, say, which

323
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:42,916
would take a million dollars at the

324
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:45,204
time, you can probably do it today with

325
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,450
$10,000, the same thing.

326
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,120
So the power of the individual in

327
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,672
creating new stuff, changing the way we

328
00:13:55,726 --> 00:13:58,360
consume product wise,

329
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,172
chaos increased dramatically as a result

330
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:05,176
of it, this continuity has been rising

331
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:07,852
dramatically. Apart from that, the world

332
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:09,708
has obviously also, again, thanks to

333
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:13,748
technology, become quite connected

334
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:16,352
and integrated. Now, when you look at

335
00:14:16,406 --> 00:14:18,176
all that stuff, what technology is

336
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:19,856
doing, what individuals are doing, they

337
00:14:19,878 --> 00:14:21,600
don't even need to be incorporated.

338
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,316
It's creating a lot of change in the

339
00:14:25,338 --> 00:14:27,988
resource market. And the resource market

340
00:14:28,154 --> 00:14:31,508
is really actually,

341
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:34,790
I do not like the term top and bottom.

342
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,284
Probably the bottom certainly is much

343
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:40,744
more front line. The top, yes,

344
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:43,000
usually the top is the board because

345
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,364
these are the last guys, the ultimate

346
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:47,972
people taking actually the resource

347
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:50,524
allocation decision on big topics which

348
00:14:50,562 --> 00:14:54,204
concern the entire firm. But when you

349
00:14:54,242 --> 00:14:58,396
look at all the stuff that

350
00:14:58,418 --> 00:15:01,600
is happening right now in product

351
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,752
markets, in supply Heins in

352
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:08,016
universities where there

353
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:10,352
is great thinking, there's not only

354
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:13,232
great ideas, there's new products coming

355
00:15:13,286 --> 00:15:15,892
out. And you start looking at the guys

356
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:18,884
who are sitting in the board of a big

357
00:15:18,922 --> 00:15:22,980
company they are so far removed from

358
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,364
really, Heins connected to what can

359
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:28,170
happen. And that's very natural because

360
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,480
there's only as much attention we have,

361
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,864
as much cognitive bandwidth we have and

362
00:15:33,902 --> 00:15:36,676
how much can they process. The bigger

363
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,036
problem, however, is, and I would say to

364
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:41,150
your first question, what's the hook is

365
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,052
every board member, every CEO would

366
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:48,988
love. And there's a

367
00:15:48,994 --> 00:15:51,240
wonderful concept which is called

368
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,884
skilled incompetence. And skilled

369
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:57,104
incompetence really means people are

370
00:15:57,142 --> 00:15:58,544
doing actions which are

371
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,104
counterproductive to what they really

372
00:16:01,142 --> 00:16:04,480
want to achieve. And clevel

373
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,732
board members are really keen on

374
00:16:07,786 --> 00:16:09,556
understanding what's happening in all

375
00:16:09,578 --> 00:16:12,724
these markets and catching up on all

376
00:16:12,762 --> 00:16:16,084
the impulses, inspiration in order to

377
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:17,364
think about where should our

378
00:16:17,402 --> 00:16:21,312
organization be going? But inadvertently

379
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:23,336
they are creating a lot of friction and

380
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:24,904
they're bringing themselves far more

381
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,776
removed. So the big challenge, and this

382
00:16:26,798 --> 00:16:28,904
is really what free energy governance is

383
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:31,164
addressing, how can we connect the top

384
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:33,464
ant the bottom in a much more efficient

385
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:35,800
way? And that has a lot of challenges

386
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,580
because you have middle management,

387
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,652
house information, traveling. But a much

388
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:42,416
more interesting thing is, which is

389
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:44,096
happening right now, is when you look at

390
00:16:44,118 --> 00:16:47,004
artificial intelligence. Artificial

391
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:50,716
intelligence effectively allows

392
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:54,532
you to decouple two things which

393
00:16:54,586 --> 00:16:58,724
usually came as a unity. It is the

394
00:16:58,762 --> 00:17:01,412
prediction and the judgment which

395
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:04,676
together form a decision. So when you

396
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:06,932
look at the anatomy of a decision

397
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:09,304
consisting of prediction and of

398
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:12,772
judgment, with the increasing deployment

399
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:15,720
of artificial intelligence that is being

400
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,410
actually decoupled. Now,

401
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,052
what that means is that the value of

402
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:25,532
human judgment becomes much more

403
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,284
important. But then the question does

404
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:31,516
arise who is best positioned to make the

405
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:33,920
judgment? Is it really the sea level?

406
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,464
Is it at the very top? Once I have all

407
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:39,104
the AI prediction available and I can

408
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:42,572
generate great predictions as an input

409
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:45,124
into my decisionmaking and subjected to

410
00:17:45,162 --> 00:17:48,484
judgment. So all of a sudden you have to

411
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:51,972
very carefully think what should be and

412
00:17:52,026 --> 00:17:54,372
continue to be decided at the very top

413
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,512
and what should be not reached the top

414
00:17:57,566 --> 00:17:59,832
any longer because it's taking too long,

415
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:02,600
it's creating too much friction. And

416
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,348
maybe the board of directors in the sea

417
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:09,224
level are no longer best positioned to

418
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:11,176
decide on many things they're deciding

419
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,564
on today. So I think what we will be

420
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:15,996
seeing in the next decade to come and

421
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:18,844
it's partly driven by technology, but in

422
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:21,820
particularly driven by AI technologies,

423
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,256
that there's going to be a shift in

424
00:18:24,278 --> 00:18:27,008
power where and how decisions are going

425
00:18:27,014 --> 00:18:29,984
to be taken. And we will look at

426
00:18:30,022 --> 00:18:31,664
organizations, the way they are run

427
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:33,004
today, the way they are structured

428
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:36,212
today, they look like a dinosaur because

429
00:18:36,346 --> 00:18:40,436
they are not really connected to

430
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:42,836
what is happening really in the

431
00:18:42,858 --> 00:18:45,972
marketplace in real time. So the C level

432
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:49,256
is facing a big challenge of A,

433
00:18:49,438 --> 00:18:51,336
how they're connecting to the bottom and

434
00:18:51,358 --> 00:18:53,688
how the information is flowing as a

435
00:18:53,694 --> 00:18:56,500
basis for them to take great decisions.

436
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,628
Second, decision power is probably

437
00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:01,532
becoming, within an organization also

438
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:04,476
more attributes. So it's not going to be

439
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:09,916
as centralized as it used to be. And the

440
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:11,936
more important thing is, and this is

441
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,520
very fundamental to free energy

442
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,792
governance is communication. When you

443
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:21,376
look into companies, Coda and

444
00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:23,440
even companies where I'm on the board

445
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:28,020
of, it's frightening to see how

446
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,804
communication is a real problem.

447
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:33,204
Everybody has the best intentions, to be

448
00:19:33,242 --> 00:19:35,620
clear, to be transparent, but

449
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,536
communicating is many times also a

450
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,184
question of Lagrange. And if we

451
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:45,592
do believe that in the future the

452
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:47,656
interface between the machine and the

453
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:50,072
human is going to be increasingly

454
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:53,720
important, we need to develop a language

455
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,332
which allows us to much better connect

456
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:59,644
to the machine. And that's where I

457
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:02,252
believe the free energy governance

458
00:20:02,316 --> 00:20:03,984
framework, which is built on the free

459
00:20:04,022 --> 00:20:07,168
energy principle, which is all about

460
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:10,384
prediction errors minimization. When you

461
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:12,464
start putting actually prediction and

462
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:16,292
prediction models at the center of what

463
00:20:16,426 --> 00:20:18,448
it is about to run an organization,

464
00:20:18,544 --> 00:20:20,096
take Active Inference Lab Institute,

465
00:20:20,128 --> 00:20:22,436
you what is your prediction model? You

466
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,404
do have a prediction model which is

467
00:20:24,442 --> 00:20:27,016
actually your world model. And on a

468
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:29,380
daily basis you are generating

469
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,064
predictions about what you think should

470
00:20:33,102 --> 00:20:36,152
happen, what is likely to happen, what

471
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:38,392
interests the audience. These are action

472
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:41,516
prediction you are generating and

473
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:44,684
eventually this team, you guys are

474
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:48,076
applying your best judgment of what

475
00:20:48,098 --> 00:20:49,656
you're doing. Many times you're testing

476
00:20:49,688 --> 00:20:51,624
the predictions and the predictions may

477
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:54,592
actually give you feedback which tell

478
00:20:54,646 --> 00:20:56,416
you you shouldn't be doing this. So

479
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:58,272
eventually your judgment will really

480
00:20:58,326 --> 00:21:02,016
matter. But what you do

481
00:21:02,118 --> 00:21:04,276
when you start adopting a language of

482
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:07,732
prediction error minimization, I believe

483
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:10,580
you become much more performing because

484
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,452
what you start doing in a much more

485
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:15,684
conscious way, you start measuring the

486
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:17,480
performance of your individual

487
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,948
predictions, which eventually feed

488
00:21:21,124 --> 00:21:23,432
your decisions on the basis of your very

489
00:21:23,486 --> 00:21:25,812
judgment. And over time your judgment

490
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:29,284
improves as well because your testing

491
00:21:29,332 --> 00:21:31,096
and your measuring of performance of

492
00:21:31,118 --> 00:21:35,144
predictions is getting better. And when

493
00:21:35,182 --> 00:21:38,172
you do this and in my book, in a later

494
00:21:38,226 --> 00:21:40,908
part of the book, when I've been trying

495
00:21:40,994 --> 00:21:44,684
to relay a very theoretical

496
00:21:44,732 --> 00:21:46,684
concept more to the world of practice,

497
00:21:46,812 --> 00:21:48,364
I've been looking at the budgeting

498
00:21:48,412 --> 00:21:50,448
process. The budgeting process is a

499
00:21:50,454 --> 00:21:54,260
great domain where

500
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,324
you have to make a projection, a

501
00:21:56,362 --> 00:22:00,084
prediction about next year and

502
00:22:00,122 --> 00:22:03,392
you make this prediction on facing

503
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,604
actually two fundamental questions what

504
00:22:05,642 --> 00:22:08,228
is you control, what you don't control?

505
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:11,896
What is what you know and

506
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:13,816
what you don't know? So there's a lot of

507
00:22:13,838 --> 00:22:16,696
unknowns you have to deal with. And when

508
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:18,328
I'm looking at the budgeting process,

509
00:22:18,414 --> 00:22:20,600
I'm dealing with a lot of unknowns.

510
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,164
What is really critical for me is not

511
00:22:23,202 --> 00:22:24,988
the number people put behind that

512
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:28,492
unknown but it's the process they

513
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:31,620
suggest of how they turn the unknown

514
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,512
into a known. And it always starts with

515
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:37,728
very small steps. So I think

516
00:22:37,894 --> 00:22:39,968
organizations need to start

517
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:42,064
communicating much more in terms of

518
00:22:42,102 --> 00:22:44,896
prediction models, in predictions,

519
00:22:45,088 --> 00:22:47,700
falsifying those, confirming those.

520
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,328
And when you start articulating

521
00:22:51,424 --> 00:22:55,604
a strategy or a vision you have as

522
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:58,472
a prediction model and that there are

523
00:22:58,526 --> 00:23:00,936
predictions generative by that

524
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:04,824
prediction model and you empower the

525
00:23:04,862 --> 00:23:07,288
organization through great and clear

526
00:23:07,374 --> 00:23:09,804
communication to challenge your

527
00:23:09,842 --> 00:23:12,732
predictions. You're creating a very

528
00:23:12,786 --> 00:23:15,564
different culture of how you engage the

529
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,600
front line with the key decision makers

530
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,084
who at the end of the day, of course,

531
00:23:21,122 --> 00:23:22,944
there is always a small number of people

532
00:23:22,982 --> 00:23:26,112
who are accountable for managing and

533
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:28,556
allocating the resources of a firm.

534
00:23:28,748 --> 00:23:31,644
So I think that's a critical hook

535
00:23:31,772 --> 00:23:36,368
because a

536
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:38,212
lot of sea level people and board

537
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:41,620
members talk about uncertainty.

538
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,030
But here's a really critical thing.

539
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,832
First of all, uncertainty is a very

540
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:50,184
subjective concept. What your

541
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:52,436
uncertainty is may not be mine or vice

542
00:23:52,468 --> 00:23:56,104
versa. So in my view, when somebody

543
00:23:56,222 --> 00:23:58,664
says the world is uncertain or

544
00:23:58,702 --> 00:24:02,040
unpredictable, I mean, we all agree

545
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,756
there is a lot of things we don't know

546
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:05,228
what's going to happen tomorrow. So in

547
00:24:05,234 --> 00:24:07,496
that regard there's many, many worlds

548
00:24:07,528 --> 00:24:09,484
that could appear. In that regard, yes,

549
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:10,636
there is some degree of

550
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:13,728
unpredictability. But if I talk about

551
00:24:13,814 --> 00:24:17,344
uncertainty, of course

552
00:24:17,382 --> 00:24:20,416
there is uncertainty. But at the

553
00:24:20,438 --> 00:24:22,464
end, using uncertainty and

554
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,076
unpredictability is really just an

555
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:27,684
admission of the very limitations of my

556
00:24:27,722 --> 00:24:31,488
world model because uncertainty

557
00:24:31,664 --> 00:24:35,424
is an incredibly rich training ground

558
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:38,696
for my predictions to eliminate and

559
00:24:38,718 --> 00:24:41,604
reduce uncertainty and turn unknowns

560
00:24:41,652 --> 00:24:44,712
into knows. And when you look at

561
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:47,464
organizations and I think sometimes most

562
00:24:47,502 --> 00:24:51,230
of the time, sea level and board level

563
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,504
are not aware of the fact the further

564
00:24:54,552 --> 00:24:56,396
you go down in the organization to the

565
00:24:56,418 --> 00:24:58,844
front line, they have much more

566
00:24:58,882 --> 00:25:01,310
intelligence and understand much better

567
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,104
how rules are creating the source of

568
00:25:05,142 --> 00:25:09,024
inertia and actually masking and

569
00:25:09,062 --> 00:25:12,144
burying uncertainty and don't make it

570
00:25:12,182 --> 00:25:14,852
available for prediction testing and

571
00:25:14,906 --> 00:25:17,508
ultimately better decision making. So

572
00:25:17,594 --> 00:25:20,548
our challenge in today's world with a

573
00:25:20,554 --> 00:25:22,820
lot of discontinuity, a lot of change

574
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,424
happening for very understandable

575
00:25:25,472 --> 00:25:27,304
reasons because the individual has more

576
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:29,412
power. We have cheaper technologies

577
00:25:29,476 --> 00:25:32,760
available to create much more impact.

578
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,936
We need to embrace uncertainty. We

579
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:39,916
should not avoid uncertainty. And today

580
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:43,516
the organizational frameworks are not in

581
00:25:43,538 --> 00:25:46,424
place to allow organizations to embrace

582
00:25:46,472 --> 00:25:48,924
uncertainty because they don't know how

583
00:25:48,962 --> 00:25:50,616
to talk in prediction and prediction

584
00:25:50,648 --> 00:25:52,828
models and test those predictions. I'm

585
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:53,920
sorry, Bleu.

586
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,752
Sorry, I thought you were wrapping up.

587
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:00,304
I just wanted to just ask a quick follow

588
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:02,816
up question. Can you clarify what you

589
00:26:02,838 --> 00:26:05,988
mean by discontinuity or continuum? I

590
00:26:05,994 --> 00:26:07,316
mean, I think I have an idea, but I

591
00:26:07,338 --> 00:26:09,044
would just like to maybe have a more

592
00:26:09,082 --> 00:26:12,976
clear I try. To avoid

593
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:14,820
the word disruptive,

594
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,936
but when you look at and you look in

595
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:20,756
management science, Clayton Christian's

596
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,696
disruptive technology, which is not

597
00:26:22,718 --> 00:26:25,524
necessarily radical technology, it's

598
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:29,132
technologies that can

599
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:32,440
change, for example, a cost factor.

600
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,060
And the cost factor is so decisive that

601
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,924
all of a sudden it changes the way

602
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:41,664
business is being done and what is being

603
00:26:41,702 --> 00:26:44,432
deployed and whether you're still

604
00:26:44,486 --> 00:26:45,616
shipping something or you're not

605
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:48,816
shipping something or whether you

606
00:26:48,838 --> 00:26:51,280
could argue to some degree.

607
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,988
Let's put the particular context of the

608
00:26:53,994 --> 00:26:57,344
pandemic aside, but a valid

609
00:26:57,392 --> 00:27:01,296
question is the way teams

610
00:27:01,408 --> 00:27:04,708
and zoom have become

611
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:07,130
so much part of our day to day

612
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:12,890
engagement? I have been someone who

613
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,024
has always preferred the physical touch

614
00:27:16,062 --> 00:27:19,292
point, and in my own company I have

615
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:23,004
offices in different parts and

616
00:27:23,202 --> 00:27:25,676
my approach has always been I'm going to

617
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:28,584
be physically present in those offices

618
00:27:28,632 --> 00:27:30,910
at least once a month as I tour them.

619
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,096
I've changed this radically. The

620
00:27:34,118 --> 00:27:37,490
pandemic is over, so I definitely

621
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,028
don't buy as many flight tickets

622
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:46,016
any longer. And this is

623
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:48,132
not a strong example, but I do think

624
00:27:48,186 --> 00:27:51,476
that a lot of airlines struggle with the

625
00:27:51,498 --> 00:27:53,524
fact that business travelers are not

626
00:27:53,562 --> 00:27:55,156
there the way they're there. There may

627
00:27:55,178 --> 00:27:57,288
be more recreational travelers and the

628
00:27:57,294 --> 00:27:58,696
planes continue to be packed, but

629
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,436
there's less planes. We shouldn't forget

630
00:28:00,468 --> 00:28:04,330
that either. So has video calling and

631
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,668
created actually some discontinuity on a

632
00:28:10,674 --> 00:28:13,900
massive scale that can disrupt

633
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,052
industries. So you do have these

634
00:28:19,106 --> 00:28:21,036
kind of discontinuities. They don't need

635
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:24,960
to be radical innovations, but they

636
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:28,480
change on a massive scale the way things

637
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,928
are being done. And there's obviously a

638
00:28:30,934 --> 00:28:33,170
lot of examples that happen all the time

639
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,780
that happens sometimes which are beyond

640
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,516
what we can see, but there's a lot of

641
00:28:40,538 --> 00:28:42,036
stuff which is happening behind the

642
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:44,640
scenes where things are so radically

643
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,156
changed that companies are from one day

644
00:28:47,178 --> 00:28:48,570
to the next out of business.

645
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,504
And I guess that's what I mean with

646
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:55,320
discontinuity more in the term in view

647
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,636
of disruption, but I don't like the term

648
00:28:57,668 --> 00:29:01,704
of disruption. That makes sense.

649
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:03,656
And I think just to unless you have more

650
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:05,656
you want to give on this elevator pitch.

651
00:29:05,688 --> 00:29:06,908
But I think to kind of summarize what I

652
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:08,572
think you're saying, or the essence of

653
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:10,732
my takeaway is you're really putting

654
00:29:10,786 --> 00:29:12,108
uncertainty at the heart of the

655
00:29:12,114 --> 00:29:13,836
organization rather than something that

656
00:29:13,938 --> 00:29:16,044
is to be worried about, to be anxious

657
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:17,696
about you're really saying, hey, this is

658
00:29:17,718 --> 00:29:19,056
an intrinsic part of being an

659
00:29:19,078 --> 00:29:20,944
organization, having a world model.

660
00:29:21,062 --> 00:29:22,144
There's nothing we can do about

661
00:29:22,182 --> 00:29:24,908
uncertainty, but we can manage it. And

662
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:26,624
we can do that by making prediction

663
00:29:26,672 --> 00:29:28,884
error as really the heart of how our

664
00:29:28,922 --> 00:29:30,950
organization thinks about its business.

665
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,476
Absolutely. And this comes back to

666
00:29:35,498 --> 00:29:38,456
active inference lab instituted because

667
00:29:38,638 --> 00:29:42,650
the most important word

668
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,960
in active inference is active because

669
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,456
you put action at the center of what you

670
00:29:50,478 --> 00:29:53,484
do and it's the actions that create your

671
00:29:53,522 --> 00:29:54,956
perceptions and not the other way

672
00:29:54,978 --> 00:29:57,052
around. And that's a fundamental thing.

673
00:29:57,106 --> 00:29:59,884
And you go into the sea level, they

674
00:29:59,922 --> 00:30:02,528
still do believe that they perceive and

675
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,764
then they act. And that's terrible

676
00:30:04,892 --> 00:30:07,936
because then you are really a victim of

677
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:09,664
whatever is happening outside your

678
00:30:09,702 --> 00:30:12,912
control and the power of the free energy

679
00:30:12,966 --> 00:30:15,108
governance framework and obviously the

680
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:18,932
free, free energy principle that you get

681
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:21,684
actually into control and the way you

682
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:24,916
work yourself through to reduce the

683
00:30:24,938 --> 00:30:27,556
unknowns and you can only do this

684
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:28,840
through the actions.

685
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,736
And there was one question you had on

686
00:30:33,758 --> 00:30:35,144
the first slide, which I think was

687
00:30:35,182 --> 00:30:37,416
question number six, we don't have to go

688
00:30:37,438 --> 00:30:39,356
back there. But it was related to

689
00:30:39,378 --> 00:30:43,004
Silicon Valley. And when you look at

690
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:46,110
the smaller a company is, when you take

691
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,140
a startup business, a startup business

692
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,730
usually does not have the challenge of

693
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,596
top down, bottom up, because there's

694
00:30:57,628 --> 00:31:00,704
three guys sitting in a room and they

695
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:03,600
wear many, many hats at the same time.

696
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,304
All they do share is one purpose, one

697
00:31:06,342 --> 00:31:10,228
mission and one big dream. As a

698
00:31:10,234 --> 00:31:11,652
result of it, almost in a self

699
00:31:11,706 --> 00:31:14,352
organizing way, all the right actions

700
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:17,124
will fall into place because the goal is

701
00:31:17,162 --> 00:31:20,040
so clear of what they want to achieve.

702
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,676
The problems start, when the team starts

703
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:24,504
growing, when things are being

704
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:26,324
delegated, when all of a sudden

705
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:28,344
communication becomes important, when

706
00:31:28,382 --> 00:31:30,312
all of a sudden there is a distance

707
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:33,036
between where the action is happening in

708
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,876
the field and the person making the

709
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:38,844
decisions about how financing is being

710
00:31:38,882 --> 00:31:40,796
raised, how it's being allocated and

711
00:31:40,818 --> 00:31:44,704
what story is being told. So when

712
00:31:44,742 --> 00:31:48,112
you look at the very mature companies

713
00:31:48,246 --> 00:31:51,024
in silicon valley and those who have

714
00:31:51,062 --> 00:31:54,252
been successful and have kind of shaped

715
00:31:54,316 --> 00:31:56,660
a big part of our life in the last 1020

716
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,068
years, you look at an uber, you look at

717
00:32:00,074 --> 00:32:02,244
a facebook, you look at a Google is

718
00:32:02,282 --> 00:32:05,108
because these companies stayed actually

719
00:32:05,194 --> 00:32:07,304
very true to their core. And you can

720
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,744
look at that. They fulfill all three

721
00:32:10,782 --> 00:32:12,724
dimensions of the free energy governance

722
00:32:12,772 --> 00:32:15,672
framework. They make sure the way they

723
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:19,212
organize, that a lot of decision power

724
00:32:19,346 --> 00:32:22,412
is actually ant the bottom. They are not

725
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:25,836
big fans of pulling all the power to the

726
00:32:25,858 --> 00:32:28,044
top. They want to make sure that

727
00:32:28,082 --> 00:32:31,032
individual entities can work, operate

728
00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:33,824
the side and be very agile and very

729
00:32:33,862 --> 00:32:35,952
fast. So that's already the first

730
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:37,536
element, the structural element, how you

731
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:39,632
connect the top and the bottom. Second

732
00:32:39,686 --> 00:32:42,130
element is the cognition part.

733
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,560
Neither Google nor Uber. Noor Facebook.

734
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,796
Any of these companies are doing market

735
00:32:49,898 --> 00:32:51,764
research when they really started with

736
00:32:51,802 --> 00:32:53,924
what they want to do as business to

737
00:32:53,962 --> 00:32:55,716
figure out is there a market or

738
00:32:55,738 --> 00:32:58,792
whatever, they create something which

739
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:02,308
they enact, driven by a deep passion,

740
00:33:02,404 --> 00:33:05,172
many times a deep passion of believing

741
00:33:05,236 --> 00:33:07,896
this is how the world should work. We

742
00:33:07,918 --> 00:33:10,504
will adapt the world to us. It's not us

743
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:13,484
adapting to the world. And that is what

744
00:33:13,522 --> 00:33:15,340
makes these companies incredibly strong

745
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,224
because they're creating their own eco

746
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:19,912
niches. When you look at the iPhone

747
00:33:19,976 --> 00:33:22,924
coming out in 2007, everybody was

748
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:25,856
mocking it. BlackBerry, which some of

749
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,824
you may not know even at the time, but

750
00:33:27,862 --> 00:33:29,644
was the dominant communication device

751
00:33:29,692 --> 00:33:32,496
because it had a great keyboard and all

752
00:33:32,518 --> 00:33:34,068
of this to have a phone without a

753
00:33:34,074 --> 00:33:37,060
keyboard, with every disadvantage,

754
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,940
low battery, which was literally putting

755
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,084
everything together, but everything was

756
00:33:42,122 --> 00:33:44,916
really sub optimal, one didn't give it

757
00:33:44,938 --> 00:33:48,756
much chance. But what effectively

758
00:33:48,868 --> 00:33:51,412
at the time, Steve Jobs as the visionary

759
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:53,384
or representative of that vision for

760
00:33:53,422 --> 00:33:56,616
whole team articulated was the

761
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:59,656
phone will be a computer and it will be

762
00:33:59,678 --> 00:34:02,748
a computer that can actually do anything

763
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:04,636
and you have it in your pocket. And that

764
00:34:04,658 --> 00:34:06,376
was a tremendous vision and Nokia didn't

765
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:08,556
have that vision and they focused on the

766
00:34:08,578 --> 00:34:11,528
prime functionalities. So I think what

767
00:34:11,554 --> 00:34:13,296
these companies do is and that's the

768
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:14,720
second dimension of the free energy

769
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,244
governance framework, they really enact

770
00:34:17,372 --> 00:34:20,370
their own environment. And the third

771
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,288
one, which is related to capabilities in

772
00:34:24,294 --> 00:34:28,084
the free energy framework is and I

773
00:34:28,122 --> 00:34:32,036
have related to this in

774
00:34:32,058 --> 00:34:34,996
the free energy governance framework in

775
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:37,760
my book. I try to be very specific, but

776
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,624
the capabilities part I focus on is how

777
00:34:41,742 --> 00:34:43,928
and I'm always focusing capabilities on

778
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:46,600
the board level. And on the board level

779
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,932
I look at how you manage duality and

780
00:34:49,986 --> 00:34:54,284
in business there is two sets of

781
00:34:54,322 --> 00:34:57,148
dualities which explain everything.

782
00:34:57,314 --> 00:34:59,116
These are the two fundamental sets and

783
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:02,716
only those two sets. The one is how do

784
00:35:02,738 --> 00:35:05,660
you manage simultaneously exploitation

785
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,176
and exploration. You have to manage your

786
00:35:08,198 --> 00:35:10,192
existing business and optimize it and

787
00:35:10,246 --> 00:35:12,000
take that cash flow which is available

788
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,064
and you have to work on the future cash

789
00:35:14,102 --> 00:35:15,548
flow which doesn't exist yet, you don't

790
00:35:15,564 --> 00:35:17,684
have the products yet and you have to

791
00:35:17,802 --> 00:35:20,112
find a way which is very challenging.

792
00:35:20,176 --> 00:35:21,988
Lots of books have been written about it

793
00:35:22,074 --> 00:35:24,676
of how you manage these two things in

794
00:35:24,698 --> 00:35:27,112
parallel. In the meantime, my view is

795
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,656
these things happen actually almost at

796
00:35:29,678 --> 00:35:32,104
once on top of each other, rather than

797
00:35:32,142 --> 00:35:34,856
being two separate organizations. But

798
00:35:34,878 --> 00:35:37,960
there are many different views also

799
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,736
depending on the maturity of the

800
00:35:39,758 --> 00:35:41,564
company, the life cycle of the company,

801
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,516
what is the better approach? That's the

802
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:45,356
first set. So first set between

803
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:47,884
exploitation of today's cash flow and

804
00:35:47,922 --> 00:35:49,512
developing through exploration

805
00:35:49,576 --> 00:35:52,844
tomorrow's cash flow. The second set is

806
00:35:52,882 --> 00:35:56,624
a very important one is the trade off or

807
00:35:56,662 --> 00:35:59,820
the. Duality between financial

808
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,888
control and strategic control.

809
00:36:02,054 --> 00:36:04,790
Financial control in this context means

810
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,436
M and A, how you buy other companies,

811
00:36:08,538 --> 00:36:10,932
which you're not doing in house to

812
00:36:10,986 --> 00:36:13,510
accelerate and to move forward.

813
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,384
Strategic control is really in house

814
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:19,832
innovation. So a company and a board is

815
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,536
continuously challenged. Is there a

816
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:24,840
sustainable balance between in house

817
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,732
innovation and external innovation?

818
00:36:27,876 --> 00:36:29,928
Or M and A doesn't always have to be

819
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:31,352
about innovation. It could be market

820
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:35,336
share with geographic

821
00:36:35,368 --> 00:36:38,588
expansion. But what is really important

822
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:42,780
to understand when a company relies

823
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,900
too much on financial

824
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:50,144
control, m and A, its survival gets

825
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:52,592
really threatened because the more

826
00:36:52,646 --> 00:36:56,116
companies you buy, the more over a

827
00:36:56,138 --> 00:36:59,056
period of time your in house capability

828
00:36:59,168 --> 00:37:02,304
to innovate will weaken and effectively

829
00:37:02,352 --> 00:37:04,004
you're losing your strategic control.

830
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:06,156
Now coming back to the Silicon Valley

831
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:08,072
companies, what they have done

832
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:11,080
tremendously successful, whether it's

833
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,152
Mehta, Facebook, Google, they have

834
00:37:16,206 --> 00:37:19,336
been continuously investing, they have

835
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:21,724
been the biggest investor as a

836
00:37:21,762 --> 00:37:23,912
percentage share of their revenues.

837
00:37:24,056 --> 00:37:26,668
They have invested in R and D, but at

838
00:37:26,674 --> 00:37:29,244
the same time they buy a company every

839
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:33,536
month. So they keep this balance in

840
00:37:33,558 --> 00:37:36,976
an incredible way. And that is in

841
00:37:36,998 --> 00:37:38,896
my view, a tremendous capability for a

842
00:37:38,918 --> 00:37:40,476
company to keep that balance. Don't

843
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,216
allow it going one way, but keep that

844
00:37:43,238 --> 00:37:45,024
balance. So when you look at the free

845
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,708
energy governance framework, looking at

846
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:49,876
really Silicon Valley as a startup, the

847
00:37:49,898 --> 00:37:51,412
question doesn't even arise because

848
00:37:51,466 --> 00:37:53,204
everybody is sitting in one room. Now

849
00:37:53,242 --> 00:37:55,076
you take this massive company, some of

850
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:56,456
them are the biggest companies in the

851
00:37:56,478 --> 00:38:00,232
world, like Apple and so on. They have

852
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:05,432
mastered it, in my view, by not

853
00:38:05,486 --> 00:38:08,756
being obsessed of how the top has to

854
00:38:08,798 --> 00:38:12,092
control everything, understanding that

855
00:38:12,146 --> 00:38:13,996
we are much more powerful as an

856
00:38:14,018 --> 00:38:17,324
organization if the unknowns are

857
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:20,652
being turned into knowns and that those

858
00:38:20,706 --> 00:38:22,496
who are capable of doing it are

859
00:38:22,518 --> 00:38:24,544
empowered. And they're usually much

860
00:38:24,582 --> 00:38:26,108
closer to the resource markets,

861
00:38:26,124 --> 00:38:28,496
suppliers, technologies, clients in

862
00:38:28,518 --> 00:38:31,776
order to do so. So I do think in

863
00:38:31,798 --> 00:38:34,116
those companies you find many facets of

864
00:38:34,138 --> 00:38:36,416
it which make it very successful and I'm

865
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:38,996
very convinced that they are also the

866
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:41,888
next companies who are embracing

867
00:38:41,984 --> 00:38:45,332
artificial intelligence as a way of

868
00:38:45,386 --> 00:38:48,904
changing again how organizations are

869
00:38:48,942 --> 00:38:51,544
structured, how they take decisions and

870
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:53,480
how the power may be shifting.

871
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,664
And that was one of the questions you

872
00:38:56,702 --> 00:39:00,412
asked me, which is on the slide is

873
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,230
why being so obsessed with the board?

874
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,436
Actually, I'm not obsessed with the

875
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:09,132
board as such, but the reality is that

876
00:39:09,186 --> 00:39:13,696
the board, depending on the

877
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,888
role of the board, varies many times

878
00:39:15,974 --> 00:39:18,160
from countries, from jurisdictions,

879
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,304
culture, what role they play. But when

880
00:39:22,342 --> 00:39:24,850
you look at a typical board,

881
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,964
the CEO may be on the board. In the US.

882
00:39:28,022 --> 00:39:29,936
The CEO usually is on the board. The CEO

883
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:31,728
is actually usually also the chairman.

884
00:39:31,824 --> 00:39:33,504
In the rest of the world they strictly

885
00:39:33,552 --> 00:39:35,268
separate these two role, CEO and

886
00:39:35,274 --> 00:39:38,772
chairman. But you will have the majority

887
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:41,556
of the board members being nonexecutives

888
00:39:41,748 --> 00:39:44,536
and these nonexecutives have no role in

889
00:39:44,558 --> 00:39:46,472
the DayToday operation of the business.

890
00:39:46,606 --> 00:39:48,376
But they come and they leverage the

891
00:39:48,398 --> 00:39:51,150
expertise from different industries and

892
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,076
overall their experience they

893
00:39:56,098 --> 00:39:59,772
have accumulated over usually a longer

894
00:39:59,826 --> 00:40:03,936
career. And the board,

895
00:40:04,118 --> 00:40:07,616
because it is not executive, is in

896
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:11,776
my view uniquely positioned not

897
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:13,488
to get involved in the content

898
00:40:13,574 --> 00:40:15,780
dimensions of the business. The board

899
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,856
can't tell you you should be buying

900
00:40:17,888 --> 00:40:20,004
this, you should be doing this. What the

901
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,332
board should be doing is to ensure that

902
00:40:23,386 --> 00:40:26,936
we have a process that allows for

903
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,210
free energy governance to come to life

904
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,324
bottom and top, properly connected

905
00:40:32,452 --> 00:40:34,712
articulating prediction models, having

906
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,980
the right language, articulating

907
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,096
predictions and empowering the rest of

908
00:40:39,118 --> 00:40:40,524
the organization to challenge those

909
00:40:40,562 --> 00:40:42,556
predictions. And the third one is where

910
00:40:42,578 --> 00:40:45,548
the board has to self evaluate are we

911
00:40:45,634 --> 00:40:48,140
really keeping a good balance between

912
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,652
strategic control and financial control?

913
00:40:50,786 --> 00:40:54,720
And these are a role which in my view

914
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:59,072
cannot be delegated to the CEO and needs

915
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:01,792
to come actually from a meta organ which

916
00:41:01,846 --> 00:41:04,732
literally the board is to ensure those

917
00:41:04,806 --> 00:41:08,196
processes and just make sure that they

918
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:10,580
are in place and that they stay alive.

919
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,116
That makes sense if I understand you

920
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,020
correctly. It's not to say that a board

921
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,636
is like intrinsically a part of free

922
00:41:17,658 --> 00:41:19,956
energy governance but like we have

923
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,768
inherited these legal structures where

924
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,340
oftentimes for nonprofits and c corpse

925
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,088
you need to have a board so you might as

926
00:41:26,094 --> 00:41:27,992
well put it to good use. And a nice

927
00:41:28,046 --> 00:41:29,748
attribute of a board is that it's

928
00:41:29,844 --> 00:41:30,936
separate from the rest of the

929
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:32,876
organization and that means you can play

930
00:41:32,898 --> 00:41:35,004
this kind of unique and special role in

931
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:36,716
free energy governance. Does that

932
00:41:36,738 --> 00:41:37,804
characterize what you're saying

933
00:41:37,842 --> 00:41:39,276
correctly? Absolutely. And if you look

934
00:41:39,298 --> 00:41:42,360
at the Dow, I mean effectively it's a

935
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:45,088
software and it's a contracting, I mean

936
00:41:45,094 --> 00:41:47,056
a smart contracting in a certain way.

937
00:41:47,158 --> 00:41:49,904
So what you should be doing, you should

938
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:53,052
be because in the Dow the governance

939
00:41:53,116 --> 00:41:56,436
dimension is not about content. I mean

940
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:58,196
it's not about saying you should be

941
00:41:58,218 --> 00:41:59,892
going left, you should be going right.

942
00:42:00,026 --> 00:42:04,032
The real question is are you following

943
00:42:04,096 --> 00:42:07,272
the right process when certain things

944
00:42:07,326 --> 00:42:09,080
should happen or they shouldn't happen?

945
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:13,912
And that in my view is for

946
00:42:14,046 --> 00:42:17,320
a board should be the guardian

947
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,752
of institutionalizing

948
00:42:21,816 --> 00:42:24,296
and of keeping alive self organizing

949
00:42:24,328 --> 00:42:27,356
mechanisms as I described them with the

950
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,468
free energy governance framework. And I

951
00:42:29,474 --> 00:42:32,704
think in a Dow you may actually write

952
00:42:32,742 --> 00:42:35,392
this into the software. The way those

953
00:42:35,446 --> 00:42:36,976
things it's, the language, the

954
00:42:36,998 --> 00:42:40,560
communication, the way actually what

955
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:43,440
information can actually take decisions

956
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:48,064
and has the. Right judgment that makes

957
00:42:48,102 --> 00:42:49,748
sense? I'm actually curious. This might

958
00:42:49,754 --> 00:42:51,988
be a hard question. I think part of the

959
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:52,884
reason it's hard because it's very

960
00:42:52,922 --> 00:42:54,864
contextually dependent but I'm wondering

961
00:42:54,912 --> 00:42:57,156
if you could have your pick up like a

962
00:42:57,178 --> 00:42:58,564
different governance structure, right?

963
00:42:58,602 --> 00:43:00,344
Maybe it's not the board but something

964
00:43:00,382 --> 00:43:03,256
else that would be more fine tuned and

965
00:43:03,278 --> 00:43:04,980
appropriate for free energy governance.

966
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,356
And like you can have any legal

967
00:43:06,388 --> 00:43:08,856
structure you wanted? Are there things

968
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:10,200
that you would change about the board?

969
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,236
Or maybe it's like just not the board at

970
00:43:12,258 --> 00:43:13,608
all. It's a different kind of entity

971
00:43:13,704 --> 00:43:14,924
that you would think would be more

972
00:43:14,962 --> 00:43:17,100
appropriate for free energy governance.

973
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,136
I do think that

974
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:26,656
the power of the board. And if

975
00:43:26,678 --> 00:43:28,850
you think about it, it's funny. Now,

976
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,128
historically, it was never one person

977
00:43:32,214 --> 00:43:34,660
aboard. It's always like two people,

978
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:38,644
three people. So I do think the idea

979
00:43:38,762 --> 00:43:41,860
of having a small group of people coming

980
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:45,636
together that are not involved in the

981
00:43:45,658 --> 00:43:48,904
day to day business as a management team

982
00:43:49,102 --> 00:43:52,152
to deliberate and think about very key

983
00:43:52,206 --> 00:43:55,064
decisions about which concern the whole

984
00:43:55,102 --> 00:43:58,660
firm is, in my view,

985
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,972
irreplaceable. And I really do believe

986
00:44:01,026 --> 00:44:04,412
in this. Now, what we do see,

987
00:44:04,466 --> 00:44:06,076
however, is that some boards are

988
00:44:06,098 --> 00:44:08,268
completely irrelevant. Some boards are a

989
00:44:08,274 --> 00:44:14,668
source of inertia, and a

990
00:44:14,674 --> 00:44:15,804
lot of the corporate governance

991
00:44:15,852 --> 00:44:17,888
literature is about how do you make the

992
00:44:17,894 --> 00:44:19,504
board really effective, then it comes

993
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:21,536
into diversity discussions and all of

994
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:24,116
this. I don't think that is really the

995
00:44:24,138 --> 00:44:28,768
key. It really comes down to I'm

996
00:44:28,784 --> 00:44:32,544
not a big fan of the diversity

997
00:44:32,672 --> 00:44:36,504
in terms of stereotypical diversity to

998
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:40,440
say, oh, we should have, for example,

999
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:43,336
the Nordic countries in Europe have made

1000
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:45,864
it the law that a certain number of

1001
00:44:45,902 --> 00:44:47,720
board members need to be female.

1002
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,524
And right now it's really crazy because

1003
00:44:52,562 --> 00:44:55,676
they don't find enough women who are

1004
00:44:55,698 --> 00:44:57,356
prepared to go on the board even, and

1005
00:44:57,378 --> 00:44:59,340
who are qualified to go on the board.

1006
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:02,716
And I

1007
00:45:02,738 --> 00:45:04,384
think that is the wrong way. I think

1008
00:45:04,422 --> 00:45:07,340
what you want is you want to constantly

1009
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:10,976
self evaluate as a board to ensure that

1010
00:45:10,998 --> 00:45:13,472
you have the right expertise, the right

1011
00:45:13,526 --> 00:45:16,596
qualities on the board to steer the

1012
00:45:16,618 --> 00:45:18,660
company through its next challenges.

1013
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,652
Got it? I see. So instead of a top down

1014
00:45:23,706 --> 00:45:26,452
mandated version of hey, this is the

1015
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:28,116
kind of diversity you have, that should

1016
00:45:28,138 --> 00:45:29,528
actually be an internalized process

1017
00:45:29,614 --> 00:45:31,336
where you would internally be saying

1018
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:32,504
like, hey, actually we don't have

1019
00:45:32,542 --> 00:45:34,468
representation from these groups that's

1020
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:36,244
actually probably hampering our decision

1021
00:45:36,292 --> 00:45:38,436
making processes in these ways. Let's

1022
00:45:38,468 --> 00:45:40,872
intentionally create diversity to create

1023
00:45:40,926 --> 00:45:42,744
new cognitive capabilities on our board.

1024
00:45:42,862 --> 00:45:44,828
Does that culture that right, yeah. I

1025
00:45:44,834 --> 00:45:46,780
would put the emphasis on the cognitive

1026
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,216
dimensions. Having said this, see, I'm

1027
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:52,480
on the board of a company in Switzerland

1028
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,952
which is quite big, has many

1029
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:58,364
thousands of employees, is involved

1030
00:45:58,412 --> 00:46:01,776
around the globe, and I'm always

1031
00:46:01,878 --> 00:46:04,950
embarrassed when I look at the website

1032
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,620
and you have four male wide

1033
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,300
guys on the board, and this is a company

1034
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:17,220
which is globally active.

1035
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,152
We have a very important part of women

1036
00:46:20,206 --> 00:46:21,720
in our workforce.

1037
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,524
And I don't think the board represents

1038
00:46:25,572 --> 00:46:28,184
this. So I do think the board has to

1039
00:46:28,222 --> 00:46:31,324
represent in some way also the world you

1040
00:46:31,362 --> 00:46:34,844
represent as a business. And I

1041
00:46:34,882 --> 00:46:37,388
think that board needs to change in

1042
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:40,008
terms of diversity. But the diversity

1043
00:46:40,104 --> 00:46:41,516
shouldn't be just changed for the sake

1044
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,856
of diversity. It should bring in, as you

1045
00:46:43,878 --> 00:46:47,296
rightly set the cognitive diversity at

1046
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:48,290
the same time.

1047
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,148
But we all know sometimes, and I

1048
00:46:54,154 --> 00:46:57,620
guess that's what the lawmakers imply,

1049
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,452
the cognitive diversity is many times

1050
00:47:00,506 --> 00:47:02,740
related to the stereotypical diversity.

1051
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,588
Unless they have anything else to add to

1052
00:47:07,594 --> 00:47:09,396
this, I do want to switch gears a little

1053
00:47:09,418 --> 00:47:10,644
bit because we have about ten minutes

1054
00:47:10,682 --> 00:47:12,776
left. And so something you're talking

1055
00:47:12,798 --> 00:47:14,136
about too is like you're envisioning a

1056
00:47:14,158 --> 00:47:16,872
very different version of what a board

1057
00:47:16,926 --> 00:47:19,428
looks like and get to the right slide.

1058
00:47:19,524 --> 00:47:22,732
So both for implementing free energy

1059
00:47:22,786 --> 00:47:24,236
governance from the perspective of being

1060
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,148
inside a board, but then also within the

1061
00:47:27,154 --> 00:47:28,924
entire organization, it's a very

1062
00:47:28,962 --> 00:47:30,604
different way that especially a board

1063
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:32,936
needs to operate. And I know that you're

1064
00:47:32,968 --> 00:47:34,992
on the board of several companies,

1065
00:47:35,126 --> 00:47:36,636
you're also a leader of several

1066
00:47:36,668 --> 00:47:38,364
companies as well. I'm kind of curious

1067
00:47:38,412 --> 00:47:40,816
how you think about the resistance that

1068
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:43,216
you've encountered in implementing free

1069
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:44,800
energy governance both within the board

1070
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:47,556
and outside of the board as well. And

1071
00:47:47,578 --> 00:47:49,892
so, for example, I've had personal

1072
00:47:49,946 --> 00:47:51,316
experience with this as well, not

1073
00:47:51,338 --> 00:47:52,692
necessarily implementing free energy

1074
00:47:52,746 --> 00:47:54,324
governance, but also implementing things

1075
00:47:54,362 --> 00:47:57,096
that are less hierarchical, more of a

1076
00:47:57,118 --> 00:47:59,144
collective sense making process where

1077
00:47:59,262 --> 00:48:01,416
we're not top down deciding the

1078
00:48:01,438 --> 00:48:03,220
strategy, but we're more collectively

1079
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,616
through a sense making process,

1080
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:07,368
understanding what that purpose is.

1081
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:09,880
And I've often found that can be very

1082
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:13,160
disorienting for folks and a lot of fear

1083
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,164
and uncertainty arises during that

1084
00:48:15,202 --> 00:48:17,084
process and a lot of resistance comes

1085
00:48:17,122 --> 00:48:18,396
during that process as well. I would

1086
00:48:18,418 --> 00:48:20,188
imagine that you would encounter similar

1087
00:48:20,274 --> 00:48:21,932
things implementing free energy

1088
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:24,576
governance both within the board and

1089
00:48:24,598 --> 00:48:26,976
then within the larger organization. So

1090
00:48:26,998 --> 00:48:29,008
I'm kind of curious about types of

1091
00:48:29,014 --> 00:48:31,196
resistance that you found and how you've

1092
00:48:31,228 --> 00:48:32,736
kind of overcome that resistance in your

1093
00:48:32,758 --> 00:48:35,584
own organizations. Yeah, good, very good

1094
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:38,500
question. Effectively it's a question or

1095
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,140
this whole topic touches upon.

1096
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,372
Let's be very precise. How do you make

1097
00:48:44,426 --> 00:48:46,776
actually free energy governance work in

1098
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,840
an organization? Give me some very

1099
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:52,392
precise tools. If I was interested now

1100
00:48:52,526 --> 00:48:57,656
in bridging the bottom and the top and

1101
00:48:57,678 --> 00:49:00,108
doing all these things, what should I

1102
00:49:00,114 --> 00:49:02,524
do? Give me a plan, give me some

1103
00:49:02,562 --> 00:49:04,156
inspiration. What other companies have

1104
00:49:04,178 --> 00:49:07,388
been doing. That's what I'm looking at,

1105
00:49:07,474 --> 00:49:09,308
putting together now through a research

1106
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:13,328
project I'm undertaking to look

1107
00:49:13,414 --> 00:49:16,656
at companies. They may not call it free

1108
00:49:16,678 --> 00:49:18,284
energy governance, but they're dealing

1109
00:49:18,332 --> 00:49:20,656
precisely with those issues and what

1110
00:49:20,678 --> 00:49:22,752
they have been doing. But I want to and

1111
00:49:22,806 --> 00:49:25,428
so my answer will be twofold. I'm going

1112
00:49:25,434 --> 00:49:28,164
to answer first of all with your

1113
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:31,444
question and then come actually to what

1114
00:49:31,482 --> 00:49:33,796
should be done because the two are kind

1115
00:49:33,818 --> 00:49:36,536
of related in a certain way. The

1116
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:40,440
resistance I see in boards is

1117
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,880
when you look at a board of directors,

1118
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,304
it's a really very strange group of

1119
00:49:47,342 --> 00:49:52,012
people because most

1120
00:49:52,066 --> 00:49:54,844
of the time the recruitment of those

1121
00:49:54,882 --> 00:49:57,420
people is coming through connectivity.

1122
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,804
I mean, of course, many times you do

1123
00:49:59,842 --> 00:50:01,708
have a headhunter saying like we need a

1124
00:50:01,714 --> 00:50:03,500
board member, can you find us somebody

1125
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,888
interesting? And somebody comes and that

1126
00:50:05,974 --> 00:50:07,408
happens, I'm sure. I don't know what the

1127
00:50:07,414 --> 00:50:09,392
percentage is, but a fair share of board

1128
00:50:09,446 --> 00:50:12,672
positions are being done this way.

1129
00:50:12,806 --> 00:50:14,544
But then most of the time the board

1130
00:50:14,582 --> 00:50:16,636
members obviously know a lot of board

1131
00:50:16,678 --> 00:50:18,356
members and they say, look, this is a

1132
00:50:18,378 --> 00:50:20,708
great person, that person can join. The

1133
00:50:20,714 --> 00:50:21,684
board has these and these

1134
00:50:21,722 --> 00:50:24,356
qualifications. So what happens at the

1135
00:50:24,378 --> 00:50:28,168
end? That the board comes together a

1136
00:50:28,174 --> 00:50:31,656
little bit as a club. So there is in the

1137
00:50:31,678 --> 00:50:35,384
board, and by the way, there's a lot

1138
00:50:35,422 --> 00:50:37,976
of research which also says it's quite

1139
00:50:38,078 --> 00:50:40,924
important that the board members get

1140
00:50:40,962 --> 00:50:44,204
along very well, so that there's a good

1141
00:50:44,242 --> 00:50:47,180
climate on the board table.

1142
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,948
It's a group of people who share a lot

1143
00:50:49,954 --> 00:50:53,916
of responsibility. What I have seen

1144
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:57,200
over the time is that because of these

1145
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:59,168
things and also because many times there

1146
00:50:59,174 --> 00:51:01,088
can be a lot of pressure on the board

1147
00:51:01,254 --> 00:51:03,168
taking decisions. In particular, at the

1148
00:51:03,174 --> 00:51:05,840
moment of crisis, there's an additional

1149
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,276
communication challenge, visa vis the

1150
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,772
public, visa vis the employee force. So

1151
00:51:10,826 --> 00:51:13,204
when you face these challenges, it

1152
00:51:13,242 --> 00:51:15,556
brings you obviously together. It's like

1153
00:51:15,738 --> 00:51:19,016
a family in the forest facing a

1154
00:51:19,038 --> 00:51:21,796
challenge to fight. You come even closer

1155
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:25,416
together and you tend, in the

1156
00:51:25,438 --> 00:51:27,704
context of the board, you tend to become

1157
00:51:27,742 --> 00:51:29,868
a little bit introverted. And that's a

1158
00:51:29,874 --> 00:51:35,372
real problem because you start again,

1159
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,992
it's skilled incompetence, it's

1160
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,376
counterproductive to what you're

1161
00:51:40,408 --> 00:51:42,508
actually trying to achieve. You become

1162
00:51:42,594 --> 00:51:44,256
further removed from the rest of the

1163
00:51:44,278 --> 00:51:47,072
organization. You start inviting people

1164
00:51:47,126 --> 00:51:48,864
to make presentations, then you close

1165
00:51:48,902 --> 00:51:50,524
the doors again, you stay amongst

1166
00:51:50,572 --> 00:51:53,776
yourself, and I think you're going to be

1167
00:51:53,878 --> 00:51:56,676
hostage to a lot of blind spots, to a

1168
00:51:56,698 --> 00:51:59,904
lot of bias, toward a lot of agent

1169
00:51:59,952 --> 00:52:02,276
recognition, which nothing is always the

1170
00:52:02,298 --> 00:52:05,556
same. And you start becoming a little

1171
00:52:05,578 --> 00:52:08,024
bit too overconfident the way you can

1172
00:52:08,062 --> 00:52:12,010
take decisions. And my approach has been

1173
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,290
and that's a problem. I do think that

1174
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,960
every board, what I've just described

1175
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,990
suffers to a certain degree from that

1176
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,492
pathology. And that

1177
00:52:26,546 --> 00:52:28,316
makes it sometimes very difficult.

1178
00:52:28,418 --> 00:52:30,028
Because when you think about it, the

1179
00:52:30,034 --> 00:52:31,596
free energy governance framework is all

1180
00:52:31,618 --> 00:52:34,080
about how the board opens, how the board

1181
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,384
communicates, how the board connects and

1182
00:52:36,422 --> 00:52:38,096
picks up the intelligence which is at

1183
00:52:38,118 --> 00:52:40,592
the bottom. And now we come to very

1184
00:52:40,646 --> 00:52:44,004
concrete measures of what you can do in

1185
00:52:44,042 --> 00:52:46,150
order to actually change this.

1186
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,470
I have to say, to answer your question,

1187
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,020
I have been practicing free energy

1188
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:57,496
governance as a CEO, making that

1189
00:52:57,518 --> 00:52:59,784
the way I run the company and the way

1190
00:52:59,822 --> 00:53:01,732
the flow of information is generated,

1191
00:53:01,796 --> 00:53:04,932
the way decision power is distributed,

1192
00:53:05,076 --> 00:53:08,888
that the company is really empowered to

1193
00:53:08,974 --> 00:53:11,496
make judgment calls and execute them.

1194
00:53:11,598 --> 00:53:13,169
And that not the top becomes a

1195
00:53:13,669 --> 00:53:15,372
bottleneck. So I'm pretty good at that.

1196
00:53:15,506 --> 00:53:17,116
But I look at my board and my own

1197
00:53:17,138 --> 00:53:18,732
company, which is a pretty strong board

1198
00:53:18,786 --> 00:53:20,924
with very strong people, and strong

1199
00:53:20,962 --> 00:53:22,504
backgrounds, very serious business

1200
00:53:22,562 --> 00:53:25,216
people. I find it very difficult, for

1201
00:53:25,238 --> 00:53:27,424
example, to say, hey, on the website,

1202
00:53:27,622 --> 00:53:30,784
why don't you put next to your photo a

1203
00:53:30,822 --> 00:53:32,976
sentence which explains what's your

1204
00:53:32,998 --> 00:53:35,024
contribution to this company? Why are

1205
00:53:35,062 --> 00:53:37,248
you on the board? I think that's a

1206
00:53:37,254 --> 00:53:39,316
question everybody should answer. And I

1207
00:53:39,338 --> 00:53:40,804
think it makes all of a sudden a board

1208
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:43,684
member much more accessible to the rest

1209
00:53:43,722 --> 00:53:45,300
of the organization. Because if somebody

1210
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:47,796
says to me like they're responsible for

1211
00:53:47,818 --> 00:53:50,468
China and I'm involved in China, then

1212
00:53:50,554 --> 00:53:52,712
there is a guy or woman I should be

1213
00:53:52,766 --> 00:53:55,316
contacting and maybe share some ideas.

1214
00:53:55,348 --> 00:53:57,912
So I think that's a way of the board

1215
00:53:57,966 --> 00:54:00,052
opening up. I think a board member

1216
00:54:00,116 --> 00:54:02,876
should have on their website stating in

1217
00:54:02,898 --> 00:54:04,652
one sentence why they're on that board

1218
00:54:04,706 --> 00:54:06,236
and what their contribution is to the

1219
00:54:06,258 --> 00:54:08,456
company, from which angle they're

1220
00:54:08,488 --> 00:54:11,230
coming. That opens up second,

1221
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,904
which is a great way and I've been

1222
00:54:13,942 --> 00:54:17,084
practicing this quite a bit, is creating

1223
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:19,920
deep dives where you take people, very

1224
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:23,344
junior people on a specific topic where

1225
00:54:23,382 --> 00:54:25,732
you believe these junior people middle

1226
00:54:25,786 --> 00:54:28,144
layer. People. Executive leadership

1227
00:54:28,192 --> 00:54:30,484
people together with selected board

1228
00:54:30,522 --> 00:54:32,196
members, not the whole board. Create a

1229
00:54:32,218 --> 00:54:33,764
deep dive around the topic. No

1230
00:54:33,802 --> 00:54:36,708
presentations. And just deep dive into a

1231
00:54:36,714 --> 00:54:39,424
topic, sharing actually what experiences

1232
00:54:39,472 --> 00:54:43,032
they are to advance the topic. And that

1233
00:54:43,086 --> 00:54:45,016
usually is an incredible experience. By

1234
00:54:45,038 --> 00:54:46,856
the end of the meeting, you don't know

1235
00:54:46,878 --> 00:54:48,356
who's a board member and who's a junior

1236
00:54:48,388 --> 00:54:51,224
guy because you don't come with this

1237
00:54:51,262 --> 00:54:53,464
like, come in here, make me a PowerPoint

1238
00:54:53,512 --> 00:54:55,756
presentation. I'm listening to you, and

1239
00:54:55,778 --> 00:54:57,996
then I will judge and come with all my

1240
00:54:58,018 --> 00:54:59,836
experience. You have to kill all of

1241
00:54:59,858 --> 00:55:02,832
this. The other element which I really

1242
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:05,472
like, and I'm looking much deeper into

1243
00:55:05,526 --> 00:55:07,824
it and there are a number of big

1244
00:55:07,862 --> 00:55:10,880
companies who have been doing it, is

1245
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:13,616
creating shadow boards. So now what

1246
00:55:13,638 --> 00:55:15,990
you're doing is you're looking ant the

1247
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,172
closer to the front lines of really high

1248
00:55:19,226 --> 00:55:23,460
potential people talent who

1249
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:27,370
form a board which is

1250
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,824
holding a board meeting at the very same

1251
00:55:30,862 --> 00:55:32,904
time the main board is holding its board

1252
00:55:32,942 --> 00:55:35,224
meeting. They have more or less the same

1253
00:55:35,262 --> 00:55:37,850
documentation, the same agenda points,

1254
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,804
and they take decisions as if they were

1255
00:55:41,842 --> 00:55:45,448
the board. They define agenda items

1256
00:55:45,544 --> 00:55:48,100
for the next board meeting. And all of a

1257
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:51,390
sudden you're creating a group of people

1258
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,344
closer to the front line who have to

1259
00:55:55,542 --> 00:55:57,664
delve into the topics. They must be

1260
00:55:57,702 --> 00:55:59,712
obviously senior enough that they can be

1261
00:55:59,766 --> 00:56:02,336
entrusted and that they are capable of

1262
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:04,592
understanding all the issues and

1263
00:56:04,726 --> 00:56:07,924
assuming that role in a way of not just

1264
00:56:07,962 --> 00:56:09,796
looking at their domain, where they are

1265
00:56:09,818 --> 00:56:11,892
acting maybe, but looking at the whole

1266
00:56:11,946 --> 00:56:13,536
organization, because that's a challenge

1267
00:56:13,568 --> 00:56:15,828
for the board too. You have to really

1268
00:56:15,994 --> 00:56:18,744
understand how to relate and how to

1269
00:56:18,782 --> 00:56:21,736
respect a lot of interacting parts of a

1270
00:56:21,758 --> 00:56:25,524
company. And then you compare afterwards

1271
00:56:25,652 --> 00:56:27,384
the shadow board, what they have

1272
00:56:27,422 --> 00:56:29,736
discussed, how they have decided that's

1273
00:56:29,768 --> 00:56:32,472
a tremendous input of frontline

1274
00:56:32,536 --> 00:56:35,052
information of intelligence feeding into

1275
00:56:35,106 --> 00:56:37,784
the main board and possibly determining

1276
00:56:37,832 --> 00:56:39,340
future agenda items.

1277
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:45,666
Oh, man. There's a lot of juicy, action

1278
00:56:45,698 --> 00:56:47,606
oriented things I would love to spend

1279
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:50,230
the next 4 hours going into.

1280
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:51,926
Unfortunately, we're at the top of the

1281
00:56:51,948 --> 00:56:54,678
hour, and so hopefully we can have you

1282
00:56:54,684 --> 00:56:57,158
back and we can go deeper into some of

1283
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:58,978
these, especially the practice oriented

1284
00:56:59,074 --> 00:57:00,326
recommendations. Would love to explore

1285
00:57:00,358 --> 00:57:03,226
that more. But before we wrap up, when

1286
00:57:03,248 --> 00:57:04,906
we respectful of each other's time,

1287
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,966
curious if anyone has any final closing

1288
00:57:06,998 --> 00:57:09,882
thoughts, comments, reflections,

1289
00:57:09,946 --> 00:57:12,080
questions before we wrap up.

1290
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:17,514
I appreciate, Tyler and Bleu that you're

1291
00:57:17,562 --> 00:57:19,086
leading this series. We're going to

1292
00:57:19,108 --> 00:57:22,254
Continuum, the regular Jorge section

1293
00:57:22,302 --> 00:57:25,746
oriented videos keep a space open for

1294
00:57:25,768 --> 00:57:28,626
others to come in and range freely. And

1295
00:57:28,648 --> 00:57:30,546
Bijan, thanks again for joining your.

1296
00:57:30,568 --> 00:57:33,886
Welcome back anytime. Thank you, Bijan.

1297
00:57:33,998 --> 00:57:36,638
Yeah, thank you for inviting me. I'm

1298
00:57:36,654 --> 00:57:38,678
very honored that you took the book and

1299
00:57:38,684 --> 00:57:40,470
you're dedicating the time to it. I do

1300
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,118
really believe, not because I wrote the

1301
00:57:42,124 --> 00:57:44,194
book, obviously it's a very theoretical

1302
00:57:44,242 --> 00:57:45,554
contribution, a more practical

1303
00:57:45,602 --> 00:57:48,042
correlation contribution should follow.

1304
00:57:48,176 --> 00:57:50,906
But I do believe. And I guess that's why

1305
00:57:50,928 --> 00:57:52,906
also Karl Friston decided to write The

1306
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:56,410
Forward and also Connie Helford from

1307
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,694
Dartmouth wrote The Forward is because I

1308
00:57:59,732 --> 00:58:02,526
do think this is the beginning of

1309
00:58:02,548 --> 00:58:04,794
changing things. And as I think Daniel

1310
00:58:04,842 --> 00:58:07,886
said it at the beginning, or I think

1311
00:58:07,908 --> 00:58:11,742
it was Bleu saying, this is something

1312
00:58:11,876 --> 00:58:15,774
Active Inference Lab Institute should be

1313
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:19,360
looking at and being inspired by how you

1314
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:21,390
design governance.

1315
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:27,766
Thanks again. Till next time. Thank you.

1316
00:58:27,948 --> 00:58:29,974
Bye bye. Thanks for John. Bye. Thank

1317
00:58:30,012 --> 00:58:31,382
you. Thank you very much.
