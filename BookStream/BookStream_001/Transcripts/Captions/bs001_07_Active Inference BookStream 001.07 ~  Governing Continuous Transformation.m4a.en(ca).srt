00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,034
Daniel Friedman: Hello and welcome. It's January 24,

2
00:00:08,082 --> 00:00:12,440
2023. We're in ActInf Livestream number

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,194
1.7 on governing continuous

4
00:00:16,242 --> 00:00:18,470
transformation. Off to you, Bleu.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,514
Bleu Knight: Great. So we are the Active Inference

6
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:24,886
Institute, a participatory online

7
00:00:24,988 --> 00:00:26,698
institute that is communicating,

8
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,446
learning and practicing applied Active

9
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:31,054
Inference Lab. You can reach us at all

10
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:34,078
of these social media links. This is a

11
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:36,222
recorded and archived live stream, so

12
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:38,286
please provide us with feedback so that

13
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:40,434
we can improve upon our work. All

14
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:42,546
backgrounds and perspectives are welcome

15
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:44,882
here and we will be following good video

16
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:47,826
etiquette for live streams. Again, if

17
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,782
you'd like to participate. Active

18
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:53,750
Inference is our main website and

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,722
there's a link to get involved and join

20
00:00:56,786 --> 00:00:58,162
many of the ongoing collaborative

21
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:00,360
projects or live streams or both.

22
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,926
This is, as Daniel said, Bookstream 1.7.

23
00:01:06,028 --> 00:01:08,780
So it's our 7th contextualization video

24
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,494
on this book governing Continuous

25
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:15,034
Transformation by Bijan Khezri. So we

26
00:01:15,072 --> 00:01:17,600
will just jump right into it.

27
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,162
I am Bleu. I'm an independent researcher

28
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:24,334
in New Mexico and I will pass it

29
00:01:24,372 --> 00:01:28,138
off to Daniel. All right, I'm Daniel.

30
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:30,898
I'm a researcher in California and just

31
00:01:30,984 --> 00:01:33,220
happy to see this series continue. Tyler.

32
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,806
I'm Tyler, I'm a protocol designer

33
00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:39,970
and researcher in California.

34
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,790
Great. So we are in

35
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,958
part two free energy governance of this

36
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:50,914
textbook. And the name of this chapter

37
00:01:50,962 --> 00:01:53,762
is Cognition from Superposition to

38
00:01:53,836 --> 00:01:57,066
Reality. And so I think that that kind

39
00:01:57,088 --> 00:02:00,106
of hints to some quantum stuff that

40
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:02,858
might be elaborated more towards the end

41
00:02:02,864 --> 00:02:06,330
of this chapter and in the next chapter.

42
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,160
And just a few keywords for this

43
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,174
chapter, but still quite a bit of

44
00:02:14,212 --> 00:02:16,718
content here. So Tyler, do you want to

45
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:18,638
read the start of the abstract? Do you

46
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:21,266
mind? Sounds good. Can you guys hear me

47
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:23,506
okay, by the way? Great. All right.

48
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:25,634
Attention based view and enacted this

49
00:02:25,672 --> 00:02:27,534
approach address FPG's cognition

50
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:29,086
dimension to this DAG strategy.

51
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:30,926
Management research is not entirely deep

52
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,978
change from its very path dependency of

53
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:34,510
putting perception ahead of the action,

54
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,566
ie. Putting environment ahead of

55
00:02:36,588 --> 00:02:38,626
strategy. While ABV's structure

56
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,674
cognition nexus is FEG's critical

57
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:43,746
building block, ABV erroneously treats

58
00:02:43,778 --> 00:02:45,554
action as a consequence of perception.

59
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:47,494
Once we embrace attention as action

60
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,706
generated, we start understanding that

61
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,334
clever analysis and form of belief

62
00:02:51,382 --> 00:02:52,854
updating follows action generated

63
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:55,446
stimuli, not the other way around. ABV

64
00:02:55,478 --> 00:02:57,222
is trapped in the old school limitations

65
00:02:57,286 --> 00:02:59,598
imposed by bounded rationality and the

66
00:02:59,604 --> 00:03:01,594
discontinuous and distributed quantum

67
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:03,726
world agents. Bounded rationality is

68
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:05,226
meaningless as enacted inference

69
00:03:05,258 --> 00:03:06,926
empowers the world to deliver a

70
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:09,550
supervisory signal, effectively agents

71
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,058
offload the burden of cognition to the

72
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:12,946
environment. Bounded rationality is

73
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:14,914
replaced by extended cognition. That

74
00:03:14,952 --> 00:03:16,562
battedness of human cognition is

75
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:19,186
effectively neutralized. Bleu would even

76
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,180
take that one.

77
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,130
Sure, there are at least as many reality

78
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,978
models as there are economic actors.

79
00:03:29,154 --> 00:03:31,446
Every organization chooses akin to

80
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:33,898
holding acting upon a light torch in the

81
00:03:33,904 --> 00:03:36,182
awareness which environmental

82
00:03:36,246 --> 00:03:38,506
significance to attend to. Whatever the

83
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:40,186
torch highlights is equivalent to

84
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,310
breaking a quantum wave of probabilities

85
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,998
moving from superposition to reality

86
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:47,550
intermediated by the Markov blanket

87
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,286
environment enactment is essentially a

88
00:03:50,308 --> 00:03:51,930
purpose directed, interactive,

89
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,382
inferential and social learning sense

90
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:58,046
making process. All right, so there

91
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:00,786
are two sections to this chapter. The

92
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:03,426
first is attention based view, and the

93
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:07,074
second is an activist approach. So,

94
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:08,770
Tyler, do you want to take this slide?

95
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,154
Sure. All right, so attention based

96
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:12,898
view. So we actually touched on this a

97
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:14,466
couple of streams ago in the context of

98
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,418
when we introduced this, was that Bijan

99
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:18,118
was going through different models of

100
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,038
thinking about firm cognition, and

101
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:21,462
they're all limited in their own sense,

102
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:22,886
including attention based view. And

103
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:24,534
we'll go deeper into why attention based

104
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:26,742
view is limited, but also chaos

105
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:28,854
important ways of thinking about how

106
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:31,802
firm cognition works. And so the general

107
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:34,858
idea of it is that attention is a

108
00:04:34,864 --> 00:04:36,934
limited resource and that permeates

109
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:38,458
through all levels of the hierarchy of

110
00:04:38,464 --> 00:04:39,870
an organization. So on the individual

111
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,822
level, you have limited attention that

112
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:45,486
bounds that bounds cognition of

113
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:47,406
what you're able to understand and

114
00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:48,926
perceive and decisions you're able to

115
00:04:48,948 --> 00:04:50,786
make. And the boundedness of your

116
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:54,130
individual cognition bubbles up into a

117
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,146
social context, which bubbles the kind

118
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:58,898
of decisions a group of people can make,

119
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:01,170
and then that finally bubbles up into

120
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,706
your organizational cognition, which

121
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:04,626
manifests through different rules,

122
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:07,826
positions, players, and resources.

123
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:09,974
So this is just to say, like, hey, we

124
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:11,206
only have so many things that we can

125
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,914
spend our time and energy on and that

126
00:05:13,952 --> 00:05:16,966
manifests at larger levels in the kinds

127
00:05:16,998 --> 00:05:18,986
of rules that we make within an

128
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:21,418
organization. Bleu Daniel, anything you

129
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:22,380
would add here?

130
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,852
No. So I can read this claim. While

131
00:05:28,906 --> 00:05:30,912
attention based views structure

132
00:05:30,976 --> 00:05:33,540
cognition, nexus is a critical building

133
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,344
block of free energy governance,

134
00:05:35,472 --> 00:05:37,328
fundamentally, attention to base views

135
00:05:37,344 --> 00:05:39,076
suffers from severe shortcomings that

136
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:41,396
weaken its relevance to practice. By

137
00:05:41,418 --> 00:05:43,044
highlighting some of attention based

138
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:45,336
views most fundamental weaknesses, we

139
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:47,096
should further cement the case for free

140
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:48,948
energy governance as a meta theory

141
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:50,724
connecting in circular causality,

142
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:53,252
structure, cognition, and capabilities.

143
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:55,076
Once we understand how the Bayesian

144
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:57,084
brain is building a model of its world,

145
00:05:57,202 --> 00:05:59,516
we start seeing how anachronistic and

146
00:05:59,538 --> 00:06:01,144
full of friction our deep rooted

147
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:03,400
conceptions of organizational attention

148
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,408
are. Do you guys have

149
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:10,672
anything to add here? Okay,

150
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:13,692
cool. All right. So bounded rationality.

151
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:16,668
So this was a concept that Bijan brought

152
00:06:16,684 --> 00:06:19,504
up here in this chapter, and it was

153
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:22,636
introduction by Herbert Simon, the term

154
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:25,076
in like, 1957. And I pulled this from

155
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:27,968
the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

156
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:31,576
So his introduction of this term was a

157
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:34,200
shorthand for his position against

158
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,856
neoclassical economics and his call to

159
00:06:36,878 --> 00:06:38,452
replace the perfect rationality

160
00:06:38,516 --> 00:06:41,016
assumptions of homo economicus with the

161
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,276
conception of rationality tailored to

162
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:46,524
cognitively limited agent. And so this

163
00:06:46,562 --> 00:06:49,996
little figure here shows

164
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:53,752
the cognitive limitations and imperfect

165
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:56,092
information and time constraints that

166
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:58,496
we're faced with when we have to make a

167
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,136
decision. So we always are limited by

168
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:03,536
what we can hold in our brain and the

169
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:05,232
view of the information that we have.

170
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:08,160
And we were talking about complexity

171
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,448
like computing pi. Like, we could get a

172
00:07:10,454 --> 00:07:14,156
more accuracy numerical digit of pi,

173
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,308
but we're limited by time. Like, if we

174
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:17,636
go on and on and on, we could get more

175
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:19,556
and more accurate. But, like, why is

176
00:07:19,578 --> 00:07:21,288
3.14 good enough? Because I can pull it

177
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:23,800
up in, like, a split second from memory.

178
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,744
And so all of this configures our

179
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:29,656
bounded rationality, and we use a

180
00:07:29,678 --> 00:07:31,784
process that Herbert Simon introduced as

181
00:07:31,822 --> 00:07:34,724
satisficing to make a suboptimal

182
00:07:34,772 --> 00:07:37,432
decision or our best possible decision

183
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:39,128
with the bounded rationality that we're

184
00:07:39,144 --> 00:07:42,584
faced with. And a quote

185
00:07:42,632 --> 00:07:45,416
from the Herbert Simon says, broadly

186
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:47,276
stated, the task is to replace the

187
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:49,616
Global rationality of economic man with

188
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:51,056
the kind of rational behavior that is

189
00:07:51,078 --> 00:07:52,656
compatible with the access to

190
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:53,964
information and the computational

191
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:55,548
capacities that are actually possessed

192
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:57,856
by organisms, including man, in the kind

193
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:00,144
of environments in which such organisms

194
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:04,148
exist. Tyler, do you want to read where

195
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,956
this bounded rationality concept is

196
00:08:05,978 --> 00:08:09,030
introduced in the computer? Sure. Yeah.

197
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,104
I think the context here is that he's

198
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:12,996
trying to connect ABV to

199
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:14,536
boundarrationality by saying, all right,

200
00:08:14,558 --> 00:08:16,824
well, you have limited attention. How

201
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:19,012
does a firm decide where his attention

202
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:21,412
is spent? How do you make that decision

203
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:24,344
collectively? So he says, in ABV top

204
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:25,724
leadership's, attention to the right

205
00:08:25,762 --> 00:08:27,276
issues and solutions considered the

206
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,096
source, the firm's competitive advantage

207
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:30,876
essentially is content rather than

208
00:08:30,898 --> 00:08:32,056
process centric. And the firm's

209
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:34,248
performance, Bobble Neck, remains upper

210
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,168
echelon's attention, ie. Boundary

211
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:38,512
rationality. The critical question then

212
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:40,768
is how in the first place, context is

213
00:08:40,774 --> 00:08:42,416
selected to determine the tension or

214
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,108
have bottom up market signals connected

215
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,356
with top down, upper echelon

216
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:47,216
expectations and predictions to

217
00:08:47,238 --> 00:08:50,316
determine tension. And so we're saying,

218
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:52,356
like, ABV doesn't really explain how

219
00:08:52,378 --> 00:08:53,748
that attention gets directed in the

220
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:56,484
first place. ABV is trapped in the old

221
00:08:56,522 --> 00:08:58,048
school limitations of hostile outbounded

222
00:08:58,064 --> 00:09:00,004
rationality and discontinuous and

223
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:01,764
distributed quantum world agents.

224
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:03,796
Bounded rationality is meaningless as

225
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:05,448
perceptual content is given in our

226
00:09:05,454 --> 00:09:07,096
predictions, and this is precisely what

227
00:09:07,118 --> 00:09:08,376
allows the world to deliver the

228
00:09:08,398 --> 00:09:10,328
supervisory signal. Effectively, the

229
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:11,688
firm is offloading the burden of

230
00:09:11,694 --> 00:09:13,096
cognition to its environment. So

231
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:15,756
boundary rationality is replaced by

232
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:18,076
extended cognition. The boundedness of

233
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:19,496
human cognition is effectively

234
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:22,776
neutralized. Bleu, Daniel,

235
00:09:22,808 --> 00:09:29,988
anything to add? There we'll

236
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:31,620
go to the next slide where Bleu can

237
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,660
explain more about extended cognition.

238
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,196
Cool. So, extended cognition, I took

239
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:39,900
this from this article by Mark Sprivac.

240
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,188
Extended cognition takes the idea that

241
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:43,848
your mind is on your smartphone,

242
00:09:43,944 --> 00:09:45,792
literally. So it says that human

243
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:47,648
cognitive states and processes sometimes

244
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:50,204
spill outside of our heads into objects

245
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:52,496
in our environment. And this is

246
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:53,856
something that we've looked at and

247
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:57,184
talked about before in many ways. Like,

248
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,628
even with Avalon, I'm not sure if you

249
00:09:58,634 --> 00:09:59,828
guys talked about it yesterday on the

250
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:01,684
stream, but in the thinking like a state

251
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:03,076
Livestream that we did, we talked quite

252
00:10:03,098 --> 00:10:05,270
a bit about extended cognition and

253
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,428
cumulative cultural evolution and how a

254
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:12,440
lot of our cognition is out there

255
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,296
embedded in our environment. So that we

256
00:10:14,318 --> 00:10:17,016
don't have to think about it. When I

257
00:10:17,038 --> 00:10:18,776
grew up, there was no Internet, so we

258
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:22,072
would have to like colton like, my son

259
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:23,796
in the car the other day asked me some

260
00:10:23,838 --> 00:10:25,388
question, and I was like, you're going

261
00:10:25,394 --> 00:10:28,076
to have to ask Alexa or Google. And he

262
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:29,388
was like, will you ask your phone for

263
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:32,828
me? And it was like some fact question,

264
00:10:32,914 --> 00:10:34,572
like, how many bones are in the body or

265
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:35,916
something that I couldn't remember off

266
00:10:35,938 --> 00:10:37,984
the top of my head. And I said, well,

267
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:39,056
wait till we get to school. And then

268
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:40,384
I'll ask my phone, because my phone was

269
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:42,176
like, whatever, playing music or doing

270
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:43,856
something, and I'm driving, right? And

271
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:47,036
he was like, that was so long. You can't

272
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:49,248
wait 15 minutes to get to school to

273
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:50,672
answer the question. I was like, man,

274
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:52,240
when I was a kid, if I wanted to know

275
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,776
the answer to this question, I would

276
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:55,808
have to go to the library, look in the

277
00:10:55,814 --> 00:10:57,848
card Cadillac, find a book, like, or

278
00:10:57,854 --> 00:10:59,688
encyclopedia or something. Oh, it's the

279
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:01,028
goodest book of world record. That's

280
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:02,068
what it was. It was like the world's

281
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:04,184
smallest pancake or something like that.

282
00:11:04,382 --> 00:11:06,216
And so we would have to find the book

283
00:11:06,238 --> 00:11:07,448
and then look it up in the book. And it

284
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:08,904
would take days, like, if we could even

285
00:11:08,942 --> 00:11:10,200
remember the question for that long.

286
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,656
And he was like, oh, my God, where would

287
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:14,696
you live? This kind of extended

288
00:11:14,728 --> 00:11:16,044
cognitive niche, we could just know

289
00:11:16,082 --> 00:11:17,816
everything with a click of a few buttons

290
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:20,396
is amazing. Do you guys have anything to

291
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:21,888
add here? Extended cognition. Sorry, I

292
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:22,720
rambled.

293
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,856
All right, then maybe Tyler wants to

294
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:33,024
talk about channeling attention. Cool.

295
00:11:33,062 --> 00:11:35,376
So, yeah, your extended cognition is not

296
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:38,156
just you as this single known

297
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:39,872
organization, and it actually

298
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:42,464
encompasses both your environment, the

299
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,068
firm around it, and also maybe the

300
00:11:44,074 --> 00:11:45,556
environment around the firm. Like, how

301
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:47,428
does the attention of that cognition get

302
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:48,836
channeled out? How do you decide what

303
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:52,132
matters, what doesn't matter? And so

304
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:53,956
what Bijan says is while ABV views

305
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:55,604
organizations as systems of structurally

306
00:11:55,652 --> 00:11:57,556
distribute attention, where structure

307
00:11:57,588 --> 00:11:59,288
channel attention, ABV treats the

308
00:11:59,294 --> 00:12:01,768
process of channeling as a black box.

309
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:03,512
So it's like a framework for thinking

310
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:05,996
about how cognition is limited in

311
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,176
organizational context, but it doesn't

312
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,116
really tell you what's going on. For

313
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:11,020
that reason, it doesn't end up being

314
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,016
super practical, at least in pajamas.

315
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:16,272
To it goes on to say, neither UEV nor

316
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:18,656
ABV, both fundamentally top down

317
00:12:18,758 --> 00:12:20,348
oriented frameworks, have given due

318
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,948
consideration to the dynamic interplay

319
00:12:21,964 --> 00:12:24,336
between top management team TMT and the

320
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:25,996
board directors. More specifically,

321
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:27,376
there's no transparent structural link

322
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:28,816
between the upper echelon level and

323
00:12:28,838 --> 00:12:30,676
field intelligence, for example. The

324
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:32,196
very process that governs the two

325
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,696
layers, interaction determining affirmed

326
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:36,192
attention and the actions remains

327
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,908
opaque. And so I think broadly what

328
00:12:37,914 --> 00:12:39,556
beyond saying is that especially like

329
00:12:39,578 --> 00:12:41,192
Beni and activist approach of thinking,

330
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:43,668
that how your actions in the environment

331
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:45,476
determine your perception, that's

332
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:47,412
missing an ABV. And that's a critical

333
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,204
aspect of understanding how cognition

334
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:51,064
happens in an organization. But

335
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:52,856
specifically the interplay between the

336
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:55,912
board and the management team,

337
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:57,836
which is in previous triumph. He spent a

338
00:12:57,858 --> 00:12:59,596
lot of time describing why that's a

339
00:12:59,618 --> 00:13:00,908
really critical and important

340
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:03,820
relationship for firm cognition.

341
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,390
Bleu Dale, anything you do that on here.

342
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,412
I would just add that or maybe emphasize

343
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:14,512
the point that we talk about a lot about

344
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:16,496
top management here and the board and

345
00:13:16,518 --> 00:13:18,704
that interaction and then the

346
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:20,708
interactions between different levels of

347
00:13:20,714 --> 00:13:22,468
the hierarchy, like from the top all the

348
00:13:22,474 --> 00:13:24,724
way to the bottom. And I think that we

349
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,904
emphasize the importance of the feeding

350
00:13:27,952 --> 00:13:29,736
forward and feeding back and the

351
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:31,464
interaction between the layers and how

352
00:13:31,502 --> 00:13:33,096
information is transmitted between them.

353
00:13:33,118 --> 00:13:36,360
But there's no real concrete

354
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,000
examples of how to best do that.

355
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,284
And I think that this is like for me,

356
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:47,996
not just in a firm but also in the

357
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:49,884
body. How is that information

358
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:53,096
transmitted? How does my big toe

359
00:13:53,128 --> 00:13:55,080
prioritize what goes to my brain?

360
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,556
Obviously, if I kick something really

361
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:59,008
hard and hurt my toe or if I get like a

362
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:00,796
hangnail or like and agreement toenail

363
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:02,352
or something, it really hurts. But

364
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:04,508
otherwise my toe, I don't even know it's

365
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:07,170
ever talking to my brain. So it has to

366
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,756
provide salience somehow and how this is

367
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:12,884
done. And I don't know that's so

368
00:14:12,922 --> 00:14:14,992
critical for me. I think that that's

369
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:17,924
really at the heart of all of active

370
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:20,084
inference lab, hierarchical structuring

371
00:14:20,212 --> 00:14:20,890
stuff.

372
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,290
All right,

373
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,016
attention coherence here.

374
00:14:33,118 --> 00:14:36,876
Bijan quotes Ocasio and this is like

375
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:40,428
a 2011 paper,

376
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:43,388
I guess, or maybe book, but he puts a

377
00:14:43,394 --> 00:14:48,076
lot of emphasis on Ocasio as one of the

378
00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:50,316
people that his work really rests

379
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,816
strongly upon. So I encourage you to

380
00:14:52,838 --> 00:14:54,352
read the chapter if you want to learn

381
00:14:54,406 --> 00:14:57,056
more or go straight to Ocasio itself.

382
00:14:57,238 --> 00:14:59,492
So he says the introduction of top down

383
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:01,556
and bottom up attentional processes is

384
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:04,624
also implicit in the WIC and Succliffe

385
00:15:04,672 --> 00:15:07,568
concept of the quality of organizational

386
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:10,356
attention and in the rerop analysis of

387
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:12,516
attentional triangulation combining

388
00:15:12,548 --> 00:15:14,648
attentional stability, top down,

389
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:17,224
attentional vividness, bottom up, and

390
00:15:17,262 --> 00:15:20,010
attentional coherence combining both.

391
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,572
And he goes on to say that attention

392
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:25,976
based view cannot explain attentional

393
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,292
coherence. And so getting at what I just

394
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:31,740
was saying about the interaction between

395
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,932
the top down and bottom up and how that

396
00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:36,472
works can be explained in attention

397
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,556
based view. Maybe it can be explained in

398
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:39,984
free energy governance, or we can maybe

399
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,776
get some guidance on how to best do

400
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:44,028
that. Hopefully in the coming chapters

401
00:15:44,124 --> 00:15:45,616
we'll learn more. Do you guys have any

402
00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:46,610
comments here?

403
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,566
Do you want to read these claims for me?

404
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:59,354
Tyler sure. So ABV erroneously

405
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:00,798
treats action as a consequence of

406
00:16:00,804 --> 00:16:03,246
attention and perception. According to

407
00:16:03,348 --> 00:16:05,918
PPF prediction processing framework,

408
00:16:06,014 --> 00:16:07,374
action is determined in circular

409
00:16:07,422 --> 00:16:09,026
causality to stimulate that they pay

410
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:11,506
attention and sense making. While ABV is

411
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:13,074
laying a critical foundation in looking

412
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:15,182
cognition structure, the question arises

413
00:16:15,246 --> 00:16:17,318
whether ABV's attention will need to be

414
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:19,558
redefined as something more granular and

415
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:21,654
practical. So tension not only is too

416
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:24,920
diffused the cognitive concept but also

417
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,794
is hard to meaningfully operationalize

418
00:16:29,842 --> 00:16:32,226
in the context of continuous strategic

419
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:34,314
renewal. So exactly what Bleu was saying

420
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:37,594
on the previous slide ABV explains like

421
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:40,426
okay, I understand why attention being

422
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:42,714
limited shapes the firm's cognition but

423
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,230
what do I even do with that information?

424
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,446
How is that going to be impactful? How

425
00:16:46,468 --> 00:16:49,198
can I model that? And the John is

426
00:16:49,204 --> 00:16:50,954
cleaning like well it's not that useful

427
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:53,618
right now but he's teasing that maybe it

428
00:16:53,624 --> 00:16:55,346
could be with active inference or free

429
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:59,106
energy governance. Yeah what

430
00:16:59,128 --> 00:17:00,706
is that something more granular and

431
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,886
practical? How do we focus attention?

432
00:17:03,998 --> 00:17:07,374
How do we break attention up into sub

433
00:17:07,432 --> 00:17:09,366
components that are more granular and

434
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:13,398
practical? What is in our field of

435
00:17:13,404 --> 00:17:15,638
view or what should be in our field of

436
00:17:15,644 --> 00:17:17,334
view like what we're looking ant what

437
00:17:17,372 --> 00:17:19,194
we're prioritizing and do those things

438
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:21,574
line up? I don't know, I could speculate

439
00:17:21,622 --> 00:17:24,314
all day but it's hard to know really

440
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:26,214
what that more granular and practical

441
00:17:26,342 --> 00:17:29,514
thing might be. One other

442
00:17:29,552 --> 00:17:31,806
quick note on that is there's the

443
00:17:31,828 --> 00:17:34,074
question of coherence and adaptivity.

444
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:36,426
For example, that student answering

445
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,398
their cell phone in the classroom on the

446
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:40,814
previous cartoon that may have certain

447
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,034
dimensions of adaptivity or fulfill

448
00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:46,146
certain preferences of one agent but not

449
00:17:46,168 --> 00:17:47,874
another. And then there's this question

450
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:49,886
of action orientation. And so if we're

451
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:52,594
always in the business of asking about

452
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:54,370
the environment, doing the market

453
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,178
research, not thinking about the

454
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:58,194
strategy, taking this sort of perception

455
00:17:58,242 --> 00:18:00,886
first mindset, there still is the

456
00:18:00,908 --> 00:18:03,734
question of attentional coherence. Are

457
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:05,718
we paying attention and sense making,

458
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:07,206
putting all the pieces together from

459
00:18:07,228 --> 00:18:10,714
what we're perceiving? And also there

460
00:18:10,752 --> 00:18:13,226
is this inactive shift which is

461
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:15,046
incomplete, but it's part of the puzzle

462
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:18,294
which is we want to be having attention,

463
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:21,630
regimes of attention on our action.

464
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,162
And that brings together the embodiments

465
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:28,286
and the inactive view. With the

466
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:31,214
attentional view, which, as brought up,

467
00:18:31,332 --> 00:18:34,430
doesn't really describe what attention

468
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,026
is and still can be mobilized in a

469
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:39,506
passive setting. But together we have

470
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:43,326
this active attention and that Flowers

471
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:45,462
active inference where attention is

472
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:46,710
internal action.

473
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,526
So isn't it like pay attention to what

474
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,086
you're paying attention to? Is that like

475
00:18:54,188 --> 00:18:56,440
a nested little hint there?

476
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,754
Well in live stream 28 we saw a three

477
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:05,002
layer model of attention and

478
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:07,594
there is no single one way to model any

479
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:09,814
cognitive phenomena. It's going to be up

480
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:11,710
to people in different settings to

481
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,258
understand what treatments of attention

482
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:19,150
are insightful or useful or applicable.

483
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,394
I don't know, I think that paying

484
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:24,306
attention to what you're paying

485
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:28,338
attention to kind of gets a

486
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:31,150
lot of attention in the business context

487
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,866
or even in prioritizing your to do

488
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:36,766
lists, right? Are you just like fighting

489
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:38,422
fires all the time or are you making

490
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:41,238
progress to do things going forward?

491
00:19:41,324 --> 00:19:43,078
Making progress on your own goals? So I

492
00:19:43,084 --> 00:19:45,078
think I don't know, that might be a

493
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:48,710
critical governing variable.

494
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,714
Let me read this claim in that regard.

495
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:57,546
Predictive processing framework in the

496
00:19:57,568 --> 00:19:59,798
form of active inference is potentially

497
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,914
a critical complement to and possibly

498
00:20:01,962 --> 00:20:04,542
substitute for the attention base view.

499
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:06,858
Predictive processing framework provides

500
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,606
the concepts and logics that give new

501
00:20:08,628 --> 00:20:10,334
meaning to the linkage of structure and

502
00:20:10,372 --> 00:20:12,678
cognition according to predictive

503
00:20:12,714 --> 00:20:14,766
processing framework. Prediction Models

504
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,978
and Predictions self optimized as a

505
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:19,102
matter of pursuing surprise minimization

506
00:20:19,246 --> 00:20:22,066
by way of free energy minimization it is

507
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:24,302
strictly a priori, not an attention

508
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:26,074
challenge, but a purpose directed

509
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,374
prediction challenge. The evolution of

510
00:20:28,412 --> 00:20:30,166
self driving vehicles provides an

511
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,230
exemplary illustration of this point.

512
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,406
Once the challenge was conceived as a

513
00:20:34,428 --> 00:20:36,034
prediction rather than attention

514
00:20:36,082 --> 00:20:38,154
challenge, the road to perfection is

515
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,026
simply a matter of continuous and

516
00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:42,246
purpose directed prediction error

517
00:20:42,278 --> 00:20:45,466
minimization. And I don't know what is

518
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:48,586
really meant by this. The challenge of

519
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:50,298
self driving was conceived as a

520
00:20:50,304 --> 00:20:52,106
prediction once people predicted that it

521
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:55,878
would happen. I'm not really sure what

522
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:59,326
means here. I could maybe take a stab at

523
00:20:59,348 --> 00:21:01,438
that one because I think what he's

524
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:03,294
saying is that for a self driving car

525
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:04,926
that's the kind of thing that if you

526
00:21:04,948 --> 00:21:06,978
were being using purely linear thinking,

527
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:08,482
only using the things you know already

528
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:11,634
about the world, a self driving car

529
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:13,570
wouldn't be like an obvious next step.

530
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,106
You have to take this leap of faith and

531
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:16,946
action oriented leap of faith just

532
00:21:16,968 --> 00:21:17,926
saying no, we're going to build a self

533
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:19,634
driving car and then once you've decided

534
00:21:19,682 --> 00:21:21,078
that that's your path, you're going to

535
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:23,586
go down. Now it's just like optimization

536
00:21:23,778 --> 00:21:26,998
on that path. And so I think he was

537
00:21:27,164 --> 00:21:29,206
illustrating the inactivist approach of

538
00:21:29,228 --> 00:21:30,834
like hey, a self driving vehicle.

539
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:32,934
There's nothing obvious or self evident

540
00:21:32,982 --> 00:21:35,386
about that needing to happen. But once

541
00:21:35,408 --> 00:21:37,226
you decide it's going to happen, then

542
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:38,940
it's a prediction problem.

543
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,414
Agree there's different readings one

544
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:46,602
way also not knowing this selfdriving

545
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,080
car game.

546
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:53,674
If we were in this passive perception

547
00:21:53,722 --> 00:21:57,280
first world, then there would be

548
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,738
the main issue to resolve would be

549
00:22:00,824 --> 00:22:03,198
understand from noisy sensor readings

550
00:22:03,294 --> 00:22:05,574
where is the location of a person and

551
00:22:05,612 --> 00:22:07,446
producer uncertainty about where the

552
00:22:07,468 --> 00:22:09,960
person is or what that object is.

553
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,974
However, once we see it in terms of this

554
00:22:14,012 --> 00:22:15,522
continuous purpose directed

555
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:17,558
predictionary minimization, we're going

556
00:22:17,564 --> 00:22:21,050
to center the role of action, gas break

557
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,006
and turning and a few other affordances

558
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:26,810
that cars have. So instead of going for

559
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,206
all the decimal points on whether that's

560
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:31,710
a person or a mailbox or a cone,

561
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,022
what does it look like to take this

562
00:22:35,076 --> 00:22:38,318
unfolding action oriented view where

563
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:40,138
you're aligning with your preferences?

564
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,538
For example, not to cause harm to people

565
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:45,554
and then lesser priority not to cause

566
00:22:45,592 --> 00:22:48,290
harm to objects. Maybe steering away

567
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,282
from that object. You can have a good

568
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,986
policy posterior on it's, a good and

569
00:22:54,008 --> 00:22:56,918
likely action without having all the

570
00:22:56,924 --> 00:22:58,566
decimals of precision about the

571
00:22:58,588 --> 00:23:01,798
environment. So once we understand how

572
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:05,234
essential action is to the self driving

573
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:08,986
car, it reframes what we have to do with

574
00:23:09,008 --> 00:23:12,214
the sensor data and it centralizes

575
00:23:12,262 --> 00:23:14,330
the relevance of the strategy.

576
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,524
Yeah, I do remember something about some

577
00:23:21,562 --> 00:23:24,308
change in self driving in the sensor

578
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:28,410
system. So maybe that references the

579
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,616
attention versus prediction problem or

580
00:23:32,638 --> 00:23:34,216
maybe that's being referred to

581
00:23:34,238 --> 00:23:36,090
internally in there. Not sure.

582
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,920
Okay, so that sums up the attention

583
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,964
based view section. And we're moving in

584
00:23:44,002 --> 00:23:46,620
now to the enactivism approach.

585
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,560
So this is at the start of the chapter.

586
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,880
The Dean quotes Thompson 2007 and

587
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,456
says the organism's environment is the

588
00:23:59,478 --> 00:24:01,684
sense it makes of the world. The

589
00:24:01,722 --> 00:24:03,584
environment is a place of significance

590
00:24:03,632 --> 00:24:05,824
and valence as a result of the Global

591
00:24:05,872 --> 00:24:08,692
action of the organism. So again,

592
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:10,528
taking this like action centric

593
00:24:10,624 --> 00:24:13,316
perspective and he quotes Ramstead at

594
00:24:13,338 --> 00:24:15,656
Alice 2020 by saying active coherence is

595
00:24:15,678 --> 00:24:17,624
an active inference. And he says,

596
00:24:17,662 --> 00:24:19,736
indeed, the essential question is how

597
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,976
the firm brings forth significance and

598
00:24:21,998 --> 00:24:24,456
valence that does not preexist, but is

599
00:24:24,478 --> 00:24:26,620
the result of action centric and

600
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,668
socially constructed engagement with the

601
00:24:28,674 --> 00:24:30,904
outer world equivalent to internally

602
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:33,048
assigning probabilities to the external

603
00:24:33,144 --> 00:24:35,708
hidden unknown states in the form of a

604
00:24:35,714 --> 00:24:38,064
Markov blanket? This revealing of

605
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:40,448
significance and valence then lays the

606
00:24:40,454 --> 00:24:42,684
foundation for generating shared meaning

607
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,376
and shared expectations in the form of

608
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:47,276
unique interpretation models, belief

609
00:24:47,308 --> 00:24:50,388
systems underlying firm performance and

610
00:24:50,474 --> 00:24:51,460
survival.

611
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,876
We can go on to see what else he says.

612
00:24:59,978 --> 00:25:03,460
So he makes the claim. Daft and Week

613
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,384
1984 differentiate between environment

614
00:25:06,432 --> 00:25:08,276
driven and interpretation driven

615
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:11,416
approaches to strategy making. And in

616
00:25:11,438 --> 00:25:13,684
this big quote, they say in environment

617
00:25:13,732 --> 00:25:16,156
driven frames, top managers experience

618
00:25:16,258 --> 00:25:18,524
environments as concrete, hard,

619
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,276
measurable and determinant on the other.

620
00:25:21,298 --> 00:25:23,704
And top managers of firms confronting

621
00:25:23,752 --> 00:25:25,784
more unstable or unanalyzable

622
00:25:25,832 --> 00:25:28,060
environments are thought to construct,

623
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,124
coerce or enact a reasonable

624
00:25:30,172 --> 00:25:32,316
interpretation that makes previous

625
00:25:32,428 --> 00:25:35,824
actions sensible. Thus they attempt to

626
00:25:35,862 --> 00:25:37,264
construct their environments through

627
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,164
their strategies, rather than developing

628
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:41,392
strategies in response to environments,

629
00:25:41,536 --> 00:25:43,568
resulting in strategy, environment

630
00:25:43,664 --> 00:25:47,124
beliefs or proactive logics. And he also

631
00:25:47,162 --> 00:25:49,316
says, despite Wick's strong influence on

632
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:51,124
strategic management research, to this

633
00:25:51,162 --> 00:25:53,284
day, the environment driven approach

634
00:25:53,332 --> 00:25:57,224
remains dominant. So I think that this

635
00:25:57,262 --> 00:25:59,364
is like one of the central themes that's

636
00:25:59,412 --> 00:26:02,730
emerging in the book is that

637
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,444
the environment is somewhere out there.

638
00:26:05,502 --> 00:26:08,316
It's some very real thing. It's taken to

639
00:26:08,338 --> 00:26:10,572
be like, it is this way, it's always

640
00:26:10,626 --> 00:26:11,950
going to be this way.

641
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,228
And kind of something that Daniel and I

642
00:26:17,234 --> 00:26:19,244
have talked about at length, like the

643
00:26:19,282 --> 00:26:22,612
niche as responding to the organism.

644
00:26:22,696 --> 00:26:24,176
The niche responds to the organism just

645
00:26:24,198 --> 00:26:25,808
as much as the organism responds to the

646
00:26:25,814 --> 00:26:27,788
niche. And whether or not the niche

647
00:26:27,804 --> 00:26:29,328
includes other organisms in the

648
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:31,056
environment or not is kind of irrelevant

649
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:32,356
when we have things like books and

650
00:26:32,378 --> 00:26:36,052
smartphones. So this environment is

651
00:26:36,106 --> 00:26:38,724
changing and it's changing maybe so fast

652
00:26:38,762 --> 00:26:40,928
and so much that this environment driven

653
00:26:41,104 --> 00:26:44,324
framework is perhaps not effective.

654
00:26:44,452 --> 00:26:47,860
So unstable or unanalyzable environments

655
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,724
is maybe like this discontinuous

656
00:26:50,772 --> 00:26:52,810
environment that Bijan speaks of,

657
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,568
because the environment is changing

658
00:26:55,604 --> 00:26:57,724
fast, like maybe faster than it's ever

659
00:26:57,762 --> 00:26:59,576
changed before, because of our Global

660
00:26:59,608 --> 00:27:02,316
connectivity and many other reasons. So

661
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:05,512
now maybe all environments are unstable

662
00:27:05,576 --> 00:27:07,932
or unanalyzable or more unpredictable

663
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:10,530
than they've been before. So that this

664
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,836
constant update or attempt to attempting

665
00:27:15,948 --> 00:27:18,370
to construct the niche rather than

666
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,004
viewing it as something stable is maybe

667
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:25,508
more important for firm persistence. Do

668
00:27:25,514 --> 00:27:28,228
you guys have any comments here? Yeah,

669
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,324
I just think on the second half of that

670
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:32,176
of very unstable and uninsurable

671
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:34,168
environments that really resonates in a

672
00:27:34,174 --> 00:27:36,904
startup context where a lot of times

673
00:27:36,942 --> 00:27:38,648
startup fanners will have no pretense of

674
00:27:38,654 --> 00:27:40,136
knowing anything that's going on in the

675
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:44,136
environment. They're very

676
00:27:44,158 --> 00:27:45,448
clear about their ignorance of the

677
00:27:45,454 --> 00:27:47,144
world. Instead they run small

678
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:49,096
experiments to kind of gauge what's

679
00:27:49,128 --> 00:27:52,124
going on in the external world and then

680
00:27:52,162 --> 00:27:53,436
kind of construct the worldview from

681
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:54,908
there. Rather than saying hey, we have

682
00:27:54,914 --> 00:27:57,176
this great business idea, let's scale

683
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,856
this thing. It's more like hey, let's

684
00:27:58,888 --> 00:28:01,088
discover who our users are. Which I

685
00:28:01,094 --> 00:28:04,588
think really corresponds

686
00:28:04,604 --> 00:28:06,400
well with that second half the quarter.

687
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,400
Also with our classical temperature

688
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,396
examples. Let's just say that we were in

689
00:28:13,418 --> 00:28:15,860
a house and there was a heating element.

690
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,124
If we think that over the timescale of

691
00:28:19,162 --> 00:28:20,596
days things agent going to change that

692
00:28:20,618 --> 00:28:23,536
much, we might look towards a strategy

693
00:28:23,648 --> 00:28:25,576
of turning on and off the heater. So

694
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:27,332
dealing with the environment variability

695
00:28:27,396 --> 00:28:30,676
in the niche we're in. Whereas if we're

696
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,144
in an open space so there's no point in

697
00:28:33,182 --> 00:28:35,396
having any strategy of trying to heat

698
00:28:35,428 --> 00:28:37,468
the local air because it's just going to

699
00:28:37,474 --> 00:28:39,948
get blown away in the next second. Then

700
00:28:40,114 --> 00:28:42,604
you might center decision making around

701
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:45,516
finding a warmer location. And so when

702
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:48,652
there's a more stable environment then

703
00:28:48,786 --> 00:28:50,364
it puts us into a mode of like

704
00:28:50,402 --> 00:28:52,776
understanding the variability patterns,

705
00:28:52,808 --> 00:28:54,604
the circadian patterns and temperature

706
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,576
and responding with what we have or

707
00:28:56,598 --> 00:28:58,204
maybe inventing something new to respond

708
00:28:58,252 --> 00:29:00,656
to those regularities. But when there's

709
00:29:00,688 --> 00:29:03,600
the discontinuous and complex

710
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,956
environmental settings that this work is

711
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:09,236
focused on, it centers this kind of

712
00:29:09,338 --> 00:29:12,220
creating one's own niche through action,

713
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,896
not just modifying it more locally to do

714
00:29:15,918 --> 00:29:17,050
the best one can.

715
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:24,346
Cool. Tyler, do you want to read this

716
00:29:24,368 --> 00:29:27,114
claim? Do you mind? Sure. So every

717
00:29:27,152 --> 00:29:28,826
organization chooses kind holding a

718
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:29,966
light porch in the darkness which

719
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:31,626
environmental significance to act upon

720
00:29:31,658 --> 00:29:33,546
and to attend to, whatever the torch

721
00:29:33,578 --> 00:29:34,926
highlights is equivalent to breaking a

722
00:29:34,948 --> 00:29:36,702
quantum wave of probabilities, moving

723
00:29:36,756 --> 00:29:38,506
from superposition to reality,

724
00:29:38,618 --> 00:29:40,798
intermediated by the markup blanket. In

725
00:29:40,804 --> 00:29:42,126
this regard, strategy research is

726
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:46,174
challenged to be less mechanistically

727
00:29:46,222 --> 00:29:48,386
determined environment to strategy, but

728
00:29:48,408 --> 00:29:50,558
more quantum strategy to environment.

729
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:52,706
The quantum world is more tenuous than

730
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:54,306
the one imagined. And this is actually a

731
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:56,690
quote from Cerritelli. This is not Sean.

732
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,598
The quantum world is more tenuous than

733
00:29:58,604 --> 00:30:00,694
the one imagined by old physics. It is

734
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,354
made up of happenings get discontinuous

735
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:04,406
events without permanence. There's a

736
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:06,934
world of fine texture, intricate and

737
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,842
fragile as Venetian lace. Every

738
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,714
interaction is an event and it is these

739
00:30:10,752 --> 00:30:12,406
light and ephemeral events that weave

740
00:30:12,438 --> 00:30:14,246
reality not the heavy objects charged

741
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:15,706
with absolute properties and our

742
00:30:15,728 --> 00:30:17,386
philosophy positive in support of these

743
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:18,170
events.

744
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,618
Cool, thanks. So Bijan

745
00:30:25,654 --> 00:30:27,646
goes on to say and I think we'll come

746
00:30:27,668 --> 00:30:31,106
back to this quantum because I have some

747
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:32,466
questions here. So we'll come back to

748
00:30:32,488 --> 00:30:34,706
this at the closer to the end of this

749
00:30:34,728 --> 00:30:38,242
section, but right now let's read this

750
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:41,374
claim. Bijan says the critical

751
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:45,394
consideration is how an organism sorry,

752
00:30:45,432 --> 00:30:47,582
too much biology. How an organization

753
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:50,358
transmorphs the sensing and sense making

754
00:30:50,444 --> 00:30:52,342
activity at the individual level.

755
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,750
Hinton a firm's institutionalized

756
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,146
environmental enactment as a basis for

757
00:30:57,168 --> 00:31:00,070
continuum strategic renewal. Enactment

758
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,426
is essentially an interactive and

759
00:31:02,448 --> 00:31:04,454
generative social learning sensemaking

760
00:31:04,502 --> 00:31:08,186
process, hence active inference. Dong et

761
00:31:08,218 --> 00:31:10,634
al. Elegantly addressed this micro macro

762
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:13,674
dichotomy. They say, While hypothesis

763
00:31:13,722 --> 00:31:15,706
setting is an individual activity,

764
00:31:15,818 --> 00:31:18,266
hypothesis testing is an organizational

765
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:21,486
activity. According to Smirchich and

766
00:31:21,508 --> 00:31:24,254
Stubborn, organization members actively

767
00:31:24,302 --> 00:31:26,482
form enact their environments through

768
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:28,706
social interaction. A pattern of

769
00:31:28,728 --> 00:31:30,706
enactment establishes the foundation of

770
00:31:30,728 --> 00:31:33,414
organizational reality and in turn has

771
00:31:33,452 --> 00:31:35,762
effects in shaping future enactments.

772
00:31:35,906 --> 00:31:37,846
The task of strategic management, in

773
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:40,294
this view is organization making to

774
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:42,386
create and maintain systems of shared

775
00:31:42,418 --> 00:31:45,350
meaning that facilitate organized

776
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:48,054
action. Do you guys have any comments

777
00:31:48,102 --> 00:31:51,930
here? One thought

778
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,638
I'm imagining a fleet of boats,

779
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:58,166
the upper etchelon. View and the board

780
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,582
of directors specifically. They may not

781
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:03,546
need to be concerned with the minutiae

782
00:32:03,578 --> 00:32:05,946
of move the wheel left, move the wheel

783
00:32:05,978 --> 00:32:08,240
right on this boat at that time,

784
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,210
but they are, as it says here,

785
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,986
the task of strategic management in this

786
00:32:14,008 --> 00:32:17,620
view is organization making. So that

787
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,894
justifies some of this upper etchelon.

788
00:32:20,942 --> 00:32:23,382
Focus. It's not coming, I don't think,

789
00:32:23,436 --> 00:32:26,690
from a place of elitism or chauvinism

790
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,426
about those upper management groups,

791
00:32:29,538 --> 00:32:33,126
but it's especially targeting to those

792
00:32:33,228 --> 00:32:35,722
who are in a cognition to be involved in

793
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:37,926
organization making, which isn't

794
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:41,434
steering the boat. But allowing the

795
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,186
agency and enactment to happen in the

796
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:48,014
front line requires those not

797
00:32:48,052 --> 00:32:51,806
in the front line to take the view that

798
00:32:51,828 --> 00:32:55,742
is being promoted here rather

799
00:32:55,796 --> 00:32:57,102
than just imagine if we had enough

800
00:32:57,156 --> 00:32:59,454
sensors on enough boats. We could have

801
00:32:59,492 --> 00:33:01,006
all of them viewed up in front of us.

802
00:33:01,028 --> 00:33:02,946
And then we could call out who should

803
00:33:02,968 --> 00:33:04,660
turn left and who should turn right.

804
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,006
With the three to eight board meetings

805
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:09,474
per year, it's not going to happen. So

806
00:33:09,512 --> 00:33:12,418
what is the organization making that

807
00:33:12,584 --> 00:33:14,920
responds to that look like?

808
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,644
I'm kind of curious about what you just

809
00:33:21,682 --> 00:33:23,516
said because something I've been

810
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:24,764
wondering about through this whole book

811
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,264
is whether a board is really necessary

812
00:33:26,312 --> 00:33:27,676
for that meeting making or whether that

813
00:33:27,698 --> 00:33:29,710
can be done in a more distributed way.

814
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,448
And I think Dean touched on this a

815
00:33:32,454 --> 00:33:33,744
little bit in our last call with him

816
00:33:33,782 --> 00:33:36,464
saying that, well, this is their job.

817
00:33:36,662 --> 00:33:38,576
The board's job specifically is to be

818
00:33:38,598 --> 00:33:39,456
able to distinctions from the

819
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:41,136
conversation. So they're in this unique

820
00:33:41,168 --> 00:33:43,556
position to really build meaning and

821
00:33:43,578 --> 00:33:45,156
create sense making and dislocate that

822
00:33:45,178 --> 00:33:47,620
process. But I'm wondering if it's

823
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,516
actually necessary for. That to happen

824
00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:52,804
because it does strike me as a very top

825
00:33:52,842 --> 00:33:54,988
down. Like, imposing a sensemaking

826
00:33:55,024 --> 00:33:57,496
framework on an organization is a ton of

827
00:33:57,518 --> 00:34:00,628
power and it does very much constrain

828
00:34:00,644 --> 00:34:02,036
the cognitive abilities of the larger

829
00:34:02,068 --> 00:34:06,116
organization. And it strikes

830
00:34:06,148 --> 00:34:07,548
me just on this simple reading of it

831
00:34:07,554 --> 00:34:09,196
that maybe something is missing from

832
00:34:09,218 --> 00:34:11,084
that or maybe a potential other way

833
00:34:11,122 --> 00:34:13,084
forward that is less top down is

834
00:34:13,122 --> 00:34:14,012
possible. But I'm probably

835
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:16,176
misunderstanding the John as well. So

836
00:34:16,198 --> 00:34:19,296
I'm curious what you all think. It'll be

837
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:22,348
so fun to explore, but let's

838
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:24,044
just say that the task of strategic

839
00:34:24,092 --> 00:34:26,210
management is organization making.

840
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,276
Maybe this is a saddle point view

841
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,852
that everybody can get on board with,

842
00:34:32,986 --> 00:34:35,584
but then we go great upper management's

843
00:34:35,632 --> 00:34:37,488
role and function was organization

844
00:34:37,584 --> 00:34:40,676
making and now everyone has access to

845
00:34:40,698 --> 00:34:44,340
the tools and at least view or comment

846
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,340
access to the process of organization

847
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,600
making. So trans

848
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,836
morphing the understanding of what the

849
00:34:55,858 --> 00:34:59,276
upper, etchelon. Does in terms of

850
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:02,056
organization making. So just double

851
00:35:02,088 --> 00:35:03,756
checking, you're not involved in

852
00:35:03,778 --> 00:35:05,564
steering the ship, you're involved in

853
00:35:05,602 --> 00:35:07,084
organization making and action

854
00:35:07,132 --> 00:35:10,768
orientation. And then

855
00:35:10,854 --> 00:35:15,728
perhaps that function could be taken

856
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:19,872
on by another organizational

857
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:23,444
structure with that as

858
00:35:23,482 --> 00:35:25,664
its focus or that could be an emergent

859
00:35:25,712 --> 00:35:29,440
functionality of other organizational

860
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,440
units. But it's really hard to go from

861
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:36,296
vision coming from the top to simply a

862
00:35:36,318 --> 00:35:38,904
vision that's coherent arising from the

863
00:35:38,942 --> 00:35:41,016
bottom and from the outside. And so

864
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,952
there's an intermediate view that

865
00:35:43,006 --> 00:35:45,500
qualifies the conversation differently.

866
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,324
Yeah, I think that makes sense. I think

867
00:35:49,362 --> 00:35:52,844
we have observed that sense making

868
00:35:52,882 --> 00:35:54,188
happening both in the bottom and the

869
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,870
top, and especially in tech companies

870
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,848
where you will have a board and they are

871
00:35:58,854 --> 00:36:01,696
making top down decisions. But you will

872
00:36:01,718 --> 00:36:04,448
also have consultants almost embedded at

873
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:06,416
each level of the hierarchy who do that

874
00:36:06,438 --> 00:36:07,728
sense making at every level of the

875
00:36:07,734 --> 00:36:10,144
hierarchy and bubble that up also to the

876
00:36:10,182 --> 00:36:12,676
top. So I think it does exist where you

877
00:36:12,698 --> 00:36:15,088
kind of have it's not purely sensemaking

878
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:17,190
happening at the board or TMT level.

879
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,644
So I just want to point out the first

880
00:36:20,682 --> 00:36:22,464
sentence here and it really resonates

881
00:36:22,512 --> 00:36:23,988
with what you just said, Tyler. Like the

882
00:36:23,994 --> 00:36:25,544
way that I've been reading this, he says

883
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:27,384
the critical consideration is how an

884
00:36:27,422 --> 00:36:29,816
organization transmorphs the sensing and

885
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:31,096
sense making activity, ant the

886
00:36:31,118 --> 00:36:32,820
individual level into a firm

887
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,524
institutionalized environment enactment

888
00:36:35,572 --> 00:36:37,268
as a basis for continuous strategic

889
00:36:37,284 --> 00:36:38,680
renewal. Like what? I took that

890
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,484
individual level as the very bottom up

891
00:36:41,522 --> 00:36:44,460
thing because it's like each little

892
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:48,396
worker ant right in the colony. I took

893
00:36:48,418 --> 00:36:49,776
that as like a very bottom up and

894
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:51,344
distributed thing. Like how do you take

895
00:36:51,382 --> 00:36:53,584
that and turn it into some kind of

896
00:36:53,622 --> 00:36:55,616
collective sense making? But really that

897
00:36:55,638 --> 00:36:57,970
could also be like there's an individual

898
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,556
level at the top. Like each board of

899
00:37:01,578 --> 00:37:03,316
directors is selected for their

900
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:05,796
different expertise, right? So like you

901
00:37:05,818 --> 00:37:07,428
have a variety, I mean, ideally you have

902
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:08,548
a variety of different views and

903
00:37:08,554 --> 00:37:10,532
perspectives at the board level and then

904
00:37:10,586 --> 00:37:13,076
how do those individuals translate their

905
00:37:13,178 --> 00:37:15,736
sensemaking into something that the

906
00:37:15,758 --> 00:37:19,416
institution can then act upon? So I

907
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:21,800
think that is a very rings very true

908
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,444
that this individual sensing and sense

909
00:37:24,482 --> 00:37:26,908
making is happening at the top and at

910
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:30,190
the bottom. I think that rings true.

911
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,832
I just want to draw one distinction

912
00:37:33,896 --> 00:37:36,316
based on some experience of doing the

913
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:38,188
top down sense making. So I was a

914
00:37:38,274 --> 00:37:40,348
strategy consultant for a while, and a

915
00:37:40,354 --> 00:37:41,890
lot of times you would do the top down

916
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,048
sense making where you would talk to all

917
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:45,936
levels of the hierarchy and you kind of

918
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:47,584
act as the board. In that situation and

919
00:37:47,622 --> 00:37:49,632
kind of bubble up all of this

920
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:52,832
information into a top level idea

921
00:37:52,886 --> 00:37:53,828
about what's happening in the

922
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:55,684
organization, what the narrative is and

923
00:37:55,722 --> 00:37:57,268
what actions they should take. So it's

924
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:58,916
like very top down structured, but

925
00:37:58,938 --> 00:38:00,404
there's like other models of doing this

926
00:38:00,442 --> 00:38:02,404
where each node in the organization is

927
00:38:02,442 --> 00:38:04,644
more or less operating independently and

928
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:07,496
sense making it dependently, whereas the

929
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,816
top down structure isn't as important.

930
00:38:09,918 --> 00:38:11,224
And maybe you're saying the same thing,

931
00:38:11,262 --> 00:38:12,536
but it Atreides me as like a little bit

932
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:14,756
different, where sense making isn't

933
00:38:14,788 --> 00:38:16,164
happening through a bubble up process,

934
00:38:16,222 --> 00:38:17,580
through a pyramid, but rather happening

935
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,812
in like a web in a mesh. And that

936
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:22,460
strikes me as like an important

937
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,372
difference. But maybe Bijan is saying

938
00:38:25,426 --> 00:38:26,850
the same thing. I'm not sure.

939
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,792
It's hard to know. And it's hard to also

940
00:38:31,846 --> 00:38:35,376
know how when you

941
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:38,288
have like even at a single layer of the

942
00:38:38,294 --> 00:38:41,830
hierarchy, like you have 25 people and

943
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,892
twelve of them think one thing and 13 of

944
00:38:45,946 --> 00:38:48,932
them think another thing. How do you

945
00:38:49,066 --> 00:38:50,996
make sense of that where there's this

946
00:38:51,018 --> 00:38:53,252
like opposing viewpoint? How do you

947
00:38:53,306 --> 00:38:56,664
collectively get buy in to proceed with

948
00:38:56,782 --> 00:38:59,624
either strategy A or strategy B even at

949
00:38:59,662 --> 00:39:01,816
a single level and then pass that

950
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:03,592
information up or down without like,

951
00:39:03,646 --> 00:39:05,256
well, I wanted it to be this way or I

952
00:39:05,278 --> 00:39:07,976
wanted the people going like the

953
00:39:07,998 --> 00:39:09,816
opposing view, like whatever wins,

954
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,190
right? Like in a vote the 13 would win

955
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,684
if that's the way that it's run or maybe

956
00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:16,488
there's weighted voting or who knows,

957
00:39:16,584 --> 00:39:19,520
however a firm would structure itself.

958
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,264
But it's really important, I think,

959
00:39:23,302 --> 00:39:26,352
to get strategy buy in from everyone,

960
00:39:26,486 --> 00:39:29,232
at least hear all of the points in order

961
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:32,496
to proceed and have

962
00:39:32,598 --> 00:39:35,364
the viewpoint adopted widely and get

963
00:39:35,402 --> 00:39:37,328
people to get behind it. So I don't

964
00:39:37,344 --> 00:39:39,924
know, it's a hard, weird thing to think

965
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:41,636
about how that information is passed up

966
00:39:41,658 --> 00:39:43,220
or down in the hierarchy.

967
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,584
All right, Tyler, do you have something

968
00:39:48,622 --> 00:39:50,824
to add? Well, I was just going to add

969
00:39:50,862 --> 00:39:53,336
that this is a really important point.

970
00:39:53,438 --> 00:39:54,848
I'm not just trying to be like pedantic

971
00:39:54,884 --> 00:39:56,924
about it. Actually, a lot of

972
00:39:57,122 --> 00:40:00,604
organizational strategy debates hinge on

973
00:40:00,642 --> 00:40:03,244
this of whether really you can do sense

974
00:40:03,282 --> 00:40:05,576
making in a hierarchical way. It's

975
00:40:05,608 --> 00:40:07,324
really like a pyramid or like a more

976
00:40:07,362 --> 00:40:09,276
mesh network. So the mesh networks are

977
00:40:09,298 --> 00:40:10,496
more like teal organizations or

978
00:40:10,518 --> 00:40:12,752
hilocracies. And this is a very

979
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:15,456
contentious point, and I was hoping that

980
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:17,808
we could figure it out head on or

981
00:40:17,894 --> 00:40:19,696
understand the genre's perspective on

982
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:22,624
it. And I think he thinks both are

983
00:40:22,662 --> 00:40:23,956
possible because I think he's hinted at

984
00:40:23,978 --> 00:40:25,236
that in the previous live streams, but

985
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:29,110
he hasn't said it super clearly so far.

986
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,344
But something I've been very eagerly

987
00:40:31,392 --> 00:40:33,600
waiting for him to spell out clearly.

988
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,236
So maybe he'll get to it in the next

989
00:40:35,258 --> 00:40:37,824
chapters. So, Tyler, I have a request.

990
00:40:37,872 --> 00:40:39,368
Like, in the next Livestream, you have

991
00:40:39,374 --> 00:40:41,672
to put in like a slide on Holocaust and

992
00:40:41,726 --> 00:40:43,336
explain that to us in a very, like,

993
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,664
break it all down, break down all these

994
00:40:44,702 --> 00:40:47,036
different strategies for us because you

995
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:49,740
have that expertise and I'm lost. So

996
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:53,052
there's my special request. Okay,

997
00:40:53,106 --> 00:40:54,908
awesome. I've just been in lots of

998
00:40:54,914 --> 00:40:56,888
debates, even within especially in Dows,

999
00:40:56,904 --> 00:40:58,344
where they try to do the mesh network

1000
00:40:58,392 --> 00:41:01,244
version of things, not the pyramid, and

1001
00:41:01,282 --> 00:41:02,384
a lot of times just like a total

1002
00:41:02,422 --> 00:41:04,160
disaster and it doesn't work. But

1003
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,728
there's always this dream, especially in

1004
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:07,424
Dazzling, oh, could this be possible?

1005
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:08,976
Do you actually need the hierarchy at

1006
00:41:08,998 --> 00:41:11,104
all? Can this work more like a spider

1007
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:12,900
web rather than the pyramid?

1008
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,816
And this whole book, I've been waiting

1009
00:41:16,848 --> 00:41:18,496
for the answer to that. So I'm excited

1010
00:41:18,528 --> 00:41:21,572
to ask the Dean. Yeah,

1011
00:41:21,706 --> 00:41:25,000
and also just getting these dimensions

1012
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,064
sketched, because what if it's like,

1013
00:41:29,102 --> 00:41:31,284
well, yeah, we can have a slime mold,

1014
00:41:31,412 --> 00:41:34,232
but then we may split a lot and not all

1015
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:36,408
the things that split off may survive.

1016
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:39,196
If that is tolerable or preferable to

1017
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:42,444
you. Slime mold it is. But if we all

1018
00:41:42,482 --> 00:41:46,204
want to ride or die together, then this

1019
00:41:46,242 --> 00:41:48,800
kind of a structure is what we want. So

1020
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,764
making sure that there's like, consent

1021
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:53,408
and transparency around what people are

1022
00:41:53,494 --> 00:41:56,336
wanting to be in, because also in sort

1023
00:41:56,358 --> 00:42:00,016
of emergent online 2020s eras teams and

1024
00:42:00,038 --> 00:42:02,308
Dows, it's like, are we hanging out in

1025
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:04,836
the group chat? Are we building a

1026
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:06,356
product that's going to change the

1027
00:42:06,378 --> 00:42:08,532
information environment? Are we learning

1028
00:42:08,586 --> 00:42:11,012
about other projects? Are we learning

1029
00:42:11,066 --> 00:42:13,688
about other early projects to invest in?

1030
00:42:13,854 --> 00:42:17,336
It can move very rapidly amongst those

1031
00:42:17,438 --> 00:42:21,544
spaces, and at the risk of trying

1032
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:23,880
to capture four birds and getting none,

1033
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,564
there's all these other failure modes.

1034
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:28,044
But maybe, again, that's what those

1035
00:42:28,082 --> 00:42:30,796
people wanted to do in that blanket at

1036
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:32,604
that time. But when you have

1037
00:42:32,642 --> 00:42:35,036
shareholders and a board and there are

1038
00:42:35,058 --> 00:42:36,236
some responsibilities that come into

1039
00:42:36,258 --> 00:42:40,112
play and these sort of okay to fail or

1040
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:43,520
okay to sunset experiments in online

1041
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:46,720
organization hopefully can reveal

1042
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,204
empirical patterns that we use to

1043
00:42:50,262 --> 00:42:53,060
carry forward organizational technique.

1044
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,396
Yeah. My read so far on what Dean is

1045
00:42:57,418 --> 00:42:59,220
doing is that he's saying, like, yes,

1046
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:02,068
sure, a slide mold organization is a

1047
00:43:02,074 --> 00:43:03,648
thing you could conceive of, and that's

1048
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,808
a valid way of thinking about an

1049
00:43:04,814 --> 00:43:06,244
organization. But he's specifically

1050
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:09,368
thinking about the legal context that a

1051
00:43:09,374 --> 00:43:11,384
lot of organizations live in. Today and

1052
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,504
making active coherence or free energy

1053
00:43:14,542 --> 00:43:16,624
governance work for those organizations

1054
00:43:16,692 --> 00:43:18,716
the world that we live in. So I'm not

1055
00:43:18,738 --> 00:43:20,270
sure if that resonates with you guys.

1056
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,912
Okay, nice debate.

1057
00:43:28,056 --> 00:43:30,348
Tangential. I don't know. Information

1058
00:43:30,434 --> 00:43:34,084
dive. All right, so Bijan

1059
00:43:34,152 --> 00:43:35,600
makes this point and he says

1060
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,632
organizations are challenged to better

1061
00:43:37,686 --> 00:43:40,000
distinguish how their actions differ

1062
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,092
from those of others as they construct

1063
00:43:42,156 --> 00:43:45,972
eco niches. And he really kind of

1064
00:43:46,026 --> 00:43:49,732
gives this like, a lot of

1065
00:43:49,786 --> 00:43:51,316
background information. But I just

1066
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:52,692
pulled these two quotes about

1067
00:43:52,826 --> 00:43:54,708
distinguishing self from other, like how

1068
00:43:54,714 --> 00:43:56,184
do you distinguish what is me and what

1069
00:43:56,222 --> 00:43:59,192
is you? And also about how do you sense

1070
00:43:59,246 --> 00:44:01,896
make like, help others see what's in

1071
00:44:01,918 --> 00:44:05,112
your head in talking about these things?

1072
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:06,776
He gives two examples which I thought

1073
00:44:06,798 --> 00:44:08,088
were really cool from biology, so I

1074
00:44:08,094 --> 00:44:10,648
wanted to read them. He quotes Godfrey

1075
00:44:10,664 --> 00:44:13,032
Smith 2016 and says, whenever a fish

1076
00:44:13,096 --> 00:44:15,772
emits a pulse, it also sends a copy of

1077
00:44:15,826 --> 00:44:17,496
the command around to the sensing

1078
00:44:17,528 --> 00:44:19,516
system, enabling that system to

1079
00:44:19,538 --> 00:44:21,116
counteract the effect of the pulse it

1080
00:44:21,138 --> 00:44:23,824
has produced. The fish is tracking and

1081
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:25,712
registering the distinction between self

1082
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:27,776
and other, between the effects on its

1083
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,984
senses of its own actions and the

1084
00:44:30,022 --> 00:44:32,384
effects of events going on around it.

1085
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:36,116
And then he also goes on to say, to use

1086
00:44:36,138 --> 00:44:37,904
the example of sharks, he says sharks.

1087
00:44:37,952 --> 00:44:40,756
He quotes Lanza at Align 2020 Paper. He

1088
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:43,168
says sharks have organs called Lorenzini

1089
00:44:43,184 --> 00:44:45,680
Blisters, which sense electrical Fields.

1090
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,608
Dolphins and tooth whales, for example,

1091
00:44:47,694 --> 00:44:49,588
benefit from echolocation abilities

1092
00:44:49,684 --> 00:44:52,072
whose sound pulses can penetrate soft

1093
00:44:52,126 --> 00:44:54,072
tissue to provide them with an Xray like

1094
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:56,920
mental image of the objects of interest.

1095
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,096
In order to tell the other dolphins what

1096
00:44:59,118 --> 00:45:00,540
they have discovered, they actually

1097
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,444
create a visual picture of what they

1098
00:45:02,482 --> 00:45:05,384
just saw in the minds of other dolphins.

1099
00:45:05,512 --> 00:45:08,396
So I didn't put a full explanation of

1100
00:45:08,418 --> 00:45:09,484
echolocation because it gets

1101
00:45:09,522 --> 00:45:11,928
complicated. But here's this dolphin and

1102
00:45:11,954 --> 00:45:13,564
it sends out these exploration rays.

1103
00:45:13,612 --> 00:45:16,652
And if something is in its echolocation

1104
00:45:16,716 --> 00:45:18,112
site, because it's not really site,

1105
00:45:18,166 --> 00:45:20,496
right? But if something sees it, then

1106
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:24,400
the arrays that are reflected back are

1107
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:26,320
molded around. So you can imagine

1108
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,436
ripples through water. So they mold

1109
00:45:29,468 --> 00:45:31,684
around like a rock or a stream. And so

1110
00:45:31,722 --> 00:45:33,716
what comes back is actually like a

1111
00:45:33,738 --> 00:45:37,152
physical ripple picture of the rock

1112
00:45:37,216 --> 00:45:39,096
or whatever it's seeing. And so it can

1113
00:45:39,118 --> 00:45:41,176
actually then modify its own

1114
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:44,296
echolocation sounds to give a picture of

1115
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:45,736
the rock to someone else, which I think

1116
00:45:45,758 --> 00:45:48,276
is so cool, right? Like to a dolphin

1117
00:45:48,308 --> 00:45:50,556
friend, not like someone else, because I

1118
00:45:50,578 --> 00:45:52,344
couldn't see a ripple picture of a rock,

1119
00:45:52,392 --> 00:45:54,270
but maybe its dolphin friends could.

1120
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,212
Anyway, I think that that is a neat idea

1121
00:45:57,266 --> 00:46:00,876
of how we always ask people like,

1122
00:46:00,898 --> 00:46:02,224
do you Andersen me? Do you know what I

1123
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:04,796
mean? Do you really know? But it's

1124
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:07,152
really hard to know perceptually what

1125
00:46:07,206 --> 00:46:09,136
someone else is, what's behind their

1126
00:46:09,158 --> 00:46:11,340
markup blanket, right? Do you guys have

1127
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:15,236
anything to add here? Sorry, I'm just

1128
00:46:15,258 --> 00:46:17,024
the one fascinated with biological

1129
00:46:17,072 --> 00:46:19,316
sensing and sense making.

1130
00:46:19,498 --> 00:46:21,476
Okay, tyler, do you want to read this

1131
00:46:21,498 --> 00:46:24,056
claim for us? Sure. So, more

1132
00:46:24,078 --> 00:46:25,764
specifically, optimization is essential

1133
00:46:25,812 --> 00:46:27,844
across the constituent elements

1134
00:46:27,892 --> 00:46:29,652
determining the circular causality

1135
00:46:29,796 --> 00:46:31,736
underlying active coherence lab. One,

1136
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:33,524
actions generating reliable sensory

1137
00:46:33,572 --> 00:46:36,008
input precision. Two, the ability to

1138
00:46:36,014 --> 00:46:37,408
express beliefs about beliefs

1139
00:46:37,444 --> 00:46:40,152
consequences. Sophistication, to enact

1140
00:46:40,216 --> 00:46:42,012
only a bounded set of external states.

1141
00:46:42,146 --> 00:46:44,044
Three, leveraging salience without

1142
00:46:44,082 --> 00:46:45,612
missing the very air signaling value

1143
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:47,004
that non salient signaling may

1144
00:46:47,042 --> 00:46:49,436
nonetheless behold. And four, force that

1145
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:51,724
to anticipatory, develop and strengthen

1146
00:46:51,772 --> 00:46:54,156
the internal states, ie. Firm resources

1147
00:46:54,268 --> 00:46:56,176
in form of capabilities critical to

1148
00:46:56,198 --> 00:46:58,732
resource recombination. So, sensing,

1149
00:46:58,796 --> 00:47:00,800
sense making and duality management.

1150
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:09,150
Cool. I find it interesting here that

1151
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:12,926
one, two and three are within the

1152
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:15,986
lifecycle of an organization or an

1153
00:47:16,008 --> 00:47:18,542
organism. They refer to the reliability

1154
00:47:18,606 --> 00:47:22,018
of action, the ability to have an

1155
00:47:22,024 --> 00:47:24,306
appropriately expanded vocabulary in

1156
00:47:24,328 --> 00:47:25,950
terms of sophistication to describe

1157
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:28,030
relevant action. And then three,

1158
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,566
essentially attention, which is to make

1159
00:47:30,588 --> 00:47:32,226
sure that you're not just falling victim

1160
00:47:32,258 --> 00:47:35,266
to hyper skewed or hypernormal stimuli,

1161
00:47:35,298 --> 00:47:38,274
but rather you're using your attention

1162
00:47:38,402 --> 00:47:42,138
to enrich incoming stimuli and

1163
00:47:42,224 --> 00:47:45,034
also not ignoring what you're not

1164
00:47:45,072 --> 00:47:46,586
totally paying attention to. That might

1165
00:47:46,688 --> 00:47:49,482
be on the margins of relevance. But then

1166
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:52,818
four is framed here as an anticipatory

1167
00:47:53,014 --> 00:47:56,622
question in the long run whether

1168
00:47:56,676 --> 00:47:59,870
the capabilities are successful to

1169
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,506
manage resource recombination. That's

1170
00:48:02,538 --> 00:48:04,894
the question of life and death. So one,

1171
00:48:04,932 --> 00:48:06,750
two and three are like the behavioral

1172
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:09,218
imperatives and then four is kind of

1173
00:48:09,224 --> 00:48:10,578
like the organism looking to the

1174
00:48:10,584 --> 00:48:13,634
horizon. Maybe it makes it or maybe its

1175
00:48:13,672 --> 00:48:15,938
offspring does, or maybe none of the

1176
00:48:15,944 --> 00:48:16,610
above.

1177
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:25,138
Thank you. And then just this

1178
00:48:25,224 --> 00:48:28,802
final quote from the

1179
00:48:28,936 --> 00:48:31,490
paper or from the book. He says,

1180
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,986
duality is an essential quantum concept

1181
00:48:34,018 --> 00:48:36,514
that underpins the mastery of managing

1182
00:48:36,562 --> 00:48:38,754
the distributed and discontinuous nature

1183
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:41,350
of today's market realities.

1184
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:45,366
And I'm curious as to what Bijan is

1185
00:48:45,388 --> 00:48:47,238
referring to as duality. Like in the

1186
00:48:47,244 --> 00:48:48,754
quantum context. I always think about

1187
00:48:48,812 --> 00:48:52,122
wave particle duality, but I think he

1188
00:48:52,176 --> 00:48:53,514
has talked here a lot about

1189
00:48:53,552 --> 00:48:56,646
superposition. And maybe he's referring

1190
00:48:56,678 --> 00:48:59,562
to superposition, maybe he means super

1191
00:48:59,616 --> 00:49:01,914
cognition. Like you can exist in two

1192
00:49:01,952 --> 00:49:05,002
different states until for a long time.

1193
00:49:05,056 --> 00:49:06,654
Like you can be both black and white,

1194
00:49:06,692 --> 00:49:09,582
one and zero. So I'm not really sure

1195
00:49:09,636 --> 00:49:11,278
what he's referring to as duality, but I

1196
00:49:11,284 --> 00:49:12,578
think maybe we'll get into it in the

1197
00:49:12,584 --> 00:49:13,140
next.

1198
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:17,138
Yeah, I was curious whether the

1199
00:49:17,144 --> 00:49:19,234
connection he's making here is like one

1200
00:49:19,272 --> 00:49:21,762
of analogy saying like hey, the same way

1201
00:49:21,896 --> 00:49:24,278
you don't know what was out there in the

1202
00:49:24,284 --> 00:49:26,646
quantum world, you observe something and

1203
00:49:26,668 --> 00:49:28,946
you kind of collapse all of these waves

1204
00:49:28,978 --> 00:49:32,246
into electron. Is it an analogy in

1205
00:49:32,268 --> 00:49:33,942
the active inference free energy

1206
00:49:33,996 --> 00:49:35,926
governance world with through the

1207
00:49:35,948 --> 00:49:37,866
inactivist approach? Or is he saying

1208
00:49:37,888 --> 00:49:39,242
that this is actually like the same

1209
00:49:39,296 --> 00:49:40,902
thing, that is the same principle

1210
00:49:40,966 --> 00:49:43,594
underlying and I wasn't totally sure

1211
00:49:43,712 --> 00:49:46,460
which way what way he meant there.

1212
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:51,066
Yes, we should explore there's the wave

1213
00:49:51,098 --> 00:49:54,142
particle duality famous there's the

1214
00:49:54,276 --> 00:49:57,710
observer observed duality or the

1215
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,686
experimenter environment? Duality.

1216
00:50:00,878 --> 00:50:04,146
There's multiple dualities. And then if

1217
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,290
we think back to Bayesian physics,

1218
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:10,740
what does this help us with?

1219
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:16,294
Let's go into it more in the next

1220
00:50:16,332 --> 00:50:18,950
chapter and then see how it actually

1221
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,686
connects back. Otherwise, I believe it

1222
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:25,042
puts us squarely into the quantum

1223
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:28,610
business advice genre.

1224
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:32,026
But I know there's more to it. And that

1225
00:50:32,048 --> 00:50:35,462
would be, like, a very sellable quantum

1226
00:50:35,526 --> 00:50:37,274
business advice. Quantum Business

1227
00:50:37,312 --> 00:50:39,520
strategy manager. That's my new job.

1228
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:41,914
I'd be, like, a heck of a consultant

1229
00:50:41,962 --> 00:50:44,734
title. Am I working? Am I not working?

1230
00:50:44,852 --> 00:50:46,174
You could check. You still might not

1231
00:50:46,212 --> 00:50:49,486
find out. Am I

1232
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:51,714
here? Am I there? Where am I? Actually,

1233
00:50:51,912 --> 00:50:53,874
you can't measure my position and my

1234
00:50:53,912 --> 00:50:56,066
momentum at the same time. That's pretty

1235
00:50:56,088 --> 00:50:59,698
funny. Okay. All right. I think

1236
00:50:59,864 --> 00:51:02,226
we've reached the end of our set of

1237
00:51:02,248 --> 00:51:05,266
slides. Looking forward to exploring the

1238
00:51:05,288 --> 00:51:08,338
quantum in more detail as I find the

1239
00:51:08,344 --> 00:51:10,114
quantum concepts fascinating. I guess

1240
00:51:10,152 --> 00:51:12,066
Bijan also does. Do you guys have

1241
00:51:12,088 --> 00:51:13,298
anything else to add before we say

1242
00:51:13,304 --> 00:51:16,906
goodbye? That's it?

1243
00:51:16,928 --> 00:51:18,970
No? Okay. Thanks, Tyler.

1244
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:22,680
Next week. Thanks, Joe. Very well.
