00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,326
>>>Daniel Friedman: Hello and welcome everyone. It's

2
00:00:11,358 --> 00:00:14,610
December 27, 2022. We're in

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,060
active bookstream number 1.03.

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,586
We're in the third in a series of

5
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:24,094
discussions on governing continuous

6
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:26,514
transformation. Off to you,

7
00:00:26,552 --> 00:00:27,250
Bleu.

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,770
>>>BLEU KNIGHT: Okay, so this bookstream is going to

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,106
be part of an ongoing series of

10
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:37,814
bookstreams at the Active Inference

11
00:00:37,862 --> 00:00:40,346
Institute. So please get in touch if you

12
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:42,634
would like to participate either in one

13
00:00:42,672 --> 00:00:44,846
of these zero contextualization videos

14
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:47,118
or an upcoming discussion over the

15
00:00:47,124 --> 00:00:50,858
material. And these are all of our links

16
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:54,062
here. This is a participatory online

17
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:56,706
lab. We are open to interacting with

18
00:00:56,728 --> 00:00:58,386
anyone, no matter what your level of

19
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:01,986
expertise is in ants of inference or

20
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:04,642
governance or other. So the goal of this

21
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:07,330
bookstream is to discuss chapter three.

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,686
We're going to go over the book map and

23
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:13,314
roadmap and the keywords of the chapter.

24
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:15,606
And then there's two sections that kind

25
00:01:15,628 --> 00:01:18,246
of fell out of this chapter three. So

26
00:01:18,268 --> 00:01:21,626
we'll split those up so we can

27
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,326
just maybe introduce ourselves. So I'm

28
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:26,490
Bleu Knight. I'm an independent research

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,058
consultant in New Mexico, and I'll pass

30
00:01:30,144 --> 00:01:31,530
to Tyler.

31
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,374
>>>TYLER SULLBERG: How's going? I'm Tyler. I'm more of a

32
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:37,550
DAO practitioner out of California.

33
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,166
Daniel: I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in

34
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:45,018
California. And as this is our year

35
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:48,498
closing bookstream, and this is going to

36
00:01:48,504 --> 00:01:52,754
be focusing on some board and

37
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:54,878
strategy related topics, I think it'll

38
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:57,370
be interesting to talk about reflection

39
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,214
and how do we look back, how do we now

40
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:02,520
cast, how do we look forward?

41
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,480
Nice. Yes. I'm definitely excited to

42
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,578
align the material that is presented in

43
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,922
the book with the ongoing development of

44
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:17,126
strategy and governance in Active

45
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:19,482
Inference Institute. So that's for me

46
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:21,100
what I'm excited about today.

47
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,594
Okay, so this chapter is Micro

48
00:02:25,642 --> 00:02:28,430
Foundations of Strategic Governance,

49
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,278
and the two sections are The Role of the

50
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,790
Board and Models of Board Cognition.

51
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,766
So, Tyler, do you want to read this

52
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:39,602
section of the abstract? Sure. Right.

53
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:41,566
So there is no universal governance

54
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:43,634
model. The strategic role of the board

55
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:45,614
does vary as a function of culture,

56
00:02:45,662 --> 00:02:47,934
laws, governance orientation, ownership

57
00:02:47,982 --> 00:02:50,206
structure, and firm context. The period

58
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:52,754
of 1998 to 2001, time of financial

59
00:02:52,802 --> 00:02:54,546
markets irrational exuberance dominated

60
00:02:54,578 --> 00:02:56,498
by coherence governance orientation

61
00:02:56,674 --> 00:02:58,054
centered around stock price

62
00:02:58,092 --> 00:03:00,026
considerations, has given birth to

63
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:01,494
today's compliance driven governance

64
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:04,006
logic ruling public companies. Simply

65
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:05,926
put, ever since, corporate governance

66
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,798
has been estranging the board that's

67
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:10,214
uniquely integral part of strategy

68
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:12,634
process. Coincidentally, during this

69
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:14,218
very period, management research started

70
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,926
complementing their two demographic

71
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,678
input output models with behavioral and

72
00:03:17,684 --> 00:03:19,774
cognitive dimensions, loping a new

73
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:21,354
conversation around the cognitive

74
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:23,098
microfoundations of board effectiveness.

75
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:25,278
To this day, the study of the board's

76
00:03:25,294 --> 00:03:26,898
strategic role remains confined to the

77
00:03:26,904 --> 00:03:28,498
boardroom increased environment as an

78
00:03:28,504 --> 00:03:31,714
exogenous variable. Bleu will take the

79
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:33,890
next half. .

80
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,562
The top down cultivated hierarchical

81
00:03:38,626 --> 00:03:40,806
disconnect so characteristic of

82
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:42,694
traditional corporate governance and

83
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:44,566
strategy processes is more likely to

84
00:03:44,588 --> 00:03:46,806
fuel prediction error, reinforcing the

85
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:47,926
perception that the world is

86
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:50,802
unpredictable and uncertain. Indeed,

87
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:52,406
the very limitations of corporate

88
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:54,294
governance research may be an astute

89
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:56,090
reflection of the very real and often

90
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,822
selfinflicted limitations of the board's

91
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:01,098
strategic role. Shareholders are

92
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:02,986
challenged to ensure that the board's

93
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:05,274
full strategic potential is not wasted.

94
00:04:05,402 --> 00:04:07,646
More specifically, there is a need for a

95
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:10,830
new self organizing governance logic.

96
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,094
Okay, Tyler, do you want to read this,

97
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:19,038
the role of the board? Yeah, sure. So

98
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:20,418
for section here is the role of the

99
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:22,722
board. And then we'll go into really

100
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:24,834
different models thinking about board

101
00:04:24,872 --> 00:04:27,346
cognition. So we'll start with this

102
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:29,666
quote from John there's no universal

103
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:31,158
governance model. The strategic role of

104
00:04:31,164 --> 00:04:32,726
the board does vary as a function of

105
00:04:32,748 --> 00:04:35,378
culture, laws, governance orientation,

106
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:37,586
ownership structure, public, private

107
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:39,966
equity, founder, family led controller,

108
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:42,218
or combination thereof in firm specific

109
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:45,674
context. All right, let's go to the next

110
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:48,902
one. Cool. Yeah. This is upper echelon.

111
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:52,074
So not being familiar with a lot of

112
00:04:52,112 --> 00:04:55,486
business like vernacular, I just put

113
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:57,246
this in there. So it's the high level of

114
00:04:57,268 --> 00:04:59,806
command authority or rank. And this can

115
00:04:59,828 --> 00:05:02,526
be like top level management or the

116
00:05:02,548 --> 00:05:05,034
board of directors or both. It seemed

117
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:08,654
like that it wasn't specifically defined

118
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:10,498
in the book as we're reading it, but

119
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:13,234
Tyler, do you have any thoughts on that

120
00:05:13,352 --> 00:05:14,626
specifically? Like, what do you think

121
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,006
Bijan means? My understanding is that it

122
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:20,582
was a combination of both the board and

123
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:23,458
the top management structure.

124
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:25,398
So yeah, he left it pretty big, but

125
00:05:25,404 --> 00:05:26,550
that's my understanding.

126
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,302
All right, so we'll start off talking

127
00:05:31,356 --> 00:05:34,166
about what a board could be. And so this

128
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:36,602
is Bajan's definition of what a board

129
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:38,218
could mean and not necessarily what it

130
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:40,026
does mean. So the board of directors is

131
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,638
a unique, integral part of the firm's

132
00:05:41,654 --> 00:05:44,366
upper echelon. It acts from within and

133
00:05:44,388 --> 00:05:46,266
without the firm as a boundary spanner.

134
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:47,546
It should encapsulate strategy,

135
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:48,826
processes, constructive attention

136
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:50,714
between organization and active

137
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:53,230
environment, exploitation and

138
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,938
exploration, as well as financial and

139
00:05:54,964 --> 00:05:58,562
strategic controls. And so I think even

140
00:05:58,616 --> 00:05:59,886
people outside of like an active

141
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:02,094
inference free energy governance context

142
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:04,674
would probably agree with roughly this

143
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:07,442
definition, that a board should be this

144
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:09,598
collective governing body that used

145
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:12,406
their collective wisdom. Because the

146
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:14,134
idea is that is greater than just like,

147
00:06:14,172 --> 00:06:15,926
one person at the top making all the

148
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:17,730
decisions and that collective wisdom,

149
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,894
something interesting and unique comes

150
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:22,806
out of that. That's not necessarily what

151
00:06:22,828 --> 00:06:24,106
always happens. Oftentimes it's not

152
00:06:24,128 --> 00:06:25,770
exactly what happens. So let's go to the

153
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,300
next slide. We talk about different,

154
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,154
these are different ways of thinking

155
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:32,294
about how a board actually functions.

156
00:06:32,422 --> 00:06:33,742
And there's like a lot of different ways

157
00:06:33,796 --> 00:06:36,906
like the board's

158
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,286
role in what they actually do and

159
00:06:38,308 --> 00:06:40,622
organization varies considerably across

160
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:42,686
a lot of exafferent dimension. So one

161
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,400
different way you could look at it is

162
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,906
the cultural background of the board.

163
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:50,498
So this is from a study, I think they

164
00:06:50,504 --> 00:06:52,354
did this on Dutch Royal Company, which

165
00:06:52,392 --> 00:06:55,554
had branches both in England and then

166
00:06:55,592 --> 00:06:58,414
also in the Rhine in like Germany.

167
00:06:58,462 --> 00:07:00,406
Right? And so they found that top

168
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:01,878
managers having the English Sachs and

169
00:07:01,884 --> 00:07:03,254
corporate governance orientation are

170
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,254
more likely to pursue exploitative and

171
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,738
external growth strategic renewal

172
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:08,786
trajectories, while those having a Ryan

173
00:07:08,818 --> 00:07:10,658
corporate governance orientation are

174
00:07:10,684 --> 00:07:12,134
more likely to pursue exploratory,

175
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,798
internal growth strategic renewal

176
00:07:13,814 --> 00:07:15,866
trajectories. So I think what they're

177
00:07:15,888 --> 00:07:16,854
implication saying is that they're

178
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:20,406
facing similar strategic concepts,

179
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:22,874
they're the same company, but for some

180
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:24,646
reason culturally they're more oriented

181
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:28,446
to doing certain kinds of actions. Then

182
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:29,966
you can also think about it just by the

183
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:32,046
context of the business, right? There

184
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:33,694
might be certain boards that have

185
00:07:33,732 --> 00:07:34,558
different roles that are more

186
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:35,806
appropriate for certain kinds of

187
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:37,262
contexts. So it might be more

188
00:07:37,316 --> 00:07:39,450
administrative. Maybe it's kind of like

189
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,834
a legal requirement to have the board.

190
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:42,242
And that's kind of why they're there.

191
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,594
They're more of just making sure that

192
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:46,898
everything is running on time, more of

193
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:48,078
an entrepreneurial where they're

194
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:49,614
actually taking more strategic role.

195
00:07:49,662 --> 00:07:51,426
There's directing and controlling. We

196
00:07:51,448 --> 00:07:53,766
can imagine that they're more kind of

197
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:56,006
integrated with management and then

198
00:07:56,028 --> 00:07:57,542
there's supervisor, which might just be,

199
00:07:57,596 --> 00:07:59,206
hey, making sure that everything is

200
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,730
going okay, that there are no outrageous

201
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,898
frauds being committed within the

202
00:08:05,904 --> 00:08:09,226
company. Though a very common issue too,

203
00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:10,634
is that the board often doesn't have

204
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:13,658
much of a role at all. And so this is a

205
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:16,138
quote from one of the studies that the

206
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:18,394
John cites that managerial hedging money

207
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,586
theory argues that boards are legal

208
00:08:20,618 --> 00:08:22,606
fiction dominated by management. So the

209
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,542
idea here is that management actually

210
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:27,374
runs the show. You have a board, they

211
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:29,154
have to check some boxes. They're often

212
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:31,874
legally mandated, right? So, like, for a

213
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:35,346
501 or a C Corp, you have to

214
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:37,586
have a board. But they're like, okay,

215
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:40,054
let's just appease regulators and have

216
00:08:40,092 --> 00:08:41,654
this board. We're not actually giving

217
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:44,326
them anything substantial to do. This is

218
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:46,246
actually like a really big problem in

219
00:08:46,348 --> 00:08:49,014
nonprofit board management as well,

220
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:52,086
because it's very unclear what nonprofit

221
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:54,298
boards are supposed to do. And

222
00:08:54,384 --> 00:08:57,706
oftentimes nonprofits will put a lot of

223
00:08:57,728 --> 00:09:00,266
donors on their board in a long way just

224
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:03,562
to appease these donors egos in

225
00:09:03,616 --> 00:09:06,394
chance for getting more funding, but

226
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:08,254
without having a clear sense of what

227
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:09,694
they're actually supposed to do. This

228
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:11,838
actually matters quite a lot because

229
00:09:12,004 --> 00:09:13,198
they don't know what they're supposed to

230
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:14,978
do. But they have all the power in the

231
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:16,706
organization, like the board runs the

232
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:20,834
organization in a nonprofit, and so they

233
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:22,926
have unknown accountability, unclear

234
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,770
responsibilities, but all the power.

235
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,506
And so what that often dissolves into is

236
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:29,986
that the CEO or the executive director

237
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:33,046
is actually running the show and the

238
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:34,454
board is there just kind of like

239
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:38,450
checking boxes and more of a formality,

240
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,546
which does not really get as a greater

241
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:42,426
cognition that the genre is hinting at.

242
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,938
It could be possible by having a board.

243
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:47,562
So that's unfortunate. Let's get to the

244
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:49,900
next one. All right.

245
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,202
Okay, so this was

246
00:09:54,256 --> 00:09:55,998
the first of John's claims. There is a

247
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:57,546
danger, however, that the compliant

248
00:09:57,578 --> 00:10:00,254
board is breathing formalism group think

249
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:01,966
and risk aversion at the expense of the

250
00:10:01,988 --> 00:10:03,514
operational understanding strategic

251
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,086
focus and independent thinking.

252
00:10:05,268 --> 00:10:06,766
Effectively, the board has been

253
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:08,286
distanced from initiating and directing

254
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:10,318
strategic renewal. Unless lawmakers

255
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:11,886
evolve corporate governance guidelines

256
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:13,138
in tune with the requirements of a

257
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:15,634
distributed continuum world, the board

258
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:17,294
is either relegated to strategic

259
00:10:17,342 --> 00:10:19,026
relevance or increasingly represents a

260
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:20,726
force of inertia reflected on the

261
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:22,710
struggle with growing complexity.

262
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,080
All right, so let's just unpack

263
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,096
what the Dean meant by irrational

264
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:34,552
exuberance from that claim. So,

265
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:38,164
irrational exuberance, this is a famous

266
00:10:38,212 --> 00:10:41,016
quote from Alan Greenspan and this was

267
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:43,016
from the 1996 when this was like the

268
00:10:43,038 --> 00:10:45,492
beginning of the.com boom. the.com boom

269
00:10:45,556 --> 00:10:47,324
still had a couple of years left to go

270
00:10:47,362 --> 00:10:49,308
before it really kind of petered out.

271
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:51,496
They said irrational duprance has unduly

272
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:54,876
escalated asset values. And so during

273
00:10:54,898 --> 00:10:56,300
this period it was like the late ninety

274
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,744
s, you had all these companies that,

275
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:00,396
well one, there's like wild speculation

276
00:11:00,428 --> 00:11:01,696
in these companies, but also there

277
00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:03,452
wasn't great strategic or financial

278
00:11:03,516 --> 00:11:06,576
controls by the boards. And so you had

279
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:09,276
companies like Enron and Tyco WorldCom

280
00:11:09,308 --> 00:11:11,232
that were very much misrepresenting

281
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,492
their financials. And so the end result

282
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:16,020
of this, after the bus, the.com bust,

283
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,668
was the Sarbanes of the ant.

284
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,328
I always mispronounce this sarbanes

285
00:11:21,344 --> 00:11:24,756
offway act. So which,

286
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:27,556
what that did was that it created the

287
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:29,476
number of like audit and regulatory

288
00:11:29,508 --> 00:11:31,256
controls, especially over the board,

289
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,856
make sure the board have conflicts of

290
00:11:32,878 --> 00:11:34,312
interest, that they're actually

291
00:11:34,366 --> 00:11:36,552
overseeing the organization effectively,

292
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,996
which is all wonderful in many ways that

293
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:41,836
can be great, those are good things.

294
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:44,664
But there's also a ton of regulation

295
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:46,764
that imposes on these companies and it

296
00:11:46,802 --> 00:11:49,488
also imposes a certain model of what a

297
00:11:49,494 --> 00:11:52,176
board is supposed to be doing onto these

298
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,680
corporations. And so John does not

299
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,128
like some aspects of that, some of the

300
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,736
way that enforces what a board can and

301
00:12:00,758 --> 00:12:03,184
should be. And so he says the 2002

302
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,916
Sarbanes Oscillate Act, the United

303
00:12:04,938 --> 00:12:06,336
States has been the most prominent lit

304
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:08,436
state of product resulting from

305
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,936
irrational exuberance, imposing

306
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:11,508
draconian measures on the audit and

307
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:13,744
financial representations of publicly

308
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:17,796
listed companies. So I

309
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:20,376
think what level of John is saying about

310
00:12:20,398 --> 00:12:24,184
this period is that like before 2002 for

311
00:12:24,222 --> 00:12:27,420
Sarbanes Oxley, you had a lot of

312
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,848
misrepresentations, a lot of rational

313
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:31,900
exuberance. But something interesting

314
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,624
that did happen during that same period

315
00:12:33,672 --> 00:12:35,196
was that you also had a lot of

316
00:12:35,218 --> 00:12:37,196
experimentation on what a board could

317
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,856
and should be. And so you agent a lot of

318
00:12:39,878 --> 00:12:41,392
research during the same time thinking

319
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:43,536
about what managerial cognition, what

320
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:45,248
board cognition actually looks like,

321
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:47,984
what the board's role could be. And that

322
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:50,400
kind of free and loose culture also

323
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,776
created a more expansive view of what

324
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:56,004
a board is. But then once you get into

325
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,744
2002 and you get all these regulations

326
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:59,844
from Starbanes Oxley that really

327
00:12:59,882 --> 00:13:01,444
constrained the idea of what a board

328
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:02,984
could be and put all of these other

329
00:13:03,022 --> 00:13:05,144
burdens on top of the board and so it

330
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:06,632
really kind of diminished their

331
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:09,252
potential strategic and cognitive role

332
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:12,628
within the company. Bleu Daniel,

333
00:13:12,644 --> 00:13:13,576
do you have anything you just want to

334
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:14,430
add here?

335
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,676
All right, so that was talking about the

336
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:23,404
role of the board and that's all. Just

337
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:25,532
to say, the role of the board is often

338
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:28,924
extremely unclear, like any nonprofit or

339
00:13:28,962 --> 00:13:32,408
corporation. And so now the John's

340
00:13:32,424 --> 00:13:33,616
kind of switches gears and says, okay,

341
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:34,956
well, let's think about different models

342
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:36,864
of board cognition and different ways

343
00:13:36,902 --> 00:13:38,400
that you can think about Hohwy a board

344
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,584
could operate. So let's go to the next

345
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:45,108
one. Bleu sure.

346
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:48,596
So Rendova 1999 was among the

347
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:51,976
first to link managerial cognition to

348
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,528
corporate governance, distilling the

349
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:55,492
board's distinct cognitive contribution

350
00:13:55,556 --> 00:13:58,104
to strategy process, specifically in

351
00:13:58,142 --> 00:13:59,944
terms of environmental scanning and

352
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:02,504
interpretation. Her contribution can be

353
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,776
considered seminal laying grounds for a

354
00:14:04,798 --> 00:14:06,664
stewardship inspired corporate coherence

355
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,876
approach that is now widely adopted by

356
00:14:08,898 --> 00:14:11,132
leading private equity firms where top

357
00:14:11,186 --> 00:14:12,904
management team and board strategize

358
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,984
together, often in highly complementary

359
00:14:15,032 --> 00:14:17,896
ways and based upon cash finance equity

360
00:14:17,928 --> 00:14:20,844
centric alignment of interest as opposed

361
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:23,584
to free call options. Private equity is

362
00:14:23,622 --> 00:14:25,244
more of a governance than a financing

363
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:27,184
model explaining its public market

364
00:14:27,222 --> 00:14:29,636
equivalent outperformance. According to

365
00:14:29,658 --> 00:14:32,000
Rendova, board directors do impact

366
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,068
decisions. And so

367
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:38,752
I thought that this idea of managerial

368
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:41,312
cognition was interesting. It just

369
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:44,360
speaks to my interest in hierarchical

370
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,216
cognition ant different levels. So this

371
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:51,960
is a reference that Bijan gives,

372
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,636
that is the managerial response to

373
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:56,812
changing environments perspectives on

374
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:59,096
problem sensing from social cognition.

375
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,224
So looking at like, what is managerial

376
00:15:01,272 --> 00:15:04,152
cognition? So this paper characterizes

377
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:06,892
managerial problem sensing and necessary

378
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:08,924
precondition for managerial activity

379
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:10,476
directed towards organizational

380
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,972
adaptation as composed of noticing,

381
00:15:13,036 --> 00:15:15,628
interpreting and incorporating stimuli.

382
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:18,204
And I liked this definition of cognition

383
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:21,136
really as like noticing, interpreting

384
00:15:21,168 --> 00:15:24,036
and incorporating stimuli. Although in

385
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:25,456
the paper they don't say managerial

386
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:27,824
cognition directly, I think that it's

387
00:15:27,872 --> 00:15:31,248
attributed largely to this paper as very

388
00:15:31,274 --> 00:15:34,472
seminal in the field and then

389
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:35,944
environmental scanning and

390
00:15:35,982 --> 00:15:37,844
interpretation from the previous claim.

391
00:15:37,892 --> 00:15:42,344
Also, so this is the Rendova paper that

392
00:15:42,382 --> 00:15:45,960
Bijan cited and it says the cognitive

393
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,544
perspective in this paper proposes

394
00:15:49,592 --> 00:15:51,996
suggests that directors contribute to

395
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,324
dealing with the complexity and

396
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:55,864
uncertainty associated with strategic

397
00:15:55,912 --> 00:15:58,172
decisions. It argues that directors

398
00:15:58,236 --> 00:15:59,884
possess valuable problem solving

399
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:01,968
expertise which they can apply to a

400
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:04,224
variety of contexts. Directors make

401
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:05,952
their cognitive contributions to

402
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,476
strategic decision making by performing

403
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:10,608
along with the firm's managers a set of

404
00:16:10,614 --> 00:16:12,572
cognitive tasks scanning,

405
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:15,716
interpretation and choice. And like, I

406
00:16:15,738 --> 00:16:17,216
noticed again this like environmental

407
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:19,060
scanning, interpretation and choice,

408
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,412
how does this relate to noticing,

409
00:16:23,476 --> 00:16:26,200
interpreting and incorporating stimuli?

410
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,156
It's like a rephrase scanning,

411
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,760
interpretation and choice.

412
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,536
Okay. And so another claim that

413
00:16:36,558 --> 00:16:38,380
Bishop makes in the paper, he says

414
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,584
Rendova appreciates the dynamic nature

415
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,984
of strategy process when she postulates

416
00:16:43,032 --> 00:16:45,816
that board participation in strategic

417
00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:48,236
decision making rises with increasing

418
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:50,620
environment complexity and uncertainty.

419
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,072
However, Rendova's approach is rather

420
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:55,308
static as it falls short of connecting

421
00:16:55,404 --> 00:16:56,976
the board table to the rest of the

422
00:16:56,998 --> 00:16:59,456
organization and interchangeably treats

423
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:02,996
perception as interpretation. A free

424
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:06,112
energy governance lens instantly exposes

425
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:08,608
the obvious shortcomings maybe Tyler's

426
00:17:08,624 --> 00:17:12,564
going to tell us how. All right,

427
00:17:12,602 --> 00:17:14,264
so let's go through a couple more of

428
00:17:14,302 --> 00:17:15,752
these different models of board

429
00:17:15,806 --> 00:17:18,040
cognition. One of them is called

430
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,736
Stewardship Theory. To look quote here

431
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:23,432
from one of the original papers about

432
00:17:23,486 --> 00:17:26,092
stewardship theory, Davis 2007. So

433
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:27,676
economic approaches to governance, such

434
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:29,436
as agency theory tend to assume some

435
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,288
form of homo economicness which depicts

436
00:17:31,304 --> 00:17:32,696
subordinates as individualistic,

437
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:34,344
opportunistic and self serving.

438
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:36,108
Alternatively, sociological and

439
00:17:36,114 --> 00:17:37,496
psychological approaches to governance,

440
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:38,932
such as stewardship theory, depicts

441
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:40,864
subordinates as connectivity, pro,

442
00:17:40,902 --> 00:17:44,928
organizational and trustworthy. And so

443
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:46,912
there's, I think, a couple of different

444
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,396
lenses you can think about stewardship

445
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:51,420
theory. One is kind of more of this like

446
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,400
communist version of a more collectivist

447
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,136
world where actually we're not all fully

448
00:17:57,168 --> 00:18:00,784
selfish, we also have collectivist

449
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:04,488
aims and people. It's like a

450
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:05,592
different way of thinking about

451
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:07,752
individual motivation. I think another

452
00:18:07,806 --> 00:18:09,352
one too is that where this has really

453
00:18:09,406 --> 00:18:12,744
shined and become actually important in

454
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:14,148
applied practice has been in private

455
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:16,764
equity. And so in private equity, the

456
00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:19,368
owners are the same as the management.

457
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:21,496
And this actually ends up mattering

458
00:18:21,528 --> 00:18:23,710
because what they seem to be safe down

459
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,340
this quote here is that actually impacts

460
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,510
performance quite a bit,

461
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,576
I think. Sorry, we already read that

462
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:36,544
quote. But the idea here is that when

463
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,368
management ownership are combined, the

464
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:40,852
management acts as more stewards rather

465
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:43,504
than people who are just paper pushers,

466
00:18:43,552 --> 00:18:45,108
but they're actually really taking care

467
00:18:45,114 --> 00:18:46,416
of this investment. And Jorge aligned

468
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:48,180
with the board interests.

469
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,300
The next one is absorbative capacity.

470
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,228
So Absorbing Capacity thinks about the

471
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:59,156
board as a a cognition unit that's

472
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:00,904
informed by the experiences of its

473
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:02,664
members. So similar to what Bleu said

474
00:19:02,702 --> 00:19:05,656
earlier, that the board's expertise in

475
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,516
the board's cognition is informed by the

476
00:19:07,538 --> 00:19:09,244
diverse experiences of its board

477
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,516
members. So the ability of a firm to

478
00:19:11,538 --> 00:19:13,048
recognize the value of new external

479
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:15,244
information assimilated and apply it to

480
00:19:15,282 --> 00:19:17,116
commercial ends is critical in its

481
00:19:17,138 --> 00:19:19,036
innovative capabilities. We labeled this

482
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,504
capability the firm's absorptive

483
00:19:20,552 --> 00:19:22,816
capacity suggests that is largely a

484
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:24,412
function of the firm's level of prior

485
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:27,920
related knowledge. It goes on to say

486
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,496
it's from Mendova director's

487
00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:32,304
contribution as a source of requisite

488
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:34,868
varieties to increase the pool available

489
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:37,300
interpretive framework on which decision

490
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,270
group which the decision group can draw.

491
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,036
So the idea here is that there's limited

492
00:19:44,068 --> 00:19:45,864
information that any individual or any

493
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:49,464
group can process. You should get more

494
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:51,476
people with more diverse experiences,

495
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:52,970
so you could process more information

496
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,980
through different models and that will

497
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:00,156
lead to more enhanced cognition. I could

498
00:20:00,178 --> 00:20:03,260
add a note on that previous slide.

499
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,176
The mention of the requisite variety in

500
00:20:08,198 --> 00:20:12,476
the Rendova quote is from Cybernetics

501
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:15,676
and Ross Ashby's law of requisite

502
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,916
variety, which is the idea that for

503
00:20:18,938 --> 00:20:21,904
a system to be a good regulator adaptive

504
00:20:21,952 --> 00:20:24,356
in a given environment that it needs to

505
00:20:24,378 --> 00:20:28,324
have internal states that are of the

506
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:31,556
order of magnitude of external states.

507
00:20:31,658 --> 00:20:33,556
Like if there's 100 positions that the

508
00:20:33,578 --> 00:20:35,016
food could be in but you can only

509
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:37,704
conceptualize of ten, then you're not

510
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:39,784
going to be able to have a granular or

511
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,216
nuanced enough perspective to find the

512
00:20:42,238 --> 00:20:45,752
food. So that ties

513
00:20:45,816 --> 00:20:50,024
the managerial and strategic practice

514
00:20:50,072 --> 00:20:53,624
oriented areas which frankly dominate

515
00:20:53,672 --> 00:20:56,292
society, to some of the more theoretical

516
00:20:56,376 --> 00:20:59,004
perspectives and system independent

517
00:20:59,052 --> 00:21:02,192
perspectives on cybernetics and

518
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:05,564
cybernetic systems as cognitive systems,

519
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:08,048
which is what brings this entire

520
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,476
discourse into the active inference

521
00:21:10,508 --> 00:21:13,616
area. And I think that's also another

522
00:21:13,718 --> 00:21:15,296
important lens, I'll think about Noor

523
00:21:15,328 --> 00:21:17,056
diversity because a lot of times Noor

524
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:19,556
diversity is often seen through more of

525
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,496
a political lens when there's also like

526
00:21:21,518 --> 00:21:23,716
a computational lens as well. That's

527
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:24,490
really important.

528
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,930
Cool. Okay, moving on.

529
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,744
Forbes and Milliken's contribution is

530
00:21:34,782 --> 00:21:37,576
relevant in three regards. First, it is

531
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:40,252
impossible to meaningfully infer board

532
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:43,496
performance from demographic variables

533
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:45,244
in the absence of a process model

534
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:48,232
linking demography and output. Second,

535
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:49,904
the board's role as a group is

536
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:52,192
essentially a cognitive role and is

537
00:21:52,246 --> 00:21:53,984
therefore a cognitive rather than

538
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,336
behavioral perspective is critical to

539
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,032
better understand the essence of board

540
00:21:58,086 --> 00:22:00,496
performance. And third, effort norms,

541
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,436
cognitive conflicts and the use of

542
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,796
knowledge and skills are important

543
00:22:03,898 --> 00:22:05,812
process variables underlying board

544
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,988
performance. I think Tyler is going to

545
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,832
tell us effort norms and cognitive

546
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:14,508
conflicts. All right, so effort norms,

547
00:22:14,544 --> 00:22:15,876
ie. The intensity of cognitive

548
00:22:15,908 --> 00:22:17,396
resourcefulness on the task performance,

549
00:22:17,428 --> 00:22:19,416
behavior, cognitive conflicts, the

550
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,108
leveraging of differences in perspective

551
00:22:21,204 --> 00:22:22,856
and the use of knowledge and skills are

552
00:22:22,878 --> 00:22:24,608
important process variables underlying

553
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,396
board performance. The dimension of

554
00:22:26,418 --> 00:22:28,524
effort norms cannot be stressed enough.

555
00:22:28,642 --> 00:22:30,264
The sheer presence of the collective

556
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:32,156
pool of competencies and experiences is

557
00:22:32,178 --> 00:22:34,316
rather meaningless unless actively and

558
00:22:34,338 --> 00:22:38,176
purposefully exercised. So the

559
00:22:38,198 --> 00:22:41,410
idea here is that even if you have a

560
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,776
diverse set of perspectives on your

561
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:45,328
board, and even if you have

562
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:47,836
computational firepower, theoretically,

563
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:49,776
if the board isn't actually inclined to

564
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:51,296
acting on that and processing that

565
00:22:51,318 --> 00:22:53,588
information, it's just not going to

566
00:22:53,594 --> 00:22:56,436
happen. In that power you have that

567
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,764
potential power just doesn't really

568
00:22:57,802 --> 00:23:00,116
matter. I think this is important too,

569
00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:01,268
because a lot of boards see themselves

570
00:23:01,354 --> 00:23:04,856
in a more passive way where the

571
00:23:04,878 --> 00:23:07,656
CEO is feeding them information and kind

572
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,764
of giving them things to rubber stamp

573
00:23:09,812 --> 00:23:12,104
approve. And so even if you have people

574
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,056
who have those capabilities, that

575
00:23:14,078 --> 00:23:16,092
capacity, it's not really even being

576
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,724
used. And so you have to have a board

577
00:23:17,762 --> 00:23:19,276
that's actually inclined to taking more

578
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:21,612
of an active role to really get that

579
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,524
cognitive potential from your board

580
00:23:24,562 --> 00:23:27,872
members or anything

581
00:23:27,926 --> 00:23:31,404
out there. Yeah. One thought by analogy

582
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,468
to the brain and the central nervous

583
00:23:33,484 --> 00:23:37,152
system is like the usage of

584
00:23:37,286 --> 00:23:40,656
resources for cognition, and the brain

585
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:42,228
is still using a lot of energy,

586
00:23:42,314 --> 00:23:45,040
slightly less, but a lot during sleep.

587
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,792
So what exactly are these cognitive

588
00:23:47,936 --> 00:23:51,216
conflicts? What is the resource in

589
00:23:51,258 --> 00:23:54,164
the case of the board? Is it the limited

590
00:23:54,212 --> 00:23:56,456
time in a meeting where people can

591
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,936
speak? Is it limited attention to

592
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:02,376
different decisions? What is it

593
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:06,140
that's actually conflicted?

594
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,460
And how do we gain insights from

595
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,680
thinking about the board as a cognitive

596
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,500
entity.

597
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,924
So I think we'll get some of those soon

598
00:24:18,962 --> 00:24:21,488
when we talk about inertia. But I think

599
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:24,048
you're right in that the time, the

600
00:24:24,054 --> 00:24:26,384
limited time constraints are a huge

601
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:27,856
factor of that, where it's just like

602
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,448
you're less inclined to actually do a

603
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:33,060
very high cognitive task, a very

604
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,348
demanding cognitive task. You have a

605
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:36,884
couple of hours every month to really

606
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:39,236
talk about it. Or in the case of a 501

607
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:41,716
C, three, like, board members are

608
00:24:41,818 --> 00:24:43,728
unpaid. And so if you're an unpaid

609
00:24:43,744 --> 00:24:44,896
member, there's probably like limited

610
00:24:44,928 --> 00:24:46,296
time you're actually willing to put to

611
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,056
actually thinking about some of these

612
00:24:48,078 --> 00:24:50,168
problems. So I think that there are a

613
00:24:50,254 --> 00:24:51,576
lot of dimensions to it, but we'll talk

614
00:24:51,598 --> 00:24:52,760
about that shortly.

615
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,720
I think this last end of this quote,

616
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,516
the competencies and experiences of the

617
00:25:01,538 --> 00:25:03,384
collective pool is meaningless unless

618
00:25:03,432 --> 00:25:05,480
it's actively and purposely exercised.

619
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,336
Really speaks a lot to collective

620
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:11,024
intelligence and how, like, within a

621
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,584
company, a board, a managerial system,

622
00:25:13,702 --> 00:25:17,250
there is this collection and you're not

623
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:23,180
contributing to the emergence

624
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,630
of the group intelligence if

625
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,430
you're not using all of the different

626
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,196
expertise of the different people in the

627
00:25:32,218 --> 00:25:34,564
group. And so I think that it's really

628
00:25:34,602 --> 00:25:37,590
limiting. But but I also wonder,

629
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,520
you know, like, we might have a board

630
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,168
that's like a very diverse group of

631
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:43,796
people and we all have different tasks

632
00:25:43,908 --> 00:25:45,916
in management, different skills in

633
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:47,484
management, but we also can do things

634
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:51,516
like crochet and bake and paint. And so

635
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:54,296
to what extent are these other skills

636
00:25:54,328 --> 00:25:55,836
that might be present in the board,

637
00:25:55,938 --> 00:25:58,210
like relevant or necessary for

638
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,528
management to thrive and really to

639
00:26:02,614 --> 00:26:05,056
enhance the collective for the group? I

640
00:26:05,078 --> 00:26:08,544
don't know. One last short thought

641
00:26:08,582 --> 00:26:11,424
on that, recalling the earlier quote,

642
00:26:11,472 --> 00:26:13,504
how there's no universal governance

643
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:15,332
model. It's like if we were talking

644
00:26:15,386 --> 00:26:17,876
about ant colony strategies, is it

645
00:26:17,898 --> 00:26:20,196
better to simply have more nest mates or

646
00:26:20,218 --> 00:26:23,488
fewer or bigger brain per body size or

647
00:26:23,514 --> 00:26:25,176
smaller? It's like there isn't a

648
00:26:25,198 --> 00:26:27,364
universal answer because there's

649
00:26:27,412 --> 00:26:29,204
different strategies, in fact multiple

650
00:26:29,252 --> 00:26:31,448
strategies that might be adaptive in a

651
00:26:31,454 --> 00:26:33,624
given niche, but it doesn't really make

652
00:26:33,662 --> 00:26:35,996
sense to even talk about one without the

653
00:26:36,018 --> 00:26:38,236
other, whether you're talking about like

654
00:26:38,258 --> 00:26:40,956
chess or ant colonies or the board. And

655
00:26:40,978 --> 00:26:43,244
so that's where the particular

656
00:26:43,362 --> 00:26:46,084
partitioning active coherence lab helps

657
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:48,252
because it reminds us that the cognitive

658
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,892
process of perception cognition,

659
00:26:50,956 --> 00:26:53,072
including action, selection and then

660
00:26:53,126 --> 00:26:56,192
action and action is happening within

661
00:26:56,246 --> 00:26:59,796
the context of a generative process in

662
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,308
the niche. And that can't be just like

663
00:27:02,474 --> 00:27:04,964
left for later. That's an intrinsic part

664
00:27:05,002 --> 00:27:06,820
of the particular partitioning.

665
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,544
Okay, so here Bijan makes the claim that

666
00:27:15,582 --> 00:27:17,480
essentially there are three important

667
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,684
conclusions to take forward from golden

668
00:27:19,732 --> 00:27:22,880
and Zajac 2001. I don't know if

669
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,908
I said that right. Probably not. First,

670
00:27:24,994 --> 00:27:27,032
demographic and procedural variables

671
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:29,176
impact strategic change, rather curve

672
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:31,976
linearly. Second, power relationships

673
00:27:32,008 --> 00:27:34,472
are critical to understanding the impel

674
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:36,556
versus impede debate and strategic

675
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,104
renewal. And third, attention, focus and

676
00:27:39,142 --> 00:27:41,772
agreement in terms of an okacoian

677
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:44,496
linkage of cognition and structure and

678
00:27:44,518 --> 00:27:48,844
that's in this reference, Ocasio 1997

679
00:27:48,982 --> 00:27:51,796
are a promising venue upon which to

680
00:27:51,818 --> 00:27:55,860
pursue future research. And then

681
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,688
this linkage of cognition and structure

682
00:27:58,864 --> 00:28:01,132
from this paper it's toward an attention

683
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:04,916
based view of the firm from William

684
00:28:04,948 --> 00:28:08,616
Ocasio here he says the

685
00:28:08,638 --> 00:28:10,532
central argument is that firm behavior

686
00:28:10,596 --> 00:28:12,616
is the result of how firms channel and

687
00:28:12,638 --> 00:28:14,584
distribute the attention of their

688
00:28:14,622 --> 00:28:17,076
decision makers. What decision makers do

689
00:28:17,118 --> 00:28:19,036
depends on what issues and answers they

690
00:28:19,058 --> 00:28:21,052
focus their attention on. What issues

691
00:28:21,106 --> 00:28:22,776
and answers they focus on depends upon

692
00:28:22,808 --> 00:28:25,068
the specific situation and on how the

693
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:26,704
firm's rules, resources and

694
00:28:26,742 --> 00:28:29,328
relationships distribute various issues,

695
00:28:29,414 --> 00:28:31,712
answers and decision makers into

696
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:34,560
specific Communications and procedures.

697
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,416
And so that pushes salience, I think to

698
00:28:38,438 --> 00:28:41,590
the forefront, especially with regard to

699
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,196
board collective intelligence, like

700
00:28:44,218 --> 00:28:46,132
maybe the crocheting and knitting and

701
00:28:46,186 --> 00:28:48,436
baking and all those things are not

702
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,052
really relevant. Or maybe they could be.

703
00:28:50,106 --> 00:28:52,024
Maybe this is the explore part where

704
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:53,690
active coherence comes in.

705
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,816
Another link here with attention and

706
00:28:57,838 --> 00:29:00,856
structure and cognition is attention is

707
00:29:00,878 --> 00:29:04,204
something that's more dynamic but it

708
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,644
requires the structural connections like

709
00:29:07,682 --> 00:29:09,816
between brain regions or at the synaptic

710
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:13,196
level or APIs that call each other in a

711
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:16,576
computational system. Those pipes have

712
00:29:16,598 --> 00:29:19,360
to be in place for attention to be

713
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,936
dynamically allocated. And so the

714
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:24,864
structural aspects of the firm are more

715
00:29:24,902 --> 00:29:27,664
like its morphology and then the

716
00:29:27,702 --> 00:29:30,624
attention and the more rapidly changing

717
00:29:30,672 --> 00:29:34,484
aspects are more like perception and

718
00:29:34,602 --> 00:29:37,536
fast changing cognition. And so that's

719
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:39,492
going to be like a theme that gets built

720
00:29:39,546 --> 00:29:42,836
upon are the faster changing,

721
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:46,360
more perceptual and decision making like

722
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,092
components of the firm and the slower

723
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:51,944
changing, more structural elements of

724
00:29:51,982 --> 00:29:52,760
the firm.

725
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,300
Just to build on. That a little bit like

726
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,204
something I've noticed from Fire

727
00:30:00,242 --> 00:30:01,804
companies that even if you have a very

728
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,364
engaged board, like a board that we say

729
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,728
gives a lot of attention within the firm

730
00:30:06,744 --> 00:30:08,860
and has a high attentional capacity,

731
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,928
they may not actually be linking that to

732
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,496
the structure of the firm. So for

733
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:14,156
example, something I've often observed

734
00:30:14,268 --> 00:30:17,024
is that you'll have two people putting

735
00:30:17,142 --> 00:30:19,856
together the quarterly board deck for a

736
00:30:19,878 --> 00:30:22,084
company of like 1000 people. So

737
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:23,396
everything gets processed through this

738
00:30:23,418 --> 00:30:25,956
like tiny funnel of two people who have

739
00:30:25,978 --> 00:30:27,716
to synthesize everything on behalf of

740
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:29,476
the board where they're essentially just

741
00:30:29,498 --> 00:30:31,508
like making the conclusions for the

742
00:30:31,514 --> 00:30:33,588
board at that point. And so if you're

743
00:30:33,604 --> 00:30:35,124
not really linking both the attention

744
00:30:35,172 --> 00:30:36,388
and the structure you're really missing

745
00:30:36,404 --> 00:30:38,696
out on the potential power of your

746
00:30:38,718 --> 00:30:39,290
board.

747
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:47,158
All right, inertia. So inertia you

748
00:30:47,164 --> 00:30:48,454
can think of it really as just like

749
00:30:48,492 --> 00:30:50,986
reluctance to change. Similar to the

750
00:30:51,008 --> 00:30:54,042
idea of boundary rationality is that

751
00:30:54,176 --> 00:30:56,874
there are certain constraints which you

752
00:30:56,912 --> 00:30:58,906
have to reason that board often reasons

753
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:02,320
within. So read a couple of quotes from

754
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,790
Presentation mode.

755
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,146
So I'll read this quote from Hannah

756
00:31:11,178 --> 00:31:14,290
1977. He came up with the original idea

757
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,578
of inertia organizational inertia which

758
00:31:16,664 --> 00:31:20,334
again isn't specific to firms.

759
00:31:20,382 --> 00:31:21,554
It's really an idea that you can apply

760
00:31:21,592 --> 00:31:23,778
to any collective system. So there are a

761
00:31:23,784 --> 00:31:25,286
number of obvious limitations on the

762
00:31:25,308 --> 00:31:26,886
ability of organizations to adapt. That

763
00:31:26,908 --> 00:31:29,142
is, there are a number of processes that

764
00:31:29,196 --> 00:31:33,734
generate structural inertia. And John

765
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:35,474
says that Andrew Corcoran governance

766
00:31:35,522 --> 00:31:37,526
best practice guidelines may rather fuel

767
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:39,526
governance inertia rather than treating

768
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:42,934
the board as an impactful variable

769
00:31:42,982 --> 00:31:45,078
supporting continuous strategic renewal.

770
00:31:45,174 --> 00:31:47,066
And so to make this a little more

771
00:31:47,168 --> 00:31:48,618
concrete, we can kind of go through a

772
00:31:48,624 --> 00:31:50,422
couple of different examples of inertia.

773
00:31:50,486 --> 00:31:52,734
And these all come from Hannah's 2nd 77

774
00:31:52,772 --> 00:31:55,166
paper, where he kind of defined this

775
00:31:55,188 --> 00:31:58,298
idea of organizational inertia. So I'll

776
00:31:58,314 --> 00:31:59,694
list a couple of them. One was that

777
00:31:59,732 --> 00:32:01,318
previously made investments aren't

778
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:03,314
easily transferable. There are

779
00:32:03,352 --> 00:32:05,134
constraints on the information decision

780
00:32:05,262 --> 00:32:07,534
makers receive. There are political

781
00:32:07,582 --> 00:32:10,018
constraints, there are cost of history

782
00:32:10,104 --> 00:32:12,606
to allocate tasks and create procedures.

783
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:14,114
So you've basically done all the work to

784
00:32:14,152 --> 00:32:15,718
figure out who's doing what. It's a lot

785
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:18,706
of work to redo that. There are legal

786
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:20,962
constraints, perceptions of legitimacy.

787
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:22,534
If you were to change course at this

788
00:32:22,572 --> 00:32:25,222
point, unclear how your strategy will

789
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,674
succeed in competitive environments,

790
00:32:26,722 --> 00:32:28,114
like if we do this, how will others

791
00:32:28,172 --> 00:32:30,426
react? And so all of this just creates a

792
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,606
sense of anxiety that people just don't

793
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:35,898
want to confront and they feel good and

794
00:32:35,904 --> 00:32:37,978
comfortable pursuing something that they

795
00:32:37,984 --> 00:32:39,818
already understand. And so you can think

796
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,830
of that as organizational inertia. And

797
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,166
this is particularly a problem with

798
00:32:43,188 --> 00:32:45,486
boards because especially if you have a

799
00:32:45,508 --> 00:32:47,710
board with limited attentional capacity,

800
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,934
they're not going to be putting the time

801
00:32:49,972 --> 00:32:51,342
to really think they're going to work

802
00:32:51,396 --> 00:32:53,506
through that anxiety. They're not going

803
00:32:53,508 --> 00:32:55,266
to be actually doing the hard work to

804
00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:57,106
overcome that. And so you end up kind of

805
00:32:57,128 --> 00:32:58,594
just defaulting to something that people

806
00:32:58,632 --> 00:33:01,314
already understand. And so there's often

807
00:33:01,352 --> 00:33:02,686
something that you hear in organizations

808
00:33:02,718 --> 00:33:05,314
where like, okay, well, we could do this

809
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:07,302
really ambitious thing, and there are

810
00:33:07,356 --> 00:33:08,706
people who might be actually excited

811
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:10,866
about this more exploratory initiative

812
00:33:10,898 --> 00:33:13,158
that you could do, but how are we going

813
00:33:13,164 --> 00:33:15,670
to sell that to the board, right? And

814
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,894
oftentimes it's the CEO has to put their

815
00:33:17,932 --> 00:33:19,434
reputation on the line to sell something

816
00:33:19,472 --> 00:33:21,786
that's more exploratory and risky to the

817
00:33:21,808 --> 00:33:23,526
board who has limited attention

818
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:26,154
capacity. They're anxious about it, so

819
00:33:26,192 --> 00:33:27,962
they just kind of have to trust this one

820
00:33:28,016 --> 00:33:29,798
person to say, yes, go for it, it's

821
00:33:29,814 --> 00:33:32,270
okay. Again, you're not really unlocking

822
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,646
that cognitive power potential of the

823
00:33:35,668 --> 00:33:39,946
board. One more aspect. There on inertia

824
00:33:40,138 --> 00:33:43,010
to connect to the Bayesian physics.

825
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,302
Inertia is something that physical

826
00:33:46,366 --> 00:33:49,294
objects have in classical mechanics,

827
00:33:49,422 --> 00:33:51,986
like whether it's a ball at rest that

828
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:53,926
requires some force to push or whether

829
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,194
it's a bicycle and movement whose

830
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,310
inertia allows it to stay upright.

831
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,634
Inertia is an aspect of physical

832
00:34:01,682 --> 00:34:05,526
objects. And by analogy, in the

833
00:34:05,548 --> 00:34:08,186
Bayesian Physics, the inertia is like

834
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:11,510
the resistance of a prior to be updated

835
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:15,014
to incoming observations. So a prior

836
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:17,478
distribution with a high inertia, it's

837
00:34:17,494 --> 00:34:19,754
like a heavy. Distribution, it's

838
00:34:19,802 --> 00:34:22,526
immovable to new stimuli and that

839
00:34:22,548 --> 00:34:25,226
corresponds to having low attention

840
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:27,086
because it's like as new information

841
00:34:27,188 --> 00:34:30,730
comes in, the prior has high inertia,

842
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:33,346
it doesn't update a lot. Whereas when

843
00:34:33,368 --> 00:34:35,186
there's high attention paid to the

844
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,906
incoming stimuli, in the extreme the

845
00:34:37,928 --> 00:34:39,874
prior just updates to whatever the new

846
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:41,714
stimuli says. That's our new best

847
00:34:41,752 --> 00:34:44,790
estimate. So that's ultra high attention

848
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:48,150
and also very moveable.

849
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:51,480
And that's like a light object.

850
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,518
And so there isn't a general answer.

851
00:34:54,684 --> 00:34:57,846
But this puts us into a framing where we

852
00:34:57,868 --> 00:35:00,694
can think about this structural and

853
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:03,978
attention inertia as part of the

854
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,062
morphological and dynamical cognitive

855
00:35:07,126 --> 00:35:09,226
process of the board and the

856
00:35:09,248 --> 00:35:10,890
organization more generally.

857
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,878
Yeah, I really like that perspective on

858
00:35:14,884 --> 00:35:17,294
it and it makes me think about how, why

859
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:18,702
Bijan is spending so much time thinking

860
00:35:18,756 --> 00:35:20,414
about the board. Because it's kind of

861
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,226
this communication of low attention,

862
00:35:23,418 --> 00:35:26,898
high responsibility for updating the

863
00:35:26,904 --> 00:35:28,626
beliefs of the organization. And so

864
00:35:28,648 --> 00:35:31,730
that's where like a lot of any like

865
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,626
continuous change or transformation

866
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:35,382
would have to happen start the board.

867
00:35:35,436 --> 00:35:36,998
So I understand my Bishop is spending so

868
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:38,758
much time thinking about this and

869
00:35:38,924 --> 00:35:40,454
talking about different models of board

870
00:35:40,492 --> 00:35:41,350
cognition.

871
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,134
Hopman Ant, Al 2019 make an invaluable

872
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:53,946
contribution in moving away from

873
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:56,474
deterministic models that suggest which

874
00:35:56,512 --> 00:35:58,654
specific board configurations and

875
00:35:58,692 --> 00:36:00,606
leadership concentrations enhance board

876
00:36:00,628 --> 00:36:02,798
effectiveness, firm performance and the

877
00:36:02,804 --> 00:36:04,986
firm's overall strategic capability.

878
00:36:05,178 --> 00:36:07,226
Instead, they focus on the board's

879
00:36:07,258 --> 00:36:09,214
better capabilities such as self

880
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:12,034
evolution and self reconfiguration to

881
00:36:12,072 --> 00:36:14,690
power a continuous strategic renewal.

882
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,486
Right. The board's power of visa visa

883
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:21,858
management is strongly related to the

884
00:36:21,864 --> 00:36:23,482
board's hair initiates self evaluation

885
00:36:23,566 --> 00:36:25,106
and self reconfiguration, thereby

886
00:36:25,138 --> 00:36:27,174
encoding that the board can still

887
00:36:27,212 --> 00:36:28,994
critically evaluate strategic proposals

888
00:36:29,042 --> 00:36:31,462
and reconfigure strategies. So

889
00:36:31,516 --> 00:36:33,974
unfortunately though, Hopman and Al do

890
00:36:34,012 --> 00:36:35,602
not go far enough. Since strategic

891
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:37,306
renewal remains balancing by the board

892
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,722
chair, we need governance processes that

893
00:36:39,776 --> 00:36:42,026
neutralize the over dependencies on the

894
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:45,270
chairman and the CEO. So oftentimes

895
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,466
within an organization that has the

896
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,514
board, the chairman is kind of running

897
00:36:49,552 --> 00:36:50,586
the show on the board and their

898
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,638
counterfactuals is the CEO. And they do

899
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,606
a lot of the agenda setting for how the

900
00:36:54,628 --> 00:36:56,494
board actually operates, how much

901
00:36:56,532 --> 00:36:57,822
attention that they're actually giving

902
00:36:57,876 --> 00:36:59,678
on to problems, the kind of information

903
00:36:59,764 --> 00:37:01,918
that's the incoming and available to the

904
00:37:01,924 --> 00:37:04,766
board. And so a lot of responsibility

905
00:37:04,878 --> 00:37:06,274
relies on the board of like how

906
00:37:06,312 --> 00:37:09,138
cognition can actually happen. And I

907
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,798
have been in this position myself, I've

908
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,306
been a board chair. A lot of

909
00:37:12,328 --> 00:37:14,146
responsibility kind of ends up being on

910
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:16,646
you for how well the board and

911
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:18,742
consequently the organization can run.

912
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:21,014
And so what's unfortunate, and something

913
00:37:21,052 --> 00:37:22,566
I've actually tried to do myself, is

914
00:37:22,588 --> 00:37:24,966
like spread the responsibility of the

915
00:37:24,988 --> 00:37:27,526
board chair throughout the board so that

916
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:29,190
cognition doesn't rest on like a single

917
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,046
person, but it's actually more spread

918
00:37:31,078 --> 00:37:34,410
out through that entire cognition unit

919
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,078
and that is difficult to do. So I'm

920
00:37:37,094 --> 00:37:38,958
curious if the genre later on in the

921
00:37:38,964 --> 00:37:42,398
book has some recommendations on how to

922
00:37:42,404 --> 00:37:43,280
structure that.

923
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,502
Daniel Bleu, anything to add here?

924
00:37:47,636 --> 00:37:51,662
Yeah, I'm curious, Tyler, with respect

925
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:54,994
to the Dow world that you live in, what

926
00:37:55,032 --> 00:37:57,474
are some governance processes that do

927
00:37:57,512 --> 00:38:00,750
neutralize that over dependence

928
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,962
on the chairman and CEO of a company?

929
00:38:03,096 --> 00:38:05,526
Can you maybe say a few words about

930
00:38:05,548 --> 00:38:07,320
that? Yeah,

931
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,834
there's a lot of different governance

932
00:38:10,882 --> 00:38:12,646
processes, but I can talk about a couple

933
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:14,598
of them. So one is that if you're doing

934
00:38:14,684 --> 00:38:17,078
especially like token or token based

935
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:20,120
voting with the NFCs or C 20s,

936
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,698
generally most people can make a

937
00:38:22,704 --> 00:38:23,818
proposal. Not anyone can make a

938
00:38:23,824 --> 00:38:25,846
proposal, but a lot of times the agenda

939
00:38:25,878 --> 00:38:27,766
setting can be done in a distributed

940
00:38:27,798 --> 00:38:29,562
way. So it's not necessarily the board

941
00:38:29,616 --> 00:38:31,594
chair and the CEO determining, hey,

942
00:38:31,632 --> 00:38:32,666
these are the things that we're bringing

943
00:38:32,698 --> 00:38:34,606
up to a vote, but that can be done more

944
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:36,366
dynamically. And oftentimes there's a

945
00:38:36,388 --> 00:38:39,406
quorum rules about who can propose. So

946
00:38:39,428 --> 00:38:41,410
it's not like fully decentralized, but

947
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,522
in a sense that agenda setting can be

948
00:38:43,576 --> 00:38:45,970
done more decentralized.

949
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,054
And there's also ways of creating

950
00:38:49,182 --> 00:38:52,578
salience as well without having a

951
00:38:52,584 --> 00:38:54,546
single person at the top saying what is

952
00:38:54,568 --> 00:38:56,166
salient and what matters and what

953
00:38:56,188 --> 00:38:58,066
doesn't. There are different governance

954
00:38:58,098 --> 00:39:00,118
strategies where salience kind of

955
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:03,186
bubbles up and you can kind of determine

956
00:39:03,378 --> 00:39:04,886
certain governance rules, like your

957
00:39:04,908 --> 00:39:08,078
quorum, for example, in a more dynamic

958
00:39:08,114 --> 00:39:11,738
way. And so there's a lot there of how

959
00:39:11,744 --> 00:39:13,466
it can't work. Then there's also how it

960
00:39:13,488 --> 00:39:15,594
actually works in practice and in

961
00:39:15,632 --> 00:39:17,286
reality. A lot of times with Dow

962
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:19,706
governance, usually often Heins like a

963
00:39:19,728 --> 00:39:21,166
couple of people making a lot of the

964
00:39:21,188 --> 00:39:24,366
proposals. And so what's interesting is

965
00:39:24,388 --> 00:39:26,814
that even if you want to be in a more

966
00:39:26,852 --> 00:39:28,750
distributed way, sometimes there's this

967
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,762
pull of gravity towards centralized

968
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,054
decision making. And it really just is

969
00:39:33,092 --> 00:39:34,930
that there's limited attention available

970
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,322
even if you're not saying you're not

971
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,130
legally mandating some kind of

972
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,842
centralized structure. There's just like

973
00:39:41,896 --> 00:39:43,202
only a couple of people who are really

974
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,766
willing to actually synthesize all this

975
00:39:45,788 --> 00:39:47,734
information at any given time,

976
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:50,386
especially within Dows. Dow proposals

977
00:39:50,418 --> 00:39:52,006
are often extremely technical and

978
00:39:52,028 --> 00:39:53,446
there's often limited people who can

979
00:39:53,468 --> 00:39:58,466
even do that if they wanted to. So it's

980
00:39:58,578 --> 00:39:59,906
something that I've been personally

981
00:39:59,938 --> 00:40:01,654
struggling with is thinking about like,

982
00:40:01,692 --> 00:40:04,106
okay, well, there's this world that we

983
00:40:04,128 --> 00:40:05,642
want to live in that's maybe more

984
00:40:05,696 --> 00:40:07,626
decentralized and less hierarchical and

985
00:40:07,648 --> 00:40:09,646
more connected, but there's also just

986
00:40:09,668 --> 00:40:11,966
these constraints on human time and

987
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:14,622
attention effort capabilities that

988
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:16,158
constrains the kind of structures that

989
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,120
you can have.

990
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,646
And hopefully later in the book that

991
00:40:21,668 --> 00:40:23,130
John will have some good recommendations

992
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:25,422
on how you construct your organization,

993
00:40:25,486 --> 00:40:27,618
your board, to kind of mitigate that

994
00:40:27,704 --> 00:40:30,674
pull towards centralized processes. But

995
00:40:30,712 --> 00:40:32,194
it's just something I witnessed a lot in

996
00:40:32,232 --> 00:40:33,540
the data world as well.

997
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:39,222
Cool, thanks. So I think

998
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:42,006
that's the end of the material today.

999
00:40:42,188 --> 00:40:45,046
So next week the chapter is quite a bit

1000
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:48,246
longer. This one was pretty short, but

1001
00:40:48,268 --> 00:40:49,894
yeah, we're looking forward, I think,

1002
00:40:49,932 --> 00:40:53,450
to what Bijan is going to tell us about

1003
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,798
free energy governance. And he's setting

1004
00:40:55,814 --> 00:40:58,058
the stage now for delineating the

1005
00:40:58,064 --> 00:41:00,334
problems. And now how do we go about

1006
00:41:00,372 --> 00:41:02,254
solving them? I'm curious to delve into

1007
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:04,400
this next section with you guys.

1008
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,486
Can I bring up a few points and

1009
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:11,214
questions? Of course. All right. So one

1010
00:41:11,252 --> 00:41:14,066
of them was it described the board as a

1011
00:41:14,088 --> 00:41:17,166
spanner earlier on. And I wondered

1012
00:41:17,198 --> 00:41:19,746
whether the board was kind of like at

1013
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,754
the heart of the onion, insulated by

1014
00:41:22,792 --> 00:41:25,414
more and more layers, or whether the

1015
00:41:25,452 --> 00:41:29,122
board is on the front line interfacing

1016
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:32,982
more publicly in the actual position,

1017
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:35,846
or that person perhaps serving in a

1018
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,766
different position as well, like wearing

1019
00:41:37,798 --> 00:41:41,306
multiple hats. So feel free to give any

1020
00:41:41,408 --> 00:41:42,886
thoughts on that. Or we can just raise

1021
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:45,866
the point. Yeah, I mean, my

1022
00:41:45,888 --> 00:41:48,026
understanding of well, there's like how

1023
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:49,706
it actually works now and then how it

1024
00:41:49,728 --> 00:41:51,758
can work, how it actually works now is I

1025
00:41:51,764 --> 00:41:54,190
think it's often more like in the onion

1026
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,646
where they're getting more refined and

1027
00:41:57,668 --> 00:41:59,114
more refined information that filters

1028
00:41:59,162 --> 00:42:00,622
through a hierarchy until it finally

1029
00:42:00,676 --> 00:42:02,926
gets to the board. And what I think the

1030
00:42:02,948 --> 00:42:04,754
gen is hoping for is something that

1031
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:07,022
resembles more of like a motherboard,

1032
00:42:07,086 --> 00:42:08,786
this integrating unit where there's all

1033
00:42:08,808 --> 00:42:10,338
these connections from other parts of

1034
00:42:10,344 --> 00:42:11,618
the organization. There's still that

1035
00:42:11,624 --> 00:42:13,762
hierarchical structure but is not

1036
00:42:13,816 --> 00:42:15,058
insulated from the rest of the

1037
00:42:15,064 --> 00:42:16,578
organization. And I think that's what

1038
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:19,526
Bijan is getting at. But from my

1039
00:42:19,548 --> 00:42:22,694
understanding of board governance, that

1040
00:42:22,732 --> 00:42:25,126
is less often the case and it's really

1041
00:42:25,148 --> 00:42:26,040
hard to build.

1042
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,642
So I think that that's like a really

1043
00:42:31,696 --> 00:42:33,978
great question and I'd like to really

1044
00:42:34,064 --> 00:42:36,250
kind of explore it more in more detail

1045
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,818
when we get into our discussion section.

1046
00:42:39,914 --> 00:42:42,106
So I think we should add that to the dot

1047
00:42:42,138 --> 00:42:44,000
one list.

1048
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:49,726
Another topic is there was

1049
00:42:49,828 --> 00:42:53,746
the mention of a compliance board

1050
00:42:53,928 --> 00:42:55,586
as well as how a board could be like

1051
00:42:55,608 --> 00:42:58,370
dissonant or impel versus impede.

1052
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:04,760
And so how to balance between

1053
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:10,150
simply going with what the body provides

1054
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:13,894
towards totally wishing things were

1055
00:43:13,932 --> 00:43:15,970
different. It's like in the extreme,

1056
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,626
neither is going to work. So there has

1057
00:43:17,648 --> 00:43:21,146
to be some middle path, but there's no

1058
00:43:21,168 --> 00:43:23,066
universal model. So that's just kind of

1059
00:43:23,088 --> 00:43:27,002
one point and then another one

1060
00:43:27,136 --> 00:43:30,814
was the market centrism of

1061
00:43:30,852 --> 00:43:34,560
a for profit company means that

1062
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,606
in some sense, but please suggest if

1063
00:43:38,628 --> 00:43:42,020
otherwise the financial success

1064
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:46,162
on the broader market will

1065
00:43:46,216 --> 00:43:48,466
define the persistence and the growth of

1066
00:43:48,488 --> 00:43:52,338
the company. So that is kind of like

1067
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,474
projecting this very high dimensional

1068
00:43:55,522 --> 00:43:58,454
space of strategy and competition and

1069
00:43:58,492 --> 00:44:01,954
attention projecting down onto

1070
00:44:02,002 --> 00:44:04,870
a number line, like did the stock price

1071
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:08,266
go up or down? And so to

1072
00:44:08,288 --> 00:44:12,330
what extent do for

1073
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,766
profit and not for profit organizations

1074
00:44:15,798 --> 00:44:19,886
or components of organizations have

1075
00:44:19,988 --> 00:44:24,158
clearer or more

1076
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:27,310
alignable measures?

1077
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,482
It's just like if the only criterion of

1078
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:36,162
cognition was this

1079
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:38,626
one test, then you kind of get the good

1080
00:44:38,648 --> 00:44:41,090
heart's law situation where other

1081
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,066
measures can fall by the wayside. So how

1082
00:44:44,088 --> 00:44:47,854
does that get prevented or ameliorated

1083
00:44:47,902 --> 00:44:50,406
in for profit endeavors. And then on the

1084
00:44:50,428 --> 00:44:52,182
other side, how does that not get

1085
00:44:52,236 --> 00:44:55,318
ignored when there are very real

1086
00:44:55,404 --> 00:44:58,198
material constraints in nonprofits as

1087
00:44:58,204 --> 00:45:01,210
well? Yes, and I forgot to mention

1088
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,618
this point earlier, but it's like a

1089
00:45:02,624 --> 00:45:05,114
really important one that a lot of our

1090
00:45:05,152 --> 00:45:08,602
model of shareholder governance is often

1091
00:45:08,656 --> 00:45:11,406
very culturally specific to America. So

1092
00:45:11,428 --> 00:45:12,446
there are other ways you could think

1093
00:45:12,468 --> 00:45:14,426
about board governance and corporate

1094
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:17,118
governance. So, for example, especially

1095
00:45:17,204 --> 00:45:18,586
in Germany, there's like a stakeholder

1096
00:45:18,618 --> 00:45:21,742
governance model where, for example,

1097
00:45:21,876 --> 00:45:24,462
you are legally required to have a board

1098
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:26,418
member in Germany who is a

1099
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:29,154
representative of the workers. And so

1100
00:45:29,192 --> 00:45:30,738
this is more aligned with like and you

1101
00:45:30,744 --> 00:45:31,886
could think of that. You could expand

1102
00:45:31,918 --> 00:45:33,358
that model too, of like, stakeholder

1103
00:45:33,374 --> 00:45:34,718
governance. That could mean so that's

1104
00:45:34,734 --> 00:45:36,706
just Germany's model where they're like,

1105
00:45:36,728 --> 00:45:39,078
hey, workers rights need to also be

1106
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:41,334
important in addition to profit. Right,

1107
00:45:41,452 --> 00:45:43,206
but you could also expand that to think

1108
00:45:43,228 --> 00:45:44,646
of, okay, well, what if we had an

1109
00:45:44,668 --> 00:45:46,134
advocate for the consumer on the board,

1110
00:45:46,172 --> 00:45:47,946
right? You could expand that idea of

1111
00:45:47,968 --> 00:45:51,478
what a for profit company's stakeholder

1112
00:45:51,494 --> 00:45:53,226
governance model can look like. In

1113
00:45:53,248 --> 00:45:55,146
Japan, for example, there's a lot of for

1114
00:45:55,168 --> 00:45:57,274
profit companies are also family run,

1115
00:45:57,392 --> 00:46:00,250
so there's these family considerations

1116
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:04,106
on top of the for profit incentives

1117
00:46:04,298 --> 00:46:07,870
as well. So then even between

1118
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,886
a C Corp. Like for profit company and

1119
00:46:09,908 --> 00:46:12,606
then a nonprofit, there are different

1120
00:46:12,788 --> 00:46:15,406
legal structures that kind of bridge the

1121
00:46:15,428 --> 00:46:17,378
distance between the two. So one of the

1122
00:46:17,384 --> 00:46:19,938
famous ones is called a B Corp. And so a

1123
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,466
B corp It's essentially the same thing

1124
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:25,942
as C Corp. It can make money. It's a

1125
00:46:25,996 --> 00:46:29,922
for profit company, but in the bylaws,

1126
00:46:29,986 --> 00:46:32,214
they are not legally mandated to only

1127
00:46:32,252 --> 00:46:34,710
maximize for profit. They can also

1128
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,534
maximize for other they call it like

1129
00:46:36,572 --> 00:46:38,470
double bottom line initiatives. So

1130
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,026
there's other things that this for

1131
00:46:40,048 --> 00:46:42,154
profit company can try to do aside from

1132
00:46:42,192 --> 00:46:45,866
just get money. And then there's a lot

1133
00:46:45,888 --> 00:46:47,434
of different permutations of that. Like

1134
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:48,826
a lot of different legal structures can

1135
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,486
have that. And same with the nonprofit,

1136
00:46:50,518 --> 00:46:52,634
too. Even a nonprofit couldn't have ways

1137
00:46:52,672 --> 00:46:55,214
that is trying to get revenue and think

1138
00:46:55,252 --> 00:46:57,566
in a more for profit way, even though

1139
00:46:57,588 --> 00:46:59,066
there aren't people who are shareholders

1140
00:46:59,098 --> 00:47:00,366
who are going to profit from it, but

1141
00:47:00,468 --> 00:47:02,798
they can act in a similar way. So I

1142
00:47:02,804 --> 00:47:05,214
think often, like, the distinctions

1143
00:47:05,262 --> 00:47:07,074
between nonprofit and for profit can

1144
00:47:07,112 --> 00:47:08,706
actually become quite fuzzy in the way

1145
00:47:08,728 --> 00:47:10,606
that we think about for profit

1146
00:47:10,638 --> 00:47:12,702
governance is often very culturally

1147
00:47:12,766 --> 00:47:14,726
centric on how we've done things in the

1148
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,558
US. And in England, not necessarily on

1149
00:47:17,644 --> 00:47:21,718
how it can be done. And as to your

1150
00:47:21,804 --> 00:47:24,834
first point, Daniel, I think I'm curious

1151
00:47:24,882 --> 00:47:26,934
to know what goes into defining or

1152
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:29,306
creating a compliant board or like a

1153
00:47:29,328 --> 00:47:32,886
dissonant board. I would think that it's

1154
00:47:32,998 --> 00:47:35,354
not structured to be a compliant board.

1155
00:47:35,392 --> 00:47:36,538
I mean, maybe they write it into the

1156
00:47:36,544 --> 00:47:38,666
bylaws that the board just agrees with

1157
00:47:38,688 --> 00:47:40,698
everything that everyone does. But I

1158
00:47:40,704 --> 00:47:42,122
think it's more of like an emergence

1159
00:47:42,186 --> 00:47:45,326
property of the board. And does the

1160
00:47:45,348 --> 00:47:48,206
entire board need to be replaced? If say

1161
00:47:48,228 --> 00:47:50,094
you have a compliant board and you want

1162
00:47:50,132 --> 00:47:52,126
more of a strategy driven governing

1163
00:47:52,158 --> 00:47:55,394
board, do you have to completely

1164
00:47:55,512 --> 00:47:59,566
interrupt the norms? Right? Like Bijan

1165
00:47:59,598 --> 00:48:02,178
had said, the norms, if the norm is to

1166
00:48:02,184 --> 00:48:03,934
be compliant, do you have to just erase

1167
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:06,166
everyone to bring in a whole new crew to

1168
00:48:06,188 --> 00:48:08,534
develop new norms? Otherwise that one

1169
00:48:08,572 --> 00:48:09,926
person who's like, oh, let's just go

1170
00:48:09,948 --> 00:48:12,306
along with what everybody says. They'll

1171
00:48:12,338 --> 00:48:14,280
keep that culture alive, right?

1172
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:18,306
To clarify that, I think what Bijan

1173
00:48:18,338 --> 00:48:20,326
meant was compliance board, which is

1174
00:48:20,348 --> 00:48:21,550
more like if you're like a regional

1175
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,098
regulatory, if you're a nuclear power

1176
00:48:23,184 --> 00:48:25,258
plant, for example, you want to have a

1177
00:48:25,264 --> 00:48:27,274
compliance centered board who's making

1178
00:48:27,312 --> 00:48:28,278
sure that you're following all the rules

1179
00:48:28,294 --> 00:48:29,674
and regulations. But I think to your

1180
00:48:29,712 --> 00:48:31,914
point, Bleu like a compliance board is

1181
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:33,706
also an important a lot of boards

1182
00:48:33,738 --> 00:48:35,246
function as compliant. Boards are just

1183
00:48:35,268 --> 00:48:37,454
rubber stamping approvals and that is

1184
00:48:37,572 --> 00:48:40,618
not super useful. So yes, I think that's

1185
00:48:40,634 --> 00:48:43,922
also a good point. And one fun

1186
00:48:44,056 --> 00:48:46,258
topic I think to do a little research

1187
00:48:46,344 --> 00:48:49,794
into is how did we even get here with

1188
00:48:49,832 --> 00:48:53,326
a board? I mean, isn't a board or the

1189
00:48:53,368 --> 00:48:55,446
table that was also mentioned, those are

1190
00:48:55,468 --> 00:48:57,846
just like rectangles. How did we get to

1191
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:00,150
this point where the meeting table

1192
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:03,666
architectures and the people gathered

1193
00:49:03,698 --> 00:49:06,870
around it have become legally

1194
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:09,862
required and then even subconstrained

1195
00:49:09,926 --> 00:49:13,194
from there. And so really, just thinking

1196
00:49:13,312 --> 00:49:16,774
broadly, as I think in the Dow

1197
00:49:16,902 --> 00:49:20,270
and other spaces, people are thinking

1198
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:23,002
broadly about what organizational

1199
00:49:23,066 --> 00:49:25,994
morphologies and what developmental

1200
00:49:26,042 --> 00:49:29,226
trajectories and ecosystems

1201
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:32,370
of shared intelligence facilitate

1202
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:36,978
adaptive cognition and what boards do

1203
00:49:37,064 --> 00:49:40,222
and how they both build on the legacy

1204
00:49:40,366 --> 00:49:44,134
and stay within that lane of what may be

1205
00:49:44,252 --> 00:49:47,174
legally required for compliance as well

1206
00:49:47,212 --> 00:49:50,246
as innovate and move beyond some of

1207
00:49:50,268 --> 00:49:53,062
these shortcomings and fallacies that

1208
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:56,306
boards can fall into. Yeah, I've

1209
00:49:56,338 --> 00:49:58,214
actually looked into this a little bit

1210
00:49:58,252 --> 00:50:01,546
about how why boards are a thing. And

1211
00:50:01,568 --> 00:50:03,270
like, for example, a nonprofit boards,

1212
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:04,970
they were just designed for a different

1213
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,986
time when a lot of times you were just

1214
00:50:07,008 --> 00:50:09,258
getting basically foundations that had a

1215
00:50:09,264 --> 00:50:10,506
bunch of money that they were going to

1216
00:50:10,528 --> 00:50:11,978
allocate and they were like top down

1217
00:50:12,064 --> 00:50:13,794
driven models. Not necessarily

1218
00:50:13,862 --> 00:50:16,174
dynamically responding to the world

1219
00:50:16,212 --> 00:50:17,642
around them and dynamically changing.

1220
00:50:17,706 --> 00:50:19,546
And I think the law for profit

1221
00:50:19,578 --> 00:50:20,718
corporations, it was kind of like a

1222
00:50:20,724 --> 00:50:23,486
similar idea is like we are going to try

1223
00:50:23,508 --> 00:50:25,454
to this boat and we're going to go to

1224
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:26,914
this other country and we're going to do

1225
00:50:26,952 --> 00:50:28,066
trade there and we're going to come

1226
00:50:28,088 --> 00:50:30,450
back. Right? It was a more simple and

1227
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,446
linear model of thinking about planning

1228
00:50:32,558 --> 00:50:34,002
and so they're just made for a different

1229
00:50:34,056 --> 00:50:36,274
world. And I think now there's a lot of

1230
00:50:36,312 --> 00:50:37,826
legal infrastructure that has built up

1231
00:50:37,848 --> 00:50:39,474
around them. So actually innovating

1232
00:50:39,522 --> 00:50:41,366
around that is really difficult. So for

1233
00:50:41,388 --> 00:50:43,078
example, one thing. I've been working on

1234
00:50:43,084 --> 00:50:44,630
a nonprofit recently. We were like,

1235
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,198
well, we don't want to have a board. We

1236
00:50:46,204 --> 00:50:47,718
want to be more community tripping. We

1237
00:50:47,724 --> 00:50:50,086
want to be a co op. And so then we look

1238
00:50:50,108 --> 00:50:51,766
into being co op. And actually the legal

1239
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,194
infrastructure for setting it up is

1240
00:50:53,232 --> 00:50:54,906
actually just like, not developed at

1241
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:56,854
all. You basically have to have a lawyer

1242
00:50:56,902 --> 00:50:58,250
spend thousands and thousands of dollars

1243
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,578
to actually figure out how that's going

1244
00:50:59,584 --> 00:51:01,414
to work. And it's also very precarious

1245
00:51:01,462 --> 00:51:03,326
to even know if this thing is even going

1246
00:51:03,348 --> 00:51:05,342
to work. So it's just really this well,

1247
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:07,214
trodden path has just been beaten down

1248
00:51:07,252 --> 00:51:08,526
over and over again because it's the

1249
00:51:08,548 --> 00:51:09,854
path of least resistance, but not

1250
00:51:09,892 --> 00:51:12,500
necessarily the optimal one for

1251
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:15,858
cognition within the company or a

1252
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,590
nonprofit. I was going to say earlier,

1253
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:20,386
how did we get here to this board?

1254
00:51:20,488 --> 00:51:23,694
Right? And it's a script. It's a script

1255
00:51:23,742 --> 00:51:26,360
that has become solidified into law.

1256
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,646
And it's the same thing, like when you

1257
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,258
have a compliant board, like the rubber

1258
00:51:30,274 --> 00:51:33,282
stampers. And that's just also a script

1259
00:51:33,346 --> 00:51:35,994
that they have followed. So that's why

1260
00:51:36,032 --> 00:51:38,362
they're all compliant and not really

1261
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:39,578
kind of leveraging the type of

1262
00:51:39,584 --> 00:51:41,110
governance that would be maybe optimal

1263
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:42,780
for the strategy of the company.

1264
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:50,302
Okay, cool. Yeah. Any other final

1265
00:51:50,356 --> 00:51:52,206
thoughts? Or we can hold it, table it

1266
00:51:52,228 --> 00:51:54,110
for the upcoming discussion.

1267
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:58,558
Rhythms of Cognition, rhythms of the

1268
00:51:58,564 --> 00:52:02,770
Year. The agenda, setting the agenda.

1269
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:05,042
Communicating with the board. Board

1270
00:52:05,096 --> 00:52:06,926
communicating with the organization.

1271
00:52:07,118 --> 00:52:09,506
Organization. Communicating outside the

1272
00:52:09,528 --> 00:52:12,866
organization. It's great

1273
00:52:12,968 --> 00:52:16,518
topics, and I think we're three

1274
00:52:16,604 --> 00:52:19,414
deep into the series, and we're just

1275
00:52:19,452 --> 00:52:21,782
going to continue to see how the

1276
00:52:21,836 --> 00:52:25,366
scholarship and the legacy of a

1277
00:52:25,388 --> 00:52:28,706
lot of conventional and even heterodox

1278
00:52:28,738 --> 00:52:31,126
thinking and management is taking the

1279
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,238
next step with this book and the

1280
00:52:33,244 --> 00:52:34,966
