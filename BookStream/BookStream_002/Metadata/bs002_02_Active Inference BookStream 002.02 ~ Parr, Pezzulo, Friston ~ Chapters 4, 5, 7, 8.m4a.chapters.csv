3600	52610	00:03	We're in active inference textbook group Slash Bookstream 2.02. What we're going to do today is give a short overview of the chapters from the par at all 2022 book. This is the second in that work.	Short overview of the chapters from the 2022 textbook, Slash Bookstream	A Short Overview of The Par at All 2022 Book
53400	249020	00:53	 chapter four is called Degenerative Models of Active Inference. It lays out the foundation constructing active inference models both for discrete time situations and continuous time ones. This is probably one of the most challenging and at least mathematically dense chapters in the book.	Ali: Chapter four lays out the foundation constructing active inference models	Chapter 4, Generative Models of Active Inference
249760	389252	04:09	Section 4.2 from Bayesian inference to free energy. Using Jane's inequality principle to derive an upper bound. These are the problems of inferring states of the world perception and inferring a course of action planning.	Section 4.2 from Bayesian inference to free energy is discussed	Bayesian Inferring to Free Energy
389396	618310	06:29	Each of these equations provide a distinct step toward deriving the ultimate whole picture. Ultimately what we would need in order to develop active inference models is the ultimate equation. This is just a way to elucidate the steps toward developing that wholePicture.	Each of these equations provides a distinct step toward deriving the ultimate whole picture	The ultimate whole picture of inference
624420	928890	10:24	Section 4.3 generative Models. This chapter deals both with discrete time and continuous time situations. To calculate the free energy, we need three things data, a family of variational distributions and a generative model comprising a prior and a likelihood.	Section 4.3 generative models deals both with discrete and continuous time situations	4.3 Generative Models for Active Inference
930430	1092430	15:30	Section 4.4 goes into essentially the top half of Figure 4.3 discrete time. At this point I would very much like to recommend following the material from step by step paper. Let's kind of just go past it now back to the regularly scheduled continuous time generative model discussion.	Section 4.4 discusses Palm DP models for discrete time and continuous time	4.1 Continuous Time Generative Models
1092850	1243838	18:12	The key distinction between the free energy principle as described in active inference literature is the LaPlace approximation. This is what enables us to go from Gibbs free energy to the variation of free energy. And obviously the concept of generalized coordinates of motion will come time and time again throughout the whole book.	The key distinction between the free energy principle as described in active inference literature is this distinction	Inactive Inference 4.2 and 4.3
1243924	1344750	20:43	 approximate Bayesian inference may be framed as minimizing a quantity known as variational free energy. This depends on a generative model that expresses our belief about how data are generated. I believe the first part of the book, conceptually and mathematically, ends here.	The key message to take away is that approximate Bayesian inference may be framed	Bayesian Inferance, Chapter 4
1344900	1747420	22:24	 chapter five is called Message Passing and Neurobiology. It provides a preliminary sketch for the process theory of active inference. It's far from an extensive theory, but it can provide important signposts for anyone who wants to further investigate this area.	Chapter five is called Message Passing and Neurobiology	Overall Review of Active Inference 5
1747760	2055030	29:07	This chapter begins from how message passing happens in neurobiological terms. Then compares it to the way active inference frames this message passing mechanism. It's not a direct one to one mapping between these two models.	This chapter compares how message passing happens in the brain to active inference	Bayesian inference 5.2, Microcircuits and messages
2056330	2250866	34:16	5.3 is motor commands leaving the prefrontal cortex. 5.3 moves to the other half of active inference framework. How it can model the decision making and ultimately the movement of the agent. We will see a bit more detail about those terms and the relation between them in chapter eight.	Section 5.3 provides a good summary of motor command systems of neurobiology	Motor Commands and the neural architecture of inference
2250978	2644900	37:30	Section 5.4 subcortical structures. This is based on at least some of the important elements we've seen from the previous chapters. 5.6 goes to Continuous and Discrete Hierarchies, which is graphically overviewed in Figure 5.5. Anything else you want to say about five?	Section 5.4 focuses on subcortical structures in decision making	Inactive Inference 5.4
2645670	2828470	44:05	 chapter seven is called Active Inference and Discrete Time. Chapter eight on Discrete and Continuous Time. I think these two chapters are really helpful in order to consolidate our understandings from the previous chapters.	Chapter seven on Active Inference and Discrete Time with chapter eight on Continuous Time	Neuroscience: Active Inference and Discrete Time
2829160	3272660	47:09	7.3 introduces a key motif which is decision making and planning as inference. This is the idea of having a Bayes graph where the variables can relate to different things. This can act as a kind of toy example to use this kind of probabilistic modeling to describe situations.	Bayesian inference can be used to describe discrete time situations	Inferring from perceptual data in 7.3
3275850	3425960	54:35	Thanks. Here's a visualization of the situation with the rat in this case where there's a pleasant and aversive stimuli on each end of a decision point. Figure 7.4 builds up on the previous section and adds other elements. Variation free energy can be used to formulate the trade off between the information seeking and information seeking.	Figure 7.4 describes the epistemic value of observing a queue	The generative model 7.4
3427530	3699630	57:07	7.5 again adds another dimension to the previous formulations. This time, we get to update the generative models by learning. The situation here or the case study shows how the different components of active inference can be connected to each other.	7.5 again adds another dimension to the previous formulations	Inference 7.5: The situation of learning and information seeking
3699970	4002800	1:01:39	First, a box 7.3 interlude on structure learning. This section works towards the idea of nested inference or multiscale modeling. Figure 712 is an example of the composability of generative models. 713 gives another example of linguistic learning through reading.	This section works towards the idea of nested inference or multiscale modeling	Inner-layered inference and learning 7
4003730	4474790	1:06:43	 chapter eight is called active inference in continuous time. Box 8.1 goes into a very fascinating topic. It's maybe one of the most thought provoking pages of the whole book. It kind of gets to really interesting, but alas, very brief discussion.	Next chapter is called active inference in continuous time	Active Inference in Continuous Time (Chapter 8)
4475130	4730410	1:14:35	Next they go to a classic model family called Lockable Terra. These dynamics inherit from characterizations of predator prey dynamics in ecology. And that evinces this kind of oscillatory but also moving behavior that gets connected in Figure 8.3 to neurobiology. The same modeling framework can give rise to different outcomes.	Figure 8.2 shows some applications of altera dynamics to ecology	Neurobiology and the dynamical systems theory
4730480	5180150	1:18:50	Active inference can be successfully used to characterize even chaotic systems. This kind of synchrony between two chaotic systems can be interpreted as providing evidence or even, let's say, a way to model a primitive theory of mind. And it leads to interesting philosophical questions about what needs to be accounted for.	Section 8.4 is about generalized synchrony between chaotic systems	Active Inference 7, Continuous Time Inference
5180230	5419300	1:26:20	How can processes be described using FEP assertions in terms of their intraaction with the environment in which they co constitute themselves? This is one of the interesting philosophical points that I think needs to be elaborated a bit. Active inference provides a clear, precise mathematical formalism.	Mahault and I discuss how processes can be described using FEP assertions	Coming soon: The ontological processes of emergence
5420950	5443780	1:30:20	All right. Next time we will do probably 910 and maybe something else. All right, I'll end it now. Thanks, Ali. Bye.	All right. Well, that's it. I guess next time we will do probably 910 and maybe something else	Q&A with Ali
