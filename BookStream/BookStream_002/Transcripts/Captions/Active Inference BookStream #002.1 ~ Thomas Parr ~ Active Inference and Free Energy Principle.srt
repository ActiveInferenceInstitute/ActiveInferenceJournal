1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,601
Daniel: Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:11,242
It's February 27, 2023.

3
00:00:07,767 --> 00:00:19,029
We're here active Inference lab

4
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:19,029
bookstream number 2.1 with Thomas Parr as

5
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:19,029
well as Terry and Ali.

6
00:00:11,255 --> 00:00:21,266
So thank you all for joining.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,536
This should be a very fun discussion.

8
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:41,241
And let's go first by way of of

9
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:41,241
introduction and beginning to thomas,

10
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:41,241
welcome and please, how did you come to

11
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:41,241
write this textbook in collaboration with

12
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:41,241
Pazulo and Friston?

13
00:00:24,554 --> 00:00:46,750
Thomas: Well, again, thank you very much

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:46,750
for having me here.

15
00:00:43,427 --> 00:00:49,034
How did we come to write the textbook?

16
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:50,142
Good question.

17
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:57,794
I think Giovanni was the person who

18
00:00:57,794 --> 00:00:57,794
really had the idea and pushed for this.

19
00:00:52,330 --> 00:01:07,214
But I think Carl had already previously

20
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:07,214
been approached by the editor who ended

21
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:07,214
up managing application of the book.

22
00:00:57,801 --> 00:01:26,134
And when Giovanni had the idea that this

23
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:26,134
would be a really useful contribution, he

24
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:26,134
and I had a number of discussions about

25
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:26,134
it both in London and in Rome where he's

26
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:26,134
based, and sort of put out a plan and

27
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:26,134
sort of came up with something that we

28
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:26,134
hoped would be useful for the community.

29
00:01:08,355 --> 00:01:37,210
I suppose part of the reason why we

30
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:37,210
thought it'd be a useful thing to do is

31
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:37,210
that active inference is a very

32
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:37,210
multidisciplinary type field that draws a

33
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:37,210
lot from lots of different domains.

34
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:55,101
And I think one of the struggles we all

35
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:55,101
had when we started out in it and I think

36
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:55,101
certainly what students and people who

37
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:55,101
are interested in the topics say to us is

38
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:55,101
that it's often quite difficult trying to

39
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:55,101
find all of these different topics,

40
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:55,101
trying to find the right background when

41
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:55,101
they don't all come from one field.

42
00:01:37,244 --> 00:02:07,168
So putting it all together in one book

43
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:07,168
with a consistent notation, consistent

44
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:07,168
language, and trying to make it complete,

45
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:07,168
we hoped would just make the field a

46
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:07,168
little bit more accessible to others who

47
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:07,168
wanted to get involved.

48
00:01:55,102 --> 00:02:23,324
Daniel: How did this dovetail or

49
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:23,324
integrate with your own education and

50
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:23,324
research directions, like what phases or

51
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:23,324
stages were you moving through while this

52
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:23,324
discussion was happening?

53
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:26,356
Thomas: Well, I think so.

54
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:32,410
When we initially started discussing it,

55
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:32,410
it must have been probably the last year

56
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:32,410
of my PhD.

57
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:40,497
So by that stage I've spent two to three

58
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:40,497
years sort of getting to grips with

59
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:40,497
active inference.

60
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:52,614
Having spent being relatively recent in

61
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:52,614
terms of learning some of the key

62
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:52,614
material myself, I think it was quite a

63
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:52,614
good stage to be at in terms of thinking

64
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:52,614
about what I would have wanted to know a

65
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:52,614
few years previously.

66
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:58,679
The actual writing of the book then

67
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:58,679
carried on over the next year or two.

68
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:17,804
And so by that stage I was back in

69
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:17,804
clinical training as well, which I think

70
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:17,804
is also a useful perspective in terms of

71
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:17,804
some of the later chapters in thinking

72
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:17,804
about application of active

73
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:17,804
infrastructure models in the context of

74
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:17,804
clinical conditions and psychiatry and

75
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:17,804
neurology and those sorts of areas.

76
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:22,853
Daniel: That's actually a really

77
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:22,853
interesting note.

78
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:40,029
How did the clinical experiences give a

79
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:40,029
perspective on the book or how did the

80
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:40,029
book or your learning in these abstract

81
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:40,029
and theoretical domains give a different

82
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:40,029
insight in the clinical setting?

83
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:48,118
Thomas: It's a good question, and I think

84
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:48,118
you're right to highlight the bi

85
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:48,118
directionality of it.

86
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:52,150
Both are useful in different ways.

87
00:03:49,123 --> 00:04:04,210
I think for me, the clinical setting is

88
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:04,210
quite useful in terms of thinking, first

89
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:04,210
of all, interacting with a different sort

90
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:04,210
of audience.

91
00:03:53,161 --> 00:04:13,305
So people who may be much more skilled on

92
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:13,305
the clinical side of things maybe have

93
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:13,305
less experience on the mathematical,

94
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:13,305
computational side of things, but may

95
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:13,305
still find concepts very useful.

96
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:18,358
So from that side of things, it's quite a

97
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:18,358
useful exercise in being able to

98
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:18,358
communicate things.

99
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:26,433
And then there's sort of the interaction

100
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:26,433
on the patient side of things and trying

101
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:26,433
to I think it makes a big difference.

102
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:37,541
First of all, interacting with patients

103
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:37,541
has an impact on how you might think

104
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:37,541
about the interesting questions and the

105
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:37,541
things you might want to use to inference

106
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:37,541
for.

107
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:47,643
But also having an understanding of

108
00:04:47,643 --> 00:04:47,643
principles behind it helps you, I think,

109
00:04:47,643 --> 00:04:47,643
formulate your questions about how

110
00:04:47,643 --> 00:04:47,643
individual patients might present or the

111
00:04:47,643 --> 00:04:47,643
reasons for that.

112
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:51,688
I think it's a useful way of thinking

113
00:04:51,688 --> 00:04:51,688
about, I mean, I suppose on two levels.

114
00:04:47,647 --> 00:05:13,841
So one in terms of understanding

115
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:13,841
understanding particular sorts of

116
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:13,841
pathology, in terms of the inferences

117
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:13,841
that might have gone wrong, but also in

118
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:13,841
terms of understanding your own active

119
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:13,841
inferential processes when you're trying

120
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:13,841
to work out what's going on yourself,

121
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:13,841
asking the right sort of questions, to

122
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:13,841
gather the right sort of information and

123
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:13,841
test those internal hypotheses.

124
00:04:51,688 --> 00:05:17,883
I think that's a very useful way of

125
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:17,883
thinking about being a doctor.

126
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:23,941
Daniel: Awesome.

127
00:05:22,935 --> 00:05:23,945
Thomas: Yeah.

128
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:25,963
Daniel: A lot to say about that.

129
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:29,002
The Bayesian optimal differential

130
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:29,002
diagnosis.

131
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:38,091
Ali or Terry, on any of these thoughts,

132
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:38,091
do you have any questions or comments you

133
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:38,091
want to raise there or any followups.

134
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:52,237
Ali: Well, yes, actually, I just wanted

135
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:52,237
to ask what are the intended audience of

136
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:52,237
the book and what do you think are the

137
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:52,237
minimum prerequisites for going through

138
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:52,237
the whole book?

139
00:05:40,109 --> 00:06:09,346
Because I'm sure you'll agree that even

140
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:09,346
today the intersection between the people

141
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:09,346
who are well versed in mathematics and

142
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:09,346
the people who have a solid background

143
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:09,346
in, say, neurobiology are quite narrow.

144
00:05:52,238 --> 00:06:25,503
So what's the solution here, and what did

145
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:25,503
you think about the organizational

146
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:25,503
structure of the book that could

147
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:25,503
accommodate various audiences?

148
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:33,583
Thomas: Again, another really good

149
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:33,583
question, and I think you're right to

150
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:33,583
highlight that.

151
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:44,697
That intersection is relatively narrow

152
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:44,697
and there are lots of people who I think

153
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:44,697
struggle to feel involved in those kinds

154
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:44,697
of discussions, and you're absolutely

155
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:44,697
right to say that.

156
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:54,789
And I think one of the solutions is the

157
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:54,789
sorts of things that you guys are doing

158
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:54,789
in terms of setting up these reading

159
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:54,789
groups, trying to open that up, trying to

160
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:54,789
provide ethical, educational resources.

161
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:56,809
I think that's really very important.

162
00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:04,838
In terms of the specific questions about

163
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:04,838
the book itself, who's the audience well

164
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:04,838
and what are the prerequisites?

165
00:06:57,824 --> 00:07:10,894
I think it sort of depends what you want

166
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:10,894
to get out of this and what your purpose

167
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:10,894
is in reading it.

168
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:17,964
So some aspects of the book, I suppose,

169
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:17,964
will appeal more to some audiences and

170
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:17,964
others to other kinds of audience.

171
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:33,120
I would hope that the readership or the

172
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,120
audience is relatively broad because

173
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,120
we've tried to provide as much background

174
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,120
as we can on sort of the mathematical and

175
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,120
the neurobiological side of things to try

176
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,120
and complement the skill.

177
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:44,233
Set of whoever's not in that

178
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:44,233
intersection, who comes to it, who may

179
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:44,233
need a bit more sort of neurobiological

180
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:44,233
grounding or who may need a bit more

181
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:44,233
mathematical and technical grounding.

182
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:54,337
But I think ultimately, like with most

183
00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:54,337
textbooks, you don't necessarily need to

184
00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:54,337
come to it thinking, I'm going to

185
00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:54,337
understand everything in this book when I

186
00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:54,337
come away from it.

187
00:07:45,246 --> 00:08:08,410
Some people may want to, but other

188
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:08,410
people, depending upon what they want to

189
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:08,410
get out of it, they might say, actually,

190
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:08,410
what I really want to get out of this is

191
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:08,410
an understanding of some of the kind of

192
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:08,410
message passing as it manifests in the

193
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:08,410
brain.

194
00:07:54,338 --> 00:08:15,487
Whereas other people might come to us and

195
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:15,487
say, actually, I already understand a bit

196
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:15,487
about that, and what I want to get out of

197
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:15,487
this is to understand a bit more of the

198
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:15,487
technical detail.

199
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:22,559
If you're a roboticist coming to this, it

200
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:22,559
probably doesn't matter too much about

201
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:22,559
how things are implemented in the brain.

202
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:30,637
If you're a neurobiologist coming to

203
00:08:30,637 --> 00:08:30,637
this, you may not need to know the

204
00:08:30,637 --> 00:08:30,637
details of the implementation as long as

205
00:08:30,637 --> 00:08:30,637
you can understand it conceptually.

206
00:08:23,561 --> 00:08:39,721
And I hope the organization, particularly

207
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:39,721
putting things like appendices of the

208
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:39,721
detailed information at the back, tries

209
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:39,721
to keep most of the text a bit more

210
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:39,721
accessible.

211
00:08:30,637 --> 00:08:48,815
The early chapters being relatively light

212
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:48,815
on the technical material and building up

213
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:48,815
the concepts before then moving into the

214
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:48,815
more technical aspects.

215
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:53,866
Daniel: About the chapters.

216
00:08:51,839 --> 00:09:09,969
Actually, just take a quick look at the

217
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:09,969
chapters we're in the Koda document that

218
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:09,969
we use, so perhaps you could just say one

219
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:09,969
or a few sentences on each chapter.

220
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:13,005
What's the short of each chapter?

221
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:18,056
What is it doing in this ten chapter

222
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:18,056
work?

223
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:21,081
Thomas: Testing my memory.

224
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:23,102
Daniel: Now, the titles are there.

225
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:24,109
The queues are there.

226
00:09:23,102 --> 00:09:24,117
Thomas: Titles are there.

227
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,132
Daniel: Epistemic queues are there?

228
00:09:24,117 --> 00:09:36,237
Thomas: Okay, well, the overview is what

229
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:36,237
it says on the tin, the description of

230
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:36,237
what's to come in the subsequent chapters

231
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:36,237
to try and try and orientate people.

232
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:40,271
The low road and high road I think.

233
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:59,468
Again, giovanni has to take credit for

234
00:09:59,468 --> 00:09:59,468
this idea of saying actually, it's often

235
00:09:59,468 --> 00:09:59,468
difficult to know where to begin when

236
00:09:59,468 --> 00:09:59,468
you're trying to understand active

237
00:09:59,468 --> 00:09:59,468
inference and the free energy principle

238
00:09:59,468 --> 00:09:59,468
and the Bayesian brain and all those

239
00:09:59,468 --> 00:09:59,468
sorts of things, because it seems like

240
00:09:59,468 --> 00:09:59,468
there are so many potential starting

241
00:09:59,468 --> 00:09:59,468
points, all of which, ultimately, I

242
00:09:59,468 --> 00:09:59,468
think, get at the same thing.

243
00:09:40,272 --> 00:10:03,443
But knowing where you begin is often

244
00:10:03,443 --> 00:10:03,443
really quite difficult.

245
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:10,514
And so these two chapters were designed

246
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:10,514
to explicitly acknowledge that

247
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:10,514
difficulty.

248
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:28,692
So the idea of the low road is to say,

249
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:28,692
well, let's take a pragmatic perspective

250
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:28,692
where we take ideas that have developed

251
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:28,692
in neuroscience based upon our

252
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:28,692
understanding of the brain and of

253
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:28,692
psychology, and models that have been

254
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:28,692
developed to explain those things.

255
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:43,846
And let's take those to their conclusion,

256
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:43,846
which is, in essence, the free energy

257
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:43,846
principle, which active inference lab the

258
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:43,846
idea of using our internal models both to

259
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:43,846
drive behavior and to understand what's

260
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:43,846
going on in the world around us.

261
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:48,899
The high road perspective was designed to

262
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:48,899
take a different approach to that.

263
00:10:45,860 --> 00:11:02,972
And instead of starting from what's

264
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:02,972
already being developed and the sort of

265
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:02,972
natural trajectory in the neurosciences,

266
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:02,972
the High Road chapter was more saying

267
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:02,972
let's start from first principles as much

268
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:02,972
as we can.

269
00:10:48,899 --> 00:11:15,102
And it was a tricky balance to try and

270
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:15,102
make sure that we didn't go too far in

271
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:15,102
depth, that we put people off by the

272
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:15,102
third chapter, but enough that people

273
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:15,102
might get a bit of a conceptual sense of

274
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:15,102
where you might go with this.

275
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:33,286
And here we sort of started from the kind

276
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:33,286
of physics, the cells organization, the

277
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:33,286
ideas that come underneath that, and how

278
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:33,286
those ideas can then feed back into the

279
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:33,286
same idea of accidents that the

280
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:33,286
neuroscientists and psychology seem to

281
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:33,286
have arrived at relatively naturally.

282
00:11:16,115 --> 00:11:46,418
But chapter four is when things start

283
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:46,418
getting a bit more technical and starts

284
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:46,418
dealing with the specifics that I think

285
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:46,418
most people would want to know if they

286
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:46,418
were implementing these models

287
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:46,418
themselves.

288
00:11:35,301 --> 00:12:01,507
So trying to understand exactly how you

289
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:01,507
construct an internal model, how you

290
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:01,507
specify it, write it down mathematically,

291
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:01,507
how you, how you perform inference with

292
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:01,507
those, how you understand message passing

293
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:01,507
schemes.

294
00:11:48,437 --> 00:12:10,597
Chapter five then takes a step back and

295
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:10,597
thinks, well, in the context of the

296
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:10,597
brain, in the context of neurobiology,

297
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:10,597
what do those things actually look like?

298
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:19,685
How do we understand those inferential

299
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:19,685
processes of different kinds of

300
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:19,685
generative models in terms of what we

301
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:19,685
know about message passing and synaptic

302
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:19,685
communication?

303
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:34,835
And those five chapters together really

304
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:34,835
are the first part of the book and the

305
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:34,835
subsequent five chapters really then take

306
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:34,835
you through the idea of actually applying

307
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:34,835
those ideas in in particular domains.

308
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:40,897
So chapter six is sort of the overview

309
00:12:40,897 --> 00:12:40,897
chapter, looking at the rest of it and

310
00:12:40,897 --> 00:12:40,897
it's really setting out.

311
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:49,979
If you wanted to sit down and design a

312
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:49,979
model, either conceptually or

313
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:49,979
computationally, these are the steps you

314
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:49,979
would have to go through to construct

315
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:49,979
that.

316
00:12:40,898 --> 00:13:09,124
And then chapters seven and eight take

317
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:09,124
you through that sort of recipe for

318
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:09,124
several examples, building up different

319
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:09,124
concepts, both the models designed in

320
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:09,124
discrete time where you're formulating

321
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:09,124
things with a sequence of events, and

322
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:09,124
models formulated in continuous time.

323
00:12:49,983 --> 00:13:13,163
We work with continuous dynamical systems

324
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:13,163
and differential equations.

325
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:25,287
Chapter Nine as I mentioned before, one

326
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:25,287
of my interests is in the clinical domain

327
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:25,287
and trying to understand what sort of

328
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:25,287
models people use to perform inference

329
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:25,287
how those can go wrong.

330
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:37,402
And part of the research on that is

331
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:37,402
thinking, well, how do we then fit these

332
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:37,402
models and use them to actually draw

333
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:37,402
inferences about what's going on,

334
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:37,402
particular individuals or groups of

335
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:37,402
individuals?

336
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:49,521
And then chapter ten takes the broadest

337
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:49,521
perspective and looks at how that relates

338
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:49,521
to a range of other theories and ideas

339
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:49,521
both in the neurosciences and beyond.

340
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:52,559
And then I'm sure the appendices speak

341
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:52,559
for themselves.

342
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:56,590
Daniel: Awesome.

343
00:13:55,582 --> 00:13:58,610
Great overview.

344
00:13:56,592 --> 00:14:00,576
Let's come back to our questions.

345
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:10,679
So you laid out that the first half of

346
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:10,679
the book is about learning and the second

347
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:10,679
half of the book is about applying, and

348
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:10,679
it begins with that recipe.

349
00:14:00,577 --> 00:14:23,804
So if chapter six is the recipe, as a

350
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:23,804
chef and sous chef yourself, what else

351
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:23,804
have you found was important in the

352
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:23,804
restaurant?

353
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:29,868
What does your full stack active

354
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:29,868
inference modeling look like?

355
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:49,062
And maybe summarizing in six or going

356
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:49,062
beyond what was in six like, what have

357
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:49,062
you found to be important as part of the

358
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:49,062
modeling journey, especially with teams

359
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:49,062
where people might have like, different

360
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:49,062
levels of domain specific knowledge or

361
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:49,062
active knowledge?

362
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:54,110
Thomas: I like the restaurant analogy,

363
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:54,110
actually.

364
00:14:51,088 --> 00:15:03,141
The first thing that anybody needs to do

365
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:03,141
if they're setting up a restaurant or a

366
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:03,141
model is thinking about who their

367
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:03,141
customers are and what they might want.

368
00:14:55,127 --> 00:15:10,214
And so in the scientific domain, you're

369
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:10,214
thinking, well, what sort of journal am I

370
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:10,214
planning on submitting this to?

371
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:16,277
What sort of questions are the

372
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:16,277
communities who read those journal

373
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:16,277
articles interested in?

374
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:31,428
And I think that's a really important

375
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:31,428
first step so that, you know, what I'm

376
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:31,428
actually trying to do with this model,

377
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:31,428
what's not such a good idea often,

378
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:31,428
although you can find interesting things

379
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:31,428
by doing it, is to say, well, I'm going

380
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:31,428
to develop a model and work out what it's

381
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:31,428
for later on.

382
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:35,469
You can end up sort of tying yourself up

383
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:35,469
a little bit by doing that.

384
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:52,635
Although there is value in exploring, as

385
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:52,635
I think we would all agree, I suppose in

386
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:52,635
terms of ingredients, it's relatively

387
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:52,635
straightforward and deliberately so.

388
00:15:36,471 --> 00:16:06,711
I suppose the idea of these sorts of

389
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:06,711
models is that they should be relatively

390
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:06,711
accessible, relatively easy to construct,

391
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:06,711
without having to make use of large

392
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:06,711
supercomputers or anything like that.

393
00:15:52,636 --> 00:16:11,765
A lot of the models that I develop can be

394
00:16:11,765 --> 00:16:11,765
run on a laptop, fairly

395
00:16:11,765 --> 00:16:11,765
straightforwardly.

396
00:16:06,713 --> 00:16:35,004
So obviously, just picking your computing

397
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:35,004
language and how you're going to

398
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:35,004
construct that, there are now a couple of

399
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:35,004
different options out there, matlab being

400
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:35,004
the one that I think is most well

401
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:35,004
developed, but now lots of people

402
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:35,004
developing Python based implementations

403
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:35,004
of accident schemes and particularly in

404
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:35,004
the Markov decision process realm.

405
00:16:12,777 --> 00:16:48,130
So that gives you, I suppose, that some

406
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,130
of the key ingredients, but then it's

407
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,130
really sitting down and thinking, well,

408
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,130
how would I now actually construct this

409
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,130
model?

410
00:16:37,020 --> 00:17:05,243
And the key question, I think often is if

411
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:05,243
you have a particular phenomena or a

412
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:05,243
particular task in mind, that you want

413
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:05,243
the model to perform it's thinking, well,

414
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:05,243
how would I go about actually

415
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:05,243
constructing the data that's presented to

416
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:05,243
a participant performing that task, or

417
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:05,243
presented to an agent that's trying to

418
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:05,243
perform this task?

419
00:16:48,131 --> 00:17:18,371
And if you can explain how those data are

420
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:18,371
generated, then you effectively have the

421
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:18,371
generative model that implicitly your

422
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:18,371
agent or your participant or whoever else

423
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:18,371
should be using to be able to perform

424
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:18,371
that task.

425
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:24,436
So really all you need to be able to do

426
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:24,436
is to work out how to create the

427
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:24,436
experimental stimuli.

428
00:17:18,379 --> 00:17:28,473
And once you've done that, you've almost

429
00:17:28,473 --> 00:17:28,473
already created your model.

430
00:17:24,437 --> 00:17:36,559
And the rest comes from predefined,

431
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:36,559
preexisting inversion schemes that

432
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:36,559
actually minimize the free energy for

433
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:36,559
that model.

434
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:41,603
So at that stage it becomes relatively

435
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:41,603
straightforward.

436
00:17:38,574 --> 00:17:54,735
I say relatively because as anybody has

437
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:54,735
experienced encoding knows, a lot of time

438
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:54,735
has spent debugging and throwing up

439
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:54,735
arrows and spending a while trying to

440
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:54,735
work out why with a bit of googling to

441
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:54,735
work out a solution around that.

442
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:58,772
I think those are all important parts of

443
00:17:58,772 --> 00:17:58,772
the process.

444
00:17:55,746 --> 00:18:01,747
Daniel: Awesome.

445
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:08,819
Ollie or Terry on that recipe and

446
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:08,819
modeling question, any thoughts on that?

447
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:48,021
Ali: Yeah, actually I also wanted to ask

448
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:48,021
if do you have a plan for extending the

449
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:48,021
codes or supplementary materials to

450
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:48,021
include other languages such as IMDP

451
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:48,021
packages or any other packages that might

452
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:48,021
come up later and would be widely used in

453
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:48,021
active inference?

454
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:59,032
Because as far as I know, there isn't any

455
00:18:59,032 --> 00:18:59,032
specific GitHub repo or something

456
00:18:59,032 --> 00:18:59,032
dedicated for this book so far.

457
00:18:48,021 --> 00:19:07,033
So do you have any plans in developing

458
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:07,033
such a supplementary material for the

459
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:07,033
book?

460
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:09,036
Thomas: We don't at the moment.

461
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:19,046
It might be an interesting thing, I mean,

462
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:19,046
it might be a useful thing to be done by

463
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:19,046
the active inference community as well as

464
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:19,046
a way of sort of being engaged and

465
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:19,046
involved in it.

466
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:29,056
I suppose one of the difficulties of

467
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
doing that for a book is that often these

468
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
things move on so quickly, by the time it

469
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
comes out in a book, those packages have

470
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:29,056
moved on.

471
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:48,075
So I think it was useful for us to give a

472
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:48,075
simple example of Mathematic

473
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:48,075
implementation to demonstrate the

474
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:48,075
principles in one of the packages that

475
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:48,075
we've been involved in developing as part

476
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:48,075
of the SBM package, where we've been

477
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:48,075
involved in developing the active

478
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:48,075
routines as part of that.

479
00:19:30,057 --> 00:20:01,082
And I think it's certainly a good idea

480
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:01,082
thinking about having other repositories

481
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:01,082
out there with all sorts of

482
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:01,082
demonstrations.

483
00:19:51,077 --> 00:20:13,094
So the SBM package does have a range of

484
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:13,094
different demonstrations for different

485
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:13,094
sorts of implementations as well for

486
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:13,094
different kinds of models, which is a

487
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:13,094
really helpful resource.

488
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:24,105
And I often suggest to people that one of

489
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:24,105
the first ways of getting a sense of how

490
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:24,105
to build these models is to look at one

491
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:24,105
that's already been built and do their

492
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:24,105
best to break it, change things and make

493
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:24,105
it behave in different ways.

494
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:33,114
And so I think you're absolutely right to

495
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:33,114
say examples of the code and how it's

496
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:33,114
implemented are vital in bringing people

497
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:33,114
into this.

498
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:47,128
But yes, I think you're absolutely right

499
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:47,128
to say that it would be really helpful to

500
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:47,128
have both Python and Julia

501
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:47,128
implementations and all sorts of

502
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:47,128
different ways of doing it and examples

503
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:47,128
so that people can pick those up.

504
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:48,129
I agree completely.

505
00:20:47,128 --> 00:21:00,135
Of course, one of the advantages of

506
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:00,135
Python and Julia is that they're open

507
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:00,135
source and you don't necessarily use an

508
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:00,135
academic license to use it, which again,

509
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:00,135
I think increases the number of people

510
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:00,135
who can access it.

511
00:20:49,130 --> 00:21:12,147
Daniel: Giving an overview to someone who

512
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:12,147
might not have been following in the blow

513
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:12,147
by blow of our little literature corner

514
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:12,147
over the last few years.

515
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:20,155
How would you say active inference

516
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:20,155
modeling has evolved during your time in

517
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:20,155
this space?

518
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:25,160
Where are we at, just generally speaking

519
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,160
with applications?

520
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:34,169
What applications are developed or

521
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:34,169
possible today that when you were

522
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:34,169
starting your PhD seemed like they were

523
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:34,169
just implausible?

524
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:47,182
Thomas: I think if we go back a bit, I

525
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:47,182
suppose some of the earlier

526
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:47,182
implementations were almost all in the

527
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:47,182
continuous domain.

528
00:21:38,173 --> 00:22:03,192
So they're all based upon things like the

529
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
generalized filtering type algorithms

530
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
that were initially developed as sort of

531
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
filtering methods to perform time series

532
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
inference.

533
00:21:48,183 --> 00:22:13,202
Those things then equipped with an active

534
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:13,202
component than the cadence under the

535
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:13,202
earlier active inference type

536
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:13,202
simulations.

537
00:22:04,193 --> 00:22:21,210
And a lot of that focused on things in

538
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:21,210
the movement domain, whether that be eye

539
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:21,210
movements or control of limbs.

540
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:36,225
To the extent that you can sort of

541
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:36,225
develop handwriting and those sorts of

542
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:36,225
things, one of the interesting things

543
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:36,225
that started to happen based upon that

544
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:36,225
was to think about how you then get

545
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:36,225
something that looks more sequential

546
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:36,225
emerged from those continuous dynamics.

547
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:54,243
And handwriting was actually a really

548
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:54,243
good example of that, where there were

549
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:54,243
some simulations developed in which the

550
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:54,243
continuous model effectively had

551
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:54,243
something a bit like a lot volter dynamic

552
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:54,243
in it.

553
00:22:37,226 --> 00:23:05,248
The idea there being that you can sort of

554
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:05,248
lock volter dynamics are a kind of

555
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:05,248
dynamical system often used for modeling

556
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:05,248
things like predator prey interactions.

557
00:22:54,243 --> 00:23:10,253
And the idea is that you get a peak in

558
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:10,253
terms of a predator population sorry,

559
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:10,253
prey population.

560
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:15,258
Followed by a peak in the prey the

561
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:15,258
predators as they eat the prey, causing

562
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:15,258
drop in the prey population.

563
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:21,264
But then as the predators die out of, the

564
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:21,264
prey come back and you get this sort of

565
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:21,264
sequence of peaks from predator prey.

566
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:22,265
Predator prey.

567
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:27,270
You can generalize that to then have

568
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,270
multiple different populations, each

569
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,270
preying on one of the mouths.

570
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:29,272
So you get this sequence of peaks over

571
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:29,272
time.

572
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:40,283
And that sort of emergence of sequences

573
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:40,283
from continuous dynamics, I think was one

574
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:40,283
of the key moves early on in terms of

575
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:40,283
thinking about things that are a bit more

576
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:40,283
cognitive in terms of how do I do this

577
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:40,283
and then this and this.

578
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:45,288
Andy Clark to plan and generate much more

579
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:45,288
purposeful type of behavior.

580
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:58,301
So that went so far until things moved

581
00:23:58,301 --> 00:23:58,301
much more to an explicitly discrete or

582
00:23:58,301 --> 00:23:58,301
sequential style of modeling.

583
00:23:46,289 --> 00:24:08,305
That's when things like Markov decision

584
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:08,305
processes have started to be employed in

585
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:08,305
the active inference domain or partially

586
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:08,305
observed Markov decision processes.

587
00:23:58,301 --> 00:24:17,314
So those are models that say, I assume my

588
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:17,314
world is a sequence of states over time,

589
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:17,314
one after another, each of which

590
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:17,314
generates some observations.

591
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:20,317
And from those observations, I can make

592
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:20,317
inferences about the states.

593
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:28,325
You can then say, well, if I can act upon

594
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:28,325
the world, I can change the sequence of

595
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:28,325
states as they evolve over time.

596
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:34,331
And by selecting different actions or

597
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:34,331
different ways, I can change that

598
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:34,331
sequence.

599
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:37,334
I'm effectively planning and making

600
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:37,334
decisions.

601
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:42,339
So that's, again, where you get into a

602
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:42,339
much more cognitive sort of domain.

603
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:49,346
Some of the key advances sort of early on

604
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:49,346
while I was doing my PhD.

605
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:55,352
Were the emergence of things like deep

606
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:55,352
hierarchical models of things like Markov

607
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:55,352
decision processes.

608
00:24:49,346 --> 00:25:02,353
So here the idea was that in the world

609
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:02,353
around us, there are lots of things that

610
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:02,353
evolve over different sorts of time

611
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:02,353
scales.

612
00:24:55,352 --> 00:25:15,366
One of the early examples of this was

613
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
reading the idea that when you move your

614
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
eyes around the page, you're sort of

615
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
looking at an individual word or the

616
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:15,366
letters within that word.

617
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:18,369
But that word is itself part of the

618
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:18,369
sentence.

619
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:31,382
And the time it takes you to infer what

620
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:31,382
the word is, is going to be much shorter

621
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:31,382
than the time it takes you to work out

622
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:31,382
what's going on in terms of the sentence,

623
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:31,382
the sentence and the paragraph, and the

624
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:31,382
paragraph on the page, and the page and

625
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:31,382
the book, et cetera.

626
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:35,386
So there's a whole hierarchy of different

627
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:35,386
time scales in the world around us.

628
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:42,392
And one way of accounting for that

629
00:25:42,392 --> 00:25:42,392
relatively simply in these sorts of

630
00:25:42,392 --> 00:25:42,392
models is to simply stack them on top of

631
00:25:42,392 --> 00:25:42,392
one another.

632
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:53,404
So the outcomes you're now predicting

633
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:53,404
from one of the Markov decision process

634
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:53,404
type models I was describing now reflects

635
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:53,404
a sequence of very fast states.

636
00:25:42,393 --> 00:25:55,406
And each of those states yes, exactly.

637
00:25:54,404 --> 00:25:57,408
Is the graphics of this.

638
00:25:55,406 --> 00:26:01,406
And then each of those outcomes predicts

639
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:01,406
another sequence of very fast states.

640
00:25:57,408 --> 00:26:08,413
So what you're left with is, at the very

641
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:08,413
top level, a very slow progression of

642
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:08,413
state after state after state.

643
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:16,421
For each of those states, which might be

644
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:16,421
the sentence, you then have the word

645
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:16,421
words in that sentence beneath it.

646
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:22,427
And then for each of those words, you

647
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:22,427
might have each of the letters sorry, in

648
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:22,427
each of the letters in that word.

649
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:36,441
And so that then sort of expanded the

650
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:36,441
range of things that we can do in terms

651
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:36,441
of how we give some sort of deep temporal

652
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:36,441
structure to the kinds of models we

653
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:36,441
develop.

654
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:41,445
Sometimes people refer to that as kind of

655
00:26:41,445 --> 00:26:41,445
breaking the Markov property.

656
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:52,457
So for those who aren't familiar with

657
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:52,457
this, the Markov property is the idea

658
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:52,457
that each step in time depends only upon

659
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:52,457
the step immediately previous to it.

660
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:58,463
That all you need to know about the next

661
00:26:58,463 --> 00:26:58,463
time step is what's happening at the

662
00:26:58,463 --> 00:26:58,463
current time step.

663
00:26:53,458 --> 00:27:01,460
Nothing else in the past is useful once

664
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:01,460
you know that.

665
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:07,466
And people often suggest that means that

666
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:07,466
these processes are effectively

667
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:07,466
memoryless.

668
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:13,472
Because it's only where I am now that

669
00:27:13,472 --> 00:27:13,472
matters, it's not what was happening well

670
00:27:13,472 --> 00:27:13,472
into the past.

671
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:32,491
By having a hierarchical structure where

672
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
you have a higher level state that is

673
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
more slowly changing that's

674
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
contextualizing, what's going on at the

675
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
lower level, it means that the fast

676
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
sequence of changes is actually dependent

677
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
upon something much slower that's

678
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
happening and that in itself is dependent

679
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:32,491
upon something much slower.

680
00:27:13,472 --> 00:27:37,496
And that gives you a sort of memory, it

681
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:37,496
allows the Markov property to be broken.

682
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:57,516
Like I said, we're sort of starting off

683
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
with continuous, the emergence of

684
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
discrete from continuous, the explicit

685
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
modeling of continuous models, decision

686
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
making and the sort of exploration and

687
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
exploitation type trade offs that you get

688
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
once you treat planning as being an

689
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
inference process.

690
00:27:40,499 --> 00:28:08,521
The idea that you can then stack these

691
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:08,521
things hierarchically and have a range of

692
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:08,521
different time scales that break the

693
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:08,521
Markov process allow us to think about

694
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:08,521
things like memory and working memory.

695
00:27:57,516 --> 00:28:17,530
And then I suppose one of the next stages

696
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:17,530
was the combination or the reintroduction

697
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:17,530
of the continuous models as the lowest

698
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:17,530
level of one of these hierarchies.

699
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:30,543
The idea that actually it's all very well

700
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:30,543
being able to make decisions, but at some

701
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:30,543
stage you need to implement those

702
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:30,543
decisions in a world that's made up of

703
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:30,543
physics and muscle lengths and continuous

704
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:30,543
sensory inputs.

705
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:40,553
And so putting these sort of hybrid

706
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:40,553
models together where you can use your

707
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:40,553
decisions to then predict short sequences

708
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:40,553
and trajectories defined in a continuous

709
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:40,553
domain.

710
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:56,569
And I suppose since then there have been

711
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:56,569
a range of further developments, active

712
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:56,569
inference, lab and map setting and a

713
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:56,569
range of developments in a number of

714
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:56,569
other directions sort of in parallel.

715
00:28:41,554 --> 00:29:01,568
So some of those developments have been

716
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:01,568
thinking about implementation in other

717
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:01,568
languages.

718
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:24,591
Some of those developments have been

719
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:24,591
thinking about combination with methods

720
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:24,591
from deep learning and introduction of

721
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:24,591
variation, auto encoders and function,

722
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:24,591
approximators and amortized inference,

723
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:24,591
which a lot of people in the robotics

724
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:24,591
community have been pioneering,

725
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:24,591
particularly that would be one direction

726
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:24,591
that things have been developed in.

727
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:47,614
And I suppose the other direction that's

728
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:47,614
seen a lot of development recently has

729
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:47,614
been the sort of underlying principles,

730
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:47,614
the physics that underwrites active the

731
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:47,614
principles and how you justify the sort

732
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:47,614
of dynamics and where free energy comes

733
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:47,614
from as a concept and why it's useful in

734
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:47,614
understanding how systems behave.

735
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:58,625
So I hope that wasn't too much all at

736
00:29:58,625 --> 00:29:58,625
once, but that was a sort of run through

737
00:29:58,625 --> 00:29:58,625
of some of the developments that spring

738
00:29:58,625 --> 00:29:58,625
to mind over the last few years.

739
00:29:48,615 --> 00:30:01,622
Daniel: Awesome.

740
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:08,629
Perry or Ali, any comments on that quick

741
00:30:08,629 --> 00:30:08,629
historical review.

742
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:21,642
Ali: Again, I had another question

743
00:30:21,642 --> 00:30:21,642
regarding actually it's a question out of

744
00:30:21,642 --> 00:30:21,642
mere curiosity.

745
00:30:13,634 --> 00:30:30,651
Did you have any specific reason for

746
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:30,651
adopting this particular mathematical

747
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:30,651
notation throughout the book?

748
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:43,664
Because it seems like it somewhat

749
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:43,664
diverges from the notations used in some

750
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:43,664
of the well known papers in the

751
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:43,664
literature.

752
00:30:30,651 --> 00:31:07,682
And I know active inference notation is

753
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:07,682
not consistently used across the

754
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:07,682
literature, but even in the papers that

755
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:07,682
came out after the publication of this

756
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:07,682
book written by Professor Prison or

757
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:07,682
others, I don't see this specific

758
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:07,682
notation used a lot in those papers.

759
00:30:43,664 --> 00:31:12,687
So I just wanted to ask about the reasons

760
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:12,687
behind this choice.

761
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:14,689
Thomas: Okay.

762
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:19,694
I think you're absolutely right to say

763
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:19,694
that it's not always been used

764
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:19,694
consistently.

765
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:30,705
And it's worth saying that there are a

766
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:30,705
couple of different tensions that affect

767
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:30,705
this.

768
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:55,730
So one is the idea that in a lot of

769
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:55,730
papers that are published because it's

770
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:55,730
only dealing with an aspect of active

771
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:55,730
inference and not trying to put it all

772
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:55,730
together, they can sort of use a notation

773
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:55,730
that may be the same as notation you

774
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:55,730
might use in another field without worry

775
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:55,730
that people will get conflicted and

776
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:55,730
misinterpret one variable for another

777
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:55,730
because everything's just defined within

778
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:55,730
that one domain.

779
00:31:30,705 --> 00:32:17,746
Another aspect to it is that depending

780
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:17,746
upon the paper in question and the

781
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:17,746
audience is aimed at, sometimes the

782
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:17,746
notation is designed to match what might

783
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:17,746
be used in that broader field, whereas

784
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:17,746
we've tried to try to make it as

785
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:17,746
consistent as possible across different

786
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:17,746
fields.

787
00:31:57,732 --> 00:32:23,752
Were there any particular notations that

788
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:23,752
you were thinking of?

789
00:32:19,748 --> 00:32:24,753
Do I can help clarify.

790
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:27,756
Yes.

791
00:32:26,755 --> 00:33:01,784
Ali: For example, as just a very simple

792
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:01,784
example, using ata for external states

793
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:01,784
instead of x that's being used, or S and

794
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:01,784
A for active states and sensory states or

795
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:01,784
other kinds of uses of lowercase matrices

796
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:01,784
and uppercase matrices, which is used

797
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:01,784
differently in a paper such as step by

798
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:01,784
step tutorial, active inference lab and

799
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:01,784
these kinds of notational divergences.

800
00:32:27,756 --> 00:33:03,786
Thomas: Okay.

801
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:06,789
Yes, there's some quite nice

802
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:06,789
illustrations.

803
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:13,796
So things like A and S, which, as you

804
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:13,796
say, are often used in some of the more

805
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:13,796
physics orientated papers.

806
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:23,806
Unfortunately, if you use those in a

807
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:23,806
Markov decision process paper, people

808
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:23,806
will interpret those as being states and

809
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:23,806
parameters of a likelihood matrix.

810
00:33:14,797 --> 00:33:29,812
So unfortunately, we couldn't use those

811
00:33:29,812 --> 00:33:29,812
same letters without causing more

812
00:33:29,812 --> 00:33:29,812
confusion.

813
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:42,825
So what we try to do there is to focus

814
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:42,825
more on the sort of practical inference

815
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:42,825
side of things, of the actual

816
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:42,825
implementations we tend to use of

817
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:42,825
accidents in particular problem

818
00:33:42,825 --> 00:33:42,825
settings.

819
00:33:29,812 --> 00:34:00,837
And there when you're constructing a

820
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:00,837
generative model, particularly if it's in

821
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:00,837
the continuous domain, I'll often use X

822
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:00,837
as being the states that I have to infer,

823
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:00,837
which from the perspective of the physics

824
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:00,837
type papers are the external states, the

825
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:00,837
things that are having an effect on my

826
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:00,837
sensory states.

827
00:33:43,826 --> 00:34:14,851
I can't remember whether we used Y or O,

828
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:14,851
the sensory states or the data in the

829
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:14,851
book as you think it's Y.

830
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:15,852
Okay.

831
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:18,855
And that sort of fits with the idea of

832
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:18,855
using it in the continuous domain.

833
00:34:15,852 --> 00:34:29,866
Where in a lot of settings when you're

834
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:29,866
trying to predict sensory data, often why

835
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:29,866
will end up being the variable that we

836
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:29,866
end up using.

837
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:45,882
So I appreciate that it can be confusing,

838
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:45,882
sort of jumping between different

839
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:45,882
resources, but what we strove for in this

840
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:45,882
one was internal consistency as much as

841
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:45,882
we could and trying not to overload

842
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:45,882
specific variables or symbols.

843
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:46,883
Ali: Thank you.

844
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:47,884
Daniel: Thanks.

845
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:50,887
Figure 4.3.

846
00:34:48,885 --> 00:34:54,891
We found ourself coming back to again and

847
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:54,891
again.

848
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:59,896
It for Sages, chapters seven and eight.

849
00:34:55,892 --> 00:35:07,898
And it lays out discrete time on top and

850
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:07,898
continuous time on the bottom in terms of

851
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:07,898
their structural similarities.

852
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:10,901
But also they have some really important

853
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:10,901
differences.

854
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:30,921
Could you just, as you see it, how do the

855
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:30,921
discrete time and the continuous time

856
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:30,921
models have similarities and differences

857
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:30,921
such that you can lay them out in a

858
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:30,921
graphically or visually similar way, yet

859
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:30,921
there's also some key differences, for

860
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:30,921
example, in what each of the nodes dean.

861
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:32,923
So how are they similar and different?

862
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:37,928
And what did you hope to illustrate by

863
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:37,928
laying out Figure 4.3 this way?

864
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:49,940
Thomas: So I think the reason that they

865
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:49,940
can be seen as similar is that

866
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:49,940
effectively what you're trying to do in

867
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:49,940
both cases to represent a trajectory.

868
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:53,944
We're trying to represent how something

869
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:53,944
evolves in time.

870
00:35:50,941 --> 00:36:04,949
And that something may be the states s in

871
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:04,949
the discrete time or they may be the

872
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:04,949
trajectory of some hidden state x in the

873
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:04,949
continuous domain.

874
00:35:53,944 --> 00:36:17,962
And when you're trying to say how do I

875
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:17,962
actually put together a set of numbers

876
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:17,962
that tell me how something's evolved or

877
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:17,962
evolving, there are a couple of different

878
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:17,962
ways you can do that.

879
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:24,969
One is to say I'm going to tell you where

880
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:24,969
it is at time one and then I'm going to

881
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:24,969
tell you where it is at time two and then

882
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:24,969
at time three, et cetera, et cetera.

883
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:29,974
And that's a perfectly legitimate and

884
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:29,974
perfectly reasonable way of writing down

885
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:29,974
a trajectory.

886
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:39,984
It obviously misses out all the times

887
00:36:39,984 --> 00:36:39,984
between time one and time two, which may

888
00:36:39,984 --> 00:36:39,984
or may not be significant depending upon

889
00:36:39,984 --> 00:36:39,984
what the problem is you're dealing with.

890
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:55,000
The second way that we approach it is to

891
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,000
say, well, you can use what's known as a

892
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Taylor series approximation or a Taylor

893
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,000
series or a polynomial expression or that

894
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,000
trajectory.

895
00:36:43,988 --> 00:37:08,007
So essentially what we're saying there is

896
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:08,007
that you just construct a function that

897
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:08,007
follows the shape of that trajectory over

898
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:08,007
time.

899
00:36:56,001 --> 00:37:18,017
And you can construct that function by

900
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:18,017
saying, well, let's look at where I am

901
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:18,017
now at this point in time and my

902
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:18,017
position, how am I changing over time?

903
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:23,022
If you just took those two variables

904
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:23,022
together, you just have a straight line

905
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:23,022
telling you where you are and where

906
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:23,022
you're going to be.

907
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:29,028
If you then take account of the

908
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:29,028
acceleration, you may even have a curve

909
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:29,028
line which says that I'm here now, I'm

910
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:29,028
going to be there then.

911
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:48,047
And as you add in more and more elements

912
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:48,047
to this, so the rate of change of the

913
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:48,047
velocity and the rate of change of the

914
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:48,047
rate of change of the velocity, et

915
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:48,047
cetera, and just add in more and more

916
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:48,047
rates of change, you effectively get a

917
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:48,047
more and more precise function, telling

918
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:48,047
you, at least locally, around where you

919
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:48,047
are now, where you're going to be at

920
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:48,047
various other times.

921
00:37:30,029 --> 00:38:07,060
So that difference, either using Taylor

922
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,060
series coefficients, which are just

923
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,060
successive rates of change, or by using a

924
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,060
sequence of states over time, are what's

925
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,060
illustrated in the lower and upper

926
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,060
graphics here, respectively.

927
00:37:50,049 --> 00:38:24,077
Each of those things has, as you said,

928
00:38:24,077 --> 00:38:24,077
they have a lot in common in terms of

929
00:38:24,077 --> 00:38:24,077
their structure, in terms of the number

930
00:38:24,077 --> 00:38:24,077
of numbers you need to be able to

931
00:38:24,077 --> 00:38:24,077
describe them, but each has their

932
00:38:24,077 --> 00:38:24,077
advantages and disadvantages depending

933
00:38:24,077 --> 00:38:24,077
upon what you're trying to actually

934
00:38:24,077 --> 00:38:24,077
model.

935
00:38:08,061 --> 00:38:54,107
And I think for me, I tend to think of

936
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:54,107
the sequence of categorical states over

937
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:54,107
time as being quite useful in thinking

938
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:54,107
about anything to do with decisionmaking,

939
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:54,107
deciding between alternatives, thinking

940
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:54,107
about sequences like language and words

941
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:54,107
and even sequences in terms of the eye

942
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:54,107
movements you make looking in one place,

943
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:54,107
then the next, then the next, rather than

944
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:54,107
continuously moving your eyes around

945
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:54,107
space in a smooth fashion.

946
00:38:25,078 --> 00:39:25,132
Whereas the process of interpreting

947
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
sensory data that's coming in from your

948
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
retina or from your stretch receptors or

949
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
whatever else or in terms of actually

950
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
driving action that changes continuous

951
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
variables in the world there I think it's

952
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
much more useful to be able to describe

953
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
things in terms of a continuous number

954
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
and those sorts of continuous

955
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
trajectories that you can get through

956
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
using these Taylor Series type

957
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
approximations, which often referred to

958
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
in this context as generalized

959
00:39:25,132 --> 00:39:25,132
coordinates of motion.

960
00:38:55,108 --> 00:39:28,135
Daniel: Awesome.

961
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:29,136
Cool.

962
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:47,154
Well, another figure that we come back to

963
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:47,154
again and again tucked away in chapter

964
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:47,154
nine, but giving a lot of context is

965
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:47,154
Figure 9.1 on what is termed metabasian

966
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:47,154
inference.

967
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:59,166
So could you describe what is happening

968
00:39:59,166 --> 00:39:59,166
in this figure and is this exactly as

969
00:39:59,166 --> 00:39:59,166
every empirical ethologist is going to

970
00:39:59,166 --> 00:39:59,166
agree with?

971
00:39:47,154 --> 00:40:01,162
Is this controversial?

972
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:02,163
Is this novel?

973
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:11,172
So what is it doing for active inference

974
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:11,172
when we conceptualize our empirical task

975
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:11,172
structurally like this?

976
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:19,180
And do you think that that is exactly how

977
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,180
ethologists have long seen this topic or

978
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,180
is this something contentious?

979
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:26,187
Thomas: I think so.

980
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:32,193
I'll talk through the figure but then you

981
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:32,193
can tell me if that's how ethologists

982
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:32,193
traditionally look at it and whether it's

983
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:32,193
contentious.

984
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:34,195
I'll be interested there.

985
00:40:32,193 --> 00:41:00,215
So the idea behind this figure is to

986
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
highlight that when dealing in psychology

987
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
or neuroscience fields, where you're

988
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
trying to understand how a particular

989
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
system is behavior or how it's

990
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
essentially what's going on in the mind

991
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
or the brain or the nervous system of

992
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
some creature that is behaving in some

993
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
way.

994
00:40:35,196 --> 00:41:05,220
There are two levels at which you can

995
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,220
look at it.

996
00:41:02,217 --> 00:41:14,229
One is saying, well, from my perspective

997
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:14,229
as the experimenter, what are the data

998
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:14,229
I'm measuring and that may be behavior

999
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:14,229
measurements from that creature.

1000
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:17,232
It may be taking electrophysiological

1001
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:17,232
measurements.

1002
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:23,238
It may be asking it a question if it's a

1003
00:41:23,238 --> 00:41:23,238
patient in that clinical setting.

1004
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:30,245
And I'm essentially now trying to

1005
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:30,245
optimize my model of this system.

1006
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:44,259
Now, in the neurosciences and in the

1007
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:44,259
settings I've outlined above, the kind of

1008
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:44,259
system we're interested in is the sort of

1009
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:44,259
system that has its own model of other

1010
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:44,259
sorts of system.

1011
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:57,272
And so the kinds of questions we're

1012
00:41:57,272 --> 00:41:57,272
interested in, the kind of parameters

1013
00:41:57,272 --> 00:41:57,272
we're interested in, are things like the

1014
00:41:57,272 --> 00:41:57,272
prior belief that this creature has about

1015
00:41:57,272 --> 00:41:57,272
this thing or how precise it thinks its

1016
00:41:57,272 --> 00:41:57,272
data are.

1017
00:41:44,259 --> 00:42:04,273
And so the parameters I'm now asking a

1018
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:04,273
question about are the parameters of the

1019
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:04,273
beliefs of another system.

1020
00:41:58,272 --> 00:42:23,292
So the outside box here, the one that the

1021
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:23,292
parameters are going into, the

1022
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:23,292
experimental stimuli are going into, and

1023
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:23,292
the observed behavior are coming out of,

1024
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:23,292
is essentially my model of how this other

1025
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:23,292
system behaves.

1026
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:35,303
Now, the inside box here, the one in the

1027
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:35,303
dotted line or the dashed line, that now

1028
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:35,303
represents the model that that system has

1029
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:35,303
to understand the world around it.

1030
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:54,323
And so when we construct our model that

1031
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:54,323
contains another model inside it, and by

1032
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:54,323
saying, if this creature believed this,

1033
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:54,323
this is how they would make inferences

1034
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:54,323
about their environment and generate

1035
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:54,323
behavior, I can now predict the behavior

1036
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:54,323
I would observe if this creature believed

1037
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:54,323
this thing.

1038
00:42:36,305 --> 00:43:12,335
So the subjective objective idea is that

1039
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
the objective model is the experimenter

1040
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
and its beliefs and the experimenters

1041
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
beliefs and the observations they make by

1042
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
measuring what the participant or

1043
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:12,335
experimental subject does.

1044
00:42:56,325 --> 00:43:20,343
And the subjective model is the

1045
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:20,343
participants model of the world around

1046
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:20,343
them.

1047
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:27,350
So that, I think, would be my summary of

1048
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:27,350
how this figure works and the idea it's

1049
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:27,350
trying to get across.

1050
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:34,357
Now, you can tell me how ethologists may

1051
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:34,357
disagree with that or agree with it, or

1052
00:43:34,357 --> 00:43:34,357
what they'd find controversial.

1053
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:41,364
Daniel: I'll give a thought, and Ali or

1054
00:43:41,364 --> 00:43:41,364
Terry, feel free to give a follow up or a

1055
00:43:41,364 --> 00:43:41,364
thought.

1056
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:48,371
I don't think, in principle it's

1057
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:48,371
contentious or dissentious.

1058
00:43:42,365 --> 00:44:07,384
However, there might be an explicit or an

1059
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:07,384
implicit belief, of course, ironically,

1060
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:07,384
that we can simply take some of these

1061
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:07,384
parameters coming into our experimental

1062
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:07,384
setup and even the selection of

1063
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:07,384
experimental stimuli.

1064
00:43:49,372 --> 00:44:12,389
We can take those as simply given, which

1065
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:12,389
is a very frequentist perspective.

1066
00:44:07,384 --> 00:44:17,394
And then on the observed behavior, we can

1067
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:17,394
simply use descriptive statistics.

1068
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:23,400
We'll characterize the predefined groups

1069
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:23,400
according to the one experiment we ran.

1070
00:44:18,395 --> 00:44:26,403
We'll do the Ttest, we'll do the ANOVA.

1071
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,404
We'll come up with a p value.

1072
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:30,407
It's going to be frequentism all the way

1073
00:44:30,407 --> 00:44:30,407
forward.

1074
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:48,425
So even if we're doing frequentism about

1075
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:48,425
a generative model, there's a sense that

1076
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:48,425
if we just clamp down on our experiment

1077
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:48,425
and treat it as handed down without

1078
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:48,425
error, instead of being actually drawn

1079
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:48,425
from distributions of possible

1080
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:48,425
experiments, we could have done.

1081
00:44:30,407 --> 00:45:00,431
If we clamp down upstream of the

1082
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:00,431
experiments, we'll just be able to

1083
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:00,431
describe and ultimately publish without

1084
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:00,431
needing to look at what else could have

1085
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:00,431
happened.

1086
00:44:48,425 --> 00:45:45,476
And I think this diagram and also the

1087
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:45,476
very subtle dashed line around even the

1088
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:45,476
bigger box suggests that just like the

1089
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:45,476
active clinician engaging with a

1090
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:45,476
conversation or the active experimenter

1091
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:45,476
also engaging iteratively over their

1092
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:45,476
system of interest, that itself is an

1093
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:45,476
adaptive epistemic process where, yes,

1094
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:45,476
you could simplify it by treating the

1095
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:45,476
parameters and the stimuli sequences as

1096
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:45,476
simply given, but then you don't have

1097
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:45,476
access to the generative model.

1098
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:50,481
That actually is the generative process

1099
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:50,481
for the subjective model.

1100
00:45:45,476 --> 00:46:05,490
So summarize in principle uncontentious,

1101
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:05,490
however, sometimes discordant with the

1102
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:05,490
ways that behavior experiments are

1103
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:05,490
conceptualized, planned and analyzed.

1104
00:45:51,482 --> 00:46:16,501
One reason why it's helpful because

1105
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:16,501
during the book we try to stay on the

1106
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:16,501
road, on the high road or the low road.

1107
00:46:09,494 --> 00:46:37,522
But when we're in discussions it's almost

1108
00:46:37,522 --> 00:46:37,522
like there's a whole roadmap and people

1109
00:46:37,522 --> 00:46:37,522
have their own backgrounds and questions

1110
00:46:37,522 --> 00:46:37,522
and it kind of comes together with all

1111
00:46:37,522 --> 00:46:37,522
these different topics that people are

1112
00:46:37,522 --> 00:46:37,522
curious about, ultimately that bring them

1113
00:46:37,522 --> 00:46:37,522
to active inference.

1114
00:46:17,502 --> 00:46:55,540
So going to this metabasian figure helps

1115
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:55,540
in some ways situate how the authors are

1116
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:55,540
seeing this entire process of

1117
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:55,540
experimental design, observation and

1118
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:55,540
cognitive modeling.

1119
00:46:37,522 --> 00:47:02,541
And that was unpacked also in the recent

1120
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:02,541
Map territory fallacy fallacy work.

1121
00:46:56,541 --> 00:47:12,551
Ali or Terry, any thoughts or questions

1122
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:12,551
in our last ten minutes?

1123
00:47:05,544 --> 00:47:17,556
Is there a figure you want to look at?

1124
00:47:14,553 --> 00:47:19,558
Or we can go to some other places.

1125
00:47:17,556 --> 00:47:30,569
Ali: Maybe we can ask the missing

1126
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:30,569
figure.

1127
00:47:26,565 --> 00:47:33,572
I think it was in figure seven.

1128
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:39,578
Daniel: Point yes or something 7.2 in the

1129
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:39,578
lower left.

1130
00:47:33,572 --> 00:47:48,587
Thomas: So this was actually corrected by

1131
00:47:48,587 --> 00:47:48,587
I don't know quite how it ended up

1132
00:47:48,587 --> 00:47:48,587
vanishing, but it was corrected in one of

1133
00:47:48,587 --> 00:47:48,587
the later print versions.

1134
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:54,593
I'll save it from the version I got in

1135
00:47:54,593 --> 00:47:54,593
front of me now and I can show you what

1136
00:47:54,593 --> 00:47:54,593
it would have looked like, but apologies

1137
00:47:54,593 --> 00:47:54,593
for that.

1138
00:47:48,587 --> 00:47:56,595
Which figure is it?

1139
00:47:54,593 --> 00:47:59,598
Daniel: 7.2 on page 128.

1140
00:47:56,595 --> 00:48:05,598
Thomas: Fortunately, I picked up a copy

1141
00:48:05,598 --> 00:48:05,598
of the book that doesn't have it.

1142
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:10,603
Daniel: So there have already been one

1143
00:48:10,603 --> 00:48:10,603
and a half fractal dimensions of

1144
00:48:10,603 --> 00:48:10,603
printing.

1145
00:48:05,598 --> 00:48:12,605
Thomas: Yes.

1146
00:48:11,604 --> 00:48:20,613
Unfortunately I don't think that one's

1147
00:48:20,613 --> 00:48:20,613
corrected yet in the online copy.

1148
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:33,626
Essentially what would have appeared in

1149
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:33,626
that figure or what did in some of the

1150
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:33,626
later printing versions is the errors

1151
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:33,626
that are driving the updates to the

1152
00:48:33,626 --> 00:48:33,626
states in the plot above.

1153
00:48:21,614 --> 00:48:48,641
Now because the errors here are

1154
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:48,641
effectively are the free energy gradients

1155
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:48,641
or the negative free energy gradients.

1156
00:48:34,627 --> 00:48:57,650
So essentially as you go down the free

1157
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:57,650
energy gradient, you're effectively

1158
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:57,650
minimizing your error.

1159
00:48:48,641 --> 00:49:07,654
So what that means in Active is that the

1160
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:07,654
errors would effectively be the rates of

1161
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:07,654
change of the states and the plot above.

1162
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:15,662
So if you take the states in the plot

1163
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:15,662
above and you imagine what the rates of

1164
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:15,662
change of each of those lines are, that's

1165
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:15,662
what you would get in the plot below.

1166
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:44,691
Daniel: Well, on this same kind of topic,

1167
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:44,691
in chapter seven, we're in the discrete

1168
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:44,691
time generative models, and a little bit

1169
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:44,691
less so here, but in the latter models

1170
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:44,691
here in 7.13 and in what we just looked

1171
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:44,691
at in 7.2, where are these continuous

1172
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:44,691
interpolations coming from if it's a

1173
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:44,691
discrete time model?

1174
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:46,693
Thomas: That's a good point.

1175
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:50,697
So I suppose there's an important

1176
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:50,697
distinction to be made here.

1177
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:59,706
There's the distinction between the

1178
00:49:59,706 --> 00:49:59,706
things that are being inferred, which are

1179
00:49:59,706 --> 00:49:59,706
happening over discrete steps in time.

1180
00:49:50,697 --> 00:50:05,706
And then there's the inference process

1181
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:05,706
itself, which deals in probabilities

1182
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:05,706
which are themselves continuous.

1183
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:14,715
They can vary in this case anywhere

1184
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:14,715
between zero and one and the time over

1185
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:14,715
which that inference happens.

1186
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:30,731
To give you an example, if you imagine

1187
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:30,731
that the way you're analyzing this figure

1188
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:30,731
at the moment is by making a series of

1189
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:30,731
the category movements, you're not sort

1190
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:30,731
of continuously moving your eyes from one

1191
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:30,731
plot to the next.

1192
00:50:17,718 --> 00:50:38,739
You're making a series of rapid ballistic

1193
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:38,739
movements that take you from one to the

1194
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:38,739
next.

1195
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:46,747
And effectively, every time your eyes

1196
00:50:46,747 --> 00:50:46,747
stand still, you have a new data point

1197
00:50:46,747 --> 00:50:46,747
that you're now trying to analyze.

1198
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:54,754
You can imagine that between that every

1199
00:50:54,754 --> 00:50:54,754
time your eyes stay still, everything

1200
00:50:54,754 --> 00:50:54,754
else in your brain doesn't just stop.

1201
00:50:47,748 --> 00:51:01,756
So once you've got that new data point,

1202
00:51:01,756 --> 00:51:01,756
your brain now has some time to simulate

1203
00:51:01,756 --> 00:51:01,756
that data point to draw inferences about

1204
00:51:01,756 --> 00:51:01,756
what it's seeing there.

1205
00:50:54,755 --> 00:51:08,763
And those inferences happen through the

1206
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:08,763
continuous dynamics of what's happening

1207
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:08,763
in your neurons and various networks

1208
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:08,763
across your brain.

1209
00:51:01,756 --> 00:51:21,776
So you can think of the continuous

1210
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:21,776
changes that are happening for each state

1211
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:21,776
as not being changes in the world that

1212
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:21,776
we're trying to infer, not being changes

1213
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:21,776
in the data point I'm currently looking

1214
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:21,776
at.

1215
00:51:10,765 --> 00:51:26,781
So the changes in my beliefs about it

1216
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:26,781
before I then sample the next data

1217
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:26,781
point.

1218
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:32,786
Daniel: Interesting.

1219
00:51:31,786 --> 00:51:42,797
I have a few more figure based quick

1220
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:42,797
questions, but Terry, do you want to

1221
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:42,797
bring up anything or just give any

1222
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:42,797
remarks?

1223
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:43,797
No worries.

1224
00:51:42,797 --> 00:51:43,798
If not.

1225
00:51:43,797 --> 00:51:59,814
Terry: I am very much just trying to

1226
00:51:59,814 --> 00:51:59,814
understand these concepts, so I don't

1227
00:51:59,814 --> 00:51:59,814
make any pretense having any deep

1228
00:51:59,814 --> 00:51:59,814
understanding.

1229
00:51:48,803 --> 00:52:17,826
But the key thing that interests me is

1230
00:52:17,826 --> 00:52:17,826
how you jump from this sense of how we

1231
00:52:17,826 --> 00:52:17,826
update our predictions into the clinical

1232
00:52:17,826 --> 00:52:17,826
realm.

1233
00:51:59,814 --> 00:52:40,849
I'm interested in pain medicine, and I

1234
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:40,849
see neuroplastic pain as very much a

1235
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:40,849
mistaken prediction based on often

1236
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:40,849
misinterpretation by medical

1237
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:40,849
professionals and the information that

1238
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:40,849
they give to patients.

1239
00:52:18,827 --> 00:52:44,853
And I'm really intrigued by the

1240
00:52:44,853 --> 00:52:44,853
potential.

1241
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:45,854
Thomas: For.

1242
00:52:44,853 --> 00:53:05,868
Terry: Using these concepts to give

1243
00:53:05,868 --> 00:53:05,868
patients an architecture in which they

1244
00:53:05,868 --> 00:53:05,868
can start to understand that they have

1245
00:53:05,868 --> 00:53:05,868
some agency in altering their future

1246
00:53:05,868 --> 00:53:05,868
predictions and really change in their

1247
00:53:05,868 --> 00:53:05,868
experience of their pain.

1248
00:52:47,856 --> 00:53:17,880
As you're a clinician, I'd be really

1249
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:17,880
intrigued to get your sense of where this

1250
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:17,880
is going in that type of clinical realm.

1251
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:36,899
Thomas: I think that's a really nice

1252
00:53:36,899 --> 00:53:36,899
example as well, thinking about attitudes

1253
00:53:36,899 --> 00:53:36,899
towards pain and particular kinds of

1254
00:53:36,899 --> 00:53:36,899
pain, particularly when there isn't

1255
00:53:36,899 --> 00:53:36,899
obvious tissue damage that can be

1256
00:53:36,899 --> 00:53:36,899
identified that's causing that pain.

1257
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:42,905
But that still is obviously a very real

1258
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:42,905
sensation to people who are experiencing

1259
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:42,905
it.

1260
00:53:36,899 --> 00:53:46,909
And I think it generalizes to a number of

1261
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:46,909
other conditions.

1262
00:53:43,906 --> 00:54:06,923
And probably there's an overlap with

1263
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
things like functional neurological

1264
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
disorders, probably a number of medically

1265
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
unexplained symptoms and things where

1266
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
there is a huge amount of overlap in

1267
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
these sorts of processes where you can't

1268
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
necessarily directly identify a big

1269
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:06,923
structural lesion of any sort.

1270
00:53:47,910 --> 00:54:12,929
But clearly the way the nervous system is

1271
00:54:12,929 --> 00:54:12,929
working, something isn't quite right.

1272
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:20,937
Pain I think, is an interesting example,

1273
00:54:20,937 --> 00:54:20,937
particularly because pain is never a real

1274
00:54:20,937 --> 00:54:20,937
thing out there in the world, is it?

1275
00:54:14,931 --> 00:54:22,939
I mean, it's always an inference.

1276
00:54:20,937 --> 00:54:35,952
And so I think that's one of the first

1277
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:35,952
things to say to anybody, regardless of

1278
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:35,952
whether you've got pain because you've

1279
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:35,952
lost a leg or whatever else, there's no

1280
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:35,952
such thing as pain as an external state.

1281
00:54:22,939 --> 00:54:41,958
It is just your inference, your

1282
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:41,958
explanation for the signals that are

1283
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:41,958
coming in from your body.

1284
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:53,970
Now, one of the important concepts that I

1285
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:53,970
think comes into all of these sorts of

1286
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:53,970
syndromes and probably many others as

1287
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:53,970
well, is the idea of precision.

1288
00:54:43,960 --> 00:55:11,982
The idea that the data I predict sensory

1289
00:55:11,982 --> 00:55:11,982
data coming in, in addition to estimating

1290
00:55:11,982 --> 00:55:11,982
what those data are going to look like, I

1291
00:55:11,982 --> 00:55:11,982
also have to estimate how confident I am

1292
00:55:11,982 --> 00:55:11,982
in what they're going to look like.

1293
00:54:54,970 --> 00:55:19,990
If I'm not very confident or I think I'm

1294
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:19,990
dealing in something that's very noisy,

1295
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:19,990
then I can actually discount a lot of

1296
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:19,990
that signal.

1297
00:55:13,984 --> 00:55:27,998
Whereas if I believe that it's all

1298
00:55:27,998 --> 00:55:27,998
extremely reliable, very clean data

1299
00:55:27,998 --> 00:55:27,998
that's coming in, then I want to put a

1300
00:55:27,998 --> 00:55:27,998
lot of weight on that.

1301
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:32,003
And another way of saying that is that

1302
00:55:32,003 --> 00:55:32,003
there are some things I pay attention to

1303
00:55:32,003 --> 00:55:32,003
and some things I don't.

1304
00:55:27,998 --> 00:55:40,011
And just saying it's reliable data is

1305
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:40,011
just a matter of saying I'm going to

1306
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:40,011
attempt to it.

1307
00:55:34,005 --> 00:55:53,024
Now, it might be that in a number of

1308
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:53,024
these different syndromes, what's going

1309
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:53,024
on is that our bodies have overestimated

1310
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:53,024
the precision, overestimated how clean

1311
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:53,024
the data are coming in from particular

1312
00:55:53,024 --> 00:55:53,024
body part.

1313
00:55:41,011 --> 00:56:00,025
And that's why we then overinterpret any

1314
00:56:00,025 --> 00:56:00,025
signals to coming in as if they are

1315
00:56:00,025 --> 00:56:00,025
painful.

1316
00:55:54,025 --> 00:56:07,032
And active inference we draw from those

1317
00:56:07,032 --> 00:56:07,032
signals are just too confident and too

1318
00:56:07,032 --> 00:56:07,032
driven by something that they shouldn't

1319
00:56:07,032 --> 00:56:07,032
be.

1320
00:56:00,025 --> 00:56:24,049
An example I often like to use in

1321
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,049
clinical discussions is that if I told

1322
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,049
you to pay attention now to the feeling

1323
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,049
that your left sock is having on your

1324
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,049
left big toe, you can probably feel it,

1325
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,049
but you were completely unaware of it

1326
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,049
before.

1327
00:56:09,034 --> 00:56:43,068
But now if I say continue to pay

1328
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:43,068
attention to that andy Clark on paying

1329
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:43,068
attention to that and you're unable to

1330
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:43,068
pay attention away from it anymore, if

1331
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:43,068
you felt that all the time, it would feel

1332
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:43,068
unusual, it would feel wrong and maybe a

1333
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:43,068
miscalation of precision in that way,

1334
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:43,068
maybe what's going on in a lot of these

1335
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:43,068
sorts of conditions.

1336
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:56,081
Partly, I think it's often interesting

1337
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:56,081
that in some of these people there was at

1338
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:56,081
some stage an injury or something that

1339
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:56,081
affected that body part.

1340
00:56:45,070 --> 00:57:16,095
And you can imagine that if you went

1341
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:16,095
through a period of illness where you did

1342
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:16,095
have tissue damage and were in pain for

1343
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:16,095
that reason, it might direct your

1344
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:16,095
attention to that, and you may have a

1345
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:16,095
learned deployment of attention towards

1346
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:16,095
that area that might persist even after

1347
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:16,095
the insult and the damage is resolved.

1348
00:56:56,081 --> 00:57:31,109
And again, maybe it's that sort of

1349
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:31,109
persistent mislearning of how precise

1350
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:31,109
things are that leads to the continued

1351
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:31,109
experience of pain, even when there's

1352
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:31,109
nothing sort of externally causing it

1353
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:31,109
anymore.

1354
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:48,127
So I think just having a sense of

1355
00:57:48,127 --> 00:57:48,127
inference and the idea that all our

1356
00:57:48,127 --> 00:57:48,127
perceptions of the world around us are

1357
00:57:48,127 --> 00:57:48,127
ultimately inferences says that if we

1358
00:57:48,127 --> 00:57:48,127
change our model in some way, we're able

1359
00:57:48,127 --> 00:57:48,127
to adapt and change.

1360
00:57:31,110 --> 00:58:04,137
And plasticity in our brains and spinal

1361
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:04,137
cords can be exploited, then we can also

1362
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:04,137
correct those misleading models and

1363
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:04,137
hopefully resolve those sorts of symptoms

1364
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:04,137
and syndromes.

1365
00:57:48,127 --> 00:58:08,141
Daniel: Awesome.

1366
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,143
Thank you.

1367
00:58:09,142 --> 00:58:19,152
Well, we are, at the very close, really

1368
00:58:19,152 --> 00:58:19,152
appreciative, Thomas, of how much we were

1369
00:58:19,152 --> 00:58:19,152
able to cover.

1370
00:58:10,143 --> 00:58:33,166
What are your closing words or thoughts,

1371
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:33,166
potentially, to someone who has listened

1372
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:33,166
to this 1 hour discussion as their

1373
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:33,166
appetizer before joining the par at All

1374
00:58:33,166 --> 00:58:33,166
Restaurant service?

1375
00:58:19,152 --> 00:58:39,172
Thomas: Well, I've enjoyed the

1376
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:39,172
discussion.

1377
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:40,173
Thank you for having me here.

1378
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:59,192
I'll reiterate what I said earlier, that

1379
00:58:59,192 --> 00:58:59,192
I think one of the key things in making

1380
00:58:59,192 --> 00:58:59,192
this field more accessible to more people

1381
00:58:59,192 --> 00:58:59,192
are these sort of reading groups, the

1382
00:58:59,192 --> 00:58:59,192
ideas of trying to create these

1383
00:58:59,192 --> 00:58:59,192
educational resources and to unpack and

1384
00:58:59,192 --> 00:58:59,192
discuss these things.

1385
00:58:44,177 --> 00:59:09,196
And I'm impressed by all the

1386
00:59:09,196 --> 00:59:09,196
infrastructure you've put together and by

1387
00:59:09,196 --> 00:59:09,196
everything you've managed to achieve by

1388
00:59:09,196 --> 00:59:09,196
doing this.

1389
00:59:01,188 --> 00:59:18,205
So I'd certainly encourage anyone who's

1390
00:59:18,205 --> 00:59:18,205
interested to join up to your reading

1391
00:59:18,205 --> 00:59:18,205
groups, and I hope they get something out

1392
00:59:18,205 --> 00:59:18,205
of it and out of the book.

1393
00:59:09,196 --> 00:59:20,207
Daniel: Thanks, ali?

1394
00:59:19,206 --> 00:59:33,220
Ali: Well, yes, actually, since the

1395
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:33,220
beginning of the first cohort, this book

1396
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:33,220
has practically become a part of our life

1397
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:33,220
that we love and cherish.

1398
00:59:22,209 --> 00:59:43,230
And it's amazing to see how with each

1399
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:43,230
iteration of our reading group, it gives

1400
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:43,230
rise to a whole different set of

1401
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:43,230
questions and discussions.

1402
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:59,246
And actually, I'm a firm believer in this

1403
00:59:59,246 --> 00:59:59,246
famous quote, I don't know by whom, which

1404
00:59:59,246 --> 00:59:59,246
says that the sign of a great book is not

1405
00:59:59,246 --> 00:59:59,246
how many answers it provides, but rather

1406
00:59:59,246 --> 00:59:59,246
how many thought provoking questions it

1407
00:59:59,246 --> 00:59:59,246
engenders.

1408
00:59:43,230 --> 01:00:14,505
So based on that criterion, and judging

1409
01:00:14,505 --> 01:00:14,505
by the variety of questions brought up

1410
01:00:14,505 --> 01:00:14,505
during our live discussions as a kind of

1411
01:00:14,505 --> 01:00:14,505
empirical evidence for that, I think it's

1412
01:00:14,505 --> 01:00:14,505
probably safe to say that this is truly a

1413
01:00:14,505 --> 01:00:14,505
great book.

1414
00:59:59,246 --> 01:00:15,688
So congratulations on that.

1415
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:16,796
And thank you.

1416
01:00:15,692 --> 01:00:18,943
Thomas: Thank you very much.

1417
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:20,145
Daniel: Great closing thoughts.

1418
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:22,352
So, Thomas, thank you again.

1419
01:00:20,148 --> 01:00:23,482
You're welcome back anytime.

1420
01:00:22,364 --> 01:00:27,808
Thanks, Ali and Terry for all the great

1421
01:00:27,808 --> 01:00:27,808
participation.

1422
01:00:23,489 --> 01:00:29,014
And till next time.

1423
01:00:27,828 --> 01:00:30,135
Thomas: Bye.
