1
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:12,975
All right, hello and welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:13,487 --> 00:00:17,852
This is act int OrgStream number 3.1.

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,967
It's November 3, 2022. Our guest

4
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:25,097
of honor is Bijan Khezri, and we're really

5
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,197
looking forward today to talking about

6
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:29,302
the free energy principle, active

7
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:31,622
inference, and your experience and

8
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:35,072
recent work. However, for today,

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,537
you've requested that I set the stage

10
00:00:37,612 --> 00:00:40,202
with a little bit of context on some of

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,112
the history and development of the

12
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:45,902
active reference distribution and by way

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,827
of doing so, set us up for a

14
00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:52,432
serendipitous collision in our paths,

15
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:55,882
encoding around applied variational,

16
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,587
active inference, and the free energy

17
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,087
principle. So I connected

18
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:04,027
with the co founders of the active

19
00:01:04,057 --> 00:01:06,127
inference Institute, then the active

20
00:01:06,157 --> 00:01:08,462
Inference Lab, which is what it was

21
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:12,317
called until about June 2022 this year.

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,247
And we connected after hearing Karl

23
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:18,722
Friston speak with Lex Friedman and got

24
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:20,857
excited around some of the opportunities

25
00:01:21,022 --> 00:01:23,672
around this developing framework of

26
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:25,262
active inference and the free energy

27
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:28,222
principle, the potential that a unifying

28
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:30,197
framework could help us understand

29
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,512
perception recognition model action

30
00:01:32,587 --> 00:01:34,952
across different kinds of complex and

31
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,567
nested systems and then specifically

32
00:01:37,702 --> 00:01:40,352
applying those models in the context of

33
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:42,272
especially remote teams and

34
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:45,497
organizations. And that resulted in our

35
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,772
2020 work active Inference and Behavior

36
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,177
Engineering for teams, which

37
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:52,327
additionally added in some systems

38
00:01:52,357 --> 00:01:55,052
engineering perspectives especially

39
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:57,637
related to ontology lifecycle

40
00:01:57,712 --> 00:01:59,542
perspective, continuous delivery,

41
00:01:59,602 --> 00:02:01,725
continuous interactions, and so on,

42
00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:04,322
also drawing from an open science and

43
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:07,847
open source background. And since then,

44
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,342
we've been on a journey, we've been

45
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,477
learning and applying active inference,

46
00:02:13,582 --> 00:02:17,487
and our structure has developed.

47
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:20,227
Today we're the active reference

48
00:02:20,257 --> 00:02:22,412
distribution and we're working on some

49
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,797
novelty formalizations of our

50
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:27,197
organizational structure and all these

51
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,592
other important aspects of successful,

52
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:33,022
which is to say surviving organizations

53
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:36,452
and organisms. And that's what led us

54
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:39,742
to find your work and immediately

55
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:42,847
resonate with it as some of the finest

56
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:45,675
contemporary examples of experience

57
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:49,442
guided and shaped and situation

58
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,927
tested cases of organizational active

59
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:55,742
inference. So that is how we came to be

60
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,027
excited about this area and use the

61
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:02,177
terms every day and use the ideas and

62
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:04,052
their relationships in our strategy and

63
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,822
to come across to work and see it as

64
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:06,612
salient.

65
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:11,357
BIJAN KHEZRI: Good. Thank you, Daniel. Well, first of

66
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,052
all, thank you very much for inviting me

67
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,737
on this live chat. I've been obviously

68
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,237
familiar with the active interference

69
00:03:18,737 --> 00:03:21,482
institute. I think it was through the

70
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,962
theoretical neurobiology group of wisdom

71
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,092
that I got signed up to your newsletter.

72
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:29,717
And I was really intrigued by really

73
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:32,582
the diversity of activities of media

74
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,847
products you're generating in order to

75
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,652
advance the case actually for the active

76
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:37,962
reference trajectory.

77
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,022
When you want to ask actually, is there

78
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:46,652
any support from a governance point of

79
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,782
view that's really when we started

80
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,077
actually engaging, because I always feel

81
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:54,902
that in the area, in particular not for

82
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,047
profit, I like to pay my debts and

83
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,622
support it. Now, I do think that

84
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,587
actually you're doing an increase job.

85
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:03,392
It's clearly still at a very early

86
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,952
stage, which is actually equally true

87
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,762
for the active interference movement in

88
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:12,675
the respective sciences. So maybe

89
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:15,827
for those who are in the audience, not

90
00:04:15,845 --> 00:04:18,362
too familiar actually with what really

91
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,075
active inference is about.

92
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:24,647
It's really very philosophy and very

93
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,297
scientific at the same time. Actually,

94
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,742
there's a mathematical framework

95
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:30,397
underlying it which has been applied

96
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:33,062
actually in machine learning and

97
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,952
actually in Karl Tristan's work, which

98
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,447
is the neuroimaging work. So it

99
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,742
is not just a philosophy concept,

100
00:04:42,802 --> 00:04:45,977
but it is actually something which has

101
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:49,292
been applied in hard science and based

102
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,222
on mathematical formulas. But when

103
00:04:53,255 --> 00:04:56,822
you really move away from the

104
00:04:56,855 --> 00:04:59,072
mathematical model and you move more to

105
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:01,352
a philosophical model, then actually a

106
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,472
much more general audience starts

107
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:05,602
understanding that actually active

108
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:09,707
inference is maybe the only way

109
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,512
to engage with the world, which is

110
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,017
increasingly discontinuous and very

111
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,225
distributed. And I

112
00:05:18,587 --> 00:05:21,902
will briefly just say my own path of

113
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,722
how I came across actually into the

114
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:26,957
concept. And then maybe a more general

115
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,692
audience, beyond actually neuroscience,

116
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:32,657
machine learning and biology will start

117
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:34,597
understanding how relevant the concept

118
00:05:34,642 --> 00:05:37,517
of active inference is, of how you build

119
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:39,602
actually your own world model to

120
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,312
navigate. And in the world of business,

121
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:46,642
where I'm from, how to actually allocate

122
00:05:46,702 --> 00:05:50,672
resources in very I

123
00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:52,657
call it continuum environments, I don't

124
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:54,047
like the word uncertainty because

125
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,867
uncertainty is a very subjective

126
00:05:55,927 --> 00:05:58,052
concept. And Zannone saying that the

127
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,727
world is uncertain is more reflection

128
00:06:00,757 --> 00:06:03,227
and admission of the very limitations of

129
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:05,227
the world model they have. And that's

130
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:07,802
really where active inference comes in.

131
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:10,727
So my view and my origin actually of

132
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,367
engaging with the active inference

133
00:06:12,427 --> 00:06:14,477
concept came through looking at

134
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:15,902
corporate governance, looking at the

135
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,902
challenges, actually thought leading

136
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:20,447
organizations in engaging with the

137
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,550
world, which is, as they say,

138
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:27,347
very difficult to predict. And we look

139
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,647
at an inferential model, and when you

140
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,377
look specifically at the active

141
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:35,027
interference model, you start looking at

142
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:38,587
a system, which is actually a wonderful

143
00:06:38,662 --> 00:06:40,942
system to look at, and all of a sudden

144
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:43,592
you can break actually a world which

145
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,957
seems to be quite difficult to predict

146
00:06:47,122 --> 00:06:49,087
into something you can navigate,

147
00:06:49,162 --> 00:06:52,322
actually in a wonderfully simple way.

148
00:06:52,505 --> 00:06:55,472
And the way I look at it is really at

149
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:58,597
the following six components.

150
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:01,522
And I deliberately did not prepare

151
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:03,422
presentation A because I'm very bad with

152
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:05,927
representations to prepare them in the

153
00:07:05,945 --> 00:07:08,297
first place. But I do understand for the

154
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,847
audience, sometimes it's much easier to

155
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,602
have it visualized in front of you. So

156
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,812
I'm trying really in simple ways to

157
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,377
visualize for you in your head. And you

158
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:21,302
may close your eyes as you do this, or

159
00:07:21,395 --> 00:07:23,842
how you build the active interference

160
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,222
framework really bottom up in a very

161
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:27,525
simplistic way,

162
00:07:28,112 --> 00:07:31,337
reflective. There's really two things

163
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:33,452
one has to always look at when you look

164
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,942
at the world. There's things you know

165
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:38,192
and there area things you don't know.

166
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,312
The second dimension is there are things

167
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,517
you control and there are other things

168
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:47,297
you don't control. And this is

169
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,877
a fact. There area many things we don't

170
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:50,402
know. This is the unknown which is

171
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,225
outside and sometimes inside even.

172
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:56,392
And there's many things which are beyond

173
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:58,967
our control. And now we have to build

174
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:02,042
bottomup a model which allows us

175
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,622
actually to navigate through this. And

176
00:08:04,655 --> 00:08:06,572
the way the active interference model is

177
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:08,792
built is that you're looking at four

178
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,402
states and I will go into the states in

179
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,197
a second. You look at actually a wall

180
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:18,637
or a blanket which is actually learning

181
00:08:18,712 --> 00:08:20,477
the known from the unknown which is

182
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:22,282
really the inner world from the outer

183
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:26,417
world. And you have a very simple first

184
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:29,297
order principle which has no purpose in

185
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,122
its own right other than orchestrating

186
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,222
this whole thing. And orchestrating

187
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:37,642
means we have only one objective,

188
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:41,237
we area pursuing and effectively in

189
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:45,450
social life you can actually bring down

190
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:49,762
our ultimate objective as we navigate

191
00:08:49,837 --> 00:08:51,752
and we deal with uncertainty and

192
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,397
unpredictability is we want to minimize

193
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:57,022
surprise. And minimize surprise

194
00:08:57,142 --> 00:09:00,737
mathematically is really a matter of

195
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,487
minimizing the error of

196
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,847
probability state space. I'm coming now

197
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,757
to the states. We have an active state

198
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,512
which is really our actions. Our actions

199
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,312
actually determine our sensory state

200
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,692
which is what we sense. We have an outer

201
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,927
world, the external state and we have an

202
00:09:23,945 --> 00:09:25,427
internal states. The inner state is

203
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:27,397
really our resources in the theorem

204
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,582
context you may say actually what are

205
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:31,577
the firm resources? Now you look at

206
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:34,987
these four states, active sensory,

207
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:38,100
internal and external, very simple.

208
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:41,297
And the internal and the external are

209
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,427
really related to a wall which we call

210
00:09:43,445 --> 00:09:45,607
the Markov blanket. And the Markov

211
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:48,812
blanket does really manage of

212
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,817
how we try and minimize our

213
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:55,192
probability estimates through constantly

214
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:57,012
updating our beliefs.

215
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:01,637
And we do this by trying to minimize at

216
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,875
every juncture in a very generative way

217
00:10:06,212 --> 00:10:08,672
free energy and information theory is

218
00:10:08,705 --> 00:10:11,492
really just a measure of error. So once

219
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,417
you see this, you see in a very very

220
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:17,552
simple way to distill this model now

221
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,482
that actually you need to act to create

222
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,247
your own sensations which allow you

223
00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:28,622
to actually continuously update your

224
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:31,952
beliefs, what beliefs you have about

225
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:35,447
actually the unknown world. And this is

226
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,092
a very generative model. The generative

227
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:40,547
model itself doesn't encode anything but

228
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,247
the generative model is just putting

229
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,617
into a very dynamic relationship how

230
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:48,052
these four states are being governed.

231
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,692
And this is really kind of the theory

232
00:10:50,752 --> 00:10:53,222
part of it when you look at it from a

233
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,652
material and from a practical point of

234
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,077
view you can very quickly see for a firm

235
00:10:59,257 --> 00:11:01,172
that actually there shouldn't be any

236
00:11:01,205 --> 00:11:03,992
uncertainty. What you need is you need

237
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,397
to engage in a very active way with the

238
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,192
world, with a very clearly defined

239
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,142
prediction model which generates

240
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:14,257
predictions and your actions

241
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:16,592
continuously actually update those

242
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,797
predictions and eventually you will

243
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,322
minimize actually the error. So what

244
00:11:22,355 --> 00:11:25,037
that means concrete, what does it mean

245
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,892
precisely in the concept of

246
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,927
strategy? When you look at organizations

247
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,377
and that's obviously the field where I

248
00:11:33,395 --> 00:11:36,242
have a lot of experience as a board

249
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,887
member, as a CEO.

250
00:11:38,987 --> 00:11:42,932
Traditionally the strategy process,

251
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,287
and this is how they teach it at

252
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:48,292
management schools, is very environment

253
00:11:48,352 --> 00:11:51,427
driven. The objective is to say you've

254
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:54,437
got to analyze the environment in order

255
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,872
to define what your strategy is. And the

256
00:11:57,905 --> 00:12:00,317
active inference view is that this is

257
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:03,722
wrong. Actually your strategy is

258
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:05,702
really interpretation driven, which is

259
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,702
effectively by your predictions. It's

260
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:10,112
driven. And then you look for the data

261
00:12:10,175 --> 00:12:13,487
points in the environment to either

262
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,277
confirm, refute, fine tune actually your

263
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:18,797
prediction and eventually, if you're not

264
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,207
right with your prediction errors, dot

265
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,202
two update your prediction model. So

266
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,152
what does that mean precisely? When you

267
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,752
look now at state there's only one thing

268
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,892
as a hyperpria talking in Bayesian

269
00:12:30,952 --> 00:12:33,497
terms, there's only one thing which is

270
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,597
important and that's what's your

271
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,697
purpose? What's the purpose of the

272
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,677
company? And if the purpose of the

273
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:42,902
company is clear, the top, which is

274
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,842
the board, the executive leadership,

275
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:47,372
start generating prediction models of

276
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:51,227
how to best realize this purpose and

277
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:52,652
then it's really for the rest of the

278
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,337
organization in a very iterative model

279
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,427
to feedback bottom up the data points

280
00:12:58,595 --> 00:13:00,962
and then actually it becomes a very

281
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:03,602
continuum process. Hence the title of my

282
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,247
book is also Continuous Transformation.

283
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:10,447
It's a process which is becoming

284
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:14,282
integral to the DNA of actually being in

285
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:16,887
the game, competing in the marketplace.

286
00:13:17,537 --> 00:13:20,437
Strategy is no longer about topdown

287
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:23,102
content prescriptions. It's really a

288
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,982
topdown bottom up, continuous,

289
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:28,577
interactive, generative process. So if

290
00:13:28,595 --> 00:13:32,775
you look at it, active inference is,

291
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:35,552
normatively speaking, really of course a

292
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,802
theory, but it really is a process

293
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:41,117
model. It's a process model of how to

294
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:45,157
minimize surprise and uncertainty

295
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:48,122
in a very complex world. And when you

296
00:13:48,155 --> 00:13:51,767
look at biological systems, they have

297
00:13:51,815 --> 00:13:54,577
done this in wonderful, wonderfully

298
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:57,602
selforganizing mechanisms. And I think

299
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,792
the challenge for the business world is

300
00:13:59,915 --> 00:14:03,587
to reintroduce and bring to life to

301
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,647
selforganizing mechanisms. And the

302
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,752
active inference framework is such a

303
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,032
framework. And when you look at my work

304
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,437
in business administration, I've adapted

305
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:17,627
the active reference trajectory to how

306
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,877
to make it work and what it means in the

307
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:21,987
context of business organizations.

308
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:27,000
Wow, there's a lot there.

309
00:14:27,662 --> 00:14:30,602
Active inference as a process model for

310
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,742
minimizing uncertainty in complex worlds

311
00:14:33,802 --> 00:14:36,997
and a broader theme of using cutting

312
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,637
edge developments as evidenced by your

313
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,547
books bibliography, everything from

314
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:46,667
cognitive science of individuals to

315
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:49,447
organizational studies and quantum

316
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:52,732
mechanics, all these interesting areas

317
00:14:52,822 --> 00:14:55,717
and also really awesome how you framed

318
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:59,027
some of the 0th principles or the

319
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:01,297
commitments that this first principles

320
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:04,117
framework makes. Like the separation

321
00:15:04,177 --> 00:15:05,927
between things you know and things you

322
00:15:05,945 --> 00:15:07,802
don't know, things you control and

323
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,917
things you don't control and of course

324
00:15:09,965 --> 00:15:12,827
all the nuancing that can happen like a

325
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,427
continuum of controllability. So I

326
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:19,312
guess to put it back into the embodied

327
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:21,832
court, what do these topdown

328
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,422
expectations and bottomup signals look

329
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:28,097
like? Are those emails or what are those

330
00:15:28,205 --> 00:15:31,442
actual operational details of this

331
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,525
type of organizational design?

332
00:15:34,862 --> 00:15:36,300
Well, first of all,

333
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:42,472
it's a very good question because it's

334
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:44,177
kind of funny also when I did the

335
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:47,117
empirical work supporting actually my

336
00:15:47,165 --> 00:15:50,492
theoretical work, it's really funny how

337
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,647
companies try to make the case

338
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,242
that they operate actually in this way.

339
00:15:57,365 --> 00:15:59,522
Now, obviously in today's world you have

340
00:15:59,555 --> 00:16:03,047
many technology based tools which allow

341
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:06,422
companies to engage in

342
00:16:06,455 --> 00:16:08,327
very attributes environment in real

343
00:16:08,345 --> 00:16:10,952
time. Slack for example, is one of those

344
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,287
where you create actually you connect,

345
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,527
actually pop down bottom and you engage

346
00:16:17,632 --> 00:16:21,225
the bottom in a very interesting way.

347
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:26,102
As part of my dissertation and the

348
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,192
book research, I went into the question

349
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,462
you asked right now a little bit deeper

350
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:35,057
and starting to understand how

351
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:38,687
companies in an age where there is

352
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,207
many technology tools for massive

353
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:46,652
agreement, how they can use actually

354
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:49,172
the button in order to refine theory,

355
00:16:49,205 --> 00:16:52,637
action, prediction. When you look

356
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,772
at the early days,

357
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,792
it was kind of all about collective

358
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:03,012
intelligence, collective collaboration,

359
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:05,552
how you bring sometimes it was more on a

360
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:09,202
project level. At IMD in Los

361
00:17:09,232 --> 00:17:11,567
Angeles, this two researchers, they have

362
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:14,937
created actually a active inference

363
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:19,787
undertaking which was really meant to be

364
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:23,117
able to define the

365
00:17:23,165 --> 00:17:25,862
questions in the first place, which

366
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:28,562
actually the base should respond to. So

367
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,107
what are the relevant questions?

368
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:32,077
Because obviously by asking a reliving

369
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:34,202
question you frame something and you

370
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,167
frame a pass. How can you even

371
00:17:36,215 --> 00:17:38,687
neutralize this by empowering the base

372
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,892
to generate actually what are the right

373
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,525
questions to do?

374
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:46,742
Cell I shouldn't say there is a big

375
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,607
movement, but there has been a movement

376
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:50,822
and there has been a lot of research on

377
00:17:50,855 --> 00:17:52,817
it and actually they're very big

378
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,547
companies from Red Bull to diamonds to

379
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,727
many big companies which have applied

380
00:17:57,757 --> 00:18:00,227
it, which is called open strategy. And

381
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,317
the idea of the open strategy framework

382
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:06,422
was that actually the strategic issues

383
00:18:06,605 --> 00:18:09,152
which are relevant for the company to

384
00:18:09,245 --> 00:18:11,642
compete in the law firm should be

385
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,397
generated through the base, the employee

386
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:17,297
base of the company. And there were

387
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,322
obviously various technology tools which

388
00:18:19,355 --> 00:18:22,472
were deployed in order to do this.

389
00:18:22,655 --> 00:18:25,477
I think all these things had very mixed

390
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:29,342
results because the question is can you

391
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,932
really open to such a big forum?

392
00:18:33,097 --> 00:18:36,977
Sense states questions so it

393
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:38,627
has been controversial within the

394
00:18:38,645 --> 00:18:40,982
perspective companies, some companies

395
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,147
had really some good input but on the

396
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,612
other hand, it raises also expectations

397
00:18:46,687 --> 00:18:49,067
in the employee base and if it's too

398
00:18:49,115 --> 00:18:51,227
project driven rather than actually

399
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:53,822
really integral to the DNA on a

400
00:18:53,855 --> 00:18:56,972
continuous basis, usually these things,

401
00:18:57,155 --> 00:19:01,172
they fail. One idea I

402
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:04,592
like a lot, having said this, I must

403
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,472
admit I haven't implemented it in my own

404
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:11,192
company. I like the idea when you think

405
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,247
in a company the very top is the board

406
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,547
of directors and you could see beneath

407
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:17,712
it obviously the executive leadership

408
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:21,812
team. I like very much the idea of

409
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,892
creating shadow boards with

410
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,312
younger employees and who face the same

411
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,522
agenda the top board is facing and you

412
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:34,907
look at what kind of discussion points,

413
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,322
what kind of agenda items, what kind of

414
00:19:37,355 --> 00:19:39,827
action representations come from the

415
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,227
base. And I think if you do this in a

416
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:43,727
structured way, it's a great way of

417
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:45,122
incentivizing actually the high

418
00:19:45,155 --> 00:19:47,552
potential in the company. But also I

419
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,892
think what you're doing is actually you

420
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,267
really engage the base to

421
00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:56,102
think strategically and to challenge the

422
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,702
top with exactly the very same topic

423
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:00,992
they're facing. And by the way, that may

424
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,857
generate actually future agenda points

425
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:07,352
as well. So I think the idea has to

426
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,347
be definitely to open up, there's no

427
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,077
question about it, but probably to do it

428
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:13,832
in a more focused way. That's why I

429
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:16,742
think it's shadowboard is a really great

430
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:20,102
thing. I just communicated on

431
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,122
this on LinkedIn this week. But I

432
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:27,197
think what is much more important and

433
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,442
this is what the active reference

434
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:32,792
trajectory and that's why I believe the

435
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,062
active inference institute is doing an

436
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,632
invaluable job by starting

437
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,442
to understand actually what active

438
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:44,342
interference and practical implication

439
00:20:44,465 --> 00:20:46,742
really means. We have to change

440
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,102
fundamentally the way we communicate.

441
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,077
And the biggest problem you have in

442
00:20:51,095 --> 00:20:53,972
organizations, any organization, is the

443
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:57,392
communication. And whenever I look at

444
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,987
the top down, bottom up Bayesian brain,

445
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:03,872
you obviously understanding that an

446
00:21:03,905 --> 00:21:06,422
organization will never, ever be able to

447
00:21:06,455 --> 00:21:08,627
work that efficiently connecting the

448
00:21:08,645 --> 00:21:11,357
topic and the bottom nervous system in a

449
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,077
way to operate, but we have

450
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:18,442
to approximate it. And all of a sudden,

451
00:21:18,502 --> 00:21:20,027
when you start understanding the

452
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,372
Bayesian brain in neuroscience and

453
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:25,537
you apply the active reference

454
00:21:25,612 --> 00:21:30,142
trajectory to social organism mandrake

455
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:33,137
artifacts, you all of a sudden start

456
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,952
understanding how much friction there

457
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,897
is. And myself, as a business leader,

458
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:41,767
CEO, chairman, I'm only dedicated

459
00:21:41,827 --> 00:21:44,312
to one thing, and from theorem,

460
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,202
everything flows brilliantly. And I

461
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,442
think this is the evidence of great and

462
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,247
future oriented leadership in this

463
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,037
continuous market environment, is take

464
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,752
the friction out between the bottom and

465
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,972
the top and there's far too much

466
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:02,657
friction in all the organizations. And

467
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:06,197
that leads many times to the fact that

468
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,392
you have very variable intelligence.

469
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,087
All the intelligence in an organization

470
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,047
is at the very bottom. There is no

471
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,972
intelligence at the top, and the top is

472
00:22:15,005 --> 00:22:17,432
only as intelligent as the bottom is.

473
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:22,042
So a very key, almost categoric

474
00:22:22,102 --> 00:22:25,717
imperative for firm performance,

475
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,422
for a company's performance and

476
00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:30,722
competitiveness is really how

477
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:32,782
do you bring the bottom up intelligence

478
00:22:32,872 --> 00:22:36,187
all the way up. And only on that basis

479
00:22:36,337 --> 00:22:38,347
will you develop smart prediction

480
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:40,352
models, great predictions, and bring

481
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,247
them back to the bottom to challenge

482
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:44,257
them and evolve them. It's a generative

483
00:22:44,347 --> 00:22:47,867
process. So I think what we need to

484
00:22:47,915 --> 00:22:50,297
finally say goodbye to, and this is the

485
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,267
key message of the active inference

486
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:55,862
framework, we need to say goodbye that

487
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,787
you can drive competitiveness,

488
00:23:00,137 --> 00:23:03,137
a future strategy by concept

489
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,642
prescriptions, put it in the right

490
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,242
process, define a very clear purpose and

491
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,252
follow a first order principle to

492
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,872
orchestrate everything, which is free

493
00:23:12,905 --> 00:23:15,347
energy minimization. As I said before,

494
00:23:15,455 --> 00:23:17,972
in information theoretical terms, free

495
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:20,222
energy is nothing but a measure of

496
00:23:20,255 --> 00:23:22,522
error. So all we want to do is measure

497
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,127
the error between our predictions and

498
00:23:25,145 --> 00:23:28,217
the present states when noise. And once

499
00:23:28,265 --> 00:23:31,277
you follow that process, you set free in

500
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:33,752
organization. I gave an example in my

501
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,777
book which is about actually when you do

502
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:38,102
the budget and right now, again in

503
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,997
October, November is the budgeting

504
00:23:40,042 --> 00:23:42,097
period for companies to set the budget

505
00:23:42,142 --> 00:23:45,337
for the next year. Again, you're facing

506
00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:48,502
knowns and unknowns, you're facing

507
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:50,717
issues you control, there's other issues

508
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:52,747
you don't control. And the management

509
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:54,892
team is challenged to put a budget

510
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:58,650
together. The only way they can

511
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:04,327
deal with the unknown is by defining

512
00:24:04,432 --> 00:24:07,577
actions they believe can generate the

513
00:24:07,595 --> 00:24:10,352
right stimuli to actually update their

514
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,722
prediction model in a continuum way. So

515
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:15,752
when I look at the budget, of course I

516
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,707
have to look at the numbers, but I'm

517
00:24:17,797 --> 00:24:19,667
reality not interested in the numbers.

518
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,667
I'm looking at the underlying

519
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:24,772
assumptions and the hypotheses and I'm

520
00:24:24,817 --> 00:24:28,172
looking at the action model and the

521
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:31,877
precise actions the management team

522
00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:34,762
looking to undertake to optimize

523
00:24:34,837 --> 00:24:37,222
actually action prediction and to gain

524
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,767
more and more control and to turn the

525
00:24:39,815 --> 00:24:42,542
unknown into the known. And that's all

526
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,672
it is about as we navigate through this

527
00:24:44,705 --> 00:24:48,047
world, be more in control, know more

528
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:50,527
and have less of the unknown. And that's

529
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:53,492
a continuum process. And I think if

530
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,572
anyone gets it and gets the active

531
00:24:56,617 --> 00:25:00,600
interference framework, then I think

532
00:25:01,262 --> 00:25:05,032
we will no longer talk about uncertainty

533
00:25:05,122 --> 00:25:07,547
in business in the way we talk about it

534
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,887
today. We are really talking more about

535
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,067
model uncertainty, but there is no such

536
00:25:13,115 --> 00:25:14,947
thing as uncertainty in an objective

537
00:25:14,992 --> 00:25:15,600
way.

538
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:23,117
Lot to add there, but really

539
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:25,532
interesting how you highlighted the

540
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,182
necessity of appropriate communications

541
00:25:29,272 --> 00:25:31,502
and pointed to communications as one of

542
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,577
the biggest area of challenge and

543
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,627
uncoincidentally. Also one of the areas

544
00:25:37,732 --> 00:25:40,432
for which for digital organizations,

545
00:25:40,597 --> 00:25:44,957
the affordance area, active states and

546
00:25:45,035 --> 00:25:48,142
the wiring diagram of the organization,

547
00:25:48,277 --> 00:25:50,627
so to speak, the effective and the

548
00:25:50,645 --> 00:25:53,627
functional causal edges, to use some

549
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,097
analogies from neuroimaging, those edges

550
00:25:57,292 --> 00:26:00,422
are composable, often digitally and

551
00:26:00,455 --> 00:26:04,102
increasingly with augmented and digital

552
00:26:04,207 --> 00:26:07,682
collaborators. And so that space

553
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,987
of wiring is vast.

554
00:26:10,562 --> 00:26:13,612
It's faster than building a physical

555
00:26:13,762 --> 00:26:16,957
building or object because it can exist

556
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:19,847
with many different counterfactuals and

557
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,147
in kind of imagined spaces. So how do we

558
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,672
go from this insight and

559
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:28,697
maybe even some imperatives or

560
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,952
heuristics like to reduce the friction

561
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,627
between the bottom and the top, as you

562
00:26:32,645 --> 00:26:36,707
described, towards a given or particular

563
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,182
organizational structure in a certain

564
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,142
concept. There have

565
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,082
been models. I think one company,

566
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,222
Zappos, has been doing this more

567
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:53,522
in a holographic way, trying to

568
00:26:53,555 --> 00:26:54,150
really,

569
00:27:00,512 --> 00:27:02,572
the way I say it, in very simplistic

570
00:27:02,617 --> 00:27:04,942
terms, looking at organizational models

571
00:27:05,002 --> 00:27:08,492
and organizational forms. If we do

572
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,997
agree as a working assumption that the

573
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,302
world is discontinuous and attributes,

574
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:17,197
then I do believe that organizational

575
00:27:17,242 --> 00:27:18,797
structures need to be much more

576
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,502
distributed and much less centralized.

577
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,122
And I think we need to break up

578
00:27:24,155 --> 00:27:28,147
companies and bring them into smaller

579
00:27:28,192 --> 00:27:31,952
units and empower them and

580
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,472
they will be much more performing,

581
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:36,075
because what we're doing is we area

582
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:39,062
minimizing or optimizing in a certain

583
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:41,002
way the pathway between bottomup

584
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:44,387
intelligence and stimuli, going actually

585
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,172
to top action prediction. And that

586
00:27:46,205 --> 00:27:48,047
should be the ultimate objective. How

587
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,727
can we minimize the friction? And

588
00:27:49,745 --> 00:27:52,697
sometimes the friction is really a

589
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,542
function of how we simplify organization

590
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:58,892
and forms of organizing. What's very

591
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,192
interesting when you look there is kind

592
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,647
of and it comes really from prehistoric

593
00:28:05,692 --> 00:28:08,347
times before even language appeared,

594
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:11,792
when actually people communicated in

595
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,942
forms of touching each other, that the

596
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,392
maximum number of a community

597
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:22,267
is 150. That's where you can distinguish

598
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:25,322
switch touches in certain ways. And

599
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:27,692
that's kind of a magic number, which has

600
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,897
been actually, I guess these are the

601
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:33,277
very origins, as some researchers

602
00:28:33,382 --> 00:28:35,642
in the language field have informed me.

603
00:28:35,765 --> 00:28:39,242
But I think it's funny to see that

604
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,297
there's a number of companies which look

605
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,552
at the 150 to 200 as the magic number.

606
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,847
And that's when actually an

607
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,547
organizational entity should be no

608
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,367
bigger. And if a company has 50 Zebra

609
00:28:52,415 --> 00:28:54,497
employees, then it should be really in

610
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,077
much smaller units and empower them.

611
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,777
And I think that's what I'm doing. My

612
00:28:59,795 --> 00:29:01,997
company's obviously not that big, but in

613
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,877
my company, I have four companies which

614
00:29:04,895 --> 00:29:06,452
are quite distinct companies, but I

615
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,742
think that's the strength, because

616
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,597
theory form one unity, but they remain

617
00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:14,612
very distinct. And I can see that they

618
00:29:14,675 --> 00:29:16,967
are much more performing if they were

619
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:19,747
just business units as part of a bigger

620
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:23,672
thing. So they have very autonomous and

621
00:29:23,705 --> 00:29:25,837
very respective leadership structures.

622
00:29:25,987 --> 00:29:30,000
And I do believe to your point,

623
00:29:30,587 --> 00:29:35,072
looking at the form of organization is

624
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:37,217
very critical. And I do think, having

625
00:29:37,265 --> 00:29:40,217
said so, there have been many

626
00:29:40,265 --> 00:29:41,927
researchers before who have been looking

627
00:29:41,945 --> 00:29:43,502
at neuroscience, the structure of the

628
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,527
brain, transferring it actually to

629
00:29:45,545 --> 00:29:47,597
organizational science, and it has been

630
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,347
certainly true for biology. But I'm

631
00:29:50,392 --> 00:29:54,912
always fascinated looking into biology,

632
00:29:57,512 --> 00:30:01,292
how our first

633
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,442
of all, how perception is very

634
00:30:04,565 --> 00:30:08,447
spaceyspecific and how we

635
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,897
have a tendency to generalize and

636
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,522
obviously make it very human centric the

637
00:30:14,555 --> 00:30:18,497
world. And once we get to the point that

638
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,572
we start understanding that the world is

639
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:25,127
not human centric, then actually

640
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,872
I think we will be much more open to be

641
00:30:27,905 --> 00:30:31,217
enriched by the insights and

642
00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:33,722
the inspiration the biological world can

643
00:30:33,755 --> 00:30:37,247
give us and to actually become aware of

644
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,997
the very limitations we have and how we

645
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:44,562
can actually navigate with uncertainty.

646
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:46,897
And there the active reference

647
00:30:46,942 --> 00:30:49,967
trajectory will come in. And I think the

648
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:53,567
problem we have as a human species is

649
00:30:53,615 --> 00:30:56,712
that we are the only species

650
00:30:57,062 --> 00:30:59,867
which has this understanding power of

651
00:30:59,915 --> 00:31:03,797
learning, but we have so many

652
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,650
limitations which are very severe and

653
00:31:08,912 --> 00:31:11,297
kind of we area empowered on the one

654
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,967
side with learning, but we are

655
00:31:14,015 --> 00:31:16,172
completely handicapped on the other

656
00:31:16,205 --> 00:31:18,247
side. We can't see electric magnetic

657
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:21,300
waves. So there's many interesting

658
00:31:21,737 --> 00:31:25,847
theories and some of them I

659
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,627
really like that our reflective or if

660
00:31:29,645 --> 00:31:32,187
you look at the very sense of evolution

661
00:31:32,687 --> 00:31:36,227
has never been about seeing the truth as

662
00:31:36,245 --> 00:31:39,900
bit is our existence and our

663
00:31:40,487 --> 00:31:43,892
epistemic for raging and exploration is

664
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,107
not about approximating truth.

665
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:50,422
Actually most of the time we do ignore

666
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:53,317
the truth. It's all about fitness

667
00:31:53,377 --> 00:31:56,897
payoffs because we want to survive and

668
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,987
we want to procreate and it's all about

669
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:03,002
that and that drives our behavior and

670
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,077
you start not looking at things the way

671
00:32:06,095 --> 00:32:08,117
theory are as much as actually our

672
00:32:08,165 --> 00:32:11,987
engagement we see a desktop. But behind

673
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:15,437
the desktop are pixels in many different

674
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,267
things which actually create our

675
00:32:17,315 --> 00:32:18,797
perception but what we're seeing is

676
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,062
definitely not the truth. So I think

677
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,317
unless we get to the point where we say

678
00:32:24,365 --> 00:32:28,102
goodbye very classical notion and that's

679
00:32:28,132 --> 00:32:30,832
why I bring also my book the Relation

680
00:32:30,922 --> 00:32:33,967
and the Juxtaposition between classical

681
00:32:34,027 --> 00:32:37,247
physics and quantum physics. We have to

682
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,572
move to quantum physics and we need to

683
00:32:39,605 --> 00:32:42,197
actually start understanding the world

684
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:45,217
does not operate according to classical

685
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:47,852
laws. It really operating point to

686
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,967
quantum law. And once you start doing

687
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:53,862
it, I think you have to embrace

688
00:32:55,262 --> 00:32:59,147
our evidence but the way we control

689
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,402
not control the known and the unknown in

690
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,592
a completely new way. And my

691
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,847
contribution in the active inference

692
00:33:06,892 --> 00:33:09,047
framework is really to say this is

693
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,167
something which is immensely valuable to

694
00:33:12,215 --> 00:33:14,207
redefining what strategy dean in the

695
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,712
business world I know we're at the very

696
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:18,722
beginning. That's why I'm sure the

697
00:33:18,755 --> 00:33:21,152
audience engaging with us today is a

698
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,932
very small audience and I have to say,

699
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,857
as you could see also with my

700
00:33:27,935 --> 00:33:30,772
theoretical introduction to the active

701
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:34,592
interference framework, it is so

702
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,547
abstract for many people, for us it's so

703
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,027
natural and we see the mathematical

704
00:33:40,057 --> 00:33:42,347
formulas behind it and we see the

705
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:47,047
consistency. But forming

706
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,947
a book, writing a book even for the

707
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,107
business community makes it almost a

708
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,922
book nobody can read and nobody can

709
00:33:52,955 --> 00:33:55,847
understand. But I'm absolutely of the

710
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,697
conviction that this book, that the work

711
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,262
of the active reference distribution and

712
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:03,232
Karl Friston has been our great source

713
00:34:03,247 --> 00:34:05,447
of inclination for all of this is

714
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,957
setting free a movement. And I'm

715
00:34:07,972 --> 00:34:09,467
absolutely convinced it's just a matter

716
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:11,867
of time that this become in a very

717
00:34:11,915 --> 00:34:13,962
significant way mainstream.

718
00:34:17,162 --> 00:34:21,450
Wow. Well a lot you add there the

719
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:24,952
recurrent mention of the distributed

720
00:34:25,057 --> 00:34:29,272
systems and state in distributed systems

721
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,642
reminds me of my earlier graduate school

722
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:36,562
work on foraging decision making in ants

723
00:34:36,712 --> 00:34:40,172
where no single nest mate knows how

724
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:41,972
many seeds the colony has, how many

725
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:43,682
seeds there are out there, what's the

726
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:46,322
humidity, what's the water loss rate,

727
00:34:46,505 --> 00:34:48,872
none of the relevant information. And

728
00:34:48,905 --> 00:34:51,757
yet it embodies through behavior,

729
00:34:51,847 --> 00:34:54,347
development, evolution, biology, it

730
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,292
embodies a solution to the regularities

731
00:34:57,352 --> 00:34:59,447
of that niche which includes like

732
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,182
abiotic challenges, antibiotic

733
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,072
challenges and then you've connected to

734
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:08,147
epistemic foraging which is what we use

735
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,397
to describe when actions are

736
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,832
understanding with the imperative

737
00:35:12,922 --> 00:35:16,052
primarily of reducing uncertainty and

738
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:19,532
gaining information. And the free energy

739
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:22,487
imperative has a dual epistemic and

740
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,762
pragmatic component. So under conditions

741
00:35:25,837 --> 00:35:28,577
of high certainty epistemically, the

742
00:35:28,595 --> 00:35:30,782
pragmatic component can be dialed in.

743
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,092
In the special case converging on

744
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,052
utility learning. And then in scenarios

745
00:35:36,082 --> 00:35:38,722
with a flatter landscape where there's

746
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:41,117
less of a sharpness or need for

747
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:43,762
pragmatism, there's an exploration

748
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:46,157
landscape where the epistemic value and

749
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,752
the novelty can be generated. And so

750
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,062
there's just so much there in thinking

751
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:55,007
about distributed systems in biology and

752
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:57,692
in organizations which after all are

753
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,202
biological too. So what

754
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,537
are your closing thoughts?

755
00:36:04,712 --> 00:36:08,672
No, I think we

756
00:36:08,705 --> 00:36:10,652
covered certainly for an audience to get

757
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,942
an insight of active interference

758
00:36:14,002 --> 00:36:17,072
framework, applying it. I like very much

759
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:18,757
your last contribution because I'm

760
00:36:18,772 --> 00:36:20,627
fascinated by the work you have done

761
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,272
with ants and even the brains of ants.

762
00:36:23,317 --> 00:36:25,892
I mean, you're going down to a level

763
00:36:26,015 --> 00:36:29,400
which is almost quantum in a certain way

764
00:36:30,812 --> 00:36:35,327
and I

765
00:36:35,345 --> 00:36:39,737
can only reiterate that I reality

766
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,142
would love to see this interview is my

767
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,847
contribution also of really firmly

768
00:36:45,892 --> 00:36:48,217
establishing the Active Interference

769
00:36:48,277 --> 00:36:52,397
Institute as a great force for a

770
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:56,192
whole new way of being inspired by

771
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:01,097
biology neuroscience to

772
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,800
embrace the world with a completely

773
00:37:05,612 --> 00:37:08,687
different mindset. And I think the world

774
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:13,147
is today in a state where it's

775
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:16,637
so obvious that actually we area

776
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,232
overwhelmed, whether it's from a

777
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:21,612
geopolitical point of view, whether it's

778
00:37:22,637 --> 00:37:24,917
from an economic point of view and

779
00:37:24,965 --> 00:37:26,927
eventually from a psychological point of

780
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,162
view because the dynamics have become

781
00:37:29,225 --> 00:37:31,397
very complex. Why? Because technology

782
00:37:31,505 --> 00:37:34,037
has empowered every person to have

783
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,202
actually a beyond imaginable impact on

784
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,322
the whole one individual potentially to

785
00:37:40,355 --> 00:37:42,472
be I don't like the word disruptive,

786
00:37:42,517 --> 00:37:45,947
but to generate discontinuities. And

787
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,067
that makes it actually increasingly

788
00:37:48,127 --> 00:37:51,332
difficult to construct an algorithm with

789
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:53,702
not only what variables are part of it,

790
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,577
but how do the variables relate and what

791
00:37:55,595 --> 00:37:58,727
is their respective waiting in the

792
00:37:58,745 --> 00:38:02,107
algorithm to start developing

793
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:05,267
actually a way moving forward. And I

794
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:08,012
am of the conviction and I see it

795
00:38:08,075 --> 00:38:10,697
reading the mainstream newspapers, I

796
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,452
don't really read the newspapers, but

797
00:38:12,545 --> 00:38:15,952
looking at actually through the voices

798
00:38:15,982 --> 00:38:17,777
which come through from the leaders in

799
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:21,832
various forums, they area overwhelmed

800
00:38:21,997 --> 00:38:23,417
and they have reached the very

801
00:38:23,465 --> 00:38:26,647
limitations of defining

802
00:38:26,842 --> 00:38:29,657
articulating communication, their very

803
00:38:29,735 --> 00:38:32,027
world model. I think actually they

804
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:34,097
haven't got a world model any longer and

805
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,347
because they haven't got it, they are

806
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,952
control error, uncertainty and

807
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:41,372
unpredictability. And I do believe that

808
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:45,375
the time is so ripe for actually

809
00:38:46,562 --> 00:38:50,147
bringing more awareness to the fact of

810
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,587
how we have to work on our model

811
00:38:53,012 --> 00:38:55,477
forward, model, reality models,

812
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:58,067
whatever you want to call it, and more

813
00:38:58,115 --> 00:39:01,547
importantly, what processes should be in

814
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:05,107
place to actually update those models

815
00:39:05,197 --> 00:39:07,937
and make them better and better going

816
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,802
forward. And I can start and I have to

817
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,497
say they're wonderful examples which

818
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,257
have really and I want to give this as a

819
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,627
closing remark, as an example. When you

820
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:19,157
look at the gain world. I'm obviously

821
00:39:19,235 --> 00:39:20,552
coming from the gaming world. As an

822
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:24,502
entrepreneur you have traditionally

823
00:39:24,682 --> 00:39:27,142
reward functions in a game. So let's

824
00:39:27,202 --> 00:39:30,077
take a very simple shooter game. In a

825
00:39:30,095 --> 00:39:32,897
shooter game, the agent is rewarded who

826
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,762
shoots most of the planes and eventually

827
00:39:34,837 --> 00:39:36,497
is the winner. Let's assume that's the

828
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:39,197
logic of the game. When you look at the

829
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,750
free energy minimization powered agent

830
00:39:43,337 --> 00:39:47,387
he has or she has no cue about

831
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,742
what the reward function of the game is

832
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:52,832
zero. All the agent does is the agent

833
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,382
starts playing the game and chaos only

834
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,902
one first order principle which is to

835
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,217
minimize surprise. So eventually the

836
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,467
agent starts learning in order to

837
00:40:03,515 --> 00:40:07,217
survive, which is the hyper prior you

838
00:40:07,265 --> 00:40:09,647
need to behave in a certain way in order

839
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,247
not to get shot and you have to engage

840
00:40:12,292 --> 00:40:15,497
in certain behavioral traits. So now you

841
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,452
have two agents in one game. The game is

842
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:21,487
a shooter game, there is a reward

843
00:40:21,562 --> 00:40:24,677
function powered agent and there

844
00:40:24,695 --> 00:40:28,492
is a free energy or surprise

845
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:31,922
minimization powered agent. The free

846
00:40:31,955 --> 00:40:34,650
energy agent will always win, always

847
00:40:35,462 --> 00:40:37,172
because it takes a little bit longer to

848
00:40:37,205 --> 00:40:41,122
train it. But eventually you don't

849
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:43,202
need to know the reward function and the

850
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,077
reward functions are outdated by the

851
00:40:45,095 --> 00:40:47,372
time you communicate them and companies

852
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,017
need to understand this. Liberalize

853
00:40:50,077 --> 00:40:52,592
yourself, free yourself actually from

854
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,022
all that friction you area creating with

855
00:40:55,055 --> 00:40:58,037
PowerPoint presentations, with top down

856
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,247
communication which fossilize the

857
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,127
mindset and the intelligence which is at

858
00:41:04,145 --> 00:41:06,452
the bottom of the company. Just put a

859
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,747
selforganizing process governed by the

860
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,077
free energy principle in place and once

861
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,877
you have a clearly defined purpose which

862
00:41:13,895 --> 00:41:17,317
is timeless, you create your prediction

863
00:41:17,377 --> 00:41:20,447
models and the journey can start and

864
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,867
you will see there's no more any such

865
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:27,362
thing as uncertainty. It's only a way of

866
00:41:27,425 --> 00:41:30,797
how uncertainty minimizing your

867
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:33,300
models are. And that's the only thing.

868
00:41:35,462 --> 00:41:37,997
Amazing. Well for those who are

869
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,127
listening all the way we expect and

870
00:41:40,145 --> 00:41:41,867
reference trajectory, you will get

871
00:41:41,915 --> 00:41:44,642
involved or otherwise allocate your

872
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,227
regime of attention to active inference

873
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:49,052
and the active inference institute and

874
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:51,825
hopefully participate in some way.

875
00:41:52,487 --> 00:41:56,197
Thanks for this awesome conversation.

876
00:41:56,392 --> 00:41:59,972
We really have so much to learn from

877
00:42:00,005 --> 00:42:03,002
each other and from our niche and from

878
00:42:03,095 --> 00:42:05,972
the unknown unknowns and from the bottom

879
00:42:06,155 --> 00:42:09,632
and from all around. So awesome

880
00:42:09,785 --> 00:42:13,172
and until next time, thank you. Thank

881
00:42:13,205 --> 00:42:15,175
you Daniel, much appreciate it.
