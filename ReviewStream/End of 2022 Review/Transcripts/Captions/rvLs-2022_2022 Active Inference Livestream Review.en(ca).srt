00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,144
>>>DANIEL FRIEDMAN: Hello and welcome, everyone. It's

2
00:00:10,192 --> 00:00:13,556
December 31, 2022. We are

3
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:17,088
here in the 2022 Active Inference

4
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:20,656
Livestream review. Welcome to the active

5
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,548
inference institute. We're a

6
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:24,996
participatory online institute that is

7
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:26,880
communicating, learning, and practicing

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,476
applied active coherence. This is a

9
00:00:29,498 --> 00:00:31,932
recorded and an active Livestream, so

10
00:00:31,986 --> 00:00:33,628
please provide us with feedback so we

11
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:36,152
can improve our work. All backgrounds

12
00:00:36,216 --> 00:00:38,316
and perspectives are welcome. We'll be

13
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,996
following good video etiquette for

14
00:00:40,018 --> 00:00:42,732
Livestreams Head over Active

15
00:00:42,786 --> 00:00:45,456
Coherence.org to learn more about

16
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:48,144
getting involved in live streams or

17
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:50,192
various other projects and learning

18
00:00:50,246 --> 00:00:53,696
groups at the institute. Well,

19
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,190
today is going to be great and fun.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,504
We are simply reviewing our streams

21
00:01:01,552 --> 00:01:04,020
from this past year. We're going to

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,708
touch lightly or mildly

23
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:10,344
on all the streams that we carried out

24
00:01:10,382 --> 00:01:14,296
from 2022. And by

25
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:16,920
way of doing that, we may end up

26
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,212
reflecting and preflecting thinking

27
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:23,550
about where we're going to head in 2023.

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,432
So we'll begin with just an introduction

29
00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:30,908
and a hello, I'm Daniel. I am a

30
00:01:30,914 --> 00:01:33,804
researcher in California and I'm excited

31
00:01:33,852 --> 00:01:37,810
to reflect. This is like the dot zero

32
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,312
preparation, dot one, dot two

33
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:43,264
discussion, and then afterwards we

34
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:45,340
reflect. This is like the bookend

35
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,368
reflection for all of those. And so it's

36
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:50,976
like an even deeper level of nesting.

37
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:54,084
When we're going to Juxtapose. So many

38
00:01:54,122 --> 00:01:56,448
things that we talked about, and I'm

39
00:01:56,464 --> 00:01:59,190
sure at some neural level,

40
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,168
whether somebody was familiar with the

41
00:02:02,174 --> 00:02:04,388
streams or whether they listened to none

42
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:06,408
of them, there's going to be something

43
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:09,012
about just touching on so many topics

44
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:11,068
and so many perspectives being

45
00:02:11,154 --> 00:02:12,716
juxtaposed that I think is going to be

46
00:02:12,738 --> 00:02:15,980
really pleasant to you. Dean.

47
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,076
>>>DEAN TICKLES: Yeah. Thanks, Dean. I'm Dean. I'm here

48
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:22,412
in Calgary. Maybe I'm a revised or

49
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:25,536
recycled researcher. I don't know what

50
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:29,996
my title is now, but after Daniel

51
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:31,904
said, yeah, I think we should do this

52
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:33,488
again, I was like, yeah, we absolutely

53
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:36,608
should, because my metaphor is that it's

54
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:39,924
kind of like double frying those

55
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:43,220
French fries. It just adds an extra

56
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,760
layer of integration or crispiness

57
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,440
that's hard to resist.

58
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,664
The way that we present these things is

59
00:02:52,862 --> 00:02:55,428
hopefully a way of integrating a bunch

60
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:57,556
of information because we talk amongst

61
00:02:57,588 --> 00:03:00,136
ourselves and it's helpful. And then you

62
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:01,944
look back at yourself talking about

63
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,408
yourself and others, and you just get a

64
00:03:04,414 --> 00:03:06,556
whole different perspective on it. So I

65
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:08,172
actually am really looking forward to

66
00:03:08,226 --> 00:03:10,044
sort of running through these things.

67
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:11,368
It's going to be a sprint, but that's

68
00:03:11,384 --> 00:03:13,456
okay. It still gives you a chance to

69
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:15,216
figure out what the milestones were.

70
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:16,848
It's like seeing the entire Tour de

71
00:03:16,854 --> 00:03:19,920
France in 30 minutes,

72
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,024
which is kind of fun. It's like we

73
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:26,980
completed that marathon and now we're

74
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,244
high speed watching the recording from

75
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:33,668
our body camera. All right,

76
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:37,092
well, we'll keep with some patterns from

77
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:39,152
the more paper centric discussions,

78
00:03:39,216 --> 00:03:41,896
like leading with big questions. So what

79
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:45,144
was our stream of attention in 2022 and

80
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:48,168
where and how will we stream in 2023?

81
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:50,396
What did you have to add on these

82
00:03:50,418 --> 00:03:50,990
questions?

83
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,956
Not a heck of a lot. It'll be

84
00:03:56,978 --> 00:03:59,244
interesting given the amount of time

85
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:02,172
that you committed to the endeavor of

86
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:04,476
here's 2022. I wonder what we'll fill it

87
00:04:04,498 --> 00:04:06,384
with. I'm curious now that now that

88
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:09,424
you're on the back side of that, what

89
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:11,616
parts of what you hoped would be

90
00:04:11,638 --> 00:04:14,608
achieved came about and what parts do

91
00:04:14,614 --> 00:04:17,844
you think there's still room for some

92
00:04:18,042 --> 00:04:21,700
backfilling? We'll come to that after

93
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,910
we've touched on everything.

94
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,796
Yeah. I really liked what you added

95
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:31,816
here, though. In a world that is

96
00:04:31,998 --> 00:04:34,212
becoming more familiar with correlation

97
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:36,520
and digital mediums and spaces,

98
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,576
is our use of technology more than an

99
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:41,710
easy way to gain information access?

100
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,932
You can be in the library all you want

101
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:49,404
and you won't read a book. We can

102
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:52,332
have all the access to information in

103
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:55,200
the world and we won't necessarily

104
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,496
digest and incorporate. We can have all

105
00:04:58,518 --> 00:05:01,244
the generative AI in the world writing

106
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,104
in these amazing essays and making art.

107
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:04,912
But where does that put us as

108
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:07,424
information forager and then you added,

109
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:10,756
can we turn figuring out into out there

110
00:05:10,938 --> 00:05:14,484
figuring? And as more and more people

111
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:18,404
start to want to figure out active

112
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:21,096
inference, it's not a Rubik's Cube on

113
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:23,716
the table that gets finished.

114
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:26,856
And by putting it out there,

115
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:30,192
figuring is where active inference

116
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:32,792
are. So I think that's really exciting.

117
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:35,310
Like, we do have so much to figure out

118
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,044
from all backgrounds, and yet we

119
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:43,292
want to be out there figuring and having

120
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:46,284
impact. I think that's where your

121
00:05:46,322 --> 00:05:48,608
background and field research and my

122
00:05:48,694 --> 00:05:51,072
background in sending people out into

123
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:54,704
professional settings, they're very

124
00:05:54,742 --> 00:05:57,460
different, but also structurally very

125
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,244
similar. There's no substitute for

126
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:03,188
actually picking yourself up. It's a

127
00:06:03,194 --> 00:06:05,396
form of migration. You like you use the

128
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:06,964
word stingrate. Until I can actually

129
00:06:07,002 --> 00:06:09,736
figure out what my pheromone trail is,

130
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:12,536
I'll let you have that piece of it. But

131
00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:15,930
I mean, I understand it. I get it. And

132
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,848
yeah, let's see where it takes us.

133
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:22,968
All right. Roadmap.

134
00:06:23,144 --> 00:06:26,296
So maybe we should have done like a rear

135
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:28,812
view mirror or something. But we had 87

136
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:32,292
streams in 2022. The live streams.

137
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:36,016
Table has 87 rows. So it

138
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:38,480
was an amazing year. And the numbers are

139
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,832
shown here. We're going to touch pretty

140
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:47,110
lightly on all of the streams from

141
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,624
two through nine. The roundtable

142
00:06:50,672 --> 00:06:52,624
symposium, math stream, Jorge stream,

143
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:54,372
Twitter spaces, guest stream, model

144
00:06:54,426 --> 00:06:56,848
stream, and bookstream. And then we're

145
00:06:56,864 --> 00:06:59,144
going to slow down a little bit and talk

146
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:01,032
about some of the papers that we

147
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:04,312
discussed. So first, the overall review,

148
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:07,720
though, for a general

149
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,320
Institute level review, check out our

150
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,816
quarterly roundtable number four. So

151
00:07:13,838 --> 00:07:15,816
that's where we talk more about the

152
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:18,376
Institute's directions, other projects,

153
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:19,848
and learning groups. But today we're

154
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:21,244
just going to talk about the Live

155
00:07:21,282 --> 00:07:25,596
Streams. All right, what did

156
00:07:25,618 --> 00:07:28,510
you write with these questions? Yeah,

157
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,876
I'm often curious because when you're

158
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:34,800
when you're busy constructing 87 rows,

159
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,790
when you reached whatever that limit is,

160
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,204
is there a big picture that has come

161
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:45,860
about as a result of that stack.

162
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,888
Again, it'll probably be something we'll

163
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:51,096
be able to answer better at the

164
00:07:51,118 --> 00:07:54,264
conclusion of our chat today,

165
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:56,056
but I think it's something to try to

166
00:07:56,078 --> 00:07:58,090
keep in mind. I don't know that we can

167
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,656
say with certainty that your big picture

168
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:03,948
and my sense of that same picture is the

169
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:07,404
same interpretation. But it's a good

170
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:11,260
idea to keep a sort of a general level

171
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,576
sense of so. Did this all come together?

172
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:18,396
Or how did the live streams intermingle

173
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:19,484
with some of the guest streams

174
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,804
intermingle with some of the bookstream

175
00:08:21,852 --> 00:08:24,904
stuff that you and is it Tyler and Bleu

176
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,550
are looking at right now?

177
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,196
Yeah, well, the links here can

178
00:08:32,218 --> 00:08:35,120
all be accessed through active

179
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,456
inference. And of course, one project of

180
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:40,228
note is the active inference journal,

181
00:08:40,324 --> 00:08:42,392
where all of the live streams, through

182
00:08:42,446 --> 00:08:45,224
the incredible work of Dave Douglas and

183
00:08:45,262 --> 00:08:48,516
others, get transcribed,

184
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:52,232
archived and versioned up on the GitHub.

185
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:55,356
So that is one structural development of

186
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:57,964
the live streams. Is there a big

187
00:08:58,002 --> 00:09:01,084
picture? It really can feel like just

188
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:04,736
moving pebbles back and forth, and there

189
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:08,176
isn't necessarily a vision of what the

190
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:11,488
final nest looks like. So I

191
00:09:11,494 --> 00:09:13,904
hope we can kind of look back on it once

192
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:16,796
we've gone through it. All right, let's

193
00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:20,032
jump in. First roundtables.

194
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:23,024
So we have a tradition of four quarterly

195
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:26,180
roundtables at the institute scale.

196
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,776
The first two one we'll notice are

197
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:32,356
ActInf lab quarterly roundtables,

198
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:35,236
and the third and the fourth are active

199
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:37,316
coherence institute roundtables.

200
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:40,748
Because in the middle of 2022, we had,

201
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,452
of course, our transition from being

202
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:45,944
active inference lab to active inference

203
00:09:45,992 --> 00:09:50,076
institute. So here's an image meme that

204
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:52,468
we have from the fourth quarterly

205
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:55,776
roundtable and these roundtables the

206
00:09:55,798 --> 00:09:57,456
screenshots with who's there and who

207
00:09:57,478 --> 00:10:00,176
shows up, but also just what we

208
00:10:00,198 --> 00:10:03,836
discussed are like planting a series

209
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:07,456
of flags in the ground and they're

210
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:11,524
an absolutely honest representation of

211
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:14,692
who we were and what we were doing then.

212
00:10:14,826 --> 00:10:18,504
And so I really enjoy sometimes even

213
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:20,872
looking back and seeing how things have

214
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:23,850
happened. So that's not as

215
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,372
scientifically or philosophically

216
00:10:26,436 --> 00:10:29,656
concept of a live stream series. And the

217
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:32,396
information in certain ways is out of

218
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:34,556
date because it's more of an

219
00:10:34,578 --> 00:10:37,592
informative, participation oriented

220
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:41,612
communication, but nonetheless a great

221
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:45,712
series. And also, before we head in

222
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:48,144
and to avert saying this, of every

223
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,240
single series in stream,

224
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,256
big appreciation for those who had the

225
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,136
bravery and capacity to join,

226
00:10:57,328 --> 00:11:00,292
whether they joined repeatedly or one

227
00:11:00,346 --> 00:11:03,696
time, it's been awesome and it's

228
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:05,636
totally co created with the people who

229
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:09,364
are there in the most just unbelievable

230
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:12,250
ways. All right,

231
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,008
to the symposium. So this was our second

232
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:18,200
applied active inference symposium.

233
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,604
The focus was on robotics, and the first

234
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:25,292
applied active inference symposium in 21

235
00:11:25,426 --> 00:11:28,124
was just with Karl Friston. It was a one

236
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:30,908
man show. And for this symposium, we had

237
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:34,316
some more elaborate developments. We had

238
00:11:34,338 --> 00:11:37,436
some entorhinal co organizers in Matt

239
00:11:37,468 --> 00:11:40,800
Brown and in Mark Miller. We also wanted

240
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,968
to Costa wide variety of speakers

241
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,892
and perspectives. So we had two four

242
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:51,940
hour sections with 12345

243
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:56,420
presenters in the first session and 1234

244
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,624
and a half with Friston joining in the

245
00:11:59,662 --> 00:12:03,640
second session. And we saw

246
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,476
active states of the art in active

247
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:09,016
inference being applied to robotics. We

248
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:12,536
saw embodied actual robots. We learned

249
00:12:12,568 --> 00:12:14,940
about some of the theory. We saw

250
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,884
connections to previous lineages of

251
00:12:17,922 --> 00:12:21,420
robotics and also more general control.

252
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,860
Theoretic Brea each of the sessions

253
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,116
closed with a roundtable discussion,

254
00:12:27,308 --> 00:12:29,872
the second one being more populous than

255
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:33,330
the first. And when people say like,

256
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,836
okay, enough about what active inference

257
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:37,904
is, how and where can it be applied?

258
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:40,388
And people commonly point to areas like

259
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:43,636
human health as well as robotics as some

260
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:46,324
of the leading areas in the recent and

261
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:50,250
in the coming years. And I'm just really

262
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,232
happy that we were able to highlight the

263
00:12:54,286 --> 00:12:56,872
state of the art. Like, this is what

264
00:12:56,926 --> 00:12:58,936
robotics and active inference looked

265
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,104
like in 2022. Publish a transcript,

266
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:04,600
make it citable, and give visibility

267
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,396
across these different sectors so that

268
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,412
they could connect on some of their

269
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:10,136
developments and also their ongoing

270
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:10,940
challenges.

271
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,594
Math stream. Yeah, go ahead. I hope

272
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,922
that at some point,

273
00:13:21,976 --> 00:13:24,766
and I don't know, timing really matters,

274
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:28,040
but I hope at some point, people in

275
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,714
other more dedicated learning spaces,

276
00:13:31,762 --> 00:13:35,590
like formal education spaces systems,

277
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,298
will find themselves asking questions

278
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:43,466
around how things that we've been

279
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:45,894
talking about and we've been interacting

280
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:49,754
on might complement the way

281
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:52,254
that things happen in those systems. So

282
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:54,926
it's not, let's go build a robot that

283
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:58,026
does x. It's actually taking the active

284
00:13:58,058 --> 00:14:01,610
and the inferred and taking action

285
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,694
on hidden states as a complement

286
00:14:05,822 --> 00:14:09,074
to we've got to get a certain

287
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:12,562
score on an Sat. I think it would be

288
00:14:12,696 --> 00:14:18,130
very interesting to see when that coming

289
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,246
together on the horizon. We know that

290
00:14:20,268 --> 00:14:23,686
the train tracks remain parallel, but as

291
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,966
we look at that, there's a name for

292
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:27,446
that. You probably know what it is, but

293
00:14:27,548 --> 00:14:29,286
when it reaches that horizon, it appears

294
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:31,686
they've come together. So I'm hoping

295
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:34,506
that that isn't sort of lost in some of

296
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:37,674
these other initiatives that

297
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:42,214
I know would actually be easier

298
00:14:42,262 --> 00:14:44,078
to do because there isn't such a history

299
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:47,054
and a whole bunch of people who are very

300
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:49,966
vested. In maintaining the status quo as

301
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:53,230
opposed to really journeying in ways

302
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,050
that are not discarding what we know,

303
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,914
taking the priors and allowing for some

304
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:01,426
new priorities. So just want to kind of

305
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:04,260
toss that in there. Awesome. Thank you.

306
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,730
We had just one math stream,

307
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,538
formerly with David Spivak

308
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:15,122
and Bleu, facilitating on category

309
00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:18,998
theory. This is a

310
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:21,946
few train stops away for some of us

311
00:15:21,968 --> 00:15:24,314
individually and for the field. But this

312
00:15:24,352 --> 00:15:26,390
year there have been some incredible

313
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,426
advances in active inference and

314
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:32,974
category theory. So the field is being

315
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:36,750
fertilized and prepared for

316
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,834
an incredible regenerative category

317
00:15:39,882 --> 00:15:42,106
theoretic implication of active

318
00:15:42,138 --> 00:15:44,754
inference. But that's all we'll say for

319
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:48,526
now. Here in the streams

320
00:15:48,638 --> 00:15:50,926
we focus on the intersection of active

321
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,114
inference and organizations. We had two

322
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:57,346
streams. First one was with Eugene

323
00:15:57,378 --> 00:15:59,810
Leventhal from the Smart Contract

324
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,690
Research Forum, and the second stream

325
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,910
was with Bijan Hezri, whose book

326
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,846
Governing Continuous Transformation is

327
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:09,338
also the focus of the bookstream, which

328
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:12,874
we'll get to in a second. And both

329
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:15,370
of these were awesome streams.

330
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,820
There are hidden states for both.

331
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,966
All only say what all say, which is

332
00:16:23,988 --> 00:16:25,194
that they both were incredibly

333
00:16:25,242 --> 00:16:28,586
informative, and the Triangulation

334
00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:31,840
active inference lab for both of them

335
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,430
was something that was incredibly

336
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,970
natural coming from,

337
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,954
as in Bijan's case, somebody with

338
00:16:39,992 --> 00:16:42,674
decades of executive experience who

339
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:45,074
completed his PhD dissertation on free

340
00:16:45,112 --> 00:16:48,690
energy governance and sees the framework

341
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,566
specifically as a vehicle for moving the

342
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:55,410
frontier of leadership in organizations.

343
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:00,838
Or Eugene, whose fluency

344
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:04,490
with internal and external organization

345
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,838
made it a natural and enjoyable

346
00:17:08,934 --> 00:17:12,030
conversation. And we connected a lot of

347
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,822
topics of interest in online and web

348
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:19,166
three organization. So it was a great

349
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:23,246
time. Yes. If you

350
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:24,926
want to do something interesting, watch

351
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:28,418
the orchestra with Bijan and then

352
00:17:28,504 --> 00:17:30,914
watch the live Stream series number 36

353
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:33,774
about modeling ourselves. And you'll

354
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:37,186
very quickly see that Bijan was close to

355
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,006
the end of the year. But many of the

356
00:17:40,028 --> 00:17:42,710
things that he spoke of, we were talking

357
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,098
about in detail with one of the papers

358
00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:49,126
that we took up basically a year ago.

359
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:51,206
That's the interesting that you don't

360
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:54,394
realize that until you're on a day like

361
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:56,860
today. Awesome.

362
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,934
We had one Twitter spaces. The title

363
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:03,118
was, can Web Three survive Without

364
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:06,330
Cognitive Modeling? It was a provocative

365
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,640
clickbait headline and we had

366
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,514
a chance on this discussion to talk

367
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,882
about the active block, for instance,

368
00:18:17,016 --> 00:18:20,274
project with Yakup here as one of the

369
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:22,786
primary developers and advocates and

370
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:25,826
stewards of that project. And we

371
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:29,110
discussed this question, which is can

372
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,534
web three or cyber physical systems more

373
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:36,418
broadly exist in an increasingly complex

374
00:18:36,514 --> 00:18:39,690
present and future without something

375
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,114
like cognitive modeling, for which we

376
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:44,842
believe active inference is the most

377
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:47,734
composable and flexible, generalizable

378
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:51,014
and powerful framework. So I forget

379
00:18:51,062 --> 00:18:53,118
whether it's never ask a question in the

380
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:55,646
headline if the answer is yes or no, I

381
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:58,366
always forget, so I never know. So I

382
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,030
always approached those headline based

383
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,334
questions with an open mind. But we

384
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:06,706
had a good time in this discussion and

385
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:10,082
these kinds of informal formats might

386
00:19:10,136 --> 00:19:12,846
have a lot of applicability. We didn't

387
00:19:12,878 --> 00:19:15,122
really need to prepare much. There also

388
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:17,846
weren't any slides. So for those who are

389
00:19:17,868 --> 00:19:21,366
interested in this genre of social

390
00:19:21,468 --> 00:19:24,466
audio or whatever it is called, there's

391
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:27,862
a lot of opportunities for frankly just

392
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,300
interacting with people where they are

393
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,906
talking about active inference and

394
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:36,582
making the compromise in the improvised

395
00:19:36,646 --> 00:19:39,980
moment. All right,

396
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,418
we had quite a handful of guest streams

397
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:48,266
from number 14 to number 31, so I'm

398
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:51,822
going to just briefly try to recall and

399
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:55,626
mention those who joined. Jorge Esteves

400
00:19:55,738 --> 00:19:57,854
discussed osteopathy and mental health

401
00:19:57,972 --> 00:20:02,178
in a 14, bobby Azarian in 15.1

402
00:20:02,264 --> 00:20:06,050
and .2 discussed Universal Bayesianism.

403
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,394
Mark Solmes joined for 16, discussing

404
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,830
consciousness as precision optimization,

405
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,466
which also was published by the Active

406
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:17,320
Inference Journal in one of the most

407
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,940
manually crafted and beautiful

408
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,126
publications. Mao Albarasan spoke

409
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,286
in guestroom 17 about epistemic

410
00:20:27,318 --> 00:20:29,062
communities under active inference,

411
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:31,174
which is an area of increasing

412
00:20:31,222 --> 00:20:34,246
importance. Iain Robertson, Michael

413
00:20:34,278 --> 00:20:36,826
Markov and Julian Kiverstein discussed

414
00:20:36,858 --> 00:20:39,214
the literalist fallacy and the free

415
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:42,574
energy principle, where that was only in

416
00:20:42,612 --> 00:20:46,240
March, it was on Pie Day, and we

417
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,074
reawakened the kraken of the

418
00:20:51,112 --> 00:20:53,934
realism instrumentalism dialectic,

419
00:20:53,982 --> 00:20:55,202
which I know that we're going to touch

420
00:20:55,256 --> 00:20:59,514
on today again. 19 Markov decision

421
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:01,830
discussed extended predictive minds

422
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,962
ActInf lab Gueststream 20 Shannon Proach

423
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:07,186
discussed coordination dynamics of multi

424
00:21:07,218 --> 00:21:10,210
agent interaction, and the screenshot on

425
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,018
the bottom left is showing a slide from

426
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:14,666
her presentation. I think it was an

427
00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:16,746
amazing presentation. It's very

428
00:21:16,848 --> 00:21:19,754
accessible and very cutting edge work on

429
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:22,846
multi agent active inference and also in

430
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:25,722
the very fun setting of music listening

431
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:28,750
and creation, so it was very engaging.

432
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,746
Adam SAFRON in guest room 21 discussed

433
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:36,266
free will. Anna Lemke in guest room

434
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:40,286
22 discussed Dopamine Nation, and that's

435
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:44,062
a fun one to view and share because Anna

436
00:21:44,126 --> 00:21:48,082
comes from a psychiatry background,

437
00:21:48,226 --> 00:21:50,646
not familiar with active inference too

438
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:54,002
much, but open hearted,

439
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,590
open minded and engaged with

440
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,202
real people and with research every day.

441
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:03,530
So we had a really affable conversation.

442
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,666
In guest room 23, Maxwell Ramstead and

443
00:22:08,688 --> 00:22:10,906
Dalton Activity Devil joined for

444
00:22:11,008 --> 00:22:12,818
rebooting the free Energy Principle

445
00:22:12,854 --> 00:22:16,480
literature, which was a paper

446
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,358
discussed that was not the title of a

447
00:22:19,364 --> 00:22:21,774
paper, but a paper was discussed that

448
00:22:21,812 --> 00:22:24,718
got folded into the pre play for

449
00:22:24,804 --> 00:22:26,834
Livestream. 49 so we'll talk more about

450
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:30,622
Bayesian physics then. Esteves Grossberg

451
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,506
joined for guestroom 24, explainable and

452
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:37,080
reliable AI and also a

453
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,614
commendation there to Ali, who did

454
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:43,378
incredible preparation and facilitation

455
00:22:43,474 --> 00:22:46,470
as well as editing the transcript here

456
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,578
and made this an incredibly high quality

457
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:53,130
experience for everybody. Guestroom 25

458
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,830
Brett Anderson discussed the continuum

459
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,782
of traits between autism and Schizotype.

460
00:22:59,926 --> 00:23:02,720
So that was kind of interesting work and

461
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,430
speaks to a lot of areas of meaning.

462
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,406
In guest room 26, along with my

463
00:23:11,428 --> 00:23:14,350
colleagues at Common Sense Makers, Data

464
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,842
ShahF, Lauren Hebert, Ozan Tamari and

465
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,446
William Fisher, we discussed from users

466
00:23:20,478 --> 00:23:23,998
to Sense Makers and about Stigmurgy,

467
00:23:24,094 --> 00:23:25,934
which is cognitive behavioral algorithms

468
00:23:25,982 --> 00:23:28,418
that modify the environment in the

469
00:23:28,424 --> 00:23:31,646
context of sense making. ActInf Lab

470
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:34,698
Gueststream 27 was with John Verveake,

471
00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:38,274
and we had a great time. We had a stool

472
00:23:38,402 --> 00:23:41,542
with three legs, predictive processing,

473
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,926
relevance, realization, active

474
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:46,166
inference, and Dean and I were preparing

475
00:23:46,198 --> 00:23:49,306
those slides. We had the stool going and

476
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:51,398
then we flipped a stool and it was

477
00:23:51,424 --> 00:23:54,414
upside down and then that was just one

478
00:23:54,452 --> 00:23:57,070
of many inversions and transformations.

479
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,970
And John has a very delightful

480
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,894
and mindful way of approaching dialogue,

481
00:24:03,962 --> 00:24:05,970
as those who are familiar with his work

482
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,940
know, and so we had a great time

483
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,246
in 28, Giovanni Rolla discussed

484
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:16,394
reconceiving, rationality and active

485
00:24:16,462 --> 00:24:20,834
cognition. Guest room 29 Shauna Dobson

486
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:23,714
on making up our minds. Imaginative

487
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,582
deconstruction in math art. For those

488
00:24:26,636 --> 00:24:29,338
who are looking for the triple play of

489
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:32,410
math, art and philosophy,

490
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,946
there is only one unicorn in this

491
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:36,730
forest.

492
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,206
Guest room 30 with Kiritanatrades was on

493
00:24:42,228 --> 00:24:44,042
the human governance Problem complex

494
00:24:44,106 --> 00:24:45,342
Systems and the Limits of Human

495
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:49,850
Cognition. This was a very fascinating

496
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,674
presentation of an artificial

497
00:24:51,722 --> 00:24:55,150
intelligence system that was churning

498
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,906
in the background while we had a

499
00:24:57,928 --> 00:25:01,246
discussion. And so it was quite visually

500
00:25:01,358 --> 00:25:04,180
and conceptually interesting.

501
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,834
And then most recently, in guest room

502
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:10,978
31, Brett Kagan and Adeel Razi discussed

503
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:12,994
biological and synthetic intelligence

504
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:14,562
from the free energy principle

505
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:17,202
perspective and some of their empirical

506
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:20,806
work with neurons in a dish playing

507
00:25:20,838 --> 00:25:22,746
video games, and the way that they were

508
00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:25,900
modeling that with active inference. So

509
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:30,122
we had a great set

510
00:25:30,176 --> 00:25:34,014
of guest streams, and we look forward to

511
00:25:34,212 --> 00:25:38,378
a diverse and comprehensive

512
00:25:38,474 --> 00:25:41,726
set for 2023. So if you want to join for

513
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,118
a guest stream, or if you want to

514
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,554
recommend or introduce somebody, this is

515
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:48,702
very low bar. It can be a presentation

516
00:25:48,766 --> 00:25:51,186
they've given somewhere else. Some of

517
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:54,530
these presenters requested us to do

518
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,338
background, which we're happy to do,

519
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:59,318
prepare questions, others just show up.

520
00:25:59,484 --> 00:26:01,686
So if you think there's somebody who

521
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:03,554
could fit in well in a guest stream,

522
00:26:03,602 --> 00:26:06,566
even if they're not in the center of the

523
00:26:06,588 --> 00:26:08,354
active inference research developments

524
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:10,714
ongoing, we can absolutely make it

525
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:13,098
happen. Dean, what would you add on the

526
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,330
guest streams angle?

527
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,794
If I could invite five

528
00:26:20,832 --> 00:26:23,002
people out myself at the same table,

529
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:26,014
and I could get Dalton and I could get

530
00:26:26,212 --> 00:26:29,502
Shauna, yourself and John

531
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:32,862
Verbaki and me just sitting around and

532
00:26:32,996 --> 00:26:37,166
just talking about stuff, I think I

533
00:26:37,268 --> 00:26:39,826
probably would be about as good as it

534
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,618
gets. I think that would be just one of

535
00:26:41,624 --> 00:26:44,834
the most amazing dialogues, and you

536
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:46,594
wouldn't know where it was going to go.

537
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:48,466
And that would be half the excitement,

538
00:26:48,498 --> 00:26:53,766
is just people who

539
00:26:53,788 --> 00:26:56,214
can basically have a conversation with

540
00:26:56,252 --> 00:27:00,070
anybody about topics that are incredibly

541
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,226
sophisticated and yet seem to be able to

542
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:05,434
bring it to a level where, as you said,

543
00:27:05,472 --> 00:27:06,570
it's engaging,

544
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,874
it's amazing. And this is not to

545
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:13,022
downplay all the other guests that were

546
00:27:13,076 --> 00:27:16,400
kind enough to join, but again,

547
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:21,310
if I were to do something on a social

548
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,930
level, on an informal level, all of

549
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,900
these people, thank you to all of them.

550
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,358
Great. All right. In the model streams,

551
00:27:31,534 --> 00:27:36,170
we like to highlight modeling,

552
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:40,374
and we had three absolutely

553
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,934
cutting edge presentations with

554
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:46,754
interactive components. Model Stream

555
00:27:46,802 --> 00:27:49,306
Five with Pietro Masaglia and Tim

556
00:27:49,328 --> 00:27:51,994
Verbelen. We discussed contrast of

557
00:27:52,032 --> 00:27:54,602
active inference, which uses some

558
00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:57,542
current threads in non active inference

559
00:27:57,606 --> 00:27:59,306
machine learning like contrast of

560
00:27:59,328 --> 00:28:01,066
learning, and brought it into the

561
00:28:01,088 --> 00:28:03,534
context of active inference to

562
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:05,594
facilitate learning in noisy

563
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,894
environments. In Model stream Six,

564
00:28:09,092 --> 00:28:12,222
Teofil Champion joined to discuss

565
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:16,158
his quite prolific and creative avenue

566
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:18,686
of research into branching time. Active

567
00:28:18,718 --> 00:28:21,330
inference. And Yakup and Ali are here

568
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,366
also did a lot of background to prepare

569
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,374
and as we entertain larger and

570
00:28:28,412 --> 00:28:31,734
larger state spaces and deeper and

571
00:28:31,772 --> 00:28:34,726
deeper possible futures with more and

572
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:36,470
more and more affordances and

573
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,726
affordances on preferences and

574
00:28:38,828 --> 00:28:40,874
affordance on affordances on

575
00:28:40,912 --> 00:28:44,458
preferences, these state spaces become

576
00:28:44,544 --> 00:28:47,338
vast. And things that you can write down

577
00:28:47,424 --> 00:28:50,314
on the back of an envelope might take

578
00:28:50,352 --> 00:28:52,490
all the heat in the world with current

579
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,838
computers to run. Just like you could

580
00:28:54,864 --> 00:28:56,446
write down two large numbers and

581
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,046
multiply them, but you could look at

582
00:28:58,068 --> 00:28:59,390
each number and it's just a number.

583
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,640
Well, you can draw a Bayes graph, and

584
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,914
yet to run that Bayes graph might be not

585
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:10,142
plausible. So there's a lot of relevance

586
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,402
in this area of research of finding out

587
00:29:12,456 --> 00:29:14,302
these computational acceleration

588
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:17,990
methods. And Heuristics, as well as

589
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,014
even just qualitatively this idea of

590
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:23,874
branching time, branching and pruning

591
00:29:23,922 --> 00:29:27,894
time, and what kinds of strategies are

592
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,058
used to branch and prune time

593
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:33,434
adaptively. It's very exciting. And then

594
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:36,826
in Model stream Seven, Conor Heins and

595
00:29:36,848 --> 00:29:40,470
Daphne Demekas joined to discuss Pymdp,

596
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:43,626
which is rapidly becoming the Python

597
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:46,394
active inference implementation approach

598
00:29:46,442 --> 00:29:49,774
of choice in the community. And it was

599
00:29:49,812 --> 00:29:52,570
great because we were able to ask basic

600
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,606
questions, we were able to hear about

601
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:57,518
the intentions of the package. And we're

602
00:29:57,534 --> 00:29:59,554
going to have a dot two in just a couple

603
00:29:59,592 --> 00:30:04,418
of weeks. This is something in

604
00:30:04,424 --> 00:30:05,778
terms of the package. It's something

605
00:30:05,864 --> 00:30:08,614
where more and more of our work in the

606
00:30:08,652 --> 00:30:11,378
Institute is going to use this package.

607
00:30:11,554 --> 00:30:14,614
And the interoperability of different

608
00:30:14,652 --> 00:30:16,598
generative, models and processes and

609
00:30:16,604 --> 00:30:19,338
simulations written in Pi MDP is going

610
00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:22,774
to facilitate the accessibility, rigor

611
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,614
and applicability of active inference.

612
00:30:24,662 --> 00:30:27,882
So great work to all those who are

613
00:30:27,936 --> 00:30:30,874
contributors on this package and

614
00:30:30,992 --> 00:30:33,114
everybody who is out there applying

615
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:36,206
active inference computationally and

616
00:30:36,388 --> 00:30:38,080
shared it with us this way.

617
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,550
All right. And the last non paper

618
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,186
Livestream is the bookstream. So the

619
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:48,878
bookstream is being led by Bleu

620
00:30:49,054 --> 00:30:52,770
and Tyler Solberg. And when

621
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,698
they got a hand on Bijan Kezri's

622
00:30:56,734 --> 00:30:58,770
book governing Continuous Transformation

623
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,594
reframing the Strategy Governance

624
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:04,726
conversation, they jumped on it and

625
00:31:04,748 --> 00:31:06,678
they said, how can we do some kind of a

626
00:31:06,684 --> 00:31:09,226
regular series? How can we increase our

627
00:31:09,248 --> 00:31:11,386
accountability in reading and

628
00:31:11,408 --> 00:31:14,474
understanding this book and also make

629
00:31:14,512 --> 00:31:17,386
something for the community? And they

630
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:20,506
said, we want to do a weekly ish book

631
00:31:20,528 --> 00:31:22,974
stream. So we've done that for the past

632
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:25,214
several weeks, and there will be many

633
00:31:25,252 --> 00:31:26,746
more sessions to come, including

634
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:31,182
discussions with the author. So great

635
00:31:31,316 --> 00:31:35,262
initiative, and it's

636
00:31:35,406 --> 00:31:39,650
keeping the stove warm

637
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,462
on these topics of organizational

638
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:45,730
development, which are just absolutely

639
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,850
evergreen.

640
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,534
All right, on to the Paper

641
00:31:52,652 --> 00:31:55,494
Livestreams, which we don't play

642
00:31:55,532 --> 00:31:57,910
favorites, but we love the paper

643
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,514
livestreams. Go ahead,

644
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:05,514
Dean, start us with 35. Where were we

645
00:32:05,712 --> 00:32:09,542
in January 22 when we were reading

646
00:32:09,606 --> 00:32:12,158
A Tale of Two Architectures free energy,

647
00:32:12,244 --> 00:32:15,466
its models and modularity by Sajid Beni?

648
00:32:15,658 --> 00:32:18,560
I wish I could say that I looked a lot

649
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:22,366
younger back then, but I looked old back

650
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:26,034
then, too. I think a year ago

651
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,586
we were pretty excited because I

652
00:32:29,608 --> 00:32:34,210
think it felt as though things

653
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,730
could go in a number of exafferent

654
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,694
directions and that we as a community

655
00:32:38,812 --> 00:32:42,278
that were discussing a lot of the most

656
00:32:42,364 --> 00:32:45,734
cutting edge on the sort of bow wave of

657
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:48,120
information that was coming out of

658
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,618
people's research. It kind

659
00:32:52,624 --> 00:32:53,962
of felt like we weren't just

660
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:58,026
aggregating, we were actually kind

661
00:32:58,048 --> 00:32:59,802
of one step removed. We weren't getting

662
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:02,426
too locked into any one particular facet

663
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:05,440
of this multifaceted idea.

664
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:11,806
And it

665
00:33:11,828 --> 00:33:13,840
could really blossom into something like

666
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,286
what we thought was this kind of magic

667
00:33:16,318 --> 00:33:19,874
acorn or unicorn or whatever. And how it

668
00:33:19,912 --> 00:33:23,730
would be viewed 360

669
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,082
some days later, we didn't really know.

670
00:33:26,136 --> 00:33:29,054
But we also weren't afraid to kind of

671
00:33:29,192 --> 00:33:32,022
test the limits. That's what I felt 22

672
00:33:32,156 --> 00:33:34,566
was more than anything else. It was an

673
00:33:34,588 --> 00:33:37,462
opportunity to test things. And that

674
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,574
didn't mean that we were out to prove

675
00:33:39,622 --> 00:33:42,746
people wrong. We just wanted there

676
00:33:42,768 --> 00:33:44,746
was now enough information, a large

677
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:48,234
enough sample size, that we could do

678
00:33:48,272 --> 00:33:51,306
some cross checking. And that sort of

679
00:33:51,328 --> 00:33:53,498
allowed the people that were doing the

680
00:33:53,504 --> 00:33:55,166
cross checking, the ones that were

681
00:33:55,188 --> 00:33:58,846
reading this long list of papers, a

682
00:33:58,868 --> 00:34:00,830
chance to kind of go, huh. Okay, well,

683
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,278
I think I've seen that over here, but

684
00:34:03,364 --> 00:34:05,502
there seemed to be some hesitation

685
00:34:05,566 --> 00:34:08,594
around how far that rule holds under

686
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:11,326
this set of circumstances in Yada yada.

687
00:34:11,438 --> 00:34:15,298
So 350 started out

688
00:34:15,384 --> 00:34:17,506
I've just put my notes here as a formal

689
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:19,286
treatment of what graphical modeling can

690
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:22,598
look like. I e. Our DAGs are

691
00:34:22,684 --> 00:34:25,798
cycle list while DCM are cycle based.

692
00:34:25,884 --> 00:34:28,914
And for me, the introduction of a term

693
00:34:28,962 --> 00:34:31,170
joint probability. Up to that point, I

694
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:34,794
had never heard of that expression. And

695
00:34:34,912 --> 00:34:37,738
we ended up using joint probability in a

696
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:39,514
lot of the papers that followed. So

697
00:34:39,552 --> 00:34:41,982
there was a bit of you could start

698
00:34:42,116 --> 00:34:45,550
weaving golden threads between things.

699
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,006
Majid, who eventually joined us for

700
00:34:49,028 --> 00:34:52,382
this, nothing but props for that guy,

701
00:34:52,436 --> 00:34:54,814
for again pulling in what are seemingly

702
00:34:54,862 --> 00:34:58,450
really distal concepts and making

703
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,602
us realize, oh well, if you do do that,

704
00:35:01,736 --> 00:35:03,940
you gain insight pretty quickly.

705
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:10,358
Then we went on to 35 one which was

706
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:12,562
which do we start with representation

707
00:35:12,626 --> 00:35:16,520
and or effect? Both in order to model?

708
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,614
So recognizing the importance of partial

709
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:23,194
information encapsulation that

710
00:35:23,232 --> 00:35:24,794
everything doesn't have to be absolute,

711
00:35:24,912 --> 00:35:27,286
especially over different time frames,

712
00:35:27,478 --> 00:35:29,450
not brain architectures, although that

713
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,734
term was in the title of his paper. But

714
00:35:32,772 --> 00:35:35,150
the role of the architect, someone who

715
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,446
is an applied structure, if there

716
00:35:38,468 --> 00:35:40,526
is such a thing, and the sort of

717
00:35:40,548 --> 00:35:42,240
arbitrary nature of that,

718
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:46,434
how does it remain arbitrary? Well, by

719
00:35:46,472 --> 00:35:49,106
not being absolute. A real clear way of

720
00:35:49,128 --> 00:35:50,498
understanding the difference between

721
00:35:50,584 --> 00:35:53,086
function and effective connectivity.

722
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:55,810
That took up a lot of our conversation,

723
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,394
proximal consistency through time and

724
00:35:59,432 --> 00:36:02,690
introduced the term perspective swaps.

725
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,966
I didn't realize that I'd introduce that

726
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:08,022
into the conversation then. But yes,

727
00:36:08,076 --> 00:36:10,706
that's where it all was seated was back

728
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:13,834
in January, almost a year ago. Then 35

729
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,686
two. What are we trying to trace?

730
00:36:15,878 --> 00:36:17,946
Separation and or boundedness? The

731
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,166
answer to that, as Magee clearly

732
00:36:20,198 --> 00:36:22,460
concluded, depends on what's available.

733
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,326
So availability not just our regime of

734
00:36:25,348 --> 00:36:27,790
attention. So I thought that was an

735
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,590
incredible thing to bring up a year ago.

736
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:34,686
Do we keep that? What? That we are the

737
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,126
tracers and the modelers and the

738
00:36:36,148 --> 00:36:38,514
separators and the boundary in the front

739
00:36:38,552 --> 00:36:41,342
of our minds as we analyze situations?

740
00:36:41,406 --> 00:36:44,260
If learning is the sought after effect,

741
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:49,110
when does that help? Does this lead to

742
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,102
a year of holding up when we are looking

743
00:36:52,156 --> 00:36:54,306
at a target system, say active inference

744
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:56,802
is subject and when we as observers

745
00:36:56,866 --> 00:36:58,406
might be using active inference in

746
00:36:58,428 --> 00:37:01,938
formal ways, ie. For allowing errors to

747
00:37:01,964 --> 00:37:04,118
not get in the way of new insights.

748
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:06,906
Assuming insights are a priority for

749
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:09,850
agents and I was interested in thinking

750
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,478
I wonder how they would be able to get

751
00:37:11,504 --> 00:37:13,710
that into JF's robots,

752
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:17,486
right? So that's an interesting thing to

753
00:37:17,508 --> 00:37:19,646
me. This is the divide between being a

754
00:37:19,668 --> 00:37:22,954
programmer of a robot where the priority

755
00:37:23,082 --> 00:37:24,750
is learned,

756
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:29,534
versus dictating how priors are amassed

757
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:32,114
and organized and then inhabiting a

758
00:37:32,152 --> 00:37:34,340
programming or participatory experience,

759
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,330
one where deconstruction is adaptability

760
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:41,174
until ultimately something called

761
00:37:41,212 --> 00:37:43,670
complexity dominates the conversation.

762
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,878
In both of those situations, priors and

763
00:37:45,884 --> 00:37:48,486
priorities work in concert, but in the

764
00:37:48,508 --> 00:37:51,286
latter the humanist case are on opposite

765
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:54,234
sides of a Markov blanket. So at least

766
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,102
partially hidden but also partially

767
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:58,806
encapsulated. We talked a lot about duck

768
00:37:58,838 --> 00:38:01,478
rabbits that are not riding two

769
00:38:01,504 --> 00:38:03,358
unicycles concurrently, whereas the

770
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,414
robot might. That's an interesting

771
00:38:06,532 --> 00:38:08,938
difference there. And for humans,

772
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,966
riding two unicycles is equal and

773
00:38:12,068 --> 00:38:14,518
complete partitioning or encapsulation.

774
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:17,762
So that's why it's hard to do. Takes

775
00:38:17,816 --> 00:38:20,114
much training to be able to carry that

776
00:38:20,152 --> 00:38:23,940
out. So that's the was Sajid and

777
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,410
bringing the science and the modeling

778
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:31,686
and the abductive. And that

779
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:33,206
was our conversation, even though his

780
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:35,206
paper was in response to a couple of

781
00:38:35,228 --> 00:38:38,406
other authors arguing that

782
00:38:38,428 --> 00:38:40,860
there's only one way really to model.

783
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:44,602
And so again, lots of things grew out of

784
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,994
a paper that was meant as a response and

785
00:38:48,032 --> 00:38:50,730
created a whole different ecosystem.

786
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,800
Awesome. Wow. I'll just give a short

787
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:58,874
thought. Graphical models and network

788
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:00,414
theory are at the heart, active

789
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:02,382
inference lab as well as many other

790
00:39:02,436 --> 00:39:04,298
Fields. And what it means to have a

791
00:39:04,324 --> 00:39:07,298
network or a hierarchical model is to

792
00:39:07,384 --> 00:39:10,402
represent a system or a model in terms

793
00:39:10,456 --> 00:39:13,186
of nodes and edges. And exactly what

794
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:16,290
those nodes and edges are matters a lot.

795
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,802
And in this diagram we had the parable

796
00:39:18,866 --> 00:39:21,666
of Bob and Alice who brushed their teeth

797
00:39:21,698 --> 00:39:24,566
at a similar time because people in that

798
00:39:24,588 --> 00:39:27,574
region just happened to do so. And we

799
00:39:27,612 --> 00:39:30,550
discussed how the statistical

800
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:34,026
connections between their activities in

801
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:35,734
terms of the functional and effective

802
00:39:35,782 --> 00:39:39,114
connectivity are not the same as what

803
00:39:39,152 --> 00:39:42,462
is touching what in the real world. And

804
00:39:42,516 --> 00:39:47,050
this very straightforward deflationary

805
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,886
approach to separating the map from the

806
00:39:49,908 --> 00:39:53,534
territory came back again and

807
00:39:53,572 --> 00:39:55,586
again and gain it. Was like we were on

808
00:39:55,608 --> 00:39:57,774
the carousel of functional and effective

809
00:39:57,822 --> 00:40:00,466
connectivity and the map territory and

810
00:40:00,488 --> 00:40:03,074
the math is not the territory. All of

811
00:40:03,112 --> 00:40:07,974
those topics are so central because

812
00:40:08,092 --> 00:40:09,794
when we're looking at those generative

813
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:12,690
models, we're looking at a graphical

814
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:16,486
map, not a picture of the

815
00:40:16,508 --> 00:40:19,866
territory. And it's easy, even when you

816
00:40:19,888 --> 00:40:21,770
know, to forget.

817
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,978
And again, I often wonder how because

818
00:40:28,064 --> 00:40:30,714
Daniel reminds me, no, people vote which

819
00:40:30,752 --> 00:40:32,622
papers we're going to do. And sometimes

820
00:40:32,676 --> 00:40:35,646
it's just availability of authors. But

821
00:40:35,828 --> 00:40:39,214
the next paper, which was 36, could not

822
00:40:39,252 --> 00:40:46,990
have been a better coordinate

823
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:51,774
with Majid's work. It was like the

824
00:40:51,812 --> 00:40:55,390
perfect follow up. Matt and Giovanni's

825
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:58,790
work on modeling ourselves.

826
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,800
Yes. Give an overview. Go for it.

827
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,030
36 was the importance of working

828
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,706
backwards. The way that you and Bleu

829
00:41:08,738 --> 00:41:11,526
set up the entire paper was, well,

830
00:41:11,548 --> 00:41:14,246
we're going to go to the end and we're

831
00:41:14,278 --> 00:41:15,834
going to work our way back through this

832
00:41:15,872 --> 00:41:17,914
paper just so that it makes sense.

833
00:41:17,952 --> 00:41:21,066
Because I think there was a bit

834
00:41:21,088 --> 00:41:24,734
of a woo woo kind of sense from

835
00:41:24,772 --> 00:41:26,606
reading the paper because it was very

836
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:29,294
deeply philosophical. Also.

837
00:41:29,412 --> 00:41:31,182
Introduction the claim that in order for

838
00:41:31,316 --> 00:41:33,306
internal representations to be wiped

839
00:41:33,338 --> 00:41:36,142
out, we need to marginalize the unit,

840
00:41:36,206 --> 00:41:39,474
call an action really radical, as if

841
00:41:39,512 --> 00:41:41,186
adding an exclamation point to your

842
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:43,474
claim somehow changes the relationship

843
00:41:43,592 --> 00:41:46,226
of an action which is a part to the

844
00:41:46,248 --> 00:41:49,766
entirety, which is a whole. So when

845
00:41:49,788 --> 00:41:51,458
you guys first picked up Parr and you're

846
00:41:51,474 --> 00:41:55,286
doing the dot zero already, there was

847
00:41:55,308 --> 00:41:57,494
like, okay, I wonder what we're getting

848
00:41:57,532 --> 00:42:00,154
into here. You also asked indirectly how

849
00:42:00,192 --> 00:42:03,194
artists indirectly how artists, people

850
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:05,210
with good entorhinal who are good

851
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,278
external external representationalists

852
00:42:08,454 --> 00:42:10,826
maybe have a different gapping or a way

853
00:42:10,848 --> 00:42:13,134
of entangling or both the

854
00:42:13,172 --> 00:42:15,038
organizational, structural and content

855
00:42:15,124 --> 00:42:18,270
related and functional aspects as either

856
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,442
representative or non representative

857
00:42:20,586 --> 00:42:23,754
within parameters. You had a nice table

858
00:42:23,802 --> 00:42:26,318
there set up which, boy, you got a lot

859
00:42:26,324 --> 00:42:28,686
of shelf life out of it. It was useful

860
00:42:28,718 --> 00:42:31,186
for all three livestreams. What I found

861
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:33,186
most interesting was that to be an

862
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:36,382
activist meant to you the use of simple

863
00:42:36,456 --> 00:42:39,046
heuristics means control mechanisms do

864
00:42:39,068 --> 00:42:41,654
not need to get to the level of

865
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:45,862
sophistication more than what

866
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:48,582
short, catch and long. You had a great

867
00:42:48,636 --> 00:42:51,318
diagram of the baseball Karl hitting it

868
00:42:51,324 --> 00:42:55,302
out of the park. Categorizing the FEP

869
00:42:55,366 --> 00:42:57,318
equals you can be all over the map.

870
00:42:57,414 --> 00:43:00,006
Does that mean we can engineer a bridge

871
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:01,626
to everywhere? Which was one of the

872
00:43:01,648 --> 00:43:03,742
questions I'd written down, actually,

873
00:43:03,796 --> 00:43:05,834
after watching you and Bleu do the dot

874
00:43:05,882 --> 00:43:08,670
zero, then in the dot one, how does

875
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:12,026
transition go from materialized to non

876
00:43:12,058 --> 00:43:16,114
materialized and then back? And that

877
00:43:16,152 --> 00:43:17,854
brought us to the idea of what's stable

878
00:43:17,902 --> 00:43:21,300
and what's dynamic juggled as a process

879
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,186
of predictivity in order for

880
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:27,334
representation and non representation to

881
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:30,486
coexist. This was the great thing they

882
00:43:30,508 --> 00:43:32,994
are bedfellows. Dean and Bleu debated

883
00:43:33,042 --> 00:43:35,154
the scale freeness and the scale

884
00:43:35,202 --> 00:43:37,702
friendliness of science. I. E.

885
00:43:37,756 --> 00:43:40,506
Observations, recordings, analysis and

886
00:43:40,528 --> 00:43:43,226
prediction. So modeling ourselves in

887
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:45,654
real time with Daniel substituting

888
00:43:45,702 --> 00:43:48,490
disciplinary for generalization as

889
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,794
modeler strategy, the question was

890
00:43:50,832 --> 00:43:53,982
raised around what must exist pre plan,

891
00:43:54,116 --> 00:43:57,246
pre model. And then I don't know the

892
00:43:57,268 --> 00:43:59,006
lady's name who joined us for the

893
00:43:59,108 --> 00:44:01,230
Danielle Daniel,

894
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,218
we got into some really interesting

895
00:44:05,304 --> 00:44:07,790
loops with your table.

896
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,666
Again, we were looking at

897
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,378
organizational, structural and content

898
00:44:11,464 --> 00:44:15,602
related as probably more stable things

899
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:18,114
that we want to anchor with those edges

900
00:44:18,162 --> 00:44:21,366
and nodes represented and not kind of

901
00:44:21,468 --> 00:44:24,040
moving around all over the place or

902
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,602
without edges. You can have a gap.

903
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:30,266
Like, there was a point that came up was

904
00:44:30,288 --> 00:44:34,060
the black lines separating the rows and

905
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:38,422
the columns, were they solid

906
00:44:38,486 --> 00:44:41,886
or were they actual gaps? So that was

907
00:44:41,908 --> 00:44:45,326
kind of interesting. And then there was

908
00:44:45,348 --> 00:44:47,694
a functional as radical dynamic and

909
00:44:47,732 --> 00:44:50,846
dependent on those stabilities. Now is

910
00:44:50,868 --> 00:44:53,054
modeling ourselves how, when, where,

911
00:44:53,252 --> 00:44:55,954
what if and which? If we act, how does

912
00:44:55,992 --> 00:44:57,826
that impact the model that we believe

913
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:01,330
exists as we boundary cross, which

914
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,810
again, if you take it to the stuff that

915
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,806
Bijan is talking about on an

916
00:45:06,828 --> 00:45:10,530
organizational level, that's

917
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:13,906
combinatorially exclusive. So it's

918
00:45:13,938 --> 00:45:16,390
interesting that how we model ourselves

919
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:19,026
has a huge impact on how do we model

920
00:45:19,068 --> 00:45:21,466
ourselves as an organization, as a

921
00:45:21,488 --> 00:45:24,102
weave, that which we'd like to remain

922
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:25,834
constant with, that which we'd like to

923
00:45:25,872 --> 00:45:29,878
see changed. So that was modeling

924
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:33,546
ourselves. And again, Matt and Giovanni

925
00:45:33,578 --> 00:45:35,662
didn't show up, but man, would have been

926
00:45:35,716 --> 00:45:38,670
awesome to have them there and kind of

927
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,694
lead that circus because it was great.

928
00:45:41,732 --> 00:45:45,074
It was great debate between Bleu and I

929
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:48,340
because she really wants science to be

930
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:51,858
seen as it, and I really like science to

931
00:45:51,864 --> 00:45:55,138
be seen as specific. And you are the

932
00:45:55,144 --> 00:45:57,526
great moderator and said, no, it's both.

933
00:45:57,708 --> 00:46:01,320
So I was 36 bottling ourselves. Wow.

934
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:06,370
Yeah, I totally forgot about Karl

935
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,186
hitting. It out of the park. About Karl

936
00:46:09,218 --> 00:46:09,910
Bonds.

937
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,618
Fantastic. Hitting the particle out of

938
00:46:16,624 --> 00:46:18,634
the Parr and about where is

939
00:46:18,672 --> 00:46:20,982
representation? Oh, representation.

940
00:46:21,046 --> 00:46:24,302
Where art thy sting? It was too

941
00:46:24,356 --> 00:46:26,766
fun. It was too fun. And also, just so

942
00:46:26,788 --> 00:46:30,960
people know, the live stream page

943
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:36,702
has the slides. For every

944
00:46:36,756 --> 00:46:38,046
single live stream that we're

945
00:46:38,078 --> 00:46:38,930
discussing,

946
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,726
you can find the live stream, the title,

947
00:46:45,758 --> 00:46:49,058
the paper, the transcript, the GitHub,

948
00:46:49,154 --> 00:46:51,670
where you can contribute to the journal

949
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:55,298
as well as the slides. So when we're

950
00:46:55,314 --> 00:46:58,086
pulling slides, you can also look at

951
00:46:58,108 --> 00:47:00,620
them. So, yeah, this was 36 was awesome.

952
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,994
All right, 37. 37.

Free Energy a user's guide by Stephen

954

Francis Mann, Ross Payne and Michael

Kirchhoff from 2021.

956
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,600
You want to take a first pass?

957
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:18,126
Well, I just remember

958
00:47:18,228 --> 00:47:21,626
that as much as I'd

959
00:47:21,658 --> 00:47:24,706
like to be able to say I could do the

960
00:47:24,728 --> 00:47:28,146
math if somebody else does the

961
00:47:28,168 --> 00:47:30,514
math and I can follow along at my own

962
00:47:30,552 --> 00:47:35,998
pace, this is where I learned Jacob's

963
00:47:36,014 --> 00:47:37,620
gift. Basically,

964
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,646
that's what my first pass is. I know

965
00:47:42,748 --> 00:47:44,726
when I'm in the presence of people who

966
00:47:44,748 --> 00:47:47,426
could go a lot further on that plane

967
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:48,360
than I can.

968
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:55,374
The paper is an excellent users

969
00:47:55,442 --> 00:47:59,142
guide or introduction. One memorable

970
00:47:59,206 --> 00:48:02,678
section was on this trilemma

971
00:48:02,694 --> 00:48:06,126
or trilectic of general or

972
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:09,018
philosophical claims, mathematical

973
00:48:09,114 --> 00:48:12,126
claims and empirical claims. And they

974
00:48:12,148 --> 00:48:15,620
went through edge by edge and they asked

975
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:19,602
how do claims from each of those three

976
00:48:19,656 --> 00:48:23,038
vertices justify

977
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:26,738
each other? And so we hear that

978
00:48:26,824 --> 00:48:28,646
all the time people speaking about

979
00:48:28,668 --> 00:48:31,334
active inference in other areas. Well,

980
00:48:31,372 --> 00:48:33,414
because the brain is this way, we use

981
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,386
this equation or we use this equation

982
00:48:36,498 --> 00:48:39,370
because the brain is this way or because

983
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,914
of this philosophical belief, we use

984
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:45,446
this equation. It's like seeing it laid

985
00:48:45,478 --> 00:48:48,890
out that way brings a huge

986
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,398
amount of rigor. And it also helps us

987
00:48:51,424 --> 00:48:53,326
understand that rigor is not just

988
00:48:53,428 --> 00:48:55,994
increasingly technical math. Rigor

989
00:48:56,042 --> 00:48:59,706
includes the relationships among

990
00:48:59,898 --> 00:49:02,126
mathematical, philosophical and

991
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:04,118
empirical claims from different Fields.

992
00:49:04,154 --> 00:49:06,786
So that was one key takeaway for me and

993
00:49:06,808 --> 00:49:10,242
another was the

994
00:49:10,296 --> 00:49:13,540
three piece, the tale of three piece.

995
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:18,566
And it was a focus of the paper to

996
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:22,086
point to the unconventional way in

997
00:49:22,108 --> 00:49:24,806
which preferences are utilized. Active

998
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:28,258
inference Lab which is not as a reward

999
00:49:28,354 --> 00:49:32,426
or a goal function but rather something

1000
00:49:32,528 --> 00:49:34,614
that is kind of the fundamental

1001
00:49:34,662 --> 00:49:37,866
frequency of the generative model. And

1002
00:49:37,888 --> 00:49:41,498
so you have entities striving to return

1003
00:49:41,584 --> 00:49:44,310
to the bottom of the bowl in terms of

1004
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,862
the path of least action, in terms of

1005
00:49:46,916 --> 00:49:49,246
the frequency that they want to be at

1006
00:49:49,348 --> 00:49:51,342
and that is the embodiment of

1007
00:49:51,396 --> 00:49:54,114
preference. And as we came to see later,

1008
00:49:54,152 --> 00:49:57,154
homeostasis and allostasis but there

1009
00:49:57,192 --> 00:50:01,026
isn't some sort of dual track between

1010
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:03,540
what is and what should be.

1011
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:07,202
Rather there's a bowl that represents

1012
00:50:07,346 --> 00:50:10,742
what could be and is and should

1013
00:50:10,796 --> 00:50:14,454
be through its shape and it's about the

1014
00:50:14,492 --> 00:50:17,510
ball moving on that shape by which

1015
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:21,146
preferences come to be enacted. So that

1016
00:50:21,168 --> 00:50:23,754
was something that was pointed to and

1017
00:50:23,872 --> 00:50:26,474
very approachable and they talked a lot

1018
00:50:26,512 --> 00:50:29,914
about how they situated the audience of

1019
00:50:30,112 --> 00:50:33,322
the work in terms of wanting to speak to

1020
00:50:33,456 --> 00:50:35,278
philosophers who really did want to

1021
00:50:35,284 --> 00:50:37,482
learn about what free energy principle

1022
00:50:37,546 --> 00:50:40,222
is about. One of the things that I got

1023
00:50:40,276 --> 00:50:42,078
kind of reinforced in my mind is because

1024
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:45,074
I kind of believe that priors are on one

1025
00:50:45,112 --> 00:50:47,582
side of a Markov blanket and priorities

1026
00:50:47,646 --> 00:50:50,434
are on another. What that tail of three

1027
00:50:50,472 --> 00:50:54,098
P s kind of in my head gave me a

1028
00:50:54,104 --> 00:50:56,594
little bit of latitude on was.

1029
00:50:56,632 --> 00:50:58,358
Preferences can be on either side of the

1030
00:50:58,364 --> 00:51:00,066
blanket. They can literally cross

1031
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,886
through. Preferences can pair up with

1032
00:51:02,908 --> 00:51:04,934
your priors. You can figure out what

1033
00:51:04,972 --> 00:51:07,302
those things are that have been sort of

1034
00:51:07,436 --> 00:51:12,182
burned into your neuro desire

1035
00:51:12,246 --> 00:51:15,114
lines and they can also preferences can

1036
00:51:15,152 --> 00:51:17,178
also be working with your your

1037
00:51:17,264 --> 00:51:19,258
priorities in this moment right as you

1038
00:51:19,264 --> 00:51:22,794
find yourself now okay, this is what the

1039
00:51:22,832 --> 00:51:24,878
niche is, the information, the niche is

1040
00:51:24,964 --> 00:51:28,394
sharing with me. But what's my priority,

1041
00:51:28,442 --> 00:51:31,486
what's my preference as well. So that

1042
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:33,486
was what the three piece thing I

1043
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:35,586
remember now when we were talking about

1044
00:51:35,608 --> 00:51:38,034
that going, okay, don't get the three

1045
00:51:38,072 --> 00:51:40,354
things mixed up. Give each one of them

1046
00:51:40,552 --> 00:51:42,290
their time in the spotlight.

Coding and Active Inference by Giovanni

1050
00:51:52,034 --> 00:51:54,518
Pezzulo, Thomas Parr, Karl Friston from

1051
00:51:54,604 --> 00:51:57,846
December 2021. And the

1052
00:51:57,868 --> 00:52:02,186
topic here is so important what

1053
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:04,054
is the evolutionary neurophysiological

1054
00:52:04,102 --> 00:52:06,150
basis of cognition? And how do complex

1055
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:09,946
cognitive phenotypes arise at a

1056
00:52:09,968 --> 00:52:11,678
developmental timescale, at an

1057
00:52:11,684 --> 00:52:13,326
ecological timescale, and ant an

1058
00:52:13,348 --> 00:52:16,526
evolutionary timescale? And where this

1059
00:52:16,548 --> 00:52:21,902
paper eventually takes us is

1060
00:52:22,036 --> 00:52:24,670
into thinking about the graphical models

1061
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,138
again. Remember what we discussed just a

1062
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:30,046
few slides ago about graphical models,

1063
00:52:30,238 --> 00:52:33,646
the graphical models which enable

1064
00:52:33,758 --> 00:52:36,286
or facilitate or underlie different

1065
00:52:36,408 --> 00:52:39,106
kinds of functional outcomes,

1066
00:52:39,298 --> 00:52:43,430
and then how structural modification on

1067
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,026
graphical model architectures enable

1068
00:52:47,138 --> 00:52:51,142
different traits to emerge,

1069
00:52:51,206 --> 00:52:54,118
diverge, duplicate, and innovate.

1070
00:52:54,294 --> 00:52:57,802
And so here we see on the right side,

1071
00:52:57,936 --> 00:53:00,906
it's a tree of options, starting from a

1072
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,354
relatively simple initial graphical

1073
00:53:03,402 --> 00:53:05,886
model, how different kinds of

1074
00:53:05,908 --> 00:53:09,018
modifications, duplications, et cetera,

1075
00:53:09,194 --> 00:53:12,446
can result in the kinds of functional as

1076
00:53:12,468 --> 00:53:15,714
well as structural phenomena that we

1077
00:53:15,752 --> 00:53:18,066
observe in living creatures today. And

1078
00:53:18,088 --> 00:53:19,838
whether that's the redundancy of gene

1079
00:53:19,854 --> 00:53:23,134
regulatory networks or the paralyzed

1080
00:53:23,182 --> 00:53:26,210
architecture of the mammalian cortex,

1081
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,742
these are the kinds of phenomena that

1082
00:53:28,796 --> 00:53:32,438
this paper set out to bridge the

1083
00:53:32,444 --> 00:53:35,714
gap with between simply representing

1084
00:53:35,762 --> 00:53:38,306
things as they are as graphical models

1085
00:53:38,338 --> 00:53:40,578
and understanding. What if you weren't

1086
00:53:40,594 --> 00:53:43,226
just studying the amp brain today,

1087
00:53:43,408 --> 00:53:45,034
but what if you were studying the ant

1088
00:53:45,072 --> 00:53:48,700
brain over its phylogenetic history?

1089
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:51,282
How would those generative model models

1090
00:53:51,366 --> 00:53:54,666
be changing? How do things like temporal

1091
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:58,286
depth or intermodal fusion come into

1092
00:53:58,308 --> 00:54:02,320
play? And so that was a nice paper

1093
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:05,898
that connects to evolution and a bunch

1094
00:54:05,914 --> 00:54:09,750
of other behavior areas. Really helped

1095
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:12,194
me understand or confirmed in my mind

1096
00:54:12,312 --> 00:54:13,858
that there's a big difference between a

1097
00:54:13,864 --> 00:54:16,290
person who makes a model and somebody

1098
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,354
who has to interpret somebody's third

1099
00:54:18,392 --> 00:54:20,614
party model. Because I remember going

1100
00:54:20,652 --> 00:54:22,470
through this, I felt like I was learning

1101
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,758
on the fly, because even as I was

1102
00:54:24,764 --> 00:54:27,414
reading the paper, there was a lot there

1103
00:54:27,612 --> 00:54:30,038
to try to parse and just having to be

1104
00:54:30,044 --> 00:54:32,778
able to converse with you in Bleu. And I

1105
00:54:32,784 --> 00:54:34,826
think Esteves was a part of this one as

1106
00:54:34,848 --> 00:54:36,940
well for a bit of time.

1107
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:40,266
Made it a lot easier for me to kind of

1108
00:54:40,288 --> 00:54:42,966
understand as an interpreter of models

1109
00:54:43,078 --> 00:54:45,206
as opposed to somebody who's, here's my

1110
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:47,614
model. What do you think of it? It was

1111
00:54:47,652 --> 00:54:49,514
taking some of these really complicated

1112
00:54:49,562 --> 00:54:51,066
models that other people have designed

1113
00:54:51,098 --> 00:54:53,374
and then trying to make it into

1114
00:54:53,412 --> 00:54:56,660
something that I had adopted. Nice.

1115
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:00,754
Okay. Live stream. 39 morphogenesis as

1116
00:55:00,792 --> 00:55:02,478
Bayesian inference a variational

1117
00:55:02,494 --> 00:55:04,146
approach to pattern formation and

1118
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:06,366
control in complex biological systems.

1119
00:55:06,398 --> 00:55:08,706
By franz Kuchling karl Friston georgi

1120
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:12,280
georgiev and Michael Levin this paper

1121
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:16,758
took what in many other situations are a

1122
00:55:16,764 --> 00:55:20,650
mathematics of structurally stable but

1123
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,362
dynamically signaling architectures like

1124
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:28,266
the brain and considered the case of

1125
00:55:28,448 --> 00:55:32,042
structurally volatile dynamics

1126
00:55:32,106 --> 00:55:34,734
signaling structures. And so they

1127
00:55:34,772 --> 00:55:38,554
focused on one of the key model systems

1128
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:40,766
in the leaven lab, which is the

1129
00:55:40,788 --> 00:55:44,942
plenarian morphogenesis. And upon

1130
00:55:45,006 --> 00:55:47,490
cutting this animal,

1131
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:52,706
it quickly reforms into a

1132
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:55,698
selfsimilar body plan.

1133
00:55:55,864 --> 00:55:58,630
So that has implications that are being

1134
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,506
developed in a whole host of areas

1135
00:56:01,538 --> 00:56:03,686
related to health and development and

1136
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:07,910
disease. And the paper uses

1137
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:11,606
a somewhat technical Variational

1138
00:56:11,638 --> 00:56:14,330
Bayesian mathematics,

1139
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:18,554
which we also jumped into. And we had

1140
00:56:18,592 --> 00:56:21,820
Franz join us here

1141
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:25,230
in the office overlooking some gray

1142
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:29,966
featureless landscape and had

1143
00:56:29,988 --> 00:56:33,626
just incredible insights

1144
00:56:33,658 --> 00:56:36,626
to share. And we talked about the

1145
00:56:36,648 --> 00:56:39,006
environment, what are developmental

1146
00:56:39,038 --> 00:56:40,914
priors and trajectories, what are

1147
00:56:40,952 --> 00:56:44,226
preferences over morphologies. And this

1148
00:56:44,248 --> 00:56:47,350
really opened up the discussion from,

1149
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,466
as mentioned, ant the beginning systems

1150
00:56:50,498 --> 00:56:53,862
that have a structural stasis, that do

1151
00:56:53,916 --> 00:56:56,578
signaling in that structural stasis,

1152
00:56:56,674 --> 00:56:58,566
like all the computers are hooked up and

1153
00:56:58,588 --> 00:56:59,926
now they're talking to each other, but

1154
00:56:59,948 --> 00:57:01,266
they're hooked up the way they're hooked

1155
00:57:01,298 --> 00:57:03,674
up. Well, what if the computers can

1156
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:05,386
change how they're hooked up? Or what if

1157
00:57:05,408 --> 00:57:08,186
they're moving around? That is another

1158
00:57:08,288 --> 00:57:11,178
space that also connects us to a lot of

1159
00:57:11,184 --> 00:57:13,566
the physics of the embodied world.

1160
00:57:13,748 --> 00:57:15,306
Maybe there's friction, maybe there's

1161
00:57:15,338 --> 00:57:19,326
viscosity, maybe there's a

1162
00:57:19,348 --> 00:57:22,126
razor that splits two halves from each

1163
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:25,826
other. And it

1164
00:57:25,848 --> 00:57:28,626
was a great discussion to see how the

1165
00:57:28,648 --> 00:57:31,742
mathematics of the Variational Bayesian

1166
00:57:31,806 --> 00:57:35,330
approach is able to accommodate

1167
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:39,414
these different focal systems which

1168
00:57:39,452 --> 00:57:41,586
speaks to the generalizability of active

1169
00:57:41,618 --> 00:57:43,906
inference. There are a lot of formalisms

1170
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:45,990
there, but it didn't feel formal talking

1171
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:49,500
with Frank and it just felt like

1172
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:55,226
the possible with regeneration had a

1173
00:57:55,248 --> 00:57:56,906
whole bunch of Fields that yet to be

1174
00:57:56,928 --> 00:57:59,510
explored and the kind of openness

1175
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:03,446
thinking openness that opens

1176
00:58:03,478 --> 00:58:06,174
up possibility. That was really cool

1177
00:58:06,212 --> 00:58:08,942
about that live stream set. Awesome.

1178
00:58:09,076 --> 00:58:12,590
All right, 40. Who could forget

1179
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,866
a free energy principle for generic

1180
00:58:15,898 --> 00:58:19,522
Quantum systems? 2021 paper.

1181
00:58:19,656 --> 00:58:23,314
In fact, a year and a day ago by

1182
00:58:23,352 --> 00:58:25,566
Chris Fields, Karl Friston, James

1183
00:58:25,598 --> 00:58:28,854
Glazebrook and Michael Levin. So this

1184
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:32,614
paper we

1185
00:58:32,652 --> 00:58:39,142
needed to situate ourself on

1186
00:58:39,196 --> 00:58:42,630
one hand here represented as the X axis.

1187
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:45,306
Sometimes we find ourselves going back

1188
00:58:45,328 --> 00:58:48,122
and forth between more talking about

1189
00:58:48,176 --> 00:58:49,686
free energy principle and active

1190
00:58:49,718 --> 00:58:52,166
inference, other times discussing

1191
00:58:52,198 --> 00:58:54,286
literature or ideas that are outside of

1192
00:58:54,308 --> 00:58:56,302
the free energy principle and then

1193
00:58:56,356 --> 00:58:59,438
orthogonally. We can think about this

1194
00:58:59,524 --> 00:59:02,222
continuum between not quantum and

1195
00:59:02,276 --> 00:59:04,670
quantum perspectives from physics.

1196
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:08,814
And we were in the upper

1197
00:59:08,862 --> 00:59:12,242
right quadrant or another way of saying

1198
00:59:12,296 --> 00:59:14,626
that is we were everywhere because we

1199
00:59:14,648 --> 00:59:18,214
were quantum and non quantum and we were

1200
00:59:18,252 --> 00:59:21,602
in FEP. We had the authors join

1201
00:59:21,746 --> 00:59:24,834
for both of the streams,

1202
00:59:24,882 --> 00:59:29,142
the 40.1 and 40.2. So here

1203
00:59:29,196 --> 00:59:32,426
we are with Bleu and Esteves, us and the

1204
00:59:32,448 --> 00:59:36,380
authors. And every

1205
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:40,950
sequence of symbols that these fellows

1206
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:44,750
added was immense.

1207
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:50,320
And to be able to make

1208
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:54,990
that daredevil jump across

1209
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:59,202
the Grand Canyon and connect the most

1210
00:59:59,336 --> 01:00:01,454
advanced perspectives on quantum

1211
01:00:01,502 --> 01:00:03,326
mechanics, quantum physics, quantum

1212
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:05,662
computation, unconventional computation

1213
01:00:05,726 --> 01:00:08,566
more broadly today, for example,

1214
01:00:08,748 --> 01:00:10,914
thinking about the perception, action

1215
01:00:10,962 --> 01:00:13,494
and memory phenomena in terms of

1216
01:00:13,532 --> 01:00:16,034
repeated measurements of a quantum

1217
01:00:16,082 --> 01:00:18,310
observer with their reference frame and

1218
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:22,426
looking ant the holograph. It was a

1219
01:00:22,448 --> 01:00:25,450
great and memorable sequence.

1220
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:29,274
It literally materialized the bridge to

1221
01:00:29,312 --> 01:00:31,338
everywhere, being in that upper right

1222
01:00:31,504 --> 01:00:34,794
quadrant, which is a fascinating thing

1223
01:00:34,832 --> 01:00:37,386
because I don't know how you engineer a

1224
01:00:37,408 --> 01:00:40,014
bridge to everywhere, but the

1225
01:00:40,052 --> 01:00:43,854
possibility means you have to open up to

1226
01:00:43,972 --> 01:00:46,302
more than somewhere. And I think that

1227
01:00:46,436 --> 01:00:49,678
was, again, one of

1228
01:00:49,684 --> 01:00:51,042
those sets where you're kind of going,

1229
01:00:51,096 --> 01:00:52,706
am I really doing well? You wouldn't say

1230
01:00:52,728 --> 01:00:54,434
this, but I would say this. Am I really

1231
01:00:54,472 --> 01:00:56,258
doing this? Am I really having a

1232
01:00:56,344 --> 01:00:59,138
conversation? Do I get to sit at the

1233
01:00:59,144 --> 01:01:01,774
same room with people of this capacity?

1234
01:01:01,822 --> 01:01:05,318
It was really fantastic. And I got to

1235
01:01:05,324 --> 01:01:08,342
talk to Mike Levin for privately after

1236
01:01:08,396 --> 01:01:10,986
that because, yeah, the idea of

1237
01:01:11,008 --> 01:01:14,006
prediction matter expertise intrigued

1238
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:17,450
him. So that was very cool. Great.

1239
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:21,100
Wow. All right. Carrying through 41

1240
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,642
extended active inference constructing

1241
01:01:23,706 --> 01:01:26,110
predictive cognition beyond skulls,

1242
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,938
by axel constant, andy clark, Michael

1243
01:01:28,954 --> 01:01:35,214
Kirchhoff, and karl Friston. So here we

1244
01:01:35,252 --> 01:01:38,746
had the all star team. We had Bleu,

1245
01:01:38,858 --> 01:01:41,858
you and I. Trust is like glue. If you

1246
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,346
don't have it, you won't be able to

1247
01:01:43,368 --> 01:01:46,900
stick together. And our team

1248
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:49,826
talked about trust active inference lab

1249
01:01:49,858 --> 01:01:53,846
models. And I remember this section of

1250
01:01:53,868 --> 01:01:57,458
the discussion where we had two systems,

1251
01:01:57,634 --> 01:02:00,774
the Bleu and the orange. And we

1252
01:02:00,812 --> 01:02:03,786
discussed what is their border, what is

1253
01:02:03,808 --> 01:02:06,310
their interface? Is it another region?

1254
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:08,406
But then if it's another region, isn't

1255
01:02:08,438 --> 01:02:12,662
there a region that borders that and

1256
01:02:12,736 --> 01:02:15,214
what is on the outside of that? And so

1257
01:02:15,252 --> 01:02:17,402
how does all that connect to extended

1258
01:02:17,466 --> 01:02:20,462
cognitive systems? Extended relative to

1259
01:02:20,516 --> 01:02:24,270
what? And so this

1260
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:27,294
topic of extended inference was dealt

1261
01:02:27,342 --> 01:02:30,100
with thoroughly here,

1262
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:33,294
and the mathematics and the applications

1263
01:02:33,342 --> 01:02:37,122
of extended cognition are so

1264
01:02:37,176 --> 01:02:40,374
promising. I also remember you

1265
01:02:40,412 --> 01:02:43,222
discussing the difference between a type

1266
01:02:43,276 --> 01:02:46,466
of active versus a passive offloading.

1267
01:02:46,658 --> 01:02:48,918
There's a difference between somebody

1268
01:02:49,084 --> 01:02:51,574
writing a code on a Post It note that

1269
01:02:51,612 --> 01:02:54,746
only they know. So if they look at it

1270
01:02:54,768 --> 01:02:56,810
later, it's like it helps them remember

1271
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,506
what they were thinking of. But to

1272
01:02:58,528 --> 01:03:00,522
somebody else, it doesn't mean anything,

1273
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:03,126
and it doesn't do anything as just notes

1274
01:03:03,158 --> 01:03:06,586
on paper versus JF creating

1275
01:03:06,618 --> 01:03:08,846
a robot and sending it into the

1276
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,430
environment. Yes, it might still need

1277
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,158
recharging and so on. So it's not like

1278
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:14,506
it's totally disconnected, but it's

1279
01:03:14,538 --> 01:03:16,574
doing things actively. And that kind of

1280
01:03:16,612 --> 01:03:19,950
active or passive offloading

1281
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:22,146
and the way that that facilitates our

1282
01:03:22,168 --> 01:03:23,774
cognitive goals was very rich

1283
01:03:23,822 --> 01:03:27,314
discussion. Axel being

1284
01:03:27,352 --> 01:03:29,000
the first author of this,

1285
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:34,200
to me, he's like Sajid. He brings in

1286
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:38,374
active coherence, and how long

1287
01:03:38,412 --> 01:03:42,150
do you stick with something before you

1288
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:45,634
no longer carry

1289
01:03:45,682 --> 01:03:49,930
something on? He's such a good

1290
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:53,370
explainer of you realize that

1291
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,818
the environment is actively inferring

1292
01:03:55,834 --> 01:03:58,400
you as much as you are inferring it.

1293
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:00,494
That's really hard for people to get

1294
01:04:00,532 --> 01:04:02,286
their minds wrapped. The first time you

1295
01:04:02,308 --> 01:04:04,480
hear that, you're kind of like, what?

1296
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:06,986
But he does such an amazing job of

1297
01:04:07,028 --> 01:04:10,180
explaining that it doesn't seem like

1298
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:12,834
people talking about some silly thing

1299
01:04:12,872 --> 01:04:14,418
like fairies dancing on the head of a

1300
01:04:14,424 --> 01:04:17,202
pin, you actually go, Wait a second,

1301
01:04:17,256 --> 01:04:20,486
you're right. It would have to the

1302
01:04:20,508 --> 01:04:21,686
environment would have to be

1303
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:24,146
scrutinizing me as much as I'm

1304
01:04:24,178 --> 01:04:26,374
scrutinizing and and trying to figure it

1305
01:04:26,412 --> 01:04:29,800
out. Nice. All right. 42.

Catal, Timberbellan Tune, von Deneve

1309
01:04:38,518 --> 01:04:42,540
Bart Dot and Adam Saffron this paper

1310
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:46,826
was an incredible example of applied

1311
01:04:46,858 --> 01:04:49,982
active inference. They in this

1312
01:04:50,036 --> 01:04:53,530
paper represented the full rainbow

1313
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:56,658
from conceptualizing a generative model

1314
01:04:56,824 --> 01:04:59,854
to implementing it and making a robot

1315
01:04:59,902 --> 01:05:01,614
that actually enacts that generative

1316
01:05:01,662 --> 01:05:04,354
model in a warehouse setting. And what

1317
01:05:04,392 --> 01:05:07,218
that warehouse setting required from the

1318
01:05:07,224 --> 01:05:10,102
generative model was that there was two

1319
01:05:10,236 --> 01:05:12,694
levels at which the generative model was

1320
01:05:12,732 --> 01:05:15,542
playing out. At the higher level, which

1321
01:05:15,596 --> 01:05:17,766
we were thinking of in terms of

1322
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:21,046
strategy, the robot decides where it

1323
01:05:21,068 --> 01:05:22,738
wants to be, where it prefers to be,

1324
01:05:22,764 --> 01:05:24,666
and where it is. At a lower level,

1325
01:05:24,768 --> 01:05:28,086
which we connected to tactics is related

1326
01:05:28,118 --> 01:05:30,234
to the kinds of bodily moves that it can

1327
01:05:30,272 --> 01:05:32,182
engage in. It's more movement

1328
01:05:32,246 --> 01:05:35,374
affordances. And this

1329
01:05:35,572 --> 01:05:40,990
discussion facilitated a lot of action

1330
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:44,126
into the math, the computation, the

1331
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:47,826
embodiment, the robotics, and give some

1332
01:05:47,848 --> 01:05:50,974
of the clearest examples of applied

1333
01:05:51,022 --> 01:05:53,954
hierarchical model modeling that came

1334
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,620
back again and again and again.

1335
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:03,136
So that was fun. All right,

Review by Beren Millidge and Neil Seth

1339
01:06:10,988 --> 01:06:14,420
and Christopher Buckley. This paper

1340
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:18,070
was quite a doozy. It was very

1341
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,796
mathematical and quite long. The

1342
01:06:21,818 --> 01:06:24,740
memorable part of this paper to me was

1343
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:27,156
collaborating with Maria on the Dot

1344
01:06:27,188 --> 01:06:30,660
zero. And Maria's

1345
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:33,892
philosophical knowledge with predictive

1346
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:36,970
processing took us way back.

1347
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:41,032
And that was rooting

1348
01:06:41,096 --> 01:06:44,830
the discussion in the ancients and

1349
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,432
thinking about world knowledge,

1350
01:06:47,496 --> 01:06:50,876
traditions and ant and Helmholtz. We

1351
01:06:50,898 --> 01:06:53,800
hear a lot more about that kind of 1718

1352
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:56,610
1900 philosophy time.

1353
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,432
But this pulled us

1354
01:07:00,486 --> 01:07:03,888
temporarily back and helped

1355
01:07:03,984 --> 01:07:07,684
bridge the math of this paper,

1356
01:07:07,882 --> 01:07:11,220
which was technical to the ways

1357
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:14,672
that people have simply perceived,

1358
01:07:14,736 --> 01:07:18,136
cognized acted and thought about the

1359
01:07:18,158 --> 01:07:20,936
world around them. And then to speak to

1360
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:24,456
the math, this paper almost the entire

1361
01:07:24,558 --> 01:07:27,640
thing before something like the last

1362
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,312
several pages. It's about hierarchical

1363
01:07:30,376 --> 01:07:32,328
predictive processing architectures,

1364
01:07:32,504 --> 01:07:35,176
but there's no action to be found. It's

1365
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:37,228
just about inference, inference going up

1366
01:07:37,234 --> 01:07:39,596
and down, priors and observations and

1367
01:07:39,618 --> 01:07:42,016
prediction errors, all of that. And then

1368
01:07:42,038 --> 01:07:43,936
at the end, oh, yeah, we're going to be

1369
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:47,168
doing inference on action. We're going

1370
01:07:47,174 --> 01:07:50,624
to be doing active inference. And with

1371
01:07:50,662 --> 01:07:53,716
that tiny twist of the

1372
01:07:53,738 --> 01:07:58,740
knife, active inference becomes.

1373
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,670
And so it's just amazing to see how

1374
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,940
purely inferential architectures,

1375
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:10,360
when they're doing inference on action,

1376
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:13,144
the consequences of action are taken

1377
01:08:13,182 --> 01:08:14,856
into account. Policy selection is

1378
01:08:14,878 --> 01:08:16,344
treated as a formal thing to do

1379
01:08:16,382 --> 01:08:19,556
inference on. You get active inference,

1380
01:08:19,748 --> 01:08:21,644
and it really isn't too much more

1381
01:08:21,682 --> 01:08:24,380
complex than that. And then just a last

1382
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:28,136
point, just like we had the three areas

1383
01:08:28,248 --> 01:08:30,156
of claims justifying each other from

1384
01:08:30,178 --> 01:08:32,796
Livestream 37 with the general claims,

1385
01:08:32,828 --> 01:08:35,024
mathematical and empirical claims. We

1386
01:08:35,062 --> 01:08:37,744
had another triangle in 43.

1387
01:08:37,942 --> 01:08:41,200
So here we had on the top

1388
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:42,976
biological systems and what they were

1389
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:45,972
doing. On the left we had philosophy and

1390
01:08:46,026 --> 01:08:49,316
qualitative claims, and on the right we

1391
01:08:49,338 --> 01:08:52,356
had formal quantitative claims. And so

1392
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:54,724
we made another triangle with pretty

1393
01:08:54,762 --> 01:08:57,784
much the same three vertices, which is

1394
01:08:57,822 --> 01:09:00,004
mathematics, philosophy and empirical

1395
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:03,032
biological phenomena. And we took

1396
01:09:03,086 --> 01:09:06,600
another first principles pass on

1397
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:10,156
constructing those three areas and what

1398
01:09:10,178 --> 01:09:12,428
are the nodes, what are the edges, and

1399
01:09:12,514 --> 01:09:15,276
how are inference and action at the

1400
01:09:15,298 --> 01:09:16,750
heart of all of it?

1401
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:28,386
All right, 44 44

1402
01:09:28,488 --> 01:09:31,154

1407
01:09:43,116 --> 01:09:45,942
was awesome. Also here, from the

1408
01:09:45,996 --> 01:09:48,566
screenshot of the event, we have Iain

1409
01:09:48,598 --> 01:09:51,594
Tennant with the Inner Sense Channel and

1410
01:09:51,632 --> 01:09:55,098
Project, who saw this paper,

1411
01:09:55,184 --> 01:09:56,986
brought it to our attention, said, I

1412
01:09:57,008 --> 01:10:00,150
want to facilitate this discussion,

1413
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:03,726
and I want to connect exteroception and

1414
01:10:03,748 --> 01:10:06,058
the Therapeutic Alliance in a Modern

1415
01:10:06,154 --> 01:10:08,446
context to active inference. And I want

1416
01:10:08,468 --> 01:10:11,886
to bring in these awesome authors and

1417
01:10:11,988 --> 01:10:14,978
make this a conversation that really

1418
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:18,078
hits home. And so thanks, Iain,

1419
01:10:18,174 --> 01:10:20,706
for joining and helping. That way, the

1420
01:10:20,728 --> 01:10:23,806
paper focuses on the Therapeutic

1421
01:10:23,838 --> 01:10:27,734
Alliance, which is like the clinical or

1422
01:10:27,772 --> 01:10:30,230
medical or therapeutic niche.

1423
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:32,806
It's the people in the room, it's the

1424
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:35,286
receptionist, it's the nurses, it's the

1425
01:10:35,308 --> 01:10:38,102
surgeon, it's the physical rehab

1426
01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:40,778
practitioner, it's the family of the

1427
01:10:40,864 --> 01:10:43,354
patient, it's the patient themselves,

1428
01:10:43,552 --> 01:10:45,994
it's the physical surroundings. And to

1429
01:10:46,032 --> 01:10:49,974
be able to very broadly discuss

1430
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:53,310
that vital setting while

1431
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:56,474
connecting it to key active inference

1432
01:10:56,522 --> 01:10:58,762
topics like generative models,

1433
01:10:58,906 --> 01:11:02,506
synchrony and so on, as well

1434
01:11:02,548 --> 01:11:06,050
as to see their delightful figures

1435
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,626
and the way that they represented the

1436
01:11:08,648 --> 01:11:11,998
same bunch

1437
01:11:12,014 --> 01:11:13,858
of authors joining for both of the

1438
01:11:13,944 --> 01:11:17,734
discussions. And it was

1439
01:11:17,772 --> 01:11:20,070
an awesome series.

1440
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:24,410
All right.

1441
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:31,770
This 145,

1442
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:34,232
this is when I come back from the dead,

1443
01:11:34,296 --> 01:11:36,190
and this is what I walked into.

1444
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,824
I knew there was a reason why I wasn't

1445
01:11:40,872 --> 01:11:43,470
called away. It was because of 45.

1446
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:46,448
45 was the free energy principle, made

1447
01:11:46,534 --> 01:11:48,796
simpler but not too simple. By Karl

Friston, Lancelot Costa, North Sage,

1449
01:11:51,036 --> 01:11:54,236
Conor Heins, Kyle ulholtzer Grigorios,

1450
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:57,780
a pavliotis, Thomas Parr well,

1451
01:11:57,930 --> 01:12:01,380
I think the best way to summarize or

1452
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:03,956
crystallize the experience of this

1453
01:12:04,058 --> 01:12:07,912
stream was Bleu, and I spent many

1454
01:12:07,966 --> 01:12:10,936
hours preparing for the dot zero. We

1455
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:12,792
were having separate meetings and doing

1456
01:12:12,846 --> 01:12:15,832
asynchronous work to really work through

1457
01:12:15,886 --> 01:12:18,136
and understand the mathematics of this

1458
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:22,476
paper. And we did the 45.0

1459
01:12:22,658 --> 01:12:24,956
in May. It was all great. We Beren

1460
01:12:24,978 --> 01:12:27,736
looking forward to June. We had invited

1461
01:12:27,768 --> 01:12:29,068
the authors. We didn't really know what

1462
01:12:29,074 --> 01:12:32,536
was going to happen. And it was several

1463
01:12:32,568 --> 01:12:34,864
minutes after the hour where we were

1464
01:12:34,902 --> 01:12:36,384
supposed to start. And so we usually

1465
01:12:36,422 --> 01:12:38,944
just try to start on the hour or a few

1466
01:12:38,982 --> 01:12:42,928
minutes after the hour. Why wait

1467
01:12:43,014 --> 01:12:46,304
longer? And we just didn't

1468
01:12:46,352 --> 01:12:49,572
have anyone else on stream. So we said,

1469
01:12:49,626 --> 01:12:53,232
all right, this is it. We floundered

1470
01:12:53,296 --> 01:12:57,476
through the dot zero. Let us swim again

1471
01:12:57,658 --> 01:13:01,076
into the one. Yes, please. Dean, I'm

1472
01:13:01,108 --> 01:13:03,144
sorry, but you're not telling the whole

1473
01:13:03,182 --> 01:13:06,776
story when you are completely out of

1474
01:13:06,798 --> 01:13:10,312
your niche. And you guys worked so hard

1475
01:13:10,446 --> 01:13:12,584
to make sure that you could adapt for

1476
01:13:12,622 --> 01:13:14,828
this, but then you took the the year

1477
01:13:14,914 --> 01:13:17,032
courage and the strength to literally

1478
01:13:17,176 --> 01:13:20,700
jump out of the ocean into the boat.

1479
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,572
And then all you wanted was come on.

1480
01:13:24,706 --> 01:13:26,464
It would be wonderful if somebody could

1481
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:28,304
show up and at least tell us that

1482
01:13:28,342 --> 01:13:29,856
jumping out of the ocean was a good

1483
01:13:29,878 --> 01:13:32,370
thing to do. And then just like that.

1484
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,780
Just a few minutes after, we started to

1485
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:39,076
come. Along and say, hey, how's it

1486
01:13:39,098 --> 01:13:42,612
going? Here catch and release. It was so

1487
01:13:42,746 --> 01:13:45,844
amazing. You may

1488
01:13:45,882 --> 01:13:48,308
not believe that it was that big of a

1489
01:13:48,314 --> 01:13:50,730
deal, but it was. And it was amazing.

1490
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:53,880
Yeah. Just a few minutes after starting

1491
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:56,516
with the two of us, first Karl Friston

1492
01:13:56,548 --> 01:13:58,072
joined, and then several minutes later,

1493
01:13:58,126 --> 01:14:00,590
Thomas joined. So,

1494
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,388
yes, it was one moment,

1495
01:14:05,554 --> 01:14:10,476
but it spoke to putting it out there and

1496
01:14:10,578 --> 01:14:14,064
being ready to show up and being ready

1497
01:14:14,102 --> 01:14:17,184
for others to show up, but also for

1498
01:14:17,222 --> 01:14:19,376
these two sessions that both Karl and

1499
01:14:19,398 --> 01:14:22,848
Thomas joined for. For those who want to

1500
01:14:22,854 --> 01:14:24,944
know about the mathematics of active

1501
01:14:24,992 --> 01:14:28,704
inference, there's many miles

1502
01:14:28,752 --> 01:14:31,552
to go with making it accessible,

1503
01:14:31,616 --> 01:14:34,276
rigorous and applicable. So, not to be

1504
01:14:34,378 --> 01:14:37,464
denied, but if somebody wants to know

1505
01:14:37,502 --> 01:14:40,920
the absolute state of the art, these

1506
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:42,920
conversations, you're hearing it

1507
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:46,056
directly and the questions and the

1508
01:14:46,078 --> 01:14:49,584
discourse are 100% approachable.

1509
01:14:49,732 --> 01:14:52,728
So this was just some of the highest

1510
01:14:52,824 --> 01:14:58,700
density learning and higher

1511
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:02,208
learning. It was an institute of

1512
01:15:02,214 --> 01:15:05,740
higher learning. If you want evidence

1513
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:09,104
of naivete, which is not

1514
01:15:09,142 --> 01:15:12,496
something you want to remain as all your

1515
01:15:12,518 --> 01:15:14,112
life, but those moments when you allow

1516
01:15:14,166 --> 01:15:17,396
yourself to be naive and how that can be

1517
01:15:17,418 --> 01:15:20,548
a feature, watch this. If you

1518
01:15:20,554 --> 01:15:22,852
ant a first step, you might look at

1519
01:15:22,906 --> 01:15:24,164
going, I don't know anything about

1520
01:15:24,202 --> 01:15:27,384
active inference. Just still, you may

1521
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:28,968
not understand some of the things that

1522
01:15:28,974 --> 01:15:30,664
were discussed, and that doesn't matter.

1523
01:15:30,782 --> 01:15:33,224
What you really will appreciate is the

1524
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:34,360
generosity.

1525
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:39,644
Yes. Great. All right.

1526
01:15:39,682 --> 01:15:43,336
46. So 46 was active. Inference models

1527
01:15:43,368 --> 01:15:45,324
do not contradict folk psychology. By

1528
01:15:45,362 --> 01:15:47,352
Ryan Smith, Maxwell Ramstead and Alex

1529
01:15:47,416 --> 01:15:50,764
Kiefer So what is there to

1530
01:15:50,802 --> 01:15:53,840
say? We are folk psychology.

1531
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:58,124
We are them. And this is also a topic

1532
01:15:58,172 --> 01:16:00,224
that people bring up all the time. Oh,

1533
01:16:00,262 --> 01:16:02,450
preference. Are we talking about like,

1534
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:06,436
that? I prefer to have this happen in my

1535
01:16:06,458 --> 01:16:08,676
life. Belief. Are we talking about what

1536
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:11,412
it feels like to believe something? And

1537
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:15,184
this paper just absolutely squarely

1538
01:16:15,232 --> 01:16:20,584
targets those questions. And the

1539
01:16:20,622 --> 01:16:23,416
conclusion is in the title for the

1540
01:16:23,438 --> 01:16:26,836
authors. It's not a reification of folk

1541
01:16:26,868 --> 01:16:29,576
psychology. It's not chapter two on folk

1542
01:16:29,608 --> 01:16:31,580
psychology. It's not a nullification,

1543
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,476
it's not a contradiction. It is a

1544
01:16:36,498 --> 01:16:40,476
non contradiction, which is exactly

1545
01:16:40,658 --> 01:16:43,932
what it sounds like, which may infuriate

1546
01:16:43,996 --> 01:16:47,520
those on any side of multiple fences.

1547
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:51,664
So it was a great conversation because

1548
01:16:51,782 --> 01:16:55,404
the topic was so directly tangible

1549
01:16:55,452 --> 01:16:57,812
and accessible. We did want to connect

1550
01:16:57,866 --> 01:16:59,648
the math and formalism active inference

1551
01:16:59,664 --> 01:17:03,056
lab to how people talked about folk

1552
01:17:03,088 --> 01:17:05,476
psychology, which is just like us day to

1553
01:17:05,498 --> 01:17:08,244
day, talking about our feelings. So that

1554
01:17:08,282 --> 01:17:11,728
was an amazing concept. And also the

1555
01:17:11,754 --> 01:17:15,450
sort of fun stream memory was

1556
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:20,612
I used social media to communicate

1557
01:17:20,676 --> 01:17:23,148
that the dot zero was beginning, I

1558
01:17:23,154 --> 01:17:26,264
guess, on June 14 here, and Ryan Smith

1559
01:17:26,312 --> 01:17:28,188
just says, hey, I don't know if I'm

1560
01:17:28,194 --> 01:17:29,884
going to be free later, but I'm free

1561
01:17:29,922 --> 01:17:33,404
now. So we had Ryan in the saddle

1562
01:17:33,532 --> 01:17:37,104
for the dot zero, which was

1563
01:17:37,222 --> 01:17:40,976
the. First time we ever had the

1564
01:17:40,998 --> 01:17:44,040
first. Time we ever had an author join

1565
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:46,468
and bring that kind of insight into the

1566
01:17:46,474 --> 01:17:50,900
dot zero. So class

1567
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:54,672
was held, Court was in session,

1568
01:17:54,816 --> 01:17:58,904
and Ryan has joined multiple times and

1569
01:17:59,102 --> 01:18:02,296
has so much incredible clarity on the

1570
01:18:02,318 --> 01:18:05,256
math and on the psychology and the

1571
01:18:05,278 --> 01:18:07,044
applications of active inference.

1572
01:18:07,172 --> 01:18:09,836
Anyone studying his publication or

1573
01:18:09,858 --> 01:18:12,828
presentation career can know that. So it

1574
01:18:12,834 --> 01:18:14,588
was a great conversation with Ryan and

1575
01:18:14,594 --> 01:18:18,344
then also with Alex Kiefer joining

1576
01:18:18,392 --> 01:18:21,996
in the subsequent discussions. And Dean,

1577
01:18:22,028 --> 01:18:25,344
you brought so many fun images and

1578
01:18:25,382 --> 01:18:28,944
motifs to bear. It was

1579
01:18:28,982 --> 01:18:31,330
just like it was such a fun house.

1580
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:33,936
Well, here's the thing. And again, this

1581
01:18:33,958 --> 01:18:36,532
was by June, right? We started in

1582
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:39,956
January trying to figure out, what do

1583
01:18:39,978 --> 01:18:43,012
the lines between mean? Right?

1584
01:18:43,066 --> 01:18:46,100
So is active inference a divider?

1585
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,304
Active inference lab an enveloper? What

1586
01:18:49,342 --> 01:18:51,192
this paper said was, it's not

1587
01:18:51,246 --> 01:18:53,656
contradictory to appreciate that it

1588
01:18:53,678 --> 01:18:55,988
could be both, that if we have a circle,

1589
01:18:56,084 --> 01:18:59,176
you can be inside with the spokes or you

1590
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:01,788
can be outside and be the contact

1591
01:19:01,874 --> 01:19:04,140
service. If it's a divider,

1592
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,444
it can be on either sideline. But if it

1593
01:19:08,482 --> 01:19:12,000
is both, then why

1594
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:14,752
would you always feel that you're doing

1595
01:19:14,806 --> 01:19:18,210
something wrong by holding up both?

1596
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:21,788
Right? Why is both the contradictory

1597
01:19:21,884 --> 01:19:23,968
aspects of this, which again,

1598
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:28,196
encouraged me and my mintu I

1599
01:19:28,218 --> 01:19:29,636
don't care how you want to do it. You

1600
01:19:29,658 --> 01:19:31,716
can collapse past that. But if you want

1601
01:19:31,738 --> 01:19:33,088
to get to fractalization,

1602
01:19:33,264 --> 01:19:35,316
fractalization being the moment that

1603
01:19:35,338 --> 01:19:38,056
you're literally in the gap or on the

1604
01:19:38,078 --> 01:19:41,610
line or on the boundary, right.

1605
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:45,256
That's what affords fractalization is

1606
01:19:45,278 --> 01:19:47,976
the fact that you don't necessarily go,

1607
01:19:47,998 --> 01:19:50,804
well, that's action prediction. And

1608
01:19:50,862 --> 01:19:53,768
Clark. We're done. No, I have to stick

1609
01:19:53,784 --> 01:19:56,252
to something simpler because I will not

1610
01:19:56,306 --> 01:19:58,556
accept a contradictory space. There are

1611
01:19:58,578 --> 01:20:00,780
times for absoluteisms, but there's also

1612
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:02,736
what Ryan was pointing out, which is

1613
01:20:02,758 --> 01:20:06,064
that maybe that's a feature. Maybe this

1614
01:20:06,102 --> 01:20:09,296
ability to see both is something we

1615
01:20:09,318 --> 01:20:13,680
should just you don't have to accept

1616
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,950
again, counterfactuals, what if you did?

1617
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,632
So it was really good. And then Alex

1618
01:20:19,776 --> 01:20:22,464
showing up afterwards, kind of plain

1619
01:20:22,512 --> 01:20:25,764
cleanup. It was really cool. Yes. So

1620
01:20:25,802 --> 01:20:29,476
that was taking us to the end of June.

1621
01:20:29,668 --> 01:20:33,480
We then took. A few weeks off of

1622
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:38,200
discussing papers, and in that inter

1623
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:42,492
semester break, we came to 47.

1624
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:46,140
So I'll let you describe 47. It was

1625
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:49,052
active inference and abduction. 2021 by

1626
01:20:49,106 --> 01:20:53,216
Ativeco, Piateran and Majid Beni and

1627
01:20:53,398 --> 01:20:55,616
an active dynamic social cognition and

1628
01:20:55,638 --> 01:20:57,488
active inference by And S. Hipolito and

1629
01:20:57,494 --> 01:21:00,784
Thomas Vaness. 2021. Yeah. Well,

1630
01:21:00,902 --> 01:21:04,460
again, I guess there was an attention

1631
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:07,616
on my part to get, first of all, muster

1632
01:21:07,648 --> 01:21:09,524
up the courage, because these people

1633
01:21:09,562 --> 01:21:11,076
have spent a lot of time putting these

1634
01:21:11,098 --> 01:21:14,964
papers together. But my sense of it was

1635
01:21:15,162 --> 01:21:17,376
I've got both eyes open. I'm not focused

1636
01:21:17,408 --> 01:21:20,996
on instrumentalism or

1637
01:21:21,098 --> 01:21:24,584
action or taking a realist stance or

1638
01:21:24,622 --> 01:21:27,064
taking a non realist stance. And yet

1639
01:21:27,102 --> 01:21:29,152
there was all of this conversation

1640
01:21:29,236 --> 01:21:32,460
around those things as to which

1641
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:36,252
one entails the other or which one came

1642
01:21:36,306 --> 01:21:39,676
first. And all I wanted to do was

1643
01:21:39,698 --> 01:21:42,204
hold the papers up side by each. And

1644
01:21:42,242 --> 01:21:43,996
rather than having people having to

1645
01:21:44,018 --> 01:21:47,024
defend one side or the other, I wanted

1646
01:21:47,062 --> 01:21:48,896
to hold it up as here's, two sides to

1647
01:21:48,918 --> 01:21:51,168
the same coin. We are on the edge of

1648
01:21:51,174 --> 01:21:54,790
this coin. Now, looking down on both,

1649
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,912
what does that imply? That's essentially

1650
01:21:58,976 --> 01:22:00,916
what that was about, because I think at

1651
01:22:00,938 --> 01:22:03,216
the core or the heart of prediction

1652
01:22:03,248 --> 01:22:05,696
matter expertise, not just active

1653
01:22:05,728 --> 01:22:07,864
inference as something that we can

1654
01:22:07,902 --> 01:22:11,800
subjectify, but that we can act upon in

1655
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:14,760
formal ways, not just informally.

1656
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:20,288
That's when you know you've

1657
01:22:20,324 --> 01:22:23,116
entered the divide or you're on the

1658
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:26,924
boundary, which leaves it up to you as

1659
01:22:26,962 --> 01:22:29,244
the person now that's taken up those

1660
01:22:29,282 --> 01:22:32,088
coordinates to do things like we're

1661
01:22:32,104 --> 01:22:34,864
doing today. Reflect back on what got

1662
01:22:34,902 --> 01:22:38,096
you here. Was it one leg or the

1663
01:22:38,118 --> 01:22:39,792
other? Right. It's like saying, oh,

1664
01:22:39,846 --> 01:22:43,136
well, it was my left leg that got me

1665
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:46,276
here. Well, it was, but it was also the

1666
01:22:46,298 --> 01:22:50,756
right leg. So how do you square that in

1667
01:22:50,938 --> 01:22:53,508
some of these debates where people,

1668
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:55,444
like I said, they invest a lot of time

1669
01:22:55,482 --> 01:22:58,424
and energy and effort into trying to

1670
01:22:58,462 --> 01:22:59,864
make sure that what they're saying is

1671
01:22:59,902 --> 01:23:02,392
correct, to the point where they almost

1672
01:23:02,446 --> 01:23:04,936
feel like they have to defend something

1673
01:23:05,038 --> 01:23:08,340
because it narrowly fits.

1674
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,516
And I wouldn't argue against that. But

1675
01:23:11,538 --> 01:23:13,884
if we're talking about both scale free

1676
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:16,556
and scale friendly, which we are, I

1677
01:23:16,578 --> 01:23:19,564
think we all kind of accepted that.

1678
01:23:19,602 --> 01:23:22,764
Now then, how does that work?

1679
01:23:22,802 --> 01:23:25,264
And mejee, despite the fact that he was

1680
01:23:25,302 --> 01:23:29,970
not under the most optimal health

1681
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:34,164
conditions, was super kind, showed up

1682
01:23:34,202 --> 01:23:38,292
and once again graced us with trying

1683
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:41,444
to explain some things, despite the fact

1684
01:23:41,482 --> 01:23:45,044
that I know he wasn't in the best

1685
01:23:45,082 --> 01:23:47,252
of cognition to do that. So, again,

1686
01:23:47,386 --> 01:23:51,000
another shout out for Mashid Beni and

1687
01:23:51,150 --> 01:23:53,412
his willingness to go the extra mile.

1688
01:23:53,556 --> 01:23:57,864
Yes. And for you in breaking the

1689
01:23:58,062 --> 01:24:02,670
one paper per series speed limit and

1690
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:06,140
having us consider two papers

1691
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,908
wholeheartedly. So that was hopefully it

1692
01:24:08,914 --> 01:24:10,956
was helpful. That's all I was hoping is

1693
01:24:10,978 --> 01:24:14,192
that it wouldn't be seen as being

1694
01:24:14,326 --> 01:24:16,832
disrespectful because we weren't giving

1695
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:19,136
enough attention over to something. We

1696
01:24:19,158 --> 01:24:21,436
were actually entertaining availability

1697
01:24:21,548 --> 01:24:24,296
with attention. Again, we were mintwing

1698
01:24:24,348 --> 01:24:27,684
things. That was cool.

1699
01:24:27,882 --> 01:24:29,430
Thank you. Thank you.

1701

ecological approach to communicative

1703
01:24:38,576 --> 01:24:41,640
behavior. By Ramit and Pierre Jorge.

1704
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:46,296
This paper brought together a lot of the

1705
01:24:46,318 --> 01:24:49,080
topics that we've mentioned earlier.

1706
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:52,152
Communication, extended cognition,

1707
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:52,990
social.

1708
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:58,636
And we had

1709
01:24:58,818 --> 01:25:02,912
you, Bleu and I with Remy both

1710
01:25:02,966 --> 01:25:05,810
times. What can you say?

1711
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:10,960
Remy is a great defender of an action,

1712
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:14,804
fantastic defender of an action. And he

1713
01:25:14,842 --> 01:25:17,908
also has partial encapsulation. Whether

1714
01:25:17,994 --> 01:25:19,636
he would have described it as that or

1715
01:25:19,658 --> 01:25:22,160
not, he is a partial encapsulator.

1716
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:24,310
So there you go.

1717
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,230
Yeah,

1718
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,484
it was awesome to have him on. And the

1719
01:25:32,602 --> 01:25:35,910
open endedness of the conversation as we

1720
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:41,212
took a look on the social, which can get

1721
01:25:41,266 --> 01:25:44,348
one Costa from the first

1722
01:25:44,434 --> 01:25:48,172
moment, and maybe that's not even a bad

1723
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:51,984
thing, but we lost more than we've ever

1724
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:55,884
found in that niche

1725
01:25:56,012 --> 01:25:59,824
of exploring and discussing. All right,

1726
01:26:00,022 --> 01:26:02,336
getting into the last three papers here.

1727
01:26:02,518 --> 01:26:04,788
Yeah. And the reason why I mentioned the

1728
01:26:04,794 --> 01:26:08,292
gap between 46 and 47 was

1729
01:26:08,346 --> 01:26:12,816
because we came back with a fury,

1730
01:26:13,008 --> 01:26:15,908
and we were mad at anyone.

1731
01:26:15,994 --> 01:26:19,000
We were angry, but we were furious.

1732
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:22,916
And we had some incredible streams.

1733
01:26:22,948 --> 01:26:27,464
So almost center in

1734
01:26:27,502 --> 01:26:29,516
representing that for me is in

1735
01:26:29,538 --> 01:26:33,404
Livestream 49, a worked Example of

1736
01:26:33,442 --> 01:26:35,160
the Bayesian Mechanics of Classical

1737
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:38,568
Objects by Dalton Sakthivadivel Devel.

1738
01:26:38,744 --> 01:26:43,028
So for this paper, Ali Yacob

1739
01:26:43,144 --> 01:26:47,724
and our colleague Conor, we met weekly

1740
01:26:47,852 --> 01:26:51,964
for about two months to prepare

1741
01:26:52,092 --> 01:26:54,560
for this discussion,

1742
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:59,396
because this paper,

1743
01:26:59,578 --> 01:27:03,008
and more generally, Dalton et

1744
01:27:03,024 --> 01:27:07,690
al's. Advances in merely 2022,

1745
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:11,876
have transformed the status of active

1746
01:27:11,908 --> 01:27:13,880
inference in the free energy principle.

1747
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:16,104
If you want to learn more about what

1748
01:27:16,142 --> 01:27:19,656
that really means, check out Live Stream

1749
01:27:19,688 --> 01:27:23,016
49. Ali Yakub

1750
01:27:23,048 --> 01:27:26,156
and under put in a ton of work. We

1751
01:27:26,178 --> 01:27:27,756
worked as hard as we could leading up to

1752
01:27:27,778 --> 01:27:32,864
the dot zero, and then Dalton took

1753
01:27:32,902 --> 01:27:35,296
us on a journey in the dot one and the

1754
01:27:35,318 --> 01:27:39,024
dot two. We couldn't have asked for

1755
01:27:39,062 --> 01:27:42,930
a better elucidation or a more

1756
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:45,712
enthralling presentation of Bayesian

1757
01:27:45,776 --> 01:27:51,092
physics. I really mean it. And whether

1758
01:27:51,226 --> 01:27:53,376
you're working in classical

1759
01:27:53,488 --> 01:27:56,020
thermodynamic or quantum mechanics,

1760
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:59,784
or whether you're not familiar with

1761
01:27:59,822 --> 01:28:04,084
those areas, this direction

1762
01:28:04,132 --> 01:28:07,656
of work and specifically the

1763
01:28:07,678 --> 01:28:11,512
presentation and the answers that Dalton

1764
01:28:11,576 --> 01:28:14,044
provides and just the spirit that he

1765
01:28:14,082 --> 01:28:18,300
brought are absolutely memorable.

1766
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:22,240
So I'll just give you a little aside.

1767
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:26,044
This is the only time on any live stream

1768
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:28,976
ever where instead of playing music,

1769
01:28:29,078 --> 01:28:31,920
when I'm doing my workout, my third

1770
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:36,210
listen my third listen of

1771
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:40,324
the dot one of 49 one was while I was

1772
01:28:40,362 --> 01:28:42,630
working out, because it's that good.

1773
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:45,492
And it had to be my third listen,

1774
01:28:45,546 --> 01:28:46,676
because the first two listeners, I was

1775
01:28:46,698 --> 01:28:48,836
just, like, having to pick my job off

1776
01:28:48,858 --> 01:28:50,548
the floor. But by the third time, I

1777
01:28:50,554 --> 01:28:52,808
wanted to listen to it a third time.

1778
01:28:52,974 --> 01:28:54,696
Instead of listening to music, I was

1779
01:28:54,718 --> 01:28:56,984
listening to you guys work through this

1780
01:28:57,022 --> 01:28:59,056
stuff. And I was just like, this path

1781
01:28:59,108 --> 01:29:01,150
integral stuff changes everything.

1782
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,980
Yeah. Just briefly, for the conceptual,

1783
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,752
here are the three phases of Bayesian

1784
01:29:09,816 --> 01:29:12,748
mechanics using a system and a scheme

1785
01:29:12,844 --> 01:29:15,216
that's presented in this research and in

1786
01:29:15,238 --> 01:29:17,564
earlier research by Dalton and Maxwell

1787
01:29:17,612 --> 01:29:21,520
et al. One setting

1788
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:25,360
is where a ball is resting on the ground

1789
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:28,132
and it's not moving. That is kind of

1790
01:29:28,186 --> 01:29:30,704
like a distribution, a belief

1791
01:29:30,752 --> 01:29:32,784
distribution that's getting new input,

1792
01:29:32,832 --> 01:29:34,980
but it's not updating. It's just getting

1793
01:29:35,050 --> 01:29:37,348
the exact information it expects. It's

1794
01:29:37,364 --> 01:29:39,544
not updating, it's not moving. In

1795
01:29:39,582 --> 01:29:42,664
contrast, when new information is

1796
01:29:42,702 --> 01:29:45,208
provided, the prior updates to the

1797
01:29:45,214 --> 01:29:49,048
posterior and it moves to

1798
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:53,012
track the mode of the new optimum.

1799
01:29:53,156 --> 01:29:55,516
So that's like if you had a ball on a

1800
01:29:55,538 --> 01:29:57,068
staircase and you pulled one stair and

1801
01:29:57,074 --> 01:29:58,476
it fell down to the next one, and you

1802
01:29:58,498 --> 01:29:59,756
pulled the next stair and it fell down

1803
01:29:59,778 --> 01:30:03,536
to the next one. Those both

1804
01:30:03,638 --> 01:30:06,690
represent taking densities over states,

1805
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:09,632
like preference as a state,

1806
01:30:09,766 --> 01:30:13,184
observation. As a state. States can

1807
01:30:13,222 --> 01:30:16,452
change through time, but they at any

1808
01:30:16,506 --> 01:30:18,870
given time, are state based,

1809
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,436
in contrast. And that's where we have

1810
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:25,968
the non equilibrium steady state nest

1811
01:30:26,064 --> 01:30:28,616
density. So all the discussions we had

1812
01:30:28,638 --> 01:30:31,016
about non equilibrium thermodynamics and

1813
01:30:31,118 --> 01:30:34,136
non equilibrium steady states, all of

1814
01:30:34,158 --> 01:30:36,344
that nest density discussion is on the

1815
01:30:36,382 --> 01:30:39,944
states. What some of these recent

1816
01:30:39,992 --> 01:30:43,016
developments in path integrals gauge

1817
01:30:43,048 --> 01:30:46,076
theory, caliber theory, maximum cal, as

1818
01:30:46,098 --> 01:30:49,192
well as the dual the discovery

1819
01:30:49,256 --> 01:30:51,628
of Dalton about the duality between the

1820
01:30:51,634 --> 01:30:53,244
constrained maximum entropy principle

1821
01:30:53,292 --> 01:30:55,984
and the free energy principle when we

1822
01:30:56,022 --> 01:30:58,992
calculate densities over paths. There

1823
01:30:59,046 --> 01:31:01,984
does not need to be a ness assumption or

1824
01:31:02,022 --> 01:31:04,820
a discussion of a mode. But you can get

1825
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:07,344
path tracking, path of least action

1826
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:10,516
tracking without appealing to

1827
01:31:10,538 --> 01:31:12,900
this intermediated nest.

1828
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:19,236
It's only been a few months, but there's

1829
01:31:19,268 --> 01:31:22,456
so much more to come here on

1830
01:31:22,478 --> 01:31:24,760
the mathematics and on the applications.

1831
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:28,650
It's incredible. And a year ago,

1832
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,430
we couldn't have said any of this.

1833
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:35,608
So a lot has happened in active

1834
01:31:35,624 --> 01:31:38,956
inference, but in the 49 dot zero,

1835
01:31:39,138 --> 01:31:42,544
you'll see us grappling with

1836
01:31:42,582 --> 01:31:45,644
the eras of active inference

1837
01:31:45,772 --> 01:31:50,012
and FEP and about what phases in epochs.

1838
01:31:50,076 --> 01:31:54,140
And even now we can acknowledge

1839
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:58,192
that we're in a post Dalton era.

1840
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:02,660
Yeah, and it's funny, because before

1841
01:32:02,730 --> 01:32:05,924
hearing this, it almost felt like you

1842
01:32:05,962 --> 01:32:08,776
had to go down the vertical and then

1843
01:32:08,798 --> 01:32:10,648
across the horizontal, and then down the

1844
01:32:10,654 --> 01:32:12,756
vertical and then across the horizontal.

1845
01:32:12,788 --> 01:32:14,676
And then all of a sudden, he introduced

1846
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:18,484
the wheels and the bike went riding

1847
01:32:18,532 --> 01:32:21,870
down the steps. That's how different

1848
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,848
it became. Now, that's still a bumpy

1849
01:32:25,864 --> 01:32:28,684
ride. You have to go quite quickly to

1850
01:32:28,722 --> 01:32:30,990
smooth things out. Right.

1851
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,372
Smoothing. But that's essentially

1852
01:32:35,516 --> 01:32:37,952
how dramatic it was like it was like

1853
01:32:38,006 --> 01:32:39,520
introducing the wheel.

1854
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:42,050
Yeah.

1855
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:45,910
It'S only a wheel. Right.

1856
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,510
Wheels within wheels now.

1857
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:53,188
All right, 50. So in 50,

1858
01:32:53,354 --> 01:32:55,296
the paper being discussed, I didn't

1859
01:32:55,328 --> 01:32:57,876
bring it in, was exteroception as

1860
01:32:57,898 --> 01:33:00,070
modeling, alastasis as control,

1861
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:03,196
with Eli Senate and Jordan Thorough,

1862
01:33:03,248 --> 01:33:05,432
who are here as well as several other

1863
01:33:05,486 --> 01:33:08,116
authors, karen Quigley and Lisa Feldman

1864
01:33:08,148 --> 01:33:10,236
Barrett, maybe some others. So what

1865
01:33:10,258 --> 01:33:13,484
would you and on 50. Well, just that

1866
01:33:13,522 --> 01:33:16,584
again, you would see that interraception

1867
01:33:16,632 --> 01:33:19,676
would be its own field and allostasis as

1868
01:33:19,698 --> 01:33:21,396
being a separate field. And then there's

1869
01:33:21,448 --> 01:33:24,092
this lab somewhere in northeastern

1870
01:33:24,156 --> 01:33:28,880
United States that's trying to DeField

1871
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:33,664
bring things into an opportunity to

1872
01:33:33,782 --> 01:33:36,996
be integrated. And it was fascinating to

1873
01:33:37,018 --> 01:33:40,230
try to see how people address

1874
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:43,684
operationally and formally things that

1875
01:33:43,722 --> 01:33:47,370
seem to be pretty messy and hard to

1876
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:50,552
manage when we're talking about things

1877
01:33:50,606 --> 01:33:54,856
like we don't have necessarily access to

1878
01:33:55,038 --> 01:33:58,820
the information in a mathematical way.

1879
01:33:58,990 --> 01:34:02,988
It's called a feeling. So how do

1880
01:34:02,994 --> 01:34:04,844
we blend those things together? And

1881
01:34:04,882 --> 01:34:08,204
again, I'll be honest, I was the most

1882
01:34:08,242 --> 01:34:11,084
skeptical and became a fanboy after

1883
01:34:11,122 --> 01:34:12,716
having great conversation with Jordan

1884
01:34:12,748 --> 01:34:16,560
and Eli. Yeah, that was

1885
01:34:16,710 --> 01:34:18,880
memorable discussions.

1886
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:23,552
Eli gave a presentation that

1887
01:34:23,606 --> 01:34:25,636
helped us really, like lock in

1888
01:34:25,818 --> 01:34:27,684
conceptually how they were framing it

1889
01:34:27,722 --> 01:34:30,580
and what they did. Some of the

1890
01:34:30,650 --> 01:34:32,916
statistical transformations are

1891
01:34:33,098 --> 01:34:36,776
evergreen in the sense that there was a

1892
01:34:36,798 --> 01:34:40,628
capacity curve, a probability density

1893
01:34:40,724 --> 01:34:43,656
implied by a capacity curve, and then a

1894
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,720
responsiveness that was a log

1895
01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:49,764
probability density. And now whenever

1896
01:34:49,812 --> 01:34:52,636
we see one of these, we see all of them,

1897
01:34:52,818 --> 01:34:54,956
right? Because they're all just

1898
01:34:55,058 --> 01:34:58,092
transformations, either PDF to CDF or

1899
01:34:58,146 --> 01:35:00,588
log probability densities. Check out the

1900
01:35:00,594 --> 01:35:03,376
stream to learn more. But whenever we

1901
01:35:03,398 --> 01:35:05,776
see these, we can kind of see all of

1902
01:35:05,798 --> 01:35:09,984
them. When we see one and see

1903
01:35:10,022 --> 01:35:12,592
one thing, see multiple things, learn

1904
01:35:12,646 --> 01:35:14,790
one thing, learn multiple things.

1905
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:19,636
It was awesome. All right, and the final

1906
01:35:19,738 --> 01:35:23,844
Livestream discussion paper. So this was

1907
01:35:24,042 --> 01:35:26,176
canonical neural networks perform active

1908
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:29,504
inference. 2022 Paper by Takuya IsomerA,

1909
01:35:29,632 --> 01:35:32,892
Hideaki Shimazaki, Andy Clark Friston

1910
01:35:33,056 --> 01:35:36,648
and it

1911
01:35:36,654 --> 01:35:39,436
was a fun and an honor and a learning

1912
01:35:39,538 --> 01:35:42,428
journey for me. I prepared the dot zero

1913
01:35:42,514 --> 01:35:45,868
myself, which hadn't happened for a

1914
01:35:45,874 --> 01:35:49,244
little bit of time by then. This was

1915
01:35:49,282 --> 01:35:53,216
just in November. And then in both the

1916
01:35:53,238 --> 01:35:55,344
dot one and the dot two, it was just

1917
01:35:55,462 --> 01:35:59,680
Takuya and I. And the paper's

1918
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:05,300
implications are so stunning

1919
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:08,176
in light of the prevalence of neural

1920
01:36:08,208 --> 01:36:10,704
networks and artificial intelligence

1921
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:15,216
machine learning. The paper supports

1922
01:36:15,408 --> 01:36:19,492
a claim that was agent within an earlier

1923
01:36:19,556 --> 01:36:21,512
research paper by the authors. But they

1924
01:36:21,566 --> 01:36:24,008
kind of completed the loop in this paper

1925
01:36:24,174 --> 01:36:28,650
to really reinforce it that

1926
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:34,856
as per their figure one, every neural

1927
01:36:34,888 --> 01:36:38,172

1931
01:36:44,694 --> 01:36:48,272
perception, cognition and action can be

1932
01:36:48,326 --> 01:36:51,184
understood using the particular

1933
01:36:51,302 --> 01:36:53,116
partitioning that we use in active

1934
01:36:53,148 --> 01:36:55,890
inference, where the generative process

1935
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:58,436
engages the generative model of an

1936
01:36:58,458 --> 01:37:00,496
agent. Also in terms of perception,

1937
01:37:00,528 --> 01:37:03,270
cognition and action. In fact,

1938
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:07,850
the training by which agents can learn

1939
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:12,264
from their own experiences about what

1940
01:37:12,302 --> 01:37:15,896
to do in the future is also analogous as

1941
01:37:15,918 --> 01:37:17,272
well. And here we see some message

1942
01:37:17,326 --> 01:37:21,464
passing reflecting that the discussion

1943
01:37:21,592 --> 01:37:25,676
was technical, yet asked

1944
01:37:25,858 --> 01:37:31,240
basic questions, and everybody

1945
01:37:31,410 --> 01:37:34,156
who works with neural networks or knows

1946
01:37:34,188 --> 01:37:37,216
somebody who does, I'd recommend that

1947
01:37:37,238 --> 01:37:40,496
they check out this discussion and

1948
01:37:40,518 --> 01:37:44,080
paper because it was a perfect example

1949
01:37:44,230 --> 01:37:48,180
of making the bridge.

1950
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,764
And here we see the min two of min two

1951
01:37:51,802 --> 01:37:54,228
s. We see the partition between a

1952
01:37:54,234 --> 01:37:55,264
generative model and a generative

1953
01:37:55,312 --> 01:37:59,272
process and then two views on that being

1954
01:37:59,326 --> 01:38:02,088
juxtaposed. And so now when we see a

1955
01:38:02,094 --> 01:38:03,416
neural network, we can think that

1956
01:38:03,438 --> 01:38:05,368
there's a generative model that might

1957
01:38:05,454 --> 01:38:07,636
reflect the semantics of what the neural

1958
01:38:07,668 --> 01:38:10,668
network does, even if the structure of

1959
01:38:10,674 --> 01:38:13,596
the neural network is arcane. And in

1960
01:38:13,618 --> 01:38:15,384
contrast, when we see a generative

1961
01:38:15,432 --> 01:38:18,396
models, we can imagine that there are

1962
01:38:18,418 --> 01:38:21,260
some neural network architectures with

1963
01:38:21,330 --> 01:38:24,512
arcane topologies that implement that

1964
01:38:24,566 --> 01:38:27,792
generative model. And so as we build

1965
01:38:27,846 --> 01:38:30,976
these rigorous Bridges, we see more and

1966
01:38:30,998 --> 01:38:34,252
more with the same visual input.

1967
01:38:34,396 --> 01:38:37,728
And so that is really advancing the

1968
01:38:37,734 --> 01:38:39,776
field. And also, again, could not have

1969
01:38:39,798 --> 01:38:42,068
been Seth a year ago. Is it building a

1970
01:38:42,074 --> 01:38:44,436
bridge to everywhere or is it moving in

1971
01:38:44,458 --> 01:38:48,276
that direction? Let's go

1972
01:38:48,298 --> 01:38:50,970
to Reflections. Okay.

1973
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:54,708
If we built Bridges to everywhere, it's

1974
01:38:54,724 --> 01:38:56,484
like paved paradise. Put up a parking

1975
01:38:56,532 --> 01:38:58,776
lot. We wanted people to be able to

1976
01:38:58,798 --> 01:39:00,696
drive all over paradise and park

1977
01:39:00,728 --> 01:39:03,068
wherever they wanted. So we paved it.

1978
01:39:03,074 --> 01:39:05,244
We put up a parking lot. I don't think

1979
01:39:05,282 --> 01:39:09,084
that's what's happening. What is

1980
01:39:09,122 --> 01:39:09,710
happening?

1981
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:15,230
Well,

1982
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:21,650
again, I get the ambition of

1983
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:26,384
trying to take some statistical

1984
01:39:26,432 --> 01:39:31,044
models and see where they might be

1985
01:39:31,082 --> 01:39:33,556
inserted in things that are going out

1986
01:39:33,578 --> 01:39:35,300
and doing the exploration.

1987
01:39:36,780 --> 01:39:45,832
See that my

1988
01:39:45,886 --> 01:39:49,992
Continuum attention active inference lab

1989
01:39:50,136 --> 01:39:54,252
is because I believe it is a

1990
01:39:54,306 --> 01:39:58,828
way when you're ready, it is a way of

1991
01:39:58,994 --> 01:40:01,484
generating way more insight, way more,

1992
01:40:01,522 --> 01:40:04,816
AHA moments than what I

1993
01:40:04,838 --> 01:40:08,364
think is a kind of unidirectional

1994
01:40:08,412 --> 01:40:12,272
approach or a hierarchical approach that

1995
01:40:12,326 --> 01:40:15,776
says, amass all

1996
01:40:15,798 --> 01:40:18,756
this information, put it, synopsize it

1997
01:40:18,778 --> 01:40:20,832
into your own, synthesize it, synopsize

1998
01:40:20,896 --> 01:40:24,900
it and feed it back to a board

1999
01:40:24,970 --> 01:40:27,336
or a review committee or something like

2000
01:40:27,358 --> 01:40:29,576
that. I understand how that works and

2001
01:40:29,598 --> 01:40:34,104
why that serves a certain agenda or

2002
01:40:34,302 --> 01:40:36,516
intent. I think what active inference

2003
01:40:36,548 --> 01:40:40,732
does is it opens things up so that you

2004
01:40:40,786 --> 01:40:44,588
do not have a ladder to climb or

2005
01:40:44,674 --> 01:40:47,256
at least they haven't invented a ladder

2006
01:40:47,288 --> 01:40:50,124
to everywhere. I think that's what it

2007
01:40:50,162 --> 01:40:52,064
does is it creates options and

2008
01:40:52,102 --> 01:40:55,696
possibilities and sees things as

2009
01:40:55,878 --> 01:40:59,104
it could be this, it could be that. So

2010
01:40:59,142 --> 01:41:01,280
from a humanist standpoint,

2011
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:06,576
it just makes available, provides

2012
01:41:06,608 --> 01:41:09,344
affordances that's kind of at the Jorge

2013
01:41:09,392 --> 01:41:11,670
of the work that's being done.

2014
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:18,696
It enables the use of things like

2015
01:41:18,718 --> 01:41:21,796
counterfactuals, why that matters,

2016
01:41:21,988 --> 01:41:24,904
why it's just as important to ask what

2017
01:41:24,942 --> 01:41:26,970
if as it is to ask what is.

2018
01:41:27,740 --> 01:41:30,264
These are all things that I think don't

2019
01:41:30,312 --> 01:41:33,304
even have to be stuck in narrative

2020
01:41:33,352 --> 01:41:36,780
spaces. I think it's what you now

2021
01:41:36,850 --> 01:41:40,460
can choose to try

2022
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:43,504
and make some sense out of. And I think

2023
01:41:43,542 --> 01:41:46,992
a lot of times in order for people to

2024
01:41:47,046 --> 01:41:49,936
become specialists and experts at

2025
01:41:49,958 --> 01:41:52,240
something they have to really focus

2026
01:41:52,310 --> 01:41:54,308
their attention on something. But I

2027
01:41:54,314 --> 01:41:58,756
think what active inference says is the

2028
01:41:58,778 --> 01:42:02,256
more times you vary your attention

2029
01:42:02,448 --> 01:42:05,492
and change your attentional space, I e.

2030
01:42:05,626 --> 01:42:09,256
Make yourself available to ideas and

2031
01:42:09,358 --> 01:42:11,816
phenomena that you otherwise would

2032
01:42:11,838 --> 01:42:15,576
ignore because you think it

2033
01:42:15,598 --> 01:42:17,208
doesn't really matter in this particular

2034
01:42:17,294 --> 01:42:20,676
moment, the more AHAs, the more insights

2035
01:42:20,708 --> 01:42:24,108
you yourself gain. So I

2036
01:42:24,114 --> 01:42:25,532
don't know that we're paving over

2037
01:42:25,586 --> 01:42:26,856
anything. I don't think that the bridge

2038
01:42:26,888 --> 01:42:29,356
has to be something positive and

2039
01:42:29,378 --> 01:42:33,052
material. In fact, as we talked about

2040
01:42:33,106 --> 01:42:37,468
at that very second

2041
01:42:37,554 --> 01:42:41,196
set of live streams this year, is the

2042
01:42:41,218 --> 01:42:44,676
hidden states hidden because a

2043
01:42:44,858 --> 01:42:47,088
shroud something that's material,

2044
01:42:47,264 --> 01:42:49,236
something that blinds us to the

2045
01:42:49,258 --> 01:42:51,540
situation? Or is it simply something

2046
01:42:51,690 --> 01:42:54,784
that we just haven't given our attention

2047
01:42:54,832 --> 01:42:56,070
to over yet?

2048
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:02,312
Do I need to build a bridge across

2049
01:43:02,366 --> 01:43:05,336
the Grand Canyon, or is seeing across it

2050
01:43:05,358 --> 01:43:08,584
to the other side enough? That's what

2051
01:43:08,622 --> 01:43:10,940
active inference asks us to explore.

2052
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,004
I think if people want to come and find

2053
01:43:15,202 --> 01:43:17,244
an opportunity to socialize with other

2054
01:43:17,282 --> 01:43:19,816
people around references,

2055
01:43:20,008 --> 01:43:22,444
there's work to do that to do with that

2056
01:43:22,482 --> 01:43:24,456
around stuff that Bijan Chaos written

2057
01:43:24,488 --> 01:43:26,108
about and stuff that Karl has written

2058
01:43:26,124 --> 01:43:27,724
about. And those are fantastic

2059
01:43:27,772 --> 01:43:29,856
exercises, but I think there's more to

2060
01:43:29,878 --> 01:43:31,932
it than that. And I think the everywhere

2061
01:43:31,996 --> 01:43:36,032
part is something that, again, it gets

2062
01:43:36,086 --> 01:43:38,596
reinforced when you're putting on a live

2063
01:43:38,618 --> 01:43:40,244
stream that you put in hours and hours

2064
01:43:40,282 --> 01:43:42,276
and hours of preparation on and you

2065
01:43:42,298 --> 01:43:45,220
don't know whether or not the person who

2066
01:43:45,290 --> 01:43:47,284
actually was the author of the work is

2067
01:43:47,322 --> 01:43:48,456
going to be able to show up or not?

2068
01:43:48,478 --> 01:43:50,616
Because these are busy people and then

2069
01:43:50,638 --> 01:43:53,316
they do. That's an active inference

2070
01:43:53,348 --> 01:43:56,810
moment. That's a kind of a dedication to

2071
01:43:57,260 --> 01:43:59,112
a philosophy. And I think that's where

2072
01:43:59,166 --> 01:44:01,964
Karl said there's a lot of stuff that

2073
01:44:02,002 --> 01:44:03,596
still has to be worked out by the

2074
01:44:03,618 --> 01:44:06,892
philosophers. Well, I continue along

2075
01:44:06,946 --> 01:44:09,404
with Thomas and Dalton to try to work

2076
01:44:09,442 --> 01:44:11,036
out what the formalisms and the

2077
01:44:11,058 --> 01:44:13,692
operations are. So I think and eye on

2078
01:44:13,746 --> 01:44:16,528
each is kind of where we are today.

2079
01:44:16,694 --> 01:44:19,456
There's probably less room for people to

2080
01:44:19,478 --> 01:44:22,336
say, no, it's one or the other. I think

2081
01:44:22,358 --> 01:44:24,784
there's a lot more room to say, well,

2082
01:44:24,822 --> 01:44:26,212
if we put this and this and this

2083
01:44:26,266 --> 01:44:28,896
together, I wonder what kind of smoothie

2084
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:30,580
that derives.

2085
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:34,788
That's my sense of where we are at the

2086
01:44:34,794 --> 01:44:36,310
start of 2023.

2087
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:41,992
Yes, it was

2088
01:44:42,046 --> 01:44:46,170
like, in the beginning of the year.

2089
01:44:46,540 --> 01:44:50,376
If only we could just pin it down.

2090
01:44:50,558 --> 01:44:53,452
Is active inference realist, or is

2091
01:44:53,506 --> 01:44:56,156
active inference this way? If we could

2092
01:44:56,178 --> 01:45:00,284
just get it on the table on

2093
01:45:00,322 --> 01:45:04,124
procrusty's bed, then I

2094
01:45:04,162 --> 01:45:05,948
would be able to approach it. I'm too

2095
01:45:05,954 --> 01:45:07,436
busy right now. I'm too overwhelmed

2096
01:45:07,468 --> 01:45:09,184
right now. It's too complex right now.

2097
01:45:09,222 --> 01:45:10,588
It's too ambiguous right now. It's

2098
01:45:10,604 --> 01:45:12,576
changing too fast right now. If you

2099
01:45:12,598 --> 01:45:14,292
could just stabilize it in this one

2100
01:45:14,346 --> 01:45:17,728
dimension, then I'll meet you, and I'll

2101
01:45:17,744 --> 01:45:21,092
be ready to talk and out of that

2102
01:45:21,226 --> 01:45:24,820
environment, the doorway was

2103
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:28,280
dialogue and getting different

2104
01:45:28,350 --> 01:45:31,160
perspectives together beginner

2105
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:36,456
intermediate and beyond. Today it

2106
01:45:36,478 --> 01:45:40,008
is becoming a growing ecosystem

2107
01:45:40,184 --> 01:45:42,956
of education, research, applications and

2108
01:45:42,978 --> 01:45:46,748
service where it's not just that there

2109
01:45:46,834 --> 01:45:49,580
can be the coexistence of different

2110
01:45:49,650 --> 01:45:52,160
perspectives, it's that there are,

2111
01:45:52,230 --> 01:45:55,410
there must be. And we love that.

2112
01:45:57,300 --> 01:46:00,160
It seems it seems bit counterintuitive.

2113
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:03,744
But if there is a nature part

2114
01:46:03,782 --> 01:46:06,852
to this, one of the things we might

2115
01:46:06,906 --> 01:46:09,716
discover at the end of 2023 that are

2116
01:46:09,818 --> 01:46:13,172
that there's more pockets of feral and

2117
01:46:13,226 --> 01:46:17,256
wild behavior and activity as

2118
01:46:17,278 --> 01:46:19,880
opposed to less. That the more times

2119
01:46:19,950 --> 01:46:22,164
people come and say, is there a packaged

2120
01:46:22,212 --> 01:46:24,164
version? Is there a Disneyland version

2121
01:46:24,212 --> 01:46:26,724
of this that I can use as my entry

2122
01:46:26,772 --> 01:46:30,510
point? Perhaps what they'll discover is

2123
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:36,236
there's an opportunity when you hit

2124
01:46:36,258 --> 01:46:38,568
your ball out of bounds in Costa Rica,

2125
01:46:38,584 --> 01:46:41,644
there's a sign that says do not find

2126
01:46:41,682 --> 01:46:45,160
your ball. There are scorpions,

2127
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:47,024
there are snakes, and there are

2128
01:46:47,062 --> 01:46:49,248
crocodiles. Crocodiles don't just

2129
01:46:49,414 --> 01:46:52,444
inhabit the water areas, they literally

2130
01:46:52,572 --> 01:46:54,244
hang out in the forest. And so you

2131
01:46:54,282 --> 01:46:57,808
respect that, right? Unless you're

2132
01:46:57,824 --> 01:47:00,816
going to properly protect your nine iron

2133
01:47:00,848 --> 01:47:03,910
ain't going to save you is my point.

2134
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,996
But there's a piece of this that's

2135
01:47:09,028 --> 01:47:11,608
highly groomed, highly formalized. And I

2136
01:47:11,614 --> 01:47:14,040
think there's also a piece of this that

2137
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:17,480
from a behavioral active standpoint,

2138
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:21,564
we might find a year from now is a lot

2139
01:47:21,602 --> 01:47:29,292
more enabling, is a lot more feral who

2140
01:47:29,346 --> 01:47:33,240
wants to go into those marginal areas

2141
01:47:33,320 --> 01:47:35,808
and really poke around a little bit.

2142
01:47:35,974 --> 01:47:38,384
And I think again, what people might

2143
01:47:38,422 --> 01:47:40,208
find is that active inference isn't a

2144
01:47:40,214 --> 01:47:43,596
shield, but it is an anchor. It provides

2145
01:47:43,628 --> 01:47:45,632
the organizational, structural and

2146
01:47:45,686 --> 01:47:48,964
contentrelated stabilities that

2147
01:47:49,002 --> 01:47:51,076
people can anchor to so that they can

2148
01:47:51,098 --> 01:47:54,640
then go out and play with those edges

2149
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:58,216
or the non edges. They can function in

2150
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:00,708
ways that they probably didn't imagine

2151
01:48:00,804 --> 01:48:03,764
if they believed that active inference

2152
01:48:03,812 --> 01:48:06,570
was a ladder to something specific.

2153
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:12,236
So again, there's a creative side of

2154
01:48:12,258 --> 01:48:15,470
this that I think a year from now.

2155
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,188
Again, I know that there's a bunch of

2156
01:48:18,194 --> 01:48:20,252
people in business that want to do

2157
01:48:20,306 --> 01:48:21,948
capture work around this and there's a

2158
01:48:21,954 --> 01:48:23,184
bunch of scientists that want to get

2159
01:48:23,222 --> 01:48:25,696
confirmation and I get that. I get what

2160
01:48:25,718 --> 01:48:28,930
their goals are and I respect them.

2161
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:31,212
But I also think there's a connectivity

2162
01:48:31,276 --> 01:48:33,880
piece to this that's just percolating

2163
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:36,288
below the surface and that when it's

2164
01:48:36,464 --> 01:48:38,470
given a chance to run its course,

2165
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:43,524
it could be amazing in terms of what

2166
01:48:43,562 --> 01:48:44,820
people generate.

2167
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:50,616
It made me think a shield is not a

2168
01:48:50,638 --> 01:48:54,056
sarcophagus. An anchor is not a

2169
01:48:54,078 --> 01:48:57,160
pillar driven into the ocean floor.

2170
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:02,364
Even something that is stabilizing and

2171
01:49:02,402 --> 01:49:06,556
defensive must have a

2172
01:49:06,578 --> 01:49:10,220
loose tethering and an optimal grasp.

2173
01:49:11,380 --> 01:49:15,360
And if it's better to be stabilized,

2174
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:19,136
why not just put the pillar down? Like

2175
01:49:19,238 --> 01:49:23,410
that is one direction of thought and

2176
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:27,988
it may be valid locally or at a

2177
01:49:27,994 --> 01:49:31,252
meso scale situationally. We're not

2178
01:49:31,306 --> 01:49:32,996
looking to resolve these questions in

2179
01:49:33,018 --> 01:49:35,892
the abstract. There may be a case where

2180
01:49:35,946 --> 01:49:37,316
you do want to get inside the iron

2181
01:49:37,348 --> 01:49:40,840
sarcophagus and hide. But when

2182
01:49:40,910 --> 01:49:45,592
we are out there figuring and

2183
01:49:45,646 --> 01:49:49,436
balancing that with

2184
01:49:49,538 --> 01:49:54,110
figuring it out, we need to also

2185
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:58,316
see those two in conversation or

2186
01:49:58,418 --> 01:50:02,304
in dialectic. So it's not like we can

2187
01:50:02,342 --> 01:50:05,216
just figure it out such that we're going

2188
01:50:05,238 --> 01:50:08,850
to derisk and achieve out there.

2189
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:14,630
It's not the work itself. It isn't even

2190
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,108
interestingly enough the exact

2191
01:50:17,194 --> 01:50:19,396
preparation for the work itself out

2192
01:50:19,418 --> 01:50:23,270
there, but also if we're only out there,

2193
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:28,052
so much happens that we lose valuable

2194
01:50:28,116 --> 01:50:29,976
opportunities for preflection and

2195
01:50:29,998 --> 01:50:32,984
function, and we lose those

2196
01:50:33,022 --> 01:50:35,304
opportunities to figure things out while

2197
01:50:35,422 --> 01:50:39,164
the iron is hot. And so we

2198
01:50:39,202 --> 01:50:41,804
grow and we act infer and we serve less

2199
01:50:41,842 --> 01:50:45,628
than we could, which again, may not be a

2200
01:50:45,634 --> 01:50:48,840
bad thing, and maybe no lives are lost

2201
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:52,832
for it. But how

2202
01:50:52,886 --> 01:50:56,128
to read and speak

2203
01:50:56,214 --> 01:50:59,984
between the lines and make sure that the

2204
01:51:00,022 --> 01:51:04,000
Active Inference Institute is accessible

2205
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:07,920
to all language and mathematical

2206
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,396
backgrounds. As our usage of

2207
01:51:11,418 --> 01:51:14,196
the active inference ontology and the

2208
01:51:14,218 --> 01:51:15,904
formalisms becomes increasingly

2209
01:51:15,952 --> 01:51:20,056
sophisticated, as demands from

2210
01:51:20,158 --> 01:51:23,304
industry, from professionalized research

2211
01:51:23,502 --> 01:51:25,850
and all of these other sectors become

2212
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:30,524
increasingly intense as well, how will

2213
01:51:30,562 --> 01:51:33,964
we be able to provide services

2214
01:51:34,082 --> 01:51:39,900
to our community and niche that neither

2215
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:44,320
exactly square with

2216
01:51:44,390 --> 01:51:47,296
what their priors are? Because if it

2217
01:51:47,318 --> 01:51:49,330
did, they could have done it themselves.

2218
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:53,040
Nor do we want to come from a different

2219
01:51:53,190 --> 01:51:56,916
wavelength or planet where the

2220
01:51:57,018 --> 01:52:01,488
material are failing

2221
01:52:01,504 --> 01:52:03,444
to make impact because they're not

2222
01:52:03,562 --> 01:52:05,860
accessible, applicable and rigorous.

2223
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:08,744
Here's an interesting thing to think

2224
01:52:08,782 --> 01:52:11,220
about as one of the people who spent

2225
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:15,610
countless hours growing this idea.

2226
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:19,588
I don't think back in January of this

2227
01:52:19,614 --> 01:52:22,316
year you could have taken the words from

2228
01:52:22,338 --> 01:52:23,900
Sajid, where he was talking about

2229
01:52:23,970 --> 01:52:26,364
partial encapsulation and envisioned a

2230
01:52:26,402 --> 01:52:29,996
direct application to the idea that the

2231
01:52:30,018 --> 01:52:32,352
active inference lab had to be only

2232
01:52:32,406 --> 01:52:34,528
partially encapsulated in order for it

2233
01:52:34,534 --> 01:52:37,244
to morph into the active inference

2234
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:40,864
institute. These are the

2235
01:52:40,902 --> 01:52:43,184
things that we, upon reflection, can

2236
01:52:43,222 --> 01:52:46,192
look back and go, well, we were talking

2237
01:52:46,246 --> 01:52:48,596
about it as an idea, but here's an

2238
01:52:48,618 --> 01:52:50,224
example of where it actually became

2239
01:52:50,272 --> 01:52:54,692
true. And I didn't know at the time that

2240
01:52:54,826 --> 01:52:56,388
the active inference lab was going to

2241
01:52:56,394 --> 01:52:58,584
turn into the institute. That's what

2242
01:52:58,622 --> 01:53:00,890
active coherence allows for.

2243
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:03,576
That's what's really fascinating. And

2244
01:53:03,598 --> 01:53:06,296
again, I'll say this. If you really want

2245
01:53:06,318 --> 01:53:08,456
to learn, go through an exercise like

2246
01:53:08,478 --> 01:53:10,040
you and I just went through today,

2247
01:53:10,190 --> 01:53:12,076
because it gives you the opportunity to

2248
01:53:12,098 --> 01:53:14,124
say, oh, by the way, if you want some

2249
01:53:14,162 --> 01:53:18,280
real evidence without pre staging

2250
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:20,556
the idea that I want to prove this. I

2251
01:53:20,578 --> 01:53:22,364
want to prove that there's a parcel

2252
01:53:22,412 --> 01:53:25,090
encapsulation, just live it out,

2253
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:29,056
migrate through it, go through that

2254
01:53:29,078 --> 01:53:31,488
space time, come out the other side,

2255
01:53:31,574 --> 01:53:34,044
look back on it and go, wow. I guess

2256
01:53:34,102 --> 01:53:38,464
what we were talking about eleven

2257
01:53:38,512 --> 01:53:42,436
months and 26 days ago, in fact,

2258
01:53:42,538 --> 01:53:45,616
could turn out to be pretty prescient,

2259
01:53:45,808 --> 01:53:47,992
because there's no way we could become

2260
01:53:48,046 --> 01:53:50,408
an institute today if we didn't leave a

2261
01:53:50,414 --> 01:53:53,268
gap open for that possibility. So it's

2262
01:53:53,284 --> 01:53:56,616
just really interesting. Again, if you

2263
01:53:56,638 --> 01:54:00,824
want active inference to be a repeat

2264
01:54:00,872 --> 01:54:03,352
of what you have already been habituated

2265
01:54:03,416 --> 01:54:07,084
to, you can make it that, or you can

2266
01:54:07,122 --> 01:54:09,324
stick around and kind of go only

2267
01:54:09,362 --> 01:54:12,416
mackerel. It wasn't just in theory. In

2268
01:54:12,438 --> 01:54:15,696
fact, it materialized in

2269
01:54:15,718 --> 01:54:18,544
the ways that the theory said it could,

2270
01:54:18,662 --> 01:54:22,416
not would. And that's the bridge to

2271
01:54:22,438 --> 01:54:23,200
everywhere.

2272
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:30,596
Well, we put up our

2273
01:54:30,618 --> 01:54:34,020
canonical final slide. Thank you, Dean,

2274
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:37,096
for this, Dean, and for all of the

2275
01:54:37,118 --> 01:54:40,090
others and everyone who came on.

2276
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:43,050
If you're listening this far,

2277
01:54:43,980 --> 01:54:46,920
thank you for your regime of attention.

2278
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:51,660
We are looking to make 2023 and

2279
01:54:51,730 --> 01:54:55,550
years beyond it better.

2280
01:54:56,160 --> 01:54:59,464
And this was a great year. So it's

2281
01:54:59,512 --> 01:55:03,470
no slight on where we've been. It's just

2282
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:06,700
a spiral of developments.

2283
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:10,832
Any dimension or divergence from your

2284
01:55:10,886 --> 01:55:14,892
highest preference is either feedback

2285
01:55:14,956 --> 01:55:18,084
you can provide the institute or

2286
01:55:18,282 --> 01:55:20,644
engagement that you can yourself make

2287
01:55:20,682 --> 01:55:22,644
happen. You want to see a certain kind

2288
01:55:22,682 --> 01:55:24,596
of stream happen. You want to see

2289
01:55:24,618 --> 01:55:26,848
another language other than English.

2290
01:55:27,024 --> 01:55:28,404
You want to see a different kind of

2291
01:55:28,442 --> 01:55:30,660
educational material become accessible,

2292
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:34,736
either provided as feedback, or let's

2293
01:55:34,768 --> 01:55:36,516
figure out how to make it happen with

2294
01:55:36,538 --> 01:55:39,964
your engagement. We'll go out there

2295
01:55:40,002 --> 01:55:40,780
anytime.

2296
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:46,430
Wow. Well,

2297
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:50,444
no word can close the year,

2298
01:55:50,562 --> 01:55:53,516
so we'll just leave it at that. Thank

2299
01:55:53,538 --> 01:55:54,936
you, Dean. Thank you. All right. Till

2300
01:55:54,968 --> 01:55:56,972
next time, my friend. Till next time.

2301
01:55:57,026 --> 01:55:59,612
Act! Infer! Serve! All right.
