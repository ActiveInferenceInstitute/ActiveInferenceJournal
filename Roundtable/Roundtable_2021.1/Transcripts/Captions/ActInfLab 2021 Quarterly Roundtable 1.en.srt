00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,639
hello

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,719
and welcome everyone to the active

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,679
inference lab

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,920
this is a special active inference live

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,200
stream it is march

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,800
2nd 2021 and this is our first quarterly

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,439
roundtable

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,279
for the active inference lap so this

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,039
should be a pretty fun

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,000
and unique stream welcome to the active

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,359
inference lab everyone

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,840
we're a participatory online lab that is

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,560
communicating

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,558
learning and practicing applied active

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,559
inference you can find us

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,600
on our website twitter through email our

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,960
youtube channel

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,160
our keybase or our discord teams which

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,960
we're going to go into

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,480
later in the stream so if you're curious

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,920
about what each of these different

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,280
platforms are for we're going to get

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,079
there

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,160
this is a recorded and an archived live

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,760
stream so please provide us with

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,840
feedback so that we can improve on our

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,480
work all backgrounds and perspectives

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,800
are welcome here and we will

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,199
use video etiquette netiquette for live

30
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,719
streams including muting

31
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,519
and using respectful speech behavior

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,479
let's just take

33
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,760
a step back and look at where we're at

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,479
on our calendar it's march 2nd and here

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,840
we are with our first quarterly

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,560
roundtable

37
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,200
it's been a pretty interesting year with

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,080
two months

39
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,080
of weekly discussions and a couple other

40
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,759
things we'll go into

41
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,040
but to keep the um papers

42
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,040
two per month and then to keep it nice

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,119
and not have dot one and dot two that

44
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,479
break across months

45
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,720
we inserted some quarterly round tables

46
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,720
and so here we are at the first one

47
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,920
the goals of the quarterly round table

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
at least for today are first to

49
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,119
summarize the results

50
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,320
of our quarterly activity secondly

51
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,200
to show for a broad audience what we're

52
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,079
working on and

53
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,960
doing and learning and then third

54
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,600
continue

55
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,680
and amplify our call for participation

56
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,759
through deep time so if you're watching

57
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,280
live that's awesome we look forward to

58
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,960
your comments and questions in the live

59
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,600
chat

60
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,680
if you're watching it in replay it's not

61
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,200
too late to get involved because we'll

62
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,000
still be around

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,840
and so if you're still interested then

64
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,600
we'll still be there

65
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,160
the sections of today we're gonna go

66
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,639
around

67
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,120
and have introductions then we're gonna

68
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
take a strategic perspective on what the

69
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,879
active inference lab

70
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,319
is and give a little narrative

71
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,680
information for those who might be

72
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,720
curious

73
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,480
then we're going to go into updates from

74
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,560
each of our three organizational units

75
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,280
which are

76
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,319
edu dot coms and dot tools and then

77
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,760
in future we'll just recap some ideas on

78
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,640
next steps and on the needs for each of

79
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,560
the main units of the lap

80
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,640
so without further ado we are on the

81
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,040
introduction and the warm-ups

82
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,040
we'll just go around and introduce

83
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,879
ourselves and we'll use our

84
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,440
regular um approach which is just first

85
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,239
we'll just

86
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,440
um say hello however we want to um give

87
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,560
information about herself

88
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,000
and then pass it to somebody who hasn't

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,760
spoken yet and then after everybody has

90
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,959
introduced himself

91
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,519
we'll um using the raise hand feature in

92
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,239
jitsi

93
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,400
will go through some of these warm-up

94
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,080
questions and it will be awesome to hear

95
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,800

101
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,840
and i'm just looking forward to this

102
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,440

we will try to join approach of

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,080
active inference framework and systems

120
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,239
engineering framework

121
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,920

information risk research initiative at

125
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,560
the university of washington

126
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,680
applied physics lab we're using active

127
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,759
inference concepts and trying to learn

128
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,000
active inference concepts to use in our

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,919
work on information

130
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,720
risk mitigation structures i'll pass it

131
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,759
to stephen thank you

132
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,880
hello i'm stephen i'm based in toronto

133
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,840
i'm doing a practice based phd through

134
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,080
canterbury christchurch university

135
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,000
which is sort of morphed more into a

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
methodological

137
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,720
phd as i'm exploring spatial approaches

138
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,880
to sense making and how that can help

139
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,680
theater for development disability arts

140
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,720
and

141
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,160
sort of multi-scale community

142
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,800
development and active inference

143
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,000
is actually a really powerful way to do

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,400
that

145
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,320
but this lab is really helping because

146
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,600
it's a very

147
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,560
new and complex area so i'm very

148
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,600
grateful for

149
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,759
the way that it's helping to really get

150
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,400
into the weeds as we say

151
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:25,840
and i will pass this over to evan

152
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,560
hello this is

153
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,160
i'm in russia moscow and i

154
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,280
i happy to be here i'm glad to that

155
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,479
we have the first round table and look

156
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,880
forward to

157
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,800
repeat again what we have done

158
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,479
last year cool

159
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,720
um fun stuff i i like everyone has

160
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,080
different context

161
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,000
some of us are on a little snow walk

162
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,240
others of us are in our cubicle

163
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,319
so we can kind of go through some of

164
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,919
these warm-up questions

165
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,319
either the questions being what's an

166
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,639
interesting or memorable experience

167
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,400
that occurred through active inference

168
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,560
lab discorder and then the same question

169
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,759
that we actually ask

170
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,759
in the discussions on the papers which

171
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,960
is what is something

172
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,560
you're wondering about or you'd like to

173
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,360
have resolved reduce your uncertainty on

174
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,759
by the end of today's discussion so

175
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,440
anyone can raise their hand but i'd say

176
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,400
one

177
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,840
really interesting and memorable

178
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,440
experience was

179
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,199
the entire discussion about realism

180
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,720
and instrumentalism which was not

181
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,120
on my radar it wasn't a dialectic or a

182
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,360
dichotomy that i had heard of or been

183
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,120
familiar with despite

184
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,360
learning about science and philosophy

185
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,720
and so for there to be

186
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,319
a sequence of papers that we work

187
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,080
through together including

188
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,880
mel andrews's paper and then following

189
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,280
with

190
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,479
um vanessa and hippolyta's paper for

191
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,680
that sort of arc in the literature

192
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,400
to be influencing our practice as a lab

193
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,720
by

194
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,560
advancing our collective understanding

195
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,479
about how realism and instrumentalism

196
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,599
worked together

197
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,120
and then the way that that discourse was

198
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,440
happening live on streams and

199
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,039
live not on streams and in text-based

200
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,120
discussion was just like very

201
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,720
multi-modal and interesting to see how

202
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
it kind of bends back around to actually

203
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,319
changing our action not just how we

204
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,120
think

205
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,520
alex

206
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,840
uh yeah thanks uh for me most exciting

207
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,639
thing

208
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,800
it's to meet a lot of people who joined

209
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,919
to our communication channels and

210
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,039
follow us and our activities

211
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,479
and starting to participate in different

212
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,000
kinds of work or

213
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,199
what lab is organizing

214
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,680
steven and then anyone else who wants to

215
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,080
say something

216
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,919
yeah i think one of the things that i

217
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,759
found really helpful i've been looking

218
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,400
at the perspectival consciousness paper

219
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,120
a bit before and um definitely had

220
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,520
got a lot out of it but i i had hit a

221
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,120
kind of a wall on my own

222
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,599
and then when we got into that and then

223
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,479
start to also

224
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,039
see that through our next sessions

225
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,720
talking about the big five

226
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,280
psychology traits and sort of oh okay

227
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,639
we're starting to get

228
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,960
some patterns here um so that was really

229
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,400
useful and particularly because i'm

230
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,560
there's been a big struggle with how do

231
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,400
i get into um

232
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,120
work around psychological perspectives

233
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,639
and then suddenly it was realizing well

234
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,200
this whole idea of perspectives itself

235
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,679
is loaded and it's kind of was sitting

236
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,279
there as just a de facto thing that

237
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,559
everything else is going to roll out

238
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,399
from my psychological perspectives but

239
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,200
suddenly

240
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,559
well you need to think about what it

241
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,240
means to have a perspective

242
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,440
or what it means to take a

243
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,080
pre-reflective more phenomenological

244
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,360
stance and

245
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,200
my gut feeling having got into active

246
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
inferences that it could cover with that

247
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,560
and what i'm seeing through the

248
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,440
the different papers in the series and

249
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,640
discussions that actually

250
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,440
is touching on these different areas and

251
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,680
so that's really useful

252
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,399
cool thanks steven and yvonne or scott

253
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:06,880
you'd be

254
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,480
welcome to another i think fun memory or

255
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,880
experience was the model streams

256
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,800
so um having the space to ask questions

257
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,120
and

258
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,320
having the um very generous and

259
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,080
attentive christopher white and ryan

260
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,040
smith spend

261
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,399
four multi-hour sessions really

262
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,040
walking us through this living document

263
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,279
that had like 25 versions and there

264
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,399
really were

265
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,160
implementing feedback and questions that

266
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,600
people were having and not just

267
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,880
oh hey you were incorrect you made a

268
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,120
typo but actually the feedback from the

269
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,160
community was like

270
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,959
how could this be made more accessible

271
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:43,839
and rigorous

272
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,680
and so we were navigating that all

273
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,080
together though it was the two authors

274
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,800
on the paper

275
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,040
the ones who had the most expertise so

276
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,959
that's sort of like a new kind of

277
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,920
research coalition that felt a lot more

278
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,760
participatory and inclusive than

279
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,160
other kinds of research axes that align

280
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,880
and then

281
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,760
dissolve scott

282
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,560
you're mute scott

283
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,040
and then sasha oh sorry i was muted yep

284
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,480
one of the things i found fascinating

285
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,959
i'm new very new to the

286
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,399
area is how um

287
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,040
each new thing that i learned about the

288
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,920
model

289
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,399
and the and the processes are associated

290
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,079
with active inference

291
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,680
reveals a certain new um

292
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,160
perspectives on existing problems and

293
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,200
challenges

294
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,120
and how some of the problems i thought

295
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,399
that were there dissipate

296
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,720
and then there's new sets of challenges

297
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,320
and so it's really been a

298
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,079
um it's it's one of the few times in my

299
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,600
life where i've been going into

300
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,040
something knowing that there was going

301
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,640
to be a paradigmatic shift

302
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,320
and i've been experiencing one it's kind

303
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,720
of and paradigms i always think of as

304
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,440
the sudden

305
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,760
aha this is like a slow-motion

306
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,360
paradigmatic shift because there's a

307
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,880
series of ahas

308
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,000
that happen so it's a fascinating

309
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,720
opportunity for discovering this

310
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,839
entirely new

311
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,320
framework that's out there that really

312
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,079
helps with the work i'm doing

313
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,600
and i think will help with the work that

314
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,200
a lot of folks are doing so that

315
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
it's kind of like discovering a whole

316
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
new world quite frankly a whole new

317
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,399
discipline

318
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,480
that is in the making and that's very

319
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,560
very exciting just watching that be born

320
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,760
it's like watching

321
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,440
i mean it's springtime here the

322
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,959
daffodils are starting to grow and i

323
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,360
it sounds like i'm overreaching here but

324
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,279
it really is like watching a blossoming

325
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:33,760
of a

326
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,160
of a living organism in in watching

327
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,360
these processes

328
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,480
and this community develop so i'm

329
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,680
fascinated by the idea that the

330
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,279
community is developing the ideas and

331
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,320
becoming

332
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,279
that idea at the same time and that's a

333
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,000
that

334
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,279
um intentionality and that awareness is

335
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,800
very different than a lot of other

336
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,320
organizations

337
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,240
that the that they're both experiencing

338
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,760
and exploring the experience

339
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,120
simultaneously

340
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,200
so that intentionality associated with

341
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,600
it i think holds great things for

342
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,160
not just this iteration of the of the

343
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,279
work and the model

344
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,040
but the model generally in terms of a

345
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,040
lot of existing problems out there

346
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,120
thanks cool thanks scott sasha

347
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,040
yeah um similar to a lot of the comments

348
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,079
that people have made

349
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,880
um yeah just been very exciting to see

350
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,040
the new kind of

351
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,079
energy and styles of participation that

352
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,720
people are bringing in because when you

353
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,560
send out the call for participation you

354
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,760
really

355
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,079
don't know what you're going to get and

356
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,000
you can't be too specific about what you

357
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,120
actually uh are asking for and so

358
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,360
that's been very exciting especially in

359
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,160
the comms

360
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,360
team um and thinking about

361
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,639
uh other ways to communicate other than

362
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,040
the

363
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,519
like weekly journal club to have uh

364
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,480
shorter

365
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,680
um perhaps kind of

366
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,160
little bite-sized versions of the talks

367
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,639
um so that's been

368
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,839
uh opening this conversation about

369
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,120
who should be doing the communication

370
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,680
and teaching should we wait to become an

371
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,399
expert

372
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,760
and then share what we've learned or

373
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,560
should be kind of like a foray out into

374
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,360
the unknown

375
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,240
and try to communicate to others what we

376
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
are trying to learn ourselves

377
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,200
and um i think it's the latter as we've

378
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,440
talked about many times in this

379
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,839
space and that's just a very um

380
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,240
exciting and scary place to be in so uh

381
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,399
that that's very uh exciting and

382
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,839
something i'm looking forward to in the

383
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,800
coming year

384
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,160
of what the participants will produce

385
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,480
thanks sasha um stephen and then we'll

386
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,199
move into

387
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,320
strategy yeah i suppose just

388
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,920
one thing that sort of bounces on what

389
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,000
sasha was saying there's um

390
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,120
the the the the foray into participation

391
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,399
and that whole

392
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,519
as a whole thing in itself which is very

393
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,000
vast but has been really interesting

394
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,440
because

395
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,399
it starts to open up opportunities

396
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,480
within some bounds at the moment but

397
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,639
opens up opportunities to really engage

398
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,680
with this knowledge

399
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,199
in ways that maybe you can't do in a

400
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,720
university so i'm actually on the board

401
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,399
of an organization called interchange

402
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,160
for peace which is community-based peace

403
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,880
building

404
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,480
which was set up by ann goodman at the

405
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,079
university of toronto

406
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,480
in the oise and she was working there um

407
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,800
same department where paulo freyr used

408
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,000
to work and

409
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,240
but she set up her own non-profit

410
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,920
charity because there are certain things

411
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,880
even as a

412
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,680
senior lecturer she couldn't do within

413
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,720
that role

414
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,560
there needed to be some way to engage

415
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,959
people that was he was a bit more freer

416
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:47,600
from

417
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,240
the constraints of the role and so she

418
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,600
would work with that organization i

419
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,440
think there's some parallels here in

420
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:53,920
like

421
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,360
by being able to work with active

422
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,600
inference more broadly

423
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,920
across papers across perspectives across

424
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,199
disciplines

425
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,800
may be hard to do that in a in a single

426
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,959
university department so that's kind of

427
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,000
interesting

428
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,440
cool thank you so here we go

429
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,720
into a little bit of recap little lab

430
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,560
101 um alex do you want to just go first

431
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,279
on these next

432
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,800
slides and just let me know if you want

433
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,000
you know if anything else

434
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,399
maybe on the next slides all right

435
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,920
starting on next slide sounds good so

436
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,120
um just as far as lab 101 here

437
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,920
at the end of 2020 uh we started to

438
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,399
apply

439
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,639
onft and active inference which we're

440
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,079
gonna get into more detail

441
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,160
what on ft is in a second but we started

442
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,480
to apply onft and active inference

443
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
to the organization of the active

444
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,000
inference community

445
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,480
as a new kind of participatory open and

446
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,920
accessible lab

447
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,720
and activeinference.org is our reference

448
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,199
point

449
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,519
you'll see a lot more information there

450
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,480
on

451
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,800
various projects and units that we're

452
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,680
involved in

453
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,360
as well as a link for the call to

454
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,199
collaboration and then just

455
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,440
that's how you get started in december

456
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,399
2020

457
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,040
we made the initial invitations for the

458
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,600
lab

459
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,440
we sent out just an open call for

460
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,639
participation

461
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,079
and set out in broad strokes the three

462
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,240
organizational units that we are still

463
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,680
working with

464
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,079
and then at the beginning of january

465
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,279
2021

466
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,519
was when we began official lab

467
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,720
activities

468
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,680
um mostly entailing weekly drop-in

469
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,560
meetings

470
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,920
as well as several other things that

471
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,399
we're going to be talking about so

472
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,560
that's sort of the how we got here but

473
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,880
there's also more to say on that

474
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,079
so alex on the strategy side

475
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,199
just pick up with our paper and let's go

476
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,959
from there

477
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,560
hey blue okay thanks

478
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,759
yeah as you mentioned uh we

479
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,920
started to apply onft

480
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,079
framework as we proposed in our initial

481
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,000
paper what was

482
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,119
prepared in the last year uh

483
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,280
where we tried uh to find a way to

484
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,799
find some kind of object

485
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,160
in reality what will help us to organize

486
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,280
work of our team and abroad the

487
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,720
community

488
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,840
in a way of understanding of

489
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,000
new ways of remote and online team

490
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
working

491
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,240
we believe that reality is changed

492
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,679
already and for now we consider

493
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,880
any team as online team and a

494
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,919
new type of

495
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,240
and new new types of behavior of

496
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,640
team members of where communication

497
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,840
styles should be

498
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,760
organized in some way to be most

499
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,480
efficient in this new reality

500
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,559
and in accordance to active inference

501
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,080
and systems engineering approaches we

502
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,960
find this object as ontologies

503
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,240
narratives formal documents and tools

504
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,280
which could be kind of informational

505
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,559
niche

506
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,600
for online team which

507
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,840
can structure and organize

508
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,440
way of doing things in the team

509
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,799
cool thanks for the summary first author

510
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,840
alex

511
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,720
and onft was an acronym and sort of a

512
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,080
thought pattern that we

513
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,240
introduced in this paper just as an

514
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,080
emergent combination of all the

515
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,840
collaborators working together

516
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,600
and so for those who might not be

517
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,919
familiar with each of the terms ontology

518
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,120
is just our structure

519
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,200
of knowing things and describing things

520
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,559
we're going to go into more detail

521
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,080
later today narratives are another

522
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,840
broad topic and our first active

523
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,280
inference live stream was on active

524
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,640
inference and narratives it's really

525
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,919
what drives us

526
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,840
is this narrative level of understanding

527
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,200
and communication

528
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,360
formal documents are referring to it

529
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,640
could be a cloud

530
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,400
document or a spreadsheet but some

531
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,919
document where someone says yep here's

532
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:16,799
the link

533
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,559
make your changes here fill out this

534
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,480
form that's a formal document

535
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,120
and then tools broadly are the software

536
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,720
and the hardware and the wet wear

537
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
that we use to get it done and there's

538
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,559
some nuance to introduce with instrument

539
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,440
and tool

540
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,480
again this is the top level onft

541
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,720
helps us remember that we're doing

542
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,520
human-centric

543
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,720
systems design and that entails making o

544
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,039
and

545
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,840
f and t work if you have a group and o

546
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,760
and f work and they don't have the tools

547
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,200
there's nothing to do if they have nft

548
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,600
uh not that nft but narratives formal

549
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,520
documents and tools but no ontology for

550
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,600
sharing their communication again it

551
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,120
won't work so we need all of these

552
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,320
dimensions to be

553
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,679
participatory and deep and um

554
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,720
this paper was written with alex as the

555
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,320
first author yvonne on

556
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,600
here sasha alexandra here uh

557
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,840
myself and then rj who is not on the

558
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,960
call but um

559
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,240
is also around so this was really fun

560
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,080
because we just put it up as a preprint

561
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
and just started going for our next step

562
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,520
into the organization

563
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,240
so we combined complexity systems

564
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,080
engineering and active inference

565
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,120
with this goal directedness where did

566
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,559
the systems engineering

567
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,320
take us towards or what did you want to

568
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,400
draw on systems engineering from alex

569
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,679
because that was definitely an area that

570
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,240
was new to me

571
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,480
thanks system engineering is a

572
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,080
very developed domain

573
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,159
of doing complex engineering systems

574
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,440
and great community around the world for

575
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,360
a few decades is working

576
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,360
on developing approaches what will help

577
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,919
to create successful systems in

578
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,799
different absolutely different

579
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,600
directions

580
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,880
of people's lives

581
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,919
so there are some set

582
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,799
of standards what was developed by

583
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,280
different communities

584
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,799
here is presented three of them but

585
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,000
actually there are

586
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,039
much more different papers

587
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,159
related to it but as

588
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,440
for most applicable and more most

589
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,320
useful and most important documents

590
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,720
presented here it's first is

591
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,520
system engineering book of knowledge

592
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,120
this is development of

593
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
international council of system

594
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,039
engineering

595
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,880
as for last year last version of this

596
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,440
document

597
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,120
it's about thousands of paper

598
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,480
of papers but it's

599
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,320
kind of a big document but it has

600
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,520
has borders of the domain and

601
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,799
if people interested just going through

602
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,400
outline of this document

603
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,559
we can understand what is

604
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,600
it about and how it could be

605
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,559
used in different directions so there

606
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,360
are some set of

607
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,280
iso standards here is present in

608
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,159
15 to 8 it's for

609
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,440
mostly for systems life like

610
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,799
life cycle processes and defines

611
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,679
processes what happens in the system and

612
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,799
in

613
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,440
all type of system what also need to be

614
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,039
created and developed to

615
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,039
make to produce some system of interests

616
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,080
and uh

617
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,799
object management group has own

618
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,679
standards as

619
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,679
essence is initially was developed for

620
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,960
software engineering but now

621
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,760
we have understanding that concept and

622
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,880
schemas from

623
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,840
the standard are also useful to

624
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,840
to apply to the works of the

625
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,200
remote teams cool

626
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,280
so a lot of resources that are

627
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,240
professional

628
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,280
and also modern and global

629
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,559
from systems engineering one piece that

630
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,520
really

631
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,559
bears upon our system's design is this

632
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,200
concept of a system of interest

633
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,840
related to attentional regimes from the

634
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,440
ontology of active inference but the

635
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,279
system of interest is the engineering

636
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,640
terminology

637
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,159
and our system of interest is the active

638
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,279
lab participant so that's what we're

639
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,279
trying to

640
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,600
instigate change in here we call it a

641
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,320
nes

642
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,960
change non-equilibrium steady state

643
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,279
which is another active inference term

644
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,960
and that's just referring to this idea

645
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,799
that the steady state operation

646
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,640
even if it's far from equilibrium of the

647
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,919
participant

648
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,960
is going to undergo a systems change and

649
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,559
an active inference there's two ways

650
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,440
that a system can change to reduce its

651
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,960
uncertainty to minimize its

652
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,799
expected free energy the two ways it can

653
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,480
change are by modifying its internal

654
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,600
states

655
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,679
which is learning and development or by

656
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,360
modifying its external states

657
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,760
through action and niche modification so

658
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,880
we're thinking about

659
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,400
the system of interest as the

660
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,799
participant that's a person

661
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,440
who's starting out indifferent then

662
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,000
something

663
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,600
changes that nest change results in the

664
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,679
next stage of this person's

665
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,000
progression along this axis towards

666
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,679
being an interested person

667
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,279
somebody who's following the active

668
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,039
inference lab towards somebody who's

669
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,640
participating in the active inference

670
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,520
lab

671
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,840
and where systems engineering and the

672
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,760
idea of enabling architecture or

673
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,279
enabling infrastructure

674
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,080
enabling systems comes into play is for

675
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,880
this

676
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
ness change from somebody who is

677
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,400
indifferent or unaware

678
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,880
to someone who's interested there has to

679
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,559
be an enabling system

680
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,880
that enabling system in this case

681
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,720
there's other roads to take

682
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,360
is an operational live stream if it's

683
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,200
just a conceived live stream but it's

684
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,159
not at a stage

685
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,760
in its progression where it's actually

686
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,840
producing then this person is not going

687
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,919
to hear about it so it can't be enabling

688
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,559
infrastructure until it's operational

689
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,360
and then

690
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
how does an operational live stream

691
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,880
occur well that's

692
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,400
kind of the fun and that's what we've

693
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,000
been experimenting with but it turns out

694
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,840
that the dot-coms unit

695
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,080
is the group of people who with enabling

696
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,919
architectures of their own

697
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,039
are the ones who enable as well as

698
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,760
fine-tune an operational live stream

699
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,760
which is again what enables a certain

700
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,960
type of change to occur

701
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
in the system of interest that's the one

702
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,000
that we're focused on

703
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,600
that's the one that we care about

704
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,279
changing and everything else is a means

705
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,799
to that end

706
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,279
alex what else would you add about that

707
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,200
from the systems engineering perspective

708
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,840
um i just want to mention this this is a

709
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,840
small part of a big picture of this

710
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,080
enabling chains which should be

711
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,760
developed in system engineering way

712
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,120
and here it's

713
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,960
presented explicitly that for any

714
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,080
uh any enabling system there should be

715
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,760
uh some kind of in our enabling system

716
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,559
and from

717
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,240
on the bottom there is this one blue

718
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,279
blue arrow it's uh from another

719
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,440
enabling system in the chain which could

720
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,320
be for example

721
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,159
obs or youtube channel

722
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,240
exact tools what i enabling work of

723
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,039
dot com's unit which is producing

724
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,240
operational

725
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,679
live streams but also dot coms unit

726
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,400
is producing other types of enabling

727
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,520
systems

728
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,799
which can be used on different

729
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,520
non-equilibrium steady state changes

730
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,880
points

731
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,799
so it's kind of very complex

732
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,440
structure of enabling systems but

733
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,320
without

734
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,919
managing attention of

735
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,320
to to create it we can't achieve

736
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,440
final needed results on changes in

737
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,720
somebody's mind

738
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,960
as we propose here and i should to

739
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,080
mention that

740
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,399
initially this approach was developed

741
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,279
in systems management school in moscow

742
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,600
so we adapted

743
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,600
for our lab but it's also based again

744
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,720
on that's international standards what

745
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,919
which are developed by much more

746
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,320
broader communities of engineers so we

747
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,240
are trying to

748
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,559
use and apply state-of-the-art

749
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,640
enemies domain for what we are doing

750
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,279
any thoughts or questions on this yep

751
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,919
steven go for it

752
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,559
yeah i just thought i'd ask um you're

753
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,720
using the non-equilibrium steady-state

754
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,320
change there so you're introducing

755
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,120
something

756
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,080
into that and uh how how's that um just

757
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,399
maybe you could speak to that i mean

758
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,760
because it gives you some other options

759
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,159
potentially than saying just behavior

760
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:30,720
change

761
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,399
which may be used in i don't know if

762
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,760
that's what you use normally

763
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,919
so maybe just speak to that and how that

764
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,039
might

765
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,880
pose challenges for you as you're trying

766
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,480
to work it out or

767
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,039
opportunities and just where you are

768
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,960
with that kind of thinking

769
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,279
thanks for the question so there's going

770
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,080
to be many

771
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,159
answers and in the end it's enacted it's

772
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,000
how it actually plays out but

773
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,919
opening the door to calling it

774
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,679
non-equilibrium steady state change

775
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,279
let's just say you want someone to brush

776
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,799
their teeth every day but they're

777
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,240
currently the kind of person who's not

778
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,520
brushing their teeth every day

779
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,200
yes it is a behavior change it's an

780
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,960
action change but

781
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,000
it's going to be a complex non-linear

782
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
dynamical system the person in their

783
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,799
environment

784
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,440
all of the richness of that is what

785
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,039
needs to be

786
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,679
worked within so if it was a dial and

787
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,200
you could say make it louder and just

788
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,039
turn the brushing per day from zero to

789
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:21,679
one

790
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,000
well yeah then that is kind of like an

791
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,600
equilibrium steady state it's a

792
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,279
knob that's just resting in a position

793
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,559
and you just make some sort of

794
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,080
perturbation and then it just stays

795
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,200
where it's going to stay

796
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,760
but for the systems that we care about

797
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,480
which are

798
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,559
also the systems that we hope are within

799
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,520
the scope

800
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,039
and the potential of active inference

801
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,960
modeling which are

802
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,159
embedded inactive complex agents

803
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,880
we want to make it clear that we're not

804
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,080
just talking about

805
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,200
environment change we're not talking

806
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,320
about behavior change we're not talking

807
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,840
about their mindset changing

808
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,039
it's about the total scenario

809
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,679
developing in a non-equilibrium steady

810
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,520
state fashion just like an ecosystem

811
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,320
would

812
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,760
towards something and so then that helps

813
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,200
us be really clear that we're bringing

814
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,120
that richness to the table

815
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,200
but we're going to be talking about it

816
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,120
in a way that's human-centric

817
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,559
and progressive in terms of incremental

818
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,039
changes

819
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,399
to our system of interest and then we

820
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,080
can cope with how many um bifurcating

821
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,840
dependencies there are and there are

822
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,679
many including some that aren't within

823
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,880
our control

824
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,919
and it just helps us keep it organized

825
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,679
and kill two birds with one stone by

826
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,440
communicating better by using active

827
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,399
inference ontology

828
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,919
yeah quick follow-up and then to scott

829
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,600
yeah just saying yeah i like that i

830
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,279
think that also

831
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,640
gives a nice segue between um

832
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,799
the system of interest that you're

833
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,000
working with

834
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,840
and the potential unknowable

835
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,320
impacts without saying without getting

836
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,520
the messiah complex

837
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,240
but the idea that there's there's the

838
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,880
the work

839
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,399
in development work where there's

840
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,399
something called outcome mapping and

841
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,880
systems change which is you can never

842
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,080
know because it's

843
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,960
beyond any ability to know it might be

844
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,720
interesting that use of non-equilibrium

845
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,519
steady state

846
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,080
as it it seems to give a bridging point

847
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,440
because at the moment they just use

848
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,120
behavior change as well

849
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,720
so i was just saying to know that could

850
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,320
be interesting thanks well we certainly

851
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,000
don't know the effects of our actions

852
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,679
because the butterfly effect so just

853
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,279
breathing you don't know so

854
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,600
right outcome mapping is a summary

855
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,440
statistic or it's a measurements

856
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,080
within a non-equilibrium steady state or

857
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,840
a change to a system of interest

858
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,200
scott you know it

859
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,159
does yield an interesting change in

860
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:40,960
terms of

861
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,000
consciousness and cognition

862
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,440
because you know one of the problems in

863
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,279
consciousness is the mind can't know

864
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,600
itself that whole challenge

865
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,760
and so you have this kind of a feeling i

866
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,880
don't know if it's

867
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,240
been stated this way but kind of a

868
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,919
guideline incompleteness

869
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,519
that you're going to ask questions

870
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,039
within that system that won't be able to

871
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,000
be answered from within

872
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,720
the system in this case one of the

873
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,880
things that's really fascinating to me

874
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,080
is it is a it seems to be

875
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,200
a comprehensively

876
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,760
introspective mind but not to mean it's

877
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,960
not expected extrospective also

878
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,919
but uh outward looking but it's um the

879
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:20,240
the

880
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,760
i guess what i'm leading to is the thing

881
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,960
that's interesting about active

882
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,519
inference to me is that the system can

883
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,279
know itself in a different way than a

884
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,799
system that doesn't know that it's

885
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,720
performing active inference

886
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,480
and so a self-awareness of active

887
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,640
inference both in human cognition

888
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,320
where you've had this perennial

889
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,080
challenge of can the

890
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,840
tool know itself and here you have the

891
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,480
tool and we're using a tool to deploy to

892
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,760
understand

893
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,640
knowing in different systems and it's

894
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,760
kind of interesting because we can

895
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,840
construct up systems

896
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,320
that can know themselves to the extent

897
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,640
of the active inference model

898
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,320
and so it feels to me like it's going to

899
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,760
reveal a lot of other unique

900
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,919
aspects of thought and consciousness

901
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,519
and again maybe it's just a model like

902
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,200
different models of you know the mind is

903
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
a robot the mind is a computer the mind

904
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,600
is

905
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,440
you know whatever is historically

906
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,360
relevant then maybe it's just another

907
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,240
model

908
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,440
but it feels like this one's going to

909
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,840
reveal some process elements

910
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,440
that will have um provide us as humans

911
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,799
with the opportunity

912
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,600
to understand connections to other

913
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,799
things that

914
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,000
also rely upon and display those same

915
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
process elements

916
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
so people to if and to the extent people

917
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,519
can start to think of their minds

918
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,320
as more like a beehive their minds as

919
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,840
more like a

920
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,799
tree and its relationship to the fungus

921
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:43,440
and and

922
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,799
forests that feels like it will be

923
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,960
of service to our resilience and

924
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,919
sustainability

925
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,279
those new perspectives thanks cool

926
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,080
so let's do last little two slides on

927
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,279
strategy

928
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,840
thinking about active inference lab in

929
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,399
terms of

930
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,279
internal structure and also its niche

931
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,120
its external interfaces

932
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,679
and the idea of interfaces is central to

933
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,960
active inference

934
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,480
with everything about the markov

935
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,239
blankets different kinds of blankets and

936
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:12,960
interfaces

937
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,639
as well as computer science and

938
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,320
engineering so it's kind of

939
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,239
something that is almost pre-adapted to

940
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,800
work as far as our current

941
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,599
lab structure as stated we have three

942
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,359
organizational units that we're about to

943
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,000
spend

944
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,960
time going into updates4.edu tools and

945
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,079
comms

946
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,199
then at the interface of internal and

947
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,280
external are the deliverables

948
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,399
that we're looking to make real change

949
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,839
and progress on

950
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,480
so the body of knowledge is a

951
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,918
deliverable in a project that's

952
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:44,879
maintained by

953
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,918
edu that we're going to get to next and

954
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:48,239
it's

955
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,918
of course a work in progress they all

956
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,679
are dot-coms

957
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,560
is the unit that brings out the live

958
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,679
stream

959
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,240
and people can be on multiple units or

960
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,760
be different roles across different

961
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,560
areas

962
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,320
and there's connections between the

963
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,640
areas and um

964
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,040
comms is also the unit that interfaces

965
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,839
out with

966
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,839
broader communities so looking at the

967
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,040
bottom here

968
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,680
there's sort of a tri-color scheme so

969
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,160
blue

970
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,960
are the broader communities the broader

971
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,160
communities of

972
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,560
science learning and doing are everyone

973
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,839
so we can also

974
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,480
call it just whoever is within the

975
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,040
sphere of influence of the world

976
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,599
then there are those who are learners

977
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,280
and practitioners of active inference at

978
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:31,680
any

979
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,320
level of familiarity or of any

980
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,040
background

981
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,440
or career trajectory just like we have

982
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,520
complexity learners complexity curious

983
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:39,920
and

984
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,359
people who are just curious and know

985
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,200
what the word is you're already on the

986
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,000
path

987
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,480
then there's the lab itself which is

988
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,000
just one

989
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,640
organization in a bigger situation with

990
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,240
other people who are studying all kinds

991
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:52,560
of

992
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,200
amazing stuff active inference and not

993
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:55,760
and

994
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,359
comms we imagine will have sort of

995
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,520
several different ways to interface with

996
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,760
different communities

997
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,839
one is just by connecting with the

998
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,440
active inference learners in that

999
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,560
community

1000
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,599
so here is um the basket weaving

1001
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,560
community

1002
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,960
and there's a a special interest group

1003
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,640
of basket weavers who are interested in

1004
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,000
learning active inference and that's how

1005
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,280
we interface

1006
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,599
and then um one could also imagine that

1007
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,280
there are communities

1008
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,400
perhaps that are more science oriented

1009
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,320
but also as we're seeing potentially

1010
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,960
performance oriented service oriented

1011
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,079
social change

1012
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,599
finance all these areas where there is

1013
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,839
a conversation happening with dot coms

1014
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,720
as our interface as well as a broader

1015
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,240
community uptake and effort and interest

1016
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,280
in learning

1017
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,079
so this is sort of our internal um this

1018
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:48,800
is sort of

1019
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,880
internal structure in light of the niche

1020
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,560
and then just to sort of zoom in

1021
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,160
on the internal structure then anyone

1022
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,680
can give their last thoughts on this

1023
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,520
strategy before we go into the project

1024
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,760
areas um

1025
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,480
the initial stage is attention without

1026
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,079
attention to active inference and the

1027
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:04,560
lab

1028
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,760
there's nothing to latch onto nor follow

1029
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,240
after attention we think about

1030
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,280
accessibility

1031
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,599
and about onboarding because if it's not

1032
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,480
accessible

1033
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,160
and there isn't an onboarding there's no

1034
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,400
one on the ship if you can't onboard

1035
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,480
onto the ship there's no one on it so it

1036
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
has to be accessible and in terms of

1037
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,920
onboarding for us

1038
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,040
that's o-n-f-t that's starting to learn

1039
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,440
and use the ontology of active inference

1040
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,880
learning and understanding and

1041
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,640
co-creating the narrative of the active

1042
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,520
inference lab

1043
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,520
the formal documents like the forms and

1044
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,280
the documents that we use to organize

1045
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,640
everything the calendars

1046
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,440
if you're not on those then you're not

1047
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,000
on board

1048
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,920
yet because that's actually how we work

1049
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,119
and then there's the tools which is

1050
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,720
similar with the formal documents but

1051
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,520
the tools

1052
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,599
are the software and the hardware as

1053
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,200
well as the wet wear and the behavior

1054
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,560
and just the practices

1055
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,119
that allow one to be a participant and

1056
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,400
then there's this continuum of

1057
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,599
participation

1058
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,920
where we just take a role-based approach

1059
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,440
so if someone is a beginner

1060
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,000
in learning something we'll try to find

1061
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,720
a space

1062
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,240
where they're going to be able to learn

1063
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,720
by doing and assisting

1064
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,079
and that's what participation will look

1065
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,040
like for that person at that time

1066
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,839
so um any thoughts on these sort of

1067
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,839
outlines

1068
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,000
yeah steven go ahead yeah

1069
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,200
i think that um once it's nice to think

1070
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,440
about the onboarding with the onft

1071
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,720
to sort of gives you a way to break down

1072
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,920
um ways to help uh

1073
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,000
understand what bits you people are

1074
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,520
trying to be under

1075
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,320
um trying to relate to and i think then

1076
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,960
once there's that participation

1077
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,200
and wherever that can go you start to

1078
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,440
get into the realms of sense making

1079
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,119
and different forms of sense making that

1080
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,640
might be happening

1081
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,000
once you have started to gain that kind

1082
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,880
of

1083
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,240
um framework of understanding and

1084
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,800
interaction and seeing where people are

1085
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,079
taking in different ways

1086
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,520
so i think that's quite interesting

1087
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,280
um scott yeah the other thing i think is

1088
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,079
interesting here is

1089
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,599
in making the um the journey explicit

1090
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,760
and mapping it for people everyone is

1091
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,640
somewhere on the map

1092
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,240
everyone who doesn't know anything about

1093
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,400
this is a pre onboarding person

1094
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,960
you know some there's some location for

1095
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,760
folks

1096
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,040
we think it's really important the other

1097
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,680
part is one of the things that i've been

1098
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,839
wondering it feels like what's going on

1099
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,440
now in the world

1100
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,280
is that people are moving from data

1101
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,960
integrity to meaning

1102
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,480
integrity questions so i could say data

1103
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,480
security to meaning security

1104
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,440
but i mean it more broadly and so this

1105
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,359
process really falls well

1106
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,280
into that because the data is much more

1107
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,119
looking at the

1108
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,040
nodes from a network theory graph theory

1109
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,400
kind of perspective

1110
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,480
and this the meaning is looking at the

1111
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,079
relationships and the edges

1112
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,640
and because this whole enterprise is

1113
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,440
relationship

1114
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
based in even in terms of the current

1115
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,680
state of a node

1116
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,400
um i feel like it offers an introduction

1117
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,599
for folks to look at the

1118
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,079
really the more dynamic elements of it

1119
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,599
and so complexity

1120
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:24,720
you know you don't have to talk about

1121
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,800
complexity for this to be useful right

1122
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,880
people can go into this and

1123
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,040
develop awarenesses and realizations

1124
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,640
that help them cultivate

1125
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,720
meaning integrity and meaning

1126
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,920
understanding

1127
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,160
uh in the world without knowing that

1128
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,599
they're doing complexity

1129
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,599
and i think that that the the fact that

1130
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,599
this can be helpful to people

1131
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,240
um to understand the dynamics of their

1132
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,160
relationships and the dynamics of

1133
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,160
internal dynamics of other entities with

1134
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,520
which they're relating

1135
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,960
feels to me like it's going to be very

1136
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,800
valuable in this next stage

1137
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,640
of security and privacy liability

1138
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,480
um limitation all these things where

1139
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,480
people want greater integrity of their

1140
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,359
interactions

1141
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,599
it feels like this practice and this

1142
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,280
awareness can help result in that

1143
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,920
thanks thanks um okay then we're gonna

1144
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,520
be talking about these projects and our

1145
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,079
progress

1146
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,359
so stephen quick no

1147
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,040
okay okay sorry okay so nice up sasha go

1148
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,359
for it

1149
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,079
i just wanted to say um one thing so

1150
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:24,400
there's

1151
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,960
there's three teams and i think at the

1152
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,440
start

1153
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,280
maybe there was a concern that the teams

1154
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,119
would be kind of siloed and

1155
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,560
maybe working on their own projects and

1156
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,680
not

1157
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,480
linked and so i think it's been

1158
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,520
surprising

1159
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,760
um in a great way that the teams are

1160
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,839
actually very interconnected because of

1161
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,359
the people who are on them

1162
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,119
but also because the teams are dependent

1163
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:49,680
on

1164
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,839
each other for content and for

1165
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:52,720
development

1166
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,520
and so that's been a really um i guess

1167
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,359
exciting and pleasant surprise that

1168
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,640
um the teams are going to continue to

1169
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
work together and kind of bounce off of

1170
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,440
each other

1171
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,160
in a way that um really isn't siloed or

1172
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,760
sequestered

1173
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,520
um as i maybe wrongly expected

1174
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,200
cool and welcome dave hello

1175
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,040
yep and tools doesn't have any links out

1176
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,480
at this point but that's just a current

1177
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,720
snapshot so we'll update things

1178
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,240
um here we go with the update on the

1179
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,760
edu organizational unit so

1180
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,280
the edu the goal of this

1181
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,240
unit is pretty broad it's to create a

1182
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,319
participatory and dynamic active

1183
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,319
inference body of knowledge

1184
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,119
and our primary areas of progress have

1185
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,400
been related to

1186
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,200
ontology development specifically a

1187
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,720
terms list which we're going to get to

1188
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,000
in just a second

1189
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,319
and the next steps for this section

1190
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,520
which again we're going to go into more

1191
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,760
detail when alex describes the ontology

1192
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,440
we're still looking for feedback on the

1193
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,280
terms list and we're

1194
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,599
making progress on ontology development

1195
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:00,319
and the

1196
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,480
um ontology life cycle but we're still

1197
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,440
looking for

1198
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,520
ontology experts so people who have

1199
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,480
worked in

1200
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,040
an advanced capacity with ontology so

1201
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,440
alex maybe you want to take a first pass

1202
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,880
on the active inference body of

1203
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,640
knowledge what is this diagram on the

1204
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,040
right

1205
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,800
and then what does it mean for active

1206
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,200
inference

1207
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,119
okay thanks yeah on the right

1208
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,119
is a diagram from

1209
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,160
it's about ecosystem i guess

1210
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,760
which is grown

1211
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,119
around international

1212
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,240
council of system engineering and well

1213
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,599
there are a lot of areas of people's

1214
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,880
activity

1215
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,640
and all of it we can see

1216
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,480
is based on

1217
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,040
system engineering body of knowledge so

1218
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,000
when you have

1219
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,040
such kind of body of knowledge

1220
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,400
you have option to create

1221
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,040
different educational courses maybe

1222
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,000
certification programs

1223
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,920
maybe a lot of different stuff

1224
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,119
to people to work with to

1225
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,520
learn to develop themselves in the

1226
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,599
domain to communicate

1227
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,800
when you have some kind of knowledge

1228
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,400
artifact which you can refer

1229
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,000
and which have its own life cycle

1230
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,079
but it's kind of

1231
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,000
common agreement of uh domain

1232
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,599
understanding

1233
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,920
between the community and this is a

1234
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,280
cornerstone to develop

1235
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,119
different type of projects and

1236
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,400
activities

1237
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,760
and our hypothesis was could we use the

1238
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,599
same approach

1239
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,520
to develop active inference body of

1240
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,720
knowledge

1241
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,280
which should also provide us much more

1242
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,800
importances

1243
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,960
to develop the domain

1244
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,480
organize the work of people and make

1245
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,720
progress in all possible meanings

1246
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,680
cool yep it was this idea of a body of

1247
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,119
knowledge which is implicit

1248
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,079
in every developed and mature field but

1249
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,319
the engineers take it to the next level

1250
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:25,920
and the systems thinkers working

1251
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,760
together unsurprisingly

1252
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,079
so it's like very cool to see how

1253
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,640
there's really a specific relationships

1254
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,079
between different parts here

1255
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,839
these are actually controlled vocabulary

1256
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,079
terms like in forms and drives these

1257
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,079
aren't just like sort of synergy type

1258
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,680
words and so by defining the interfaces

1259
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,240
and the progressions it actually helps

1260
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:46,880
it

1261
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,599
be participatory and accessible and so

1262
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:50,480
we just were

1263
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,920
motivated by active inference one day

1264
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,319
realizing a truly mature body of

1265
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,040
knowledge

1266
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,960
which isn't just a textbook it's not

1267
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,960
just an unpacking of a paper it's not

1268
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,560
just a journal club discussion live

1269
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,359
stream

1270
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,440
it's actually formal courses

1271
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,400
certification

1272
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,480
standards but also practices that unify

1273
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,040
our community so that will be really

1274
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,560
awesome and then it says what else

1275
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,119
because

1276
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,920
we just listed a few english words but

1277
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,200
this is something that we're going to be

1278
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,200
enacting together so that's why

1279
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,800
one option is you know the live chat

1280
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,319
that's in affordance for feedback

1281
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,920
for those who are on the stream yes it's

1282
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,079
an affordable feedback and for co-design

1283
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,319
and then it's the actual doing and that

1284
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,319
will decide how it is

1285
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,800
so this is going to be pretty cool to be

1286
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,599
working on with

1287
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,760
edu and then we have a lot other things

1288
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,880
to say in ontology but stephen go for it

1289
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,079
just like to say i think it's quite

1290
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,680
interesting the um that bit in the

1291
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,200
middle the boundary of systems

1292
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,800
engineering so i quite like

1293
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,280
the uh you know with the participatory

1294
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,200
nature and the sort of

1295
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,680
evolving nature of uh sort of

1296
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,280
discussions you've got

1297
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,119
it's like the right um the right hand

1298
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,359
side there is is is the

1299
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,800
the more kind of structured formalized

1300
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,359
way it's bridged by this boundary of

1301
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,280
system engineering with the

1302
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,280
system engineering community so it's

1303
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,640
kind of

1304
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,520
be interesting to see how that nature of

1305
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,400
the boundary of system engineering

1306
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,319
um relates back to the nests

1307
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,400
non-equilibrium steady state and whether

1308
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,520
there's some interesting dynamics there

1309
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,640
which may be a similar or different to

1310
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,599
what's done in other areas of uh systems

1311
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,440
engineering

1312
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,000
cool so um as far as progress on our

1313
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,119
journey

1314
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,839
one of the key insights that many people

1315
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,200
don't expect

1316
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,960
but then once they start understanding

1317
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,119
the sense of the word more broadly

1318
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,200
they start to see is that ontology is

1319
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,119
the root and the backbone

1320
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,720
whatever metaphor you want to use it's

1321
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,559
the structure it's the clothes hanger

1322
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,359
it's a formal and explicit specification

1323
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,240
of a shared

1324
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,640
conceptualization of a domain that

1325
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,319
doesn't mean it's fixed in fact it's

1326
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,040
dynamic

1327
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,920
and participatory and then ontology is

1328
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,200
communicated between

1329
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,440
people as well as computers and that's

1330
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,520
what allows us to have heterogeneous

1331
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,079
and distributed systems and this is a

1332
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,480
paper um i think by its ontology

1333
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,680
learning from text

1334
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,640
by i think yang at all or i'm not sure

1335
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,000
and um we could look but

1336
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,880
go right now and it's a continuum of

1337
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,960
formality of ontologies

1338
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,000
so not every one of these terms many

1339
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,280
people would associate

1340
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,880
all these things with ontology but we're

1341
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,040
taking a broad perspective on ontology

1342
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,880
and we're starting with the simplest

1343
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,480
which is a terms list which we're going

1344
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,920
to show in a second

1345
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,720
terms lists can be updated as well as

1346
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,160
new terms can be added terms can be

1347
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:40,960
removed but

1348
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,160
the richness of the ontology which is uh

1349
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,480
like a sort of way that things are

1350
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,319
related to each other

1351
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,680
the richness can be developed to

1352
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,359
initially include definitions and

1353
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,400
synonyms like a glossary or thesaurus

1354
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,720
then looking more like a database like a

1355
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,000
data approach

1356
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,880
then all the way out to formal logics

1357
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,680
that allow

1358
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,480
almost computation in an analytical way

1359
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:06,960
on

1360
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,319
knowledge relationships which is

1361
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,400
extremely powerful but usually it's

1362
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,680
quite domain specific

1363
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,960
so we can't put the

1364
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,319
cart before the horse i was thinking put

1365
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:17,520
the inference before the active but

1366
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,640
that's fine

1367
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,640
both directions are fine so we're

1368
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,440
developing dynamic ontology life cycle

1369
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,599
and the stage that we are at in this

1370
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,440
first quarterly update

1371
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,400
is that we did complete the first stable

1372
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,000
version not the final version of the

1373
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,880
terms list

1374
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,800
that's the active inference lab terms

1375
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,680
list v 1.0 candidate

1376
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,240
and we've been getting several weeks of

1377
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,920
feedback on the terms list

1378
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,240
improved it a lot also with very much

1379
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,599
appreciated feedback from

1380
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,640
carl fristin and this terms list is not

1381
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,839
always going to be a spreadsheet it's

1382
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,280
not always going to look this way

1383
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,960
it will develop into richer

1384
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,040
computational resources

1385
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,160
that allow us to do translation allow us

1386
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:58,720
to make

1387
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,040
educational content at different levels

1388
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,680
to connect formally to different fields

1389
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,440
to think about how terms are being used

1390
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,040
across different spaces to provide

1391
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,400
points of contact

1392
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,400
because one thing that we noticed when

1393
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,680
we were making the terms list in the

1394
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,880
supplement which is sort of

1395
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,920
words that we put in the b tier was the

1396
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,119
b tier words

1397
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,839
were like a lot of isms and theories and

1398
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:20,720
ideas and

1399
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,319
ways of doing a certain mathematical

1400
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,720
formalism and then the terms

1401
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,760
for the actual core set that we will

1402
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,000
be focusing our language use and

1403
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,359
understanding on

1404
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,319
they include really um powerful words

1405
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:34,720
like

1406
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,599
accuracy action agency ambiguity

1407
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:38,960
attention that's just the a

1408
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,920
section and there's less than 90 terms

1409
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,640
right now

1410
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,000
so this is pretty fun and that's

1411
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,839
basically where we're at with

1412
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,680
the ontology project which has been the

1413
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,599
main focus of the edu

1414
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,960
unit and the next steps are to continue

1415
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,520
up this progression to move towards

1416
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,760
better understandings of our ontology as

1417
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,200
well as to use

1418
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,440
text analysis type approaches to

1419
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,800
understand how these terms are being

1420
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,440
used

1421
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,119
and provide a little bottom-up or a

1422
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:07,680
data-driven ontological approach

1423
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,200
anyone have any thoughts or comments on

1424
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,920
ontology or edu before we go to the next

1425
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,319
section

1426
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,960
all right let's stephen go ahead

1427
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,200
yeah i'd just like to say this is really

1428
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,400
very very useful

1429
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,839
um actually i think even

1430
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,960
the process of people um you know going

1431
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,319
through these terms they could be an

1432
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,319
interesting educational piece

1433
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:38,079
um just like having people explore

1434
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,119
how these terms arise for themselves you

1435
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,160
know and actually

1436
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,920
maybe even gamifying some of this

1437
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,720
because in exploring and finding out the

1438
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,960
terms you actually

1439
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,319
understand an awful lot more about

1440
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,240
active infants so it's it's

1441
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,559
it's good on a number of levels actually

1442
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:55,280
cool

1443
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,920
and also dave thanks a lot for your

1444
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,800
really

1445
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,520
powerful insights into ontology and just

1446
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,119
language and helping us think about that

1447
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,319
in a in a

1448
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,599
structured way so the second project is

1449
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,079
comms second organizational unit because

1450
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,839
there's teams there's projects inside of

1451
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:13,680
a unit so for now it's sort of like the

1452
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,440
unit and the team are really similar

1453
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,520
but when the organizational unit is

1454
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,960
larger then there will be

1455
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,119
disjoint teams and projects inside of

1456
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,400
comms

1457
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,760
so the goal of comms is sort of two-fold

1458
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,160
the first goal is to carry out all forms

1459
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,079
of communication with external entities

1460
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,680
and the other goal is to organize the

1461
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,000
lab's internal projects and activities

1462
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,680
so it's internal communication and

1463
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,319
external communication

1464
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:39,920
because when we're thinking about

1465
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,920
systems design for online teams for

1466
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,480
remote teams which are all of them now

1467
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,480
those are what we have access to

1468
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,400
internal communications design

1469
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,800
and then external communications

1470
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,480
interfacing

1471
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,440
and towards that end i think comms has

1472
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:55,760
been

1473
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,280
a fun experience for a lot of people

1474
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,800
we had several projects within comps

1475
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,880
so again with overlapping personnel at

1476
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,400
this point but

1477
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,839
um not for always there um

1478
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:13,359
several uh series that we carried out

1479
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,200
so just to sort of describe and

1480
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,040
distinguish them the active inference

1481
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,160
live stream

1482
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,520
is the main weekly discussion that we've

1483
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,640
been having

1484
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,559
it's publication centric other than the

1485
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,000
quarterly roundtables

1486
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,319
it's like we discuss a paper and that's

1487
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:29,839
why we have the calendar that references

1488
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,440
the paper and we schedule things

1489
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,559
a lot in advance for this one and for

1490
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:35,119
each

1491
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,119
number of paper like number 16 is going

1492
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,640
to be the same paper for 16.012345

1493
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,079
however many sessions we need on that

1494
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,559
paper and the idea is that dot zero

1495
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,160
is like a contextualing a

1496
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,000
contextualizing video

1497
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,680
um blue as a amazing contextualizer

1498
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,440
and we'll be doing 17.0 tomorrow um

1499
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,760
so probably pull an all-nighter or

1500
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,880
something on that one

1501
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,400
and then the dot one and the dot two

1502
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,880
videos are participatory group

1503
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,040
discussions ideally with the authors

1504
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:05,520
around

1505
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,119
also be cool if authors wanted to help

1506
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,359
us with dot zero but the idea is we can

1507
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,280
invite and really honor and respect

1508
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,839
the authors by having them show up to a

1509
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:14,480
discussion

1510
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,160
where there's going to be a group of

1511
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,480
people people sharing their perspectives

1512
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:18,960
at different

1513
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,599
stages in understanding and then it's

1514
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,599
all good for participants to have

1515
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,440
not read the paper or read the paper a

1516
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,920
little bit just circled questions

1517
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,079
highly added a ton of notes it's like

1518
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,440
wherever people are at

1519
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,800
the authors are the ones who put out the

1520
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,960
paper and so that's been great to talk

1521
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,240
with the researchers in the active

1522
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:36,839
inference

1523
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:40,160
community then um that sort of led

1524
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,839
to a desire to go a little bit more

1525
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,520
technical at times

1526
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,000
and ryan smith and christopher white

1527
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
kicked off our model stream series with

1528
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,480
four

1529
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,480
model streams and the model stream is

1530
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,640
intended to be like a tutorial or a code

1531
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,440
walk through

1532
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,200
or more like a deep dive into modeling

1533
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,040
because then we can be really clear

1534
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,880
where we're doing a how-to on modeling

1535
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,440
and then

1536
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,079
in a live stream uh regular format would

1537
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:04,799
be more about

1538
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:06,799
like when we had alex chance for octave

1539
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,079
eight um

1540
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,240
that was talking about implications and

1541
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,920
asking some more qualitative questions

1542
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,839
about the project

1543
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:17,200
and then the new um newest series is the

1544
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,319
guest stream

1545
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,559
and majeed benny came on for the first

1546
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,000
guest stream on feb

1547
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,799
24th and the guest stream is just our

1548
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:25,520
grab bag

1549
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,599
our wild card it's like if a new paper

1550
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:28,640
comes out

1551
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,400
we could have a discussion with the

1552
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,720
authors 48 hours later

1553
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,559
if they're available so a guest stream

1554
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,079
the idea is on

1555
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,760
short time scales or if someone says

1556
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,839
yeah i'm really busy i could come on and

1557
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:40,559
visit in

1558
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:43,520
seven months then we can also account

1559
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,119
for that so any

1560
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:46,880
time of day or any availability that

1561
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,160
that somebody has

1562
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,319
who wants to be leading a session or be

1563
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:51,520
a guest on a session

1564
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,520
we'll just put it in the guest stream

1565
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,079
component and then there's bite-sized

1566
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,040
so maybe blue would you want to say

1567
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,720
anything about bite size or any other

1568
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,319
projects that you're thinking about on

1569
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:03,760
this front

1570
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,960
sure the um bite size really uh

1571
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,480
you know i have a lot of people like

1572
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,599
where i'm like i'm doing this live

1573
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,960
stream it's really cool you should come

1574
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,160
like participate

1575
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,240
and here's this big paper like the paper

1576
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,480
that we're doing for the

1577
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,200
17.0 is like you know 30 pages long like

1578
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,799
here read this paper and join us on our

1579
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,559
live stream and people get a little

1580
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,640
uh intimidated by that and so they don't

1581
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,599
really want to engage

1582
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,359
at that level but i've definitely had a

1583
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:29,280
lot of feedback from people saying like

1584
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,880
oh you're gonna make it into like an

1585
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,880
audio podcast like short like

1586
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,799
15 minute little clips that we can

1587
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,480
listen to on the way to work or while

1588
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,240
i'm out for a walk or whatever and so

1589
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,400
i've had a lot of interest in that and

1590
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,880
um i think i'm i've got two episodes

1591
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,400
already clipped from

1592
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,760
like i'm starting at the earlier live

1593
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,760
streams and moving up um

1594
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,440
and so so i've got a couple episodes

1595
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,799
that already clipped and ready and one

1596
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,079
more that's almost ready

1597
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,160
so i think we should be launching like

1598
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,200
as soon as i get them

1599
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,920
pushed into the rss feed maker we should

1600
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,920
be launching maybe as early as

1601
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,240
next week probably so just you know

1602
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,160
short little episodes for people to

1603
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,440
um listen to and um you know that that

1604
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,400
are maybe not

1605
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,319
don't involve reading a 30 page paper

1606
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,000
and doing a bunch of math

1607
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,160
uh but still people can engage at a

1608
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,680
level that's kind of

1609
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,720
um thought friendly and right commute

1610
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,520
friendly

1611
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,720
right awesome yeah thanks a lot for

1612
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,880
taking the initiative and helping that

1613
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,319
project happen and

1614
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:28,720
we'll probably make another youtube

1615
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,520
channel like

1616
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,640
acting clips or something and then

1617
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,920
we can figure out how to make it work

1618
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,599
and we'll keep everyone posted through

1619
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:36,000
our

1620
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,200
communications channels so also another

1621
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,040
deliverable with the next steps for

1622
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,359
comms we're going to continuing continue

1623
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:44,480
working on our

1624
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,440
series that exist so the live stream has

1625
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,400
a calendar

1626
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,200
um that's in the info box for each video

1627
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,400
the model stream

1628
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,040
we're in conversation with several

1629
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,559
people as well as for guest stream with

1630
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:57,760
future dates

1631
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,079
so that's how it is with live stream you

1632
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,760
can schedule it but then in the end it's

1633
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,960
better to tell people

1634
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,720
when it goes live or after because you

1635
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,000
never know what's going to happen

1636
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,040
last moment so we just um

1637
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,880
are looking to schedule and coordinate

1638
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,480
with new participants

1639
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,720
of any background or interest if

1640
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,079
somebody wants to

1641
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,839
give a model stream or you know be the

1642
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:19,599
one who's walking through their tutorial

1643
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,119
or their blog

1644
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,280
that's awesome and we have so many

1645
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,799
people who have written like their own

1646
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,000
sort of

1647
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,960
um free energy or active inference

1648
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,559
manifestos or learning

1649
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:33,839
documents so how to surface that or

1650
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:35,839
who could we invite in an adjacent

1651
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:38,000
community to do a guest stream or like

1652
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,119
an interview or

1653
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,280
could we do a special other stream could

1654
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,760
we do a math stream or a kid stream

1655
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,880
or just joke stream who knows

1656
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,280
and then we're looking towards the kinds

1657
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,480
of communications

1658
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,359
that are enabled by the markov blanket

1659
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:54,480
of a remote team

1660
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,960
we can send data and that data can be

1661
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,520
text

1662
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,000
like a blog or a wiki or article it

1663
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,680
could be audio only

1664
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,599
it could be video only it could be a

1665
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,040
still image it could be a physical

1666
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:05,920
object

1667
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,240
so what are our affordances as an

1668
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,040
organization

1669
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,760
and then there's some that we can't

1670
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,400
afford

1671
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,720
to do now but maybe we'll afford them

1672
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,400
later

1673
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,119
and then just the last note on comms is

1674
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:20,079
it's been pretty

1675
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,520
interesting to work on what basically

1676
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,359
amounts to a live stream organization

1677
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,119
and implementation checklist

1678
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,119
it's just a sequence of commentable

1679
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,720
google slides

1680
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,760
for now but it partitions

1681
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,240
some of the roles of a live stream just

1682
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,839
one perspective

1683
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:40,240
in a way that makes sense inc it

1684
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,079
includes a couple of things

1685
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,960
that people might not expect about a

1686
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,960
live stream for example that what they

1687
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,079
see on their computer is what other

1688
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:49,440
people see or that noises

1689
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,280
might be not for them but other people

1690
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,280
can hear it or vice versa

1691
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,160
and um that helps us make sure that we

1692
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,599
have a high quality live stream

1693
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,119
experience for everybody

1694
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,040
as well as an experience that is

1695
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,640
accessible because someone can

1696
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,880
um reduce their anxiety reduce their

1697
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,319
uncertainty about

1698
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:08,880
the who why where when and then there's

1699
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,760
a total

1700
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,200
um direction to continue in

1701
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,760
with just how to communicate and

1702
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:16,799
dialogue

1703
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:18,240
so i know it's something that many

1704
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,000
people on this

1705
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,240
conversation and and in the lab think

1706
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,520
about a lot like

1707
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,119
whether it's in the context of

1708
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,839
transformative dialogue

1709
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:30,799
productive innovative whatever adjective

1710
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:33,040
is meaningful to you there's something

1711
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,640
about improvisation

1712
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,240
and coming together with the affordances

1713
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,839
that we have

1714
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:41,599
to just hopefully do good and have fun

1715
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,880
so how do we make that possible

1716
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,680
has been what comms is about clarifying

1717
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,520
and communicating on

1718
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,160
any last thoughts on comms before we go

1719
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,240
to tools

1720
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,240
um yeah alex then stephen

1721
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,040
yeah thanks i just want to add uh

1722
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,079
in relation to checklist that it is

1723
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,880
a checklist is one of the main concepts

1724
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,559
of

1725
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,319
and approach from systems engineering so

1726
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:17,359
we are trying to apply system

1727
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:18,000
engineering

1728
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,480
approaches for actually

1729
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,559
all types of activities what we are

1730
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,880
doing

1731
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,720
cool stephen yeah i suppose the

1732
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,160
the idea of the niche or creating as

1733
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,240
an awareness of the niche and the

1734
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,680
affordances in the niche that we're

1735
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,079
giving

1736
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,559
people as well as their their own sort

1737
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:41,280
of personal

1738
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,119
journeys kind of a nice way to think

1739
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:44,640
about this so as as

1740
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,640
as the list is being ticked off it's

1741
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,920
like

1742
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,640
connect with self and participants to

1743
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,000
bring the relevant energy

1744
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,039
so that's kind of a bigger term

1745
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:56,400
than you might often get in an

1746
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,319
engineering context but you know that

1747
01:01:58,319 --> 01:01:59,280
that's

1748
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,640
but that is the sort of thing that often

1749
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,559
gets forgotten you know especially if

1750
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:03,440
you're

1751
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,319
so it's good to to like have that as a

1752
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:07,520
yeah let's just check in

1753
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,240
you know and just get that chance to

1754
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,520
make sure that

1755
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,880
we're in the right headspace because

1756
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,960
this it does take some time to

1757
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,920
to reorientate so that's quite good yep

1758
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:18,319
and

1759
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:21,119
the the challenge and the opportunity

1760
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:21,520
are

1761
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,640
two sides of the same coin for the

1762
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,440
remote teams we can have international

1763
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,920
conversations and so yes maybe you know

1764
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,160
dave's video blips out

1765
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,839
once in a while or somebody gets kicked

1766
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,760
off but it's like we're having

1767
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,039
conversations that are very special

1768
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,160
so instead of relativizing it to some

1769
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,480
imagined reality where like tech is

1770
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,640
perfect and free and everyone has it

1771
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,039
we can reference to what's possible and

1772
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,799
then we work with what we have and make

1773
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:49,839
the best of it and

1774
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:52,000
some people their rate limiting step to

1775
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,440
live stream participation

1776
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,799
is psychological or internal whatever

1777
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:59,599
for some people it's um logistical they

1778
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:00,079
can't

1779
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:01,520
make the time work maybe they live in a

1780
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,799
different time zone for other people

1781
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:03,680
it's technical

1782
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,799
they have the time and they want to do

1783
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:07,359
it but they don't have a camera or a

1784
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:08,240
microphone or

1785
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,520
internet connectivity or something like

1786
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,440
that so when we

1787
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,880
have a role-based approach to

1788
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,039
participation not like

1789
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,119
live streamers not a title in our

1790
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:18,559
community it's like

1791
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:21,039
who's a participant in this live stream

1792
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:21,599
today

1793
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,079
in quarterly roundtable one which role

1794
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:25,359
is everybody playing

1795
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:27,359
and we actually have an answer for which

1796
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:28,720
people are playing each role

1797
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,319
and whether they did or didn't do the

1798
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:32,319
checklist exactly today

1799
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,720
probably few did um i know that the

1800
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,920
broadcaster didn't

1801
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,720
but that's all good because it at least

1802
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,359
is there

1803
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,039
and then we can iterate on it and that

1804
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:43,200
will i think really

1805
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,520
be powerful and effective okay any other

1806
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,280
thoughts on comps but yeah we're just

1807
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,760
looking forward to

1808
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,760
learning by doing and communicating all

1809
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,839
right tools so this is kind of a fun

1810
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:56,640
section i think the goals of the dot

1811
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,520
tools

1812
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,799
unit are again sort of twofold an

1813
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:02,720
internal and an external

1814
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,240
view so the internal goal of

1815
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,640
tools is to enable effective tool and

1816
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,400
instrument use for all active inference

1817
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,760
lab processes

1818
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,000
so we need to figure out which tools

1819
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,119
will work best for

1820
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,839
onft for onboarding and participation

1821
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,000
otherwise we don't have

1822
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,599
anything but especially as we

1823
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:26,799
build more scaffolding for

1824
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:29,119
our lab and stabilize some of the tool

1825
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,039
use inside of our lab and have more

1826
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:32,960
regimes of attention to spare

1827
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,640
on external views we're interested in

1828
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,839
exploring and designing

1829
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:39,760
affordances within our niche which is

1830
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,039
all we can ever have

1831
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,920
resulting in effective action externally

1832
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,880
facing

1833
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,880
and also innovating in terms of tool

1834
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,240
development so

1835
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,599
um tim and others who we had such

1836
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,680
great conversations with in the weekly

1837
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,880
discussions that

1838
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,160
relate to our progress um and several

1839
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,680
others scott and schneider

1840
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,839
and many just awesome people who came

1841
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:04,000
through there's like

1842
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,280
us using tools to make the lab better at

1843
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,160
what it does

1844
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,680
and then there is the tantalizing

1845
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,240
and exciting question of what active

1846
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,359
inference driven

1847
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:18,000
tools look like whether there's an

1848
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
active inference computational

1849
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,400
or software element and so the tools

1850
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,200
look like

1851
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,359
slack or look like email or look like

1852
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:26,559
something that people are very familiar

1853
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:26,960
with

1854
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,119
but it's like a recommendation engine

1855
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:30,640
that changes

1856
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,280
how things are done in some subtle way

1857
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,559
so whether we talk about

1858
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,799
implementing active inference on top of

1859
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,960
the tools that we know and see today

1860
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,440
or whether we're talking about truly

1861
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,079
novel

1862
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,880
and unexpected ways of active inference

1863
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,400
and systems engineering and systems

1864
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,280
design

1865
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,640
coming into play in the true um

1866
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,160
imminent future of online work

1867
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,440
that is where we want to go but um

1868
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,799
with a couple people and a lot to figure

1869
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:01,760
out internally

1870
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,799
we haven't gotten there but like people

1871
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:06,160
have been saying

1872
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,559
all of the goals and units are

1873
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,079
intertwined

1874
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:12,880
and to use a figure from our paper the

1875
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,119
fiatkin at all paper

1876
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,200
we're taking a function driven approach

1877
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,960
to thinking about this internal and

1878
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,960
external team communication

1879
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,280
and the tooling for that using the

1880
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,039
active inference framework

1881
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:28,400
because designing the system for the

1882
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:28,960
physical

1883
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,559
office you know you need the hammer to

1884
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,160
build the hallway so that you could have

1885
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,039
a certain

1886
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:35,119
connectivity of conversation or certain

1887
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:37,039
architectural suggestion

1888
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,000
but the hammer our tool is actually the

1889
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,359
modification

1890
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:44,480
of communication pathways communication

1891
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,359
being included

1892
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:47,039
data being shuttled back and forth

1893
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,640
between parts of a computer

1894
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,440
or across the internet also a part of

1895
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,720
communication between non-human agents

1896
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,839
so we sort of even

1897
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,640
from last year wanted to use the idea of

1898
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,920
a markov blanket

1899
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,920
and blankets or however they end up

1900
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,559
being defined with interfaces

1901
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:09,520
as sense incoming and actions outgoing

1902
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,319
and so we have

1903
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:13,760
internal team communications and then

1904
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,599
external team communications

1905
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:18,480
which are all important sense in action

1906
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,000
internally and externally just like

1907
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,799
multi-scale nested active inference and

1908
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:24,240
then tool development is about making

1909
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,039
that happen

1910
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,680
so we're going to run now through the

1911
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,880
tools

1912
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,880
including ones that i hope some people

1913
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,480
will be familiar with maybe some

1914
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,760
people will not be familiar with and

1915
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,119
anyone can just raise their hand

1916
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,640
if they want to mention something about

1917
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,480
tool so

1918
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,480
the single source of truth from a file

1919
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,839
sharing perspective

1920
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,480
for the lab is a google drive folder

1921
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,200
from activeinference.gmail.com

1922
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,160
and this is our activelab folder we have

1923
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,039
the three

1924
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:55,920
organizational units.edu tools and comms

1925
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,920
and then we have dot admin which is the

1926
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,400
uh

1927
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,799
minimal administration for the lab and

1928
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:01,760
just like the form

1929
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,079
responses that are not part of one of

1930
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:05,039
these other

1931
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,599
organizational units but by and large

1932
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:09,440
everything related to these projects

1933
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,960
is totally viewable and if people rsvp

1934
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,839
to participate

1935
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:16,238
they're added as an editor to the folder

1936
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:16,960
if they

1937
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,319
um just want to see the link then they

1938
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,080
can comment on everything so everything

1939
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,359
from the slides for all of the

1940
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,439
presentations to the feedback

1941
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:25,679
for the podcast are in each of these

1942
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:26,560
folders

1943
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,080
and uh it's a participatory and

1944
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,279
hopefully an open way

1945
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,719
to organize so any project that people

1946
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:36,799
are hearing about that sounds cool

1947
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,640
or something that they think is an

1948
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,479
adjacency or a role that they'd like to

1949
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:42,000
play

1950
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,439
even if um just a very

1951
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,960
vague sense of what it could be just get

1952
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,198
in touch with us because basically

1953
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:53,359
this is our current project

1954
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:56,399
to go into a few specific areas

1955
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,719
in our work on the ontology and terms we

1956
01:08:58,719 --> 01:08:59,920
used two different tools

1957
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,960
we used google documents

1958
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,719
as we used with many projects documents

1959
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,439
and sheets but then also we use protege

1960
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:10,640
which is a online the web protege is an

1961
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,238
online ontology editor

1962
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:13,679
lightweight but pretty powerful and

1963
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:16,000
there's also a desktop application

1964
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,479
and this is for ontology construction

1965
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:20,158
and sharing so that's pretty fun just

1966
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:22,158
learning about ontologies and different

1967
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,359
ways of viewing

1968
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,479
um terms we

1969
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:30,238
use um gather.town for spatial video

1970
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:31,120
chat

1971
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,120
and um right now we're using jitsi which

1972
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,799
i actually didn't take a screenshot of

1973
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:35,279
we could

1974
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,120
do it total uh during add but

1975
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,520
gatherer.town

1976
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,719
is allowing for interfaces uh

1977
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,439
and affordances like movement while i'm

1978
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:47,198
taking a screenshot stephen

1979
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:49,679
just maybe give one thought on gathering

1980
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,759
active inference and where that might

1981
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:55,360
come into play yeah well

1982
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,199
it could be interesting i think active

1983
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,360
inference and the nature of how

1984
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,760
we relate into our affordances it's kind

1985
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,360
of interesting when you start to be

1986
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,159
sitting at a table as an avatar

1987
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:10,400
and how that feels slightly different um

1988
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,040
to how you are maybe when you're sort of

1989
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,239
in an open space

1990
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:17,040
discussing aspects of active inference

1991
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,480
so it might be it might be quite

1992
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,000
interesting as we

1993
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,640
start to explore how some of the active

1994
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,719
inference processes

1995
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:27,760
are ontologically and then how they are

1996
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,040
when we start to experience um

1997
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:34,400
stepping into the dynamics of

1998
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,880
active impress inference because it is a

1999
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:37,679
a process

2000
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:42,239
theory rather than a static

2001
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,640
sort of diagram telling us what the

2002
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,840
world is so

2003
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,960
that opens up some possibilities um and

2004
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,400
uh yeah i quite enjoy

2005
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,239
meeting everyone that way so i i don't

2006
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:53,520
know how others find it but

2007
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,360
i think that's uh yep there's

2008
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,640
possibilities

2009
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,120
yep fun and jitsy is a little bit more

2010
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,239
standard but it's an

2011
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:03,120
open source video platform and we have

2012
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,560
an aws server

2013
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,640
so it will cost a couple of cents or a

2014
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:07,840
little bit more per

2015
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,840
meeting but then we know that we have

2016
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,280
the reliability

2017
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,480
but also meet.jit.c is free okay

2018
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,600
then for text and file sharing and the

2019
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,480
official

2020
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,520
organization of each of the lab the dot

2021
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,080
admin

2022
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:25,440
and the three units that we have as well

2023
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,679
as dot public on key base

2024
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:30,560
this is um a platform just it's not

2025
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,120
about

2026
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,239
the pros and cons of any of these

2027
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:33,760
specific platforms we're just saying

2028
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:34,640
what it is that we're

2029
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,360
using but key base is a really great

2030
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,800
platform at the current

2031
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,199
moment for doing the kinds of things

2032
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:42,480
that we want to do

2033
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,480
in the back end for official

2034
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,679
organization

2035
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:47,360
this is like the internal communications

2036
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,679
of the lab then there's the external

2037
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:50,880
communications in the lab

2038
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,679
now it being an open in a participatory

2039
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:54,320
lab

2040
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,920
sometimes it's a little bit hard to say

2041
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,199
where is their internal and external

2042
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,400
communication because

2043
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,800
all of the documents are visible all of

2044
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,239
our teams are joinable

2045
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:04,159
so where is the line between internal

2046
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:05,840
and external communication

2047
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,840
basically there's communications that we

2048
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,000
address to participants and

2049
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,679
members of our lab people who are

2050
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:13,600
actively um somebody who would just

2051
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,400
directly

2052
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,159
solicit feedback to in a sort of

2053
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:17,840
off-the-cuff way

2054
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,000
like somebody you might bump into in a

2055
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,159
co-working situation ask for feedback

2056
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:25,280
whereas external communications we try

2057
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,320
to communicate

2058
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:30,239
um sporadically but regularly

2059
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:33,199
and uh well structuring our external

2060
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:34,080
communications

2061
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,159
like having professionalism with our

2062
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:38,400
newsletter and with our live streams

2063
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,320
whereas just popping on a video call

2064
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,520
with the same people

2065
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,120
it'd be an internal lab discussion

2066
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,800
because it wasn't being performed

2067
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,960
externally but they're ultimately all

2068
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,880
open i guess

2069
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,120
so for external communication

2070
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,159
specifically but

2071
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,960
also increasingly project collaborations

2072
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,159
just ones that aren't

2073
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:57,920
the three organizational units of the

2074
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,600
lab which is our focus as

2075
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,159
organizers is the actual organization of

2076
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:03,679
those lab units and

2077
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,280
incrementing those systems and including

2078
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,960
participation in a lab

2079
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,600
and then people are just so amazing and

2080
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,120
creative and have so many

2081
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,159
awesome project ideas and collaborations

2082
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:17,679
so in the discord i know that we'll have

2083
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:19,760
papers and research and projects

2084
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,679
together that are

2085
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:24,159
maybe even only constituting our lab

2086
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:24,960
participants

2087
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,199
but will not be part of the exact

2088
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:28,400
organizational unit

2089
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,560
just be people collaborating we have a

2090
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:31,520
discord

2091
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,239
and the join link is probably in the

2092
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:35,360
video description and

2093
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,199
live chat and here and then there's

2094
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:39,199
twitter inference active

2095
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:43,679
on twitter then um for live streaming

2096
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:46,400
uh if you're watching it it's on youtube

2097
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,280
and then if you're

2098
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,960
live streaming it then there's this

2099
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,360
dashboard for youtube live streaming

2100
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,480
and then currently as broadcaster i'm

2101
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,640
using the open broadcasting studio

2102
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,679
obs project.com and then just that's

2103
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:00,320
what i'm

2104
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,440
using right now but the fun part and

2105
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,600
just to sort of call back to the roles

2106
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,960
of comms is the um the

2107
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,000
facilitator and the event organizer in

2108
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,520
the broadcaster the participant

2109
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,679
it could be one person all doing these

2110
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,600
roles for one person

2111
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,679
or it could be many people with these

2112
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:21,600
roles and it could be split up across

2113
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,360
different expertises and skills

2114
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,760
and then lastly aweber is where we have

2115
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,800
our

2116
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,560
monthly newsletter so there's been two

2117
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,239
of them end of january

2118
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,480
end of february so far because now it's

2119
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,760
march 2nd

2120
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,280
and that's going to be just for updates

2121
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,520
on our projects and sort of sharing

2122
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,600
similar information

2123
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,280
to this live stream but just in a

2124
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,560
bullet point project by project way okay

2125
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,600
any tools thoughts that's sort of the

2126
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,199
active lab

2127
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,760
stack or just where it is but we know

2128
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,040
that some of these platforms are going

2129
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,320
to be

2130
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,560
closing or changing or new ones come on

2131
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,760
to the scene and

2132
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,719
so yeah we just are kind of at the spot

2133
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:07,280
we're at

2134
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,719
and then as the affordance becomes

2135
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,400
salient and preferable while also being

2136
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,080
aware of switching costs then

2137
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:19,760
we'll do what we have to do to scale

2138
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,600
any other thoughts on tools though oh

2139
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,880
stephen go for it

2140
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,640
well i was just wondering if there's are

2141
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,960
you actively looking for any tools to

2142
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,800
bridge any gaps at the moment or you

2143
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,000
sort of you feel you've got enough at

2144
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,360
the moment like is this

2145
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,800
i'm just curious if that's something

2146
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,280
that you're trying to look at

2147
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,719
i would respond in terms of optimal

2148
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:42,320
experimentation

2149
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,040
and optimal foraging on a rapidly

2150
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,159
shifting

2151
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:47,920
affordance landscape there's tools that

2152
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,199
are just at

2153
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:52,320
working quality today or in six months

2154
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,000
that a year ago

2155
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,120
we hadn't heard of so by staying

2156
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:57,920
connected

2157
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,400
to people with various domain specific

2158
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,440
expertise and kind of

2159
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,960
use specific expertise we want to stay

2160
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,239
attuned to trends

2161
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:11,440
on the tool landscape and then dot tools

2162
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:15,679
is the spot where the people who are

2163
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:18,080
the most interested in that will come

2164
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,040
together

2165
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,040
to look for internal opportunities for

2166
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,800
local and global improvement

2167
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,040
like fine-tuning the discord channels or

2168
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,000
going to a different

2169
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,560
platform for that function so it's a

2170
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:29,199
need-based

2171
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:32,239
engineering approach and then also

2172
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:33,679
once there's again a stable working

2173
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:35,679
version or it seems like the global

2174
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:37,840
reorganization of the tools internally

2175
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,440
is off the table for some period of time

2176
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,480
or something

2177
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,640
then there's more attentional capacity

2178
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,000
for external collaboration

2179
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,239
okay hashtag future all right

2180
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,800
so to kind of recap the next steps for

2181
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,960
the lab

2182
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,120
the main next steps for the lab are the

2183
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,679
next steps within each unit

2184
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:02,400
which we can talk about with i guess we

2185
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,920
can just say the edu is

2186
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,880
working on improving the terms list and

2187
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,280
on

2188
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,440
developing the terms list down the road

2189
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,640
of ontology

2190
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,760
formalism dot coms is interested

2191
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,640
in continuing and expanding the current

2192
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,000
series which are the

2193
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,719
weekly live stream the model stream and

2194
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:21,840
the guest stream

2195
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,440
and then also opening up new series or

2196
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,080
types of content like audio only bite

2197
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,679
sized or

2198
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:32,239
who knows other media that are possible

2199
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:33,280
with tech

2200
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,520
and then in dot tools with a two-fold

2201
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,840
goal of internal and external tool use

2202
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,120
and development

2203
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,159
they're currently assessing

2204
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:45,440
needs and um

2205
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,199
seeing what can be done as evidenced by

2206
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:48,239
these discussions we're just having

2207
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,080
today

2208
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,920
as we're heading this is from the point

2209
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,840
of view of the admin

2210
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,440
as we're heading into our second quarter

2211
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,120
of activity we're

2212
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,040
looking to focus more on preparing

2213
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,880
detailed narratives of active inference

2214
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:01,280
lab

2215
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,560
and for participants to help

2216
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,400
structure the end of onft

2217
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,800
because we're starting on ontology with

2218
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,960
the terms list formal documents are

2219
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,880
related to tools and we have what we

2220
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:15,840
have and again

2221
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,440
we'll locally and globally fine tune as

2222
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,880
we need to

2223
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,320
and then the tools is for now

2224
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,920
the formal documents and communication

2225
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,320
channels but that was the whole point

2226
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,880
of our paper in 2020 which is for remote

2227
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,320
teams and communities

2228
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,679
communities of practice however you want

2229
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,840
to think about it the affordances for

2230
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:34,320
design

2231
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,360
are the ontologies and the formal

2232
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,400
documents

2233
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,719
because those are the tools that the

2234
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:41,920
team uses

2235
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,320
for communication and then what's being

2236
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,679
communicated

2237
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,760
is heterogeneous it could be text it

2238
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,719
could be a

2239
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:51,280
image meme it could be an emoji it could

2240
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,560
be a link to something

2241
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,199
it can be very very specific pieces of

2242
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:55,920
data

2243
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,199
that are getting interpreted in the

2244
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,199
context of what the narrative which is

2245
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:00,320
the end part

2246
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,520
so o f and t are kind of like the

2247
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,360
observables and the systems that we can

2248
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,719
actually increment and focus our

2249
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,320
attention on and

2250
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,080
narrative is something that you can get

2251
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,600
meta about and focus

2252
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,120
on but really it has to be enacted

2253
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,280
and changed through non-equilibrium

2254
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,239
steady state

2255
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:21,440
type design not equilibrium steady state

2256
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:22,719
type design

2257
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:25,440
so the reason for this narrative

2258
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,280
preparation which also alex

2259
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,600
really led the way on with laying out um

2260
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,360
participant life cycle

2261
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,320
from experience with the system school

2262
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,120
we want to

2263
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,400
structure the access and

2264
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,800
interpretability of lab materials

2265
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,800
so people can have their participation

2266
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,199
catalyzed so the rate limiting step is

2267
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:44,159
it that they didn't know where this

2268
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:45,600
spreadsheet was or they

2269
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,040
solid spreadsheet but then didn't

2270
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,520
understand how to get in touch with

2271
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,159
something to schedule this time and then

2272
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:53,280
um

2273
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:56,719
the needs for the lab are in the

2274
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:59,120
edu project any participants who are

2275
01:19:59,120 --> 01:19:59,840
interested

2276
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:04,400
in ontology and uh education making or

2277
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,760
taking coursework

2278
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,719
formalisms learning by doing teaching

2279
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:09,520
dot coms

2280
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,199
is always looking for participants

2281
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:13,760
looking in uh to areas like writing

2282
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,320
teaching connecting audio visual

2283
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,199
production

2284
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:20,639
and events co-organizing then

2285
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:23,760
tools we are looking for participants

2286
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,040
who are interested in technical

2287
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,080
development

2288
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,880
computer science user experiences

2289
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,760
toolkit

2290
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,199
use practices

2291
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:36,560
also accessibility and how tools are

2292
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,639
used across different communities

2293
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:41,360
and then the admin are participants who

2294
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,480
are interested in

2295
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,560
topics like logistics education

2296
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:45,520
communication

2297
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:49,120
tools these are the projects hint

2298
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,000
community mentoring and service so we're

2299
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:52,800
just

2300
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,159
looking to um our diagram

2301
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:59,199
and to how we can increment people as

2302
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:02,480
our system of interest along this

2303
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:03,760
continuum here

2304
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,600
in the context of this evolving

2305
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:06,800
structure

2306
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,159
and that will be cool any thoughts on

2307
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:11,280
next steps or

2308
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:15,840
needs for the lab

2309
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,120
the last questions are just um kind of

2310
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,560
the questions from the regular papers

2311
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:21,600
just

2312
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,880
on the inference side what are we

2313
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,960
curious about learning more about which

2314
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:25,280
is

2315
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,560
kind of an action oriented curiosity

2316
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:32,000
and then how are we wanting to apply

2317
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,880
active inference and then all the

2318
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,159
questions that we ask about

2319
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:39,440
papers but pretty fun thanks everyone

2320
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,560
for the first

2321
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,600
quarterly roundtable

2322
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,400
pretty fun any last thoughts otherwise

2323
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,879
that's good

2324
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:52,560
alright so thanks for participating and

2325
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,880
see you later bye
