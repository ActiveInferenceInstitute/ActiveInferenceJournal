00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,320
four that was our

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,440
first ever playing of a musical intro by

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,320
d schwakoff so thank you for that and

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,120
happy birthday to yvonne

so welcome to this

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,680
fourth lab meeting to our end of 2021

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,640
discussion not quite but almost

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,119
welcome to activelab everyone

14
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,000
we are a participatory online lab that

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,720
is communicating learning and practicing

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,880
applied active inference you can find us

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,759
at the links here on this slide

18
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,680
this is recorded and an archived live

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,200
stream so please provide us with

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,400
feedback so that we can improve our work

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
all backgrounds and perspectives are

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,600
welcome here

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,520
and we'll be following good video

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,280
etiquette for live streams so just make

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,840
sure to raise your hand in jitsi because

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,439
no one will be called on but if you want

27
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,840
to add anything please feel free just

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,399
raise your hand in jitsi and we will get

29
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,640
to it

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,040
today the way that it's going to work

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,920
we're going to address the lab scale

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,840
we'll have introductions then we'll talk

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,399
about some updates at the lab scale

34
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,960
and then we'll go into spending most of

35
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,759
the meeting discussing the updates at

36
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,640
the organizational unit scale and then

37
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,600
talk about the future but first

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,239
we can say hello and just introduce

39
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,000
ourselves

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,560

in a new language and write code in

51
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,400
another new language for a while

52
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,599

80
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,000
well thanks everyone for joining this

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040

will join in um and anybody who's

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,879
watching live can just ask a question in

84
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,360
the live chat

85
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,439
we're going to start with the

86
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,399
updates at the lab scale

87
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,238
so actin flab updates

88
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,040
we started this year

89
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,919
with

90
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:24,720
a

91
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,639
interactive

92
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,160
and participatory mission slash vision

93
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,840
slash project

94
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,520
which was to

95
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,400
ask whether active inference could

96
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,759
develop into a community and a field and

97
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,600
all that comes along with that

98
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,199
while also

99
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,520
drawing on the best practices

100
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,639
that we saw elsewhere especially in

101
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,240
systems engineering

102
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,199
and

103
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,520
community of practice that yvonne and

104
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,680
alex had a lot of familiarity with

105
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,160
and other experiences that we and every

106
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,120
participant brings to the table

107
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,800
uh having a community for active

108
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
inference that was participatory and

109
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,840
accessible for those with many different

110
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
backgrounds and trainings

111
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,639
having a body of knowledge that includes

112
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,880
courses and competencies things we'll

113
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,560
talk about soon

114
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,080
and also

115
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,360
reflected the nature of modern work and

116
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,560
professionalism and collaboration so

117
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,840
these are just a few of the things that

118
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,800
we wrote down long long ago

119
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
and it's still a living

120
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,000
document so please come get involved

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,320
all actions are participatory stephen

122
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,000
i was thinking we could also say a

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,960
community of communities a nested

124
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,639
set of uh

125
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,680
communities uh inside a community that

126
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,360
overlap in the kind of

127
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,800
markovian sense

128
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,840
yes

129
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,880
let's

130
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,199
graphically look at that

131
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,919
so this is a little updated graphic and

132
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,960
i hope it looks good for everyone

133
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,240
so on the right side in the gray

134
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,880
background we have the structure of the

135
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,000
active lab itself so this is the lab

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,919
scale that we're addressing in this

137
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,280
section

138
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,800
we have three

139
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,199
primary organizational units which are

140
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,319
coms communications edu education and

141
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,000
tools tools

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,400
we also have dot admin but they won't be

143
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,639
presenting on projects today

144
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,000
also in the active lab we have some of

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,160
the pieces of the puzzle that we have

146
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,639
gleaned from systems engineering

147
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,800
community and other areas

148
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,240
and we're going to be talking more about

149
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,560
the advisory board soon

150
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,800
and about other initiatives that we're

151
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,639
undertaking so that's sort of inside the

152
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,440
lab this is the lab scale under the lab

153
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,199
blanket we have our organizational units

154
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,720
dot coms

155
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,599
is

156
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,000
outputting different products into the

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,240
broader ecosystem like

158
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,120
externalities or runoff and so that's

159
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,120
kind of this teal scroll image

160
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,599
and coms is really our primary interface

161
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,199
with the external

162
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,560
ecosystem

163
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,080
we can think about this external

164
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,960
ecosystem as containing all kinds of

165
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,880
different things in it

166
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,160
so there's

167
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,479
artifacts there's texts

168
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,560
like papers and videos and all kinds of

169
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,520
other

170
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,400
uh

171
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,560
documents and artifacts and then there's

172
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,720
also people and their skills and their

173
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,840
connections

174
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,560
so we can start in with this red bounded

175
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,840
box of the current body of

176
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,240
relevant publications which as we've

177
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,000
seen stretches

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,880
back

179
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,120
and forward and left and right so

180
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,199
there's a lot of relevant publications

181
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,120
but there is a relevant body of

182
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,479
publications

183
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,360
and we have used the live stream format

184
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,960
kind of like a journal club to go into

185
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,720
the publications themselves each live

186
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,319
stream is centered around a publication

187
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,199
which we'll talk more about in comms

188
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,039
comms produces a guest stream which

189
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,360
bridges from that circle of established

190
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,599
knowledge and people into broader

191
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,759
interactions amongst participants in the

192
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,160
topics that they're interested in

193
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,840
like a two-way street between let's just

194
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,039
say active inference and field x so some

195
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,160
people are going to be hearing about

196
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,759
active inference for the first time

197
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,440
others are going to be inside of active

198
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,039
inference hearing about x for the first

199
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,560
time and then we look forward to having

200
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
increasingly broad avenues to

201
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,519
communicate like org stream that help to

202
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,640
bridge even one step further and outside

203
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,240
of the realm of just research and

204
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,479
development may be thinking more about

205
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,479
practice and all the different ways that

206
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,399
people around the world are

207
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,959
engaged in practices every day that may

208
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,600
be related to or influenced by active

209
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,320
inference so here's kind of this nested

210
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,680
ecosystem

211
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,959
of uh circles like an onion around the

212
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,200
active inference literature sensu

213
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,680
strictu and then all the ways that our

214
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,000
outputs into the ecosystem help to

215
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,480
scaffold and modify and

216
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,920
catalyze sense making in that

217
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,200
environment which can be overwhelming

218
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,240
also

219
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,560
which we uh picked up on from the

220
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,959
systems engineering practices and

221
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,360
community organization we've engaged in

222
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,040
several development initiatives which

223
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,800
we'll talk more about in the sections

224
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,880
that are relevant but the ontology

225
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,680
working group is uh upskilling and

226
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,480
learning about ontology and the systems

227
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,080
thinking reading discussion group is

228
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,760
doing similar for systems thinking so

229
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,920
we'll talk more about those but this is

230
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,040
just

231
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
our initial forays

232
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,600
into some of the kinds of products and

233
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,399
lab functions that are important and we

234
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,120
hope serve a positive role inside the

235
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,160
lab and effect a positive outcome

236
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,959
outside the lab in our local niche so

237
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,360
there's our internal states

238
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,720
over on the right side and then there's

239
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
our niche modification

240
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,760
products

241
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,399
in the left side

242
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,640
any comments that somebody would like to

243
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,600
add here

244
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,319
uh stephen

245
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,360
yeah i suppose

246
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,760
i like to think about how

247
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,680
the ontology working group is is

248
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,079
hopefully helping to bridge

249
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,640
and fill a gap in the in the complexity

250
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,440
of

251
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,480
um

252
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,640
all the different ways that active

253
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,279
inference gets used so it's kind of

254
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,040
hopefully going to help for that applied

255
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,959
active inference to be

256
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,240
more multi-disciplinary

257
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,120
interdisciplinary transdisciplinary

258
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,839
no small task but i think it's a useful

259
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,079
endeavor thank you agreed

260
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,040
and there's the ontology itself um

261
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,079
as a product in the niche

262
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,560
so multiple representations are very

263
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,720
important for distributed systems for

264
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,640
complex systems this is kind of a

265
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,000
snapshot visual layout but we can also

266
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,440
look at more of a narrative overview

267
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,519
so just to recap

268
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,360
during 2020

269
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,399
viatgan at all that's alex

270
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,640
and others including many on this

271
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,320
discussion now

272
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,959
collaborated on a

273
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,120
paper that was released as a pre-print

274
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,760
on september 9th 2020 called active

275
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,519
inference and behavior engineering for

276
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,320
teams so this is as close to a

277
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,560
prerequisite for understanding the

278
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,040
narrative and the context of the actin

279
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,000
flab as exists at this point

280
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,200
after

281
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,120
completing that paper

282
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,360
we sent out an initial call for

283
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,440
collaboration with an active inference

284
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,480
lab

285
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,720
and that was at the end of 2020.

286
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,760
during 2021 we engaged starting at the

287
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,839
beginning of january in our first year

288
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,639
of active lab activities many of which

289
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,560
we're going to be talking about today

290
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,600
that's kind of our recap moment

291
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
um and then we're going to also be

292
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,680
looking forward to 2022.

293
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,200
so this is like a

294
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,399
like a sandwich we're going to have the

295
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,800
two pieces of bread right now

296
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,320
and then that will be our appetizer and

297
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,560
then we're gonna spend most of it on the

298
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,680
meat itself so it's an odd sandwich but

299
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,920
please what do you expect

300
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,600
in 2022 we're going to do a few things

301
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,240
similarly and a few things differently

302
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,000
so on the

303
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,079
similar but different wavelength

304
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,600
we are going to be continuing to

305
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,399
implement our projects and plans within

306
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,480
each organizational unit so that's what

307
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,560
we're going to discuss today in the

308
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
organizational unit sections it's what

309
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,440
we talk about every week when we meet

310
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,160
in the organizational units so that kind

311
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,120
of

312
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,480
homeostatic or functional operation of

313
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,560
the lab is the substance of what we're

314
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,720
actually doing and so that is going to

315
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,000
continue

316
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,200
we're also

317
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,920
bringing a few new ideas and structures

318
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920
to the table and practices

319
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,320
so one is the inaugural advisory board

320
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,920
cohort which we'll talk about on the

321
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,120
next slide

322
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,519
and then a little bit on the um

323
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,360
not having their own slide of their own

324
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,680
but important ideas that we look forward

325
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,800
and call for participation around

326
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,440
formalizing the lab governance there

327
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,880
have been so many important and

328
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,160
interesting

329
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,800
governance questions that have arisen

330
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,639
during the past year

331
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,000
as well as

332
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,240
everyone experiencing similar challenges

333
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,560
in their own located in online teams so

334
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,720
that's something we want to understand

335
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,839
better

336
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,199
and then also as we learn more and

337
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,760
embody and enact decentralized science

338
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,440
or desai

339
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
everything that comes along with this

340
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,760
from who's doing research what questions

341
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,600
are they asking how is it funded how is

342
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,920
it communicated how is it verified the

343
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,760
whole research stack is evolving

344
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,560
so

345
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,360
welcome to the 2020s and we want to

346
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,720
understand

347
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,199
how we as a lab can

348
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,480
take the best

349
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,480
aspects that are emerging from this

350
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,360
domain of desai while not getting lost

351
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,519
in the technicalities or committing

352
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,480
grievous ecological errors

353
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,320
anything else that anyone wants to

354
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,000
address these were just a few of the

355
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,760
kind of top level points that we all

356
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,959
worked on when we were preparing the

357
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,920
slides dean

358
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,320
yeah i think this is a fantastic summary

359
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,000
and i think for people who are kind of

360
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,680
new to this or maybe

361
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,560
are

362
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,480
still constantly sort of evolving their

363
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,720
basic understanding of this

364
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,959
um i think what we're what we're seeing

365
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,800
right here on this slide

366
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,920
is

367
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,040
the tension between a lot of constant

368
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,720
updating which is which is kind of what

369
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,639
the active inference tool

370
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,720
um enables and then the piece about okay

371
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,079
so these are the things that we've

372
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,040
established the kind of top-down

373
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,480
consistent constant stable things

374
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,360
that we think um have some shelf life

375
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,040
and can carry forward so i think by

376
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,839
showing this sort of chronologically

377
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,480
we're sharing with the audience the fact

378
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,680
that there is a tension there isn't one

379
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
constant that is going to take over and

380
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,079
there isn't a constant updating mean

381
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,680
we're always throwing out the baby with

382
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,000
the bathwater and i think

383
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,320
you may not necessarily

384
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,160
hear or see that in a timeline but i

385
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,680
think that's front and center in terms

386
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,199
of how we organize ourselves we organize

387
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,880
ourselves with the

388
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,160
with the intention of remaining in a in

389
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,600
a in a tension that constant updating

390
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,839
versus what's stable and is carried

391
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,600
forward

392
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,240
thanks dean and welcome blue great point

393
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,720
and it is like the nesting of models in

394
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,199
active inference where there's a slower

395
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,120
tick at the deeper

396
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,199
scale of the model so every year there's

397
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,800
12 ticks for months and then within a

398
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,880
month there's more and more

399
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,519
and that takes us to the advisory board

400
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,519
which is something structurally that

401
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,040
we're introducing in 2022

402
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,759
so

403
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,160
this lab advisory board first we can say

404
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,519
it's not a formal voting or governance

405
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,600
hashtag not legal advice not financial

406
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,079
advice they're not our managers

407
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,199
it's a advisory board

408
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,480
the advisory board is helping to move

409
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,079
the temporal scale of the labs

410
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,720
organizing from the kind of day-to-day

411
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,639
sometimes it felt like we were just

412
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,079
putting out little surprises all the

413
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,040
time

414
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,120
to the annual scale and beyond so as we

415
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,839
think about deepening the deepest level

416
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,279
of our model

417
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,839
for vision and for alignment while also

418
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,000
refining the finer points in our model

419
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,160
that's kind of like the icicating is

420
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,600
like the micro scale and then we have

421
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,800
deeper levels like semantics of vision

422
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,720
so that's kind of the way that we think

423
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
about these temporal scales

424
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,160
and we're already in the process of

425
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,360
onboarding individuals with expertise in

426
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,920
a variety of important domains

427
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,000
but please contact us if you have any

428
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
interest before

429
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,199
say the middle of december of 21

430
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,199
and you might want to be involved in

431
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,000
this inaugural cohort of the annual role

432
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,119
at this point for the advisory board

433
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,720
or we'll be there to

434
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,959
onboard you in 23.

435
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,959
what we do when we onboard them

436
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,799
in the advisory board just to be clear

437
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,000
and because many of them will be

438
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,520
listening to this

439
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,880
discussion

440
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,640
first we make personal contacts with

441
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,960
organizers and have consensus amongst

442
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,360
lab organizers about that invitation

443
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,799
and we'll have more governance for that

444
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,840
future

445
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,880
we then

446
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,400
have a live meeting with a potential

447
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,799
board member and assign them to one or

448
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,520
more organizational units so

449
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,240
no side doors no free floating

450
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,880
i'm here but where everybody is in an

451
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,559
organizational unit

452
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,160
and then we describe the specific

453
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,480
synchronous and asynchronous affordances

454
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,000
and roles and requirements that the

455
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,480
advisory board members will engage in so

456
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,640
it's not just an open-ended ask for you

457
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,799
to do work it's actually a very

458
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,120
structured conversation that will

459
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,679
hopefully be win-win so

460
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,280
we're really looking forward to the

461
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,039
advisory board's

462
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,280
service does anyone want to add any

463
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,360
comments on the advisory board

464
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,440
and we'll probably hear more from them

465
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,600
once we've confirmed the personnel but

466
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,440
right now it's just a um we're still in

467
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,400
the onboarding phase

468
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,640
okay any other lab scale comments before

469
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,320
we go into the organizational units

470
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,039
okay

471
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,080
our first

472
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,880
organizational unit as a educational

473
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,600
nonprofit is edu

474
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,159
education

475
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,240
what we're going to do for each of the

476
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,919
organizational units is we've just

477
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,320
copied from our coda

478
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,919
document which we'll talk more about

479
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,720
we've just copied the ongoing projects

480
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,760
so the idea is these kinds of single

481
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,039
source of truth

482
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,120
and centralized ways of working together

483
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,320
allow us to have an asynchronous lab and

484
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,080
then also when we need to present and

485
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,400
share we just take screenshots or copy

486
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,160
out tables so that keeps it really

487
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,840
efficient these are the six projects or

488
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,720
five projects that we have in edu so

489
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
these are not the total scope of all the

490
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,640
projects happening by participants these

491
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,760
are within the organizational units

492
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,440
markup blanket

493
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,919
the goal of edu is to scaffold the

494
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,919
participatory and dynamic active

495
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,000
inference body of knowledge

496
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,960
so these five projects are the current

497
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,400
active threads and if you see a space to

498
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,480
improve one of these or add another one

499
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,600
then

500
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,200
get involved

501
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,720
so on to the first

502
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,559
one of these projects this is the

503
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,880
fristen symposium transcript so i'll

504
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,559
summarize it and then dave if you'd like

505
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,960
to add a comment or anyone else

506
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,600
so in june 2021 we had our first applied

507
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,360
active inference symposium with

508
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,200
professor carl fristen

509
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,280
and each of the three organizational

510
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,320
units had about a one hour session

511
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,400
the videos are watchable

512
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,960
and many insightful things were said and

513
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,080
discussed

514
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,720
so the idea of this project is to use

515
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,919
automated speech-to-text processing plus

516
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,240
manual copy editing and enrichment of

517
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,320
those texts to get an accurate

518
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,200
transcript of the discussions so that we

519
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
can upload it as a preprint get a doi

520
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,600
and make it citable so instead of oh i

521
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,000
think somewhere somebody said this thing

522
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,039
let's have in-text something we can copy

523
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,240
out

524
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,600
and connect core terms to translations

525
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,760
use it for the captioning of the youtube

526
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,919
videos for accessibility

527
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,240
and then looking beyond this one

528
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,320
important symposium we had this year

529
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,640
towards transcripts for maybe all live

530
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,600
streams

531
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,000
and integration more

532
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,919
thoroughly with the ontology so

533
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,400
translation of terms linking to other

534
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,720
knowledge resources so that's the

535
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,679
fristen symposium transcript dave or

536
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,280
anyone else do you want to add a comment

537
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,120
yeah um

538
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,080
the

539
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,440
three

540
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,440
transcripts are um in daniels and blues

541
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,520
and some other people's hands

542
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,480
um

543
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,450
and um

544
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,440
[Music]

545
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,360
as much markup as folks want to do

546
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,360
that's fine if you want to just take

547
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,000
what i've got and make them perfect and

548
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
get all the cross references and so on

549
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,640
that's great if you want to just um

550
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,480
mark up uh

551
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,039
the change of speakers and maybe throw

552
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,200
in some obvious paragraph

553
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,679
terminations just empty lines that's

554
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,039
that's fine

555
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,200
um and i have the option later on of

556
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,480
just doing some some automated cleanup

557
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,559
uh trying to find end of sentences that

558
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,400
aren't marked otherwise

559
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,480
but um

560
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,840
you know i think this is going to be

561
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,400
somewhat quicker than just taking the

562
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,919
raw youtube

563
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,320
output well we shall see

564
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,640
uh next year after some other things i'm

565
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,960
going to go in and improve the program a

566
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,799
lot more do the stuff that i thought i

567
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,880
would have finished by now but

568
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
you know when i can't change the parser

569
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,559
and i have to live with the parts that

570
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,320
i've gotten it's only got half of the

571
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,960
vocabulary and i gotta get around that

572
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,320
it takes longer so that's good

573
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,559
if you can't pass the one you want

574
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,320
parse the one you have steven

575
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,640
yeah i was thinking that one thing to

576
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,400
think about when we have these talks

577
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,840
with um

578
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,240
kristen and these presentations is

579
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,520
we're able to as well as clarify the

580
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,360
stuff which is um

581
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
already possible to do

582
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,440
and separate it from

583
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,799
what is um

584
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,039
you know is is beyond our knowledge at

585
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,440
the moment we get this zone of proximal

586
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,400
development

587
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
the vaikovsky which our russian friends

588
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,360
will be

589
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,000
very fond of um so that idea of where we

590
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,159
can be we get a sense of where the sort

591
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,520
of the extension of what the established

592
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,880
knowledge might be and i think that's

593
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,559
also a useful thing

594
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,440
to clarify um because that's also part

595
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,039
of where this applications are going to

596
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,960
be

597
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
good point we're not just

598
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,760
recapping memorized facts

599
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,159
that's the first in symposium transcript

600
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,200
the second project in edu is the

601
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,000
ontology working group so in ontology

602
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,880
working group we are reading this

603
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,159
textbook by adam peace the ontology

604
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,720
uh a practical guide textbook

605
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,880
and the bigger picture here is that

606
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,559
there's a continuum

607
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,520
of formality and expressivity of what is

608
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,120
called ontology ranging on the left side

609
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,600
from mere terms lists

610
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,919
through more structured and enriched

611
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,480
terms lists like structured glossaries

612
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,400
and informed hierarchies

613
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,640
verging towards

614
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,480
more formal data structures that allow

615
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,080
increasing computational

616
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,120
power

617
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,039
in many different dimensions

618
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,640
and over here

619
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,520
the sun rising in the east of sumo

620
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
and uh sumo's the language and the

621
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,120
framework that's discussed in the

622
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,240
textbook suggested upper merged ontology

623
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,559
so that's what we're learning about

624
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,640
in the ontology working group and we

625
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,240
meet every two weeks

626
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,799
we discuss what we've read and worked

627
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,279
through the exercises together

628
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,320
and

629
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,880
over the course of the year the ontology

630
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,360
working group has been kind of pushing

631
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,960
like a little train

632
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,080
towards further and further right

633
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,120
from

634
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,919
um

635
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,600
just the terms list that we started at

636
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,200
in the beginning of the year

637
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,799
to a lot more which we'll talk about

638
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,720
soon but the ontology working group is

639
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,200
specifically those who are learning

640
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,720
ontology by doing and reading the

641
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,080
textbook

642
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,120
any

643
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,960
thoughts or comments on ontology working

644
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,480
group and we'll talk about the ontology

645
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,559
more broadly in just a few slides

646
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,720
okay

647
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,159
so another

648
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,000
development initiative

649
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,120
which um i'll allow yvonne to summarize

650
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,039
is the systems thinking reading and

651
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,039
discussion group so yvonne maybe you

652
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,120
could summarize the intention or the

653
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,760
background here

654
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,880
yes thank you

655
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,919
well

656
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,720
in initially the system thinking course

657
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,320
was represented by system management

658
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,640
school in moscow and we decided to

659
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,760
provide

660
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,279
a common language for the lab

661
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,120
all of us from

662
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,520
different domains with different

663
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,400
perspectives

664
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,600
and we decided that it will be

665
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,240
somewhere we can

666
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,159
understand

667
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,039
one another better

668
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,520
here i

669
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,840
gave some small example when

670
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,559
where one

671
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,000
object can describe

672
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,840
a totally different

673
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,000
one person can hear can see here a face

674
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,679
and another

675
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,559
vest

676
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,400
and once

677
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,880
all of them

678
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,120
talk about leaps they totally

679
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,760
to

680
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,720
miss

681
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,159
understanding

682
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,640
and to prevent this

683
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,279
um situation

684
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,880
this group

685
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,520
could you could you

686
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,880
texts

687
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,880
next yes yes

688
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,039
there is the interface

689
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,400
of the course

690
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,440
is this is uh online course based on

691
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,880
iso standards and for documents

692
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,760
that

693
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,840
include system approach

694
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,640
in engineering and

695
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,360
uh

696
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,640
in different

697
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,120
a lot of

698
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,640
fields

699
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,960
and

700
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,600
of course

701
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,960
the course

702
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,640
has a

703
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,480
list of concepts that

704
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,880
you can actually interconnect it with

705
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,960
the active inference

706
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,640
concepts

707
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,960
and

708
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,000
every every participant

709
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,360
can now

710
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,159
uh upload it to the course

711
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,919
and

712
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:44,960
in

713
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,360
appropriate

714
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,240
way

715
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,799
start to learning system and

716
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,520
thinking as

717
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,240
system management school providers

718
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,840
of course has

719
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,000
eight sections now a lot of tasks

720
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,279
to

721
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,360
check

722
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,760
your understanding

723
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,559
you can find all information

724
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,960
about the course on systemschool.com

725
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,760
thank you yvonne and also you and others

726
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,480
translated it from the russian to this

727
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,120
english course which were beta testing

728
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,919
so it's being offered for free and we

729
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,320
provide them feedback so it's a cool

730
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,559
relationship between our groups that

731
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,200
helps benefit our participants

732
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,840
any comments on st rdg

733
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,480
one of the main projects in edu

734
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,919
something we spend half or more of each

735
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,159
meeting on is the actual active

736
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,559
inference ontology itself

737
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,919
so here we're showing um just the top

738
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,600
page of the working active inference

739
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,240
ontology we released versions um more

740
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,000
stable versions

741
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,679
earlier in the year

742
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:02,960
um

743
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,840
we're working through the core terms

744
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,320
and then for each core term getting a

745
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,960
bunch of references and quotable citable

746
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,120
definitions so not saying that they're

747
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,679
the truth just how it was used you know

748
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,200
a system is a or blanket states are

749
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,080
then

750
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,000
each week we have a discussion

751
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,600
on these terms

752
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
one term per discussion and we kind of

753
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,360
go deep and hear many different

754
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,000
perspectives and gather more resources

755
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,919
and then we work towards

756
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,200
proposed

757
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,000
synthetic definitions that synthesize in

758
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,360
the term of synthetic not artificial

759
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,840
that bring together a few of the senses

760
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,080
or clarify is there just one sense or

761
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,600
are there multiple senses that the term

762
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
is being used

763
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,760
and then the terms themselves

764
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,440
as well as how the terms are connected

765
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,720
to one another

766
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,200
will form some of the early versions of

767
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,440
our educational materials

768
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,080
so how about that five minute video that

769
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,080
everyone has always wanted about what is

770
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,240
a markov blanket or

771
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,480
that five minute video about how is a

772
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,840
generative model

773
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,240
related to epistemic and pragmatic value

774
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,000
those are the kinds of questions that we

775
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,159
want to have like a video

776
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,399
but more importantly this deep knowledge

777
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,880
linking underlying so just that's the

778
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,880
first cover sheet and then i'll get to

779
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,760
you steven um the second sheet

780
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,240
has translations of those core terms

781
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,440
into

782
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,799
human languages

783
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,200
so we have russian portuguese spanish

784
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,960
french and italian

785
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,279
very well completed

786
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,679
we're definitely looking for more

787
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,559
languages to be added so if you're

788
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,559
speaking or learning

789
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,640
any language

790
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,840
then it would be awesome even just to do

791
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,720
two

792
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,200
or five words terms because that helps

793
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,080
modify the niche so that stigmatically

794
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,799
another language speaker may be able to

795
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,559
pick up where you left off so this would

796
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,200
be extremely helpful and important

797
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,399
global work

798
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,760
for somebody who speaks one of these

799
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,519
languages or any language to start to

800
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,880
pin together

801
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,279
just with the terms at first this active

802
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,919
inference corpus which is primarily

803
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,880
written in english as a natural language

804
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,039
mathematics and computer languages as

805
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,279
technical languages and so we'll be able

806
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,640
to

807
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,799
operate better across those different

808
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,960
human and technical languages and then

809
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,440
the last sheets of this tab

810
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,840
here just show the supplemental terms

811
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,320
and equations so the equations that's

812
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,480
going to be a long game with

813
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,320
corralling the formalism

814
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,840
and how that has evolved and how

815
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,960
different letters have meant different

816
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
things through different times but then

817
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,200
also supplemental terms there's so many

818
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
fun terms that come up in our

819
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,760
discussions but they're not necessarily

820
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,840
core or they may be we may

821
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,600
update them and put them in the core

822
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,799
later but

823
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,480
things that people bring up

824
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,600
that like

825
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,519
are cool and important to learn about

826
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,000
and link around we can add that to the

827
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,080
the term supplement so we kind of get to

828
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,799
have a big gutter with a term supplement

829
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,960
while also having a very

830
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,799
curated core terms list that will be the

831
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,559
basis of education so stephen

832
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,799
yeah i'd just like to also thank again

833
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,399
that ivan and alex there for bringing in

834
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,240
that system's work

835
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,760
i think it's really valuable and i think

836
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,440
this

837
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,559
as you mentioned there the different

838
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,880
languages are also useful because

839
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,320
even different languages have different

840
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,240
ways of thinking about time they have

841
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,080
different cultural so if we're looking

842
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,679
at pluralism

843
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,960
um but also trying to clarify and get

844
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
ways to have

845
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,200
common languages this is going to be

846
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,840
actually extends that

847
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,679
and one other thing i'd like to mention

848
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:48,880
is that

849
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,720
it can build the bridge with the field

850
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,279
of coaching i think that coaching

851
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,600
systemic coaching and ontological

852
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,240
coaching are two very fast growing

853
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,320
fields and i know from the literature

854
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,559
that they're really moving into looking

855
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,919
at um

856
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,279
pluralism

857
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,799
and different types of social

858
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,159
construction

859
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,600
and i think

860
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,840
so this this

861
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,440
before it's a bit of a bridge too far

862
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,279
but i think with this work as well from

863
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,039
alex and ivan

864
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,039
and this other work with the ontology

865
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:19,919
that

866
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,679
is starting to make it not bridge too

867
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,960
far hopefully it's it's it's spannable

868
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,840
thanks

869
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,120
very cool

870
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,640
the last project to discuss in edu

871
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,120
is course development itself you know

872
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,840
what people expect of a edu to engage in

873
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,080
and we know this is one of the most

874
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,440
important projects and we also knew

875
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,200
that ontology

876
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,440
not necessarily the practice of ontology

877
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,159
itself but this core term ontology would

878
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,240
be the backbone of the course

879
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,679
development

880
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,399
broadly in this project were interested

881
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,640
in how to provide the affordance for

882
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
people to learn and apply and

883
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,120
communicate active inference

884
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,360
we had great discussions during the year

885
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,159
on live streams and in edu

886
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,760
about instructionism and interactionism

887
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,918
and how do we prevent this from just

888
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:14,960
being

889
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,320
a sort of plug and chug course how do we

890
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,879
enable interactions and

891
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,719
his own approximate development like was

892
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,440
being described and this tension that

893
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,280
dean described earlier as well between

894
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,480
the sort of

895
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,960
the technical the minute particulars and

896
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,480
the big picture and the unknown and the

897
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,800
thirdness and the betweenness

898
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,079
and um with a special focus on

899
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,239
applied active inference and also

900
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,399
enabling this education for individuals

901
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,119
of many different backgrounds

902
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,679
inside academia outside academia there's

903
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,079
a whole world out there and there are

904
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,800
not paths from here to there so that's

905
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,399
what course development is going to be

906
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,440
exploring

907
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,359
in 2022 and beyond especially

908
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,800
everyone is welcome to get involved with

909
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,920
all projects but in edu if knowledge

910
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,160
engineering sounds interesting to you

911
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
whether it's the translations or diving

912
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,760
into the literature to find definitions

913
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,280
and references

914
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,359
bringing your experience on curriculum

915
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,480
development

916
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,040
or learning by doing on the ontology

917
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,280
those capture a few of the projects that

918
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,520
we talked about here and that's some of

919
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,000
the main practices that are involved in

920
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,359
edu

921
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,040
any dot edu thoughts

922
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,240
okay

923
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,479
dean

924
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,079
oh wait unmuted then continue

925
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,479
dean

926
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,440
sorry about that there's some cultures

927
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,800
that

928
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
we're taking a very western-centric

929
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,880
approach to this which is fine we have

930
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,720
to start somewhere and i think that

931
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,079
there are some cultures that simply

932
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,920
won't have words

933
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,400
or verbs that describe some of the

934
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,480
things that happen in their

935
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,119
particular niche that those with a

936
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,760
western view don't necessarily have the

937
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,359
terminology for and i think we're

938
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,320
keeping that aspect of this open when

939
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,839
we're trying to figure out whether or

940
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,560
not there can be a bridge from calgary

941
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,280
to moscow or if there are other ways

942
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,680
of being able to transport ourselves and

943
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,760
migrate that are better than trying to

944
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,160
put a solid structure in

945
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,920
so sometimes when we're working on this

946
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,760
ontology piece

947
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,320
we might only be able to collapse to two

948
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,119
or three different ways of describing

949
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,839
two faces and a vase and i think that's

950
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,599
one of the other things we we want to

951
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,680
let people understand is that there is

952
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,040
no one

953
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,839
singular answer to this that when active

954
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,560
inference is actually being used we

955
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,079
distribute and there are going to be

956
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,280
times when

957
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,920
we can agree to disagree on how to

958
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,400
describe something

959
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,040
thank you dean it's like there's

960
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,920
what was said in first in 2013 the paper

961
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,240
there's how you just said it right now

962
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,839
there's how blue's gonna say it in six

963
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:12,800
months

964
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,880
and those are like observations those

965
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,599
are not the latent hidden state even if

966
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,240
they all concur that isn't alone

967
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,320
evidence that that is the hidden state

968
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,920
so we actually can take that kind of

969
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,440
signal processing

970
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,160
perspective and integrate it with ideas

971
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,560
like pluralism and distributed systems

972
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,800
to talk about how to have inclusive

973
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
education

974
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,359
so in comms the second

975
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,079
organizational unit we are interested in

976
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,680
communication

977
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,960
the goals of this

978
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,520
organizational unit are to organize the

979
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,320
internal lab project and activities kind

980
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,400
of the connective tissue circulatory

981
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,280
system

982
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,200
and also to carry out all forms of

983
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,680
communication with external entities so

984
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,560
if.edu needs to send an email they can

985
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,720
just pass it to coms and say please

986
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,440
email these nine people with this

987
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,560
information

988
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,520
thank you

989
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,440
and dot coms loves emails

990
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,440
the first project well there's uh six

991
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,520
projects on here

992
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,160
live streams social media podcast end of

993
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,960
2021 treat monthly newsletter and

994
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,040
updating the coda and the playbook so

995
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,000
first on the live streams of which we're

996
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,760
in one now

997
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,800
we had

998
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,040
a fun year of live streams the live

999
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,440
streams technically began before octave

1000
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,560
lab in july 2020

1001
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,599
but

1002
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,200
we have um

1003
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,880
multiple series

1004
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,760
of live streams and we've done

1005
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,000
well over 100

1006
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,839
total 85 around papers and then 14 guest

1007
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,920
streams presentations

1008
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,960
seven

1009
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,560
model streams and three math streams

1010
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,640
which are more technical

1011
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,160
and then um

1012
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,240
roundtable meetings like this one

1013
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,640
orgstream is a new series that just

1014
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,800
began we have one video in there about

1015
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,880
organizational design practice and then

1016
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,920
the applied active inference symposium

1017
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,520
and

1018
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,760
lest anyone think the year is over

1019
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,599
we still have some upcoming papers to

1020
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,720
read

1021
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,440
for 32 still cast the chaos markov

1022
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,720
blankets in the first two weeks of

1023
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,520
november 33 thinking like a state with

1024
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,680
avel serval

1025
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,160
33 in the last two weeks of november and

1026
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,640
then we'll have two more papers probably

1027
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,160
that we'll discuss in december but just

1028
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,000
haven't set them yet

1029
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,720
so we'll also be probably moving this to

1030
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,359
coda having a nice

1031
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,440
way to look at the past and present live

1032
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,960
streams

1033
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,800
but for now

1034
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,359
if you want to give a live stream

1035
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,200
like give a presentation and or

1036
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,280
discussion for a guest stream on your

1037
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,040
research or your thinking or your

1038
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,240
application

1039
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,599
just let us know

1040
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,520
and also if you want to suggest somebody

1041
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,920
who would be good for a live stream

1042
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,760
whether it's just like i read this paper

1043
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,520
could you reach out to this person or

1044
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,599
whether it's somebody you know and you'd

1045
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,240
like to co-organize the event or just

1046
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,440
make the connect we're planning for 2022

1047
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,680
so that would be great if anyone

1048
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,760
listening has any thoughts or wants to

1049
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,760
present

1050
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,200
social media

1051
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,460
um

1052
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,040
[Music]

1053
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,319
broadly just to give two updates we have

1054
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,800
over a thousand twitter

1055
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,079
followers and uh over 600 subscribers on

1056
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,200
youtube

1057
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,079
so

1058
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,760
the slow and steady

1059
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,119
accumulation

1060
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,280
there

1061
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,200
on the podcast front uh then i'll pass

1062
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,880
this to blue so anything you want to add

1063
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,240
on social media blue and then please

1064
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,200

1065
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,599
sure so just also on the social media

1066
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,640
front um i just kind of took over uh the

1067
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,040
facebook page and um or or took

1068
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,440
responsibility for you know promoting

1069
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,359
the actin flab on facebook so if you're

1070
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,680
on facebook um find us there because

1071
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,520
that's brand new and we have like i

1072
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,520
don't know a whole 10 likes on our page

1073
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,280
or something like that but but we've

1074
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,960
hooked up the podcast which will feed

1075
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,119
directly into the facebook page so if

1076
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,359
you get updates that way that's helpful

1077
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,960
and we'll try to post the live streams

1078
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,079
on there as well

1079
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:16,800
so

1080
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,040
yeah new social media venue is always

1081
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,079
good we're also on discord right so um

1082
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,560
if you're on discord and and do that too

1083
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,040
um there's more social media ways to get

1084
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,400
a hold of us

1085
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,079
and then podcast i think we're up to

1086
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,560
like 30 episodes of the podcast at this

1087
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,640
point and we're starting to

1088
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,520
codify them um with links to each

1089
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,480
episode and the associated live streams

1090
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,200
and maybe in some future rendition of

1091
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,800
the website we'll be able to make all

1092
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,480
that information publicly available so

1093
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,800
that people can see who participated and

1094
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,480
what the topics are because frequently

1095
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,560
the podcast will just be like the markov

1096
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,720
blanket um even though the paper is is a

1097
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,319
much broader

1098
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,800
paper or topic so the podcasts are

1099
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,960
coming along and yeah get in touch i

1100
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,319
mean there's always room for people to

1101
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,760
participate i've been doing a lot of

1102
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,400
them um also we're looking for music so

1103
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,800
if you want to submit some musical riffs

1104
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,760
to us uh for evaluation um definitely

1105
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,839
that's something on my on my to-do list

1106
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,240
is to like get an intro lead for for the

1107
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,800
lab podcast and if if you're interested

1108
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,720
in podcasting or audio production at all

1109
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,119
um get in touch it's been i've just kind

1110
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,480
of learned and figured it out but i'm

1111
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480
happy to you know work with people show

1112
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,359
people the the ins and outs of that so

1113
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,240
yeah awesome job with these edits blue

1114
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,079
because sometimes the discussion can

1115
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,160
have even when it has just a few core

1116
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,560
themes which sometimes happens

1117
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,079
it can be

1118
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,440
interleaved

1119
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,440
complexly so it takes skill to

1120
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,560
untangle

1121
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,440
but the podcast is fun um

1122
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,480
[Music]

1123
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,000
number four the end of 2021 treat

1124
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,640
so this is just a little gift that blue

1125
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,800
and i wanted to send out so this is kind

1126
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,079
of our project we just thought um we

1127
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,480
could send people some physical stickers

1128
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,720
and potentially send a non-fungible

1129
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,079
token an nft purely as a gift no

1130
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,440
value or utility so both of these

1131
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,319
reflect the expansion of the lab

1132
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,599
into

1133
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,200
the physical space as well as the

1134
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,000
digital and the cryptographic space

1135
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,119
and

1136
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,480
we do think that cryptographic

1137
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,480
affordances will be very important for

1138
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,200
the future of science art and

1139
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,960
communities in web 3 and beyond

1140
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,040
we also want it to be

1141
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,760
mindful ecologically and meaningful for

1142
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,520
participants so

1143
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,680
if you'd like to be involved in this

1144
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,880
area

1145
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,000
of kind of

1146
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,440
taos and web3 and crypto and desai

1147
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,319
then

1148
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,520
please come get involved with active lab

1149
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,440
because there's a lot to

1150
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,480
learn and help us do here

1151
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,160
just very briefly we have a monthly

1152
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,720
newsletter so that's um

1153
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,920
you can find that on our site

1154
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,440
activeinference.org

1155
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,680
and find other places to subscribe but

1156
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,480
this is a kind of monthly and then a few

1157
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,079
other special

1158
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,160
affordances but mainly just a monthly

1159
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,440
summary

1160
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,400
of our

1161
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,359
operations so good low traffic totally

1162
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,560
not spam way to stay updated

1163
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,960
and then the last comms project

1164
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,240
is um the live stream playbook so we do

1165
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,640
have a slides-based playbook

1166
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,520
for

1167
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,200
uh live streaming so i'll just kind of

1168
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,119
like show it here

1169
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:36,560
this is just

1170
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,000
for participation guidelines

1171
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,040
this is um checklists for roles

1172
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,040
participant checklist presenter

1173
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,440
checklist broadcaster checklist

1174
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,520
facilitator checklist organizer

1175
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,400
checklist

1176
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,920
so that was something that we developed

1177
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,599
over this year

1178
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,839
and we're looking to

1179
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,079
move that over to

1180
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,040
coda

1181
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,880
so that it can be implemented much more

1182
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,880
smoothly with automations

1183
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,280
the playbook itself from the technical

1184
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,520
details to the behavioral and the social

1185
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,839
and then also another coda related

1186
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,240
improvement project is going from the

1187
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,680
list that spreadsheet of live streams

1188
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,240
to this enriched table

1189
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,400
where we're gonna be able to add in

1190
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,680
keywords links participants

1191
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,480
um you see some upcoming streams here so

1192
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,200
it will be possible to very easily ask a

1193
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,599
question like i want to know what dave

1194
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,240
had to say about predictive processing

1195
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,400
before 2022

1196
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,800
that will be a simple query to make

1197
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,280
and when we include the speech to text

1198
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,119
and have full text transcripts not just

1199
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,599
enriched tagging that'll also be very

1200
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,160
powerful but this will be really a fun

1201
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,240
project and it's also little micro tasks

1202
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,079
if anybody wants to contribute

1203
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:59,440
asynchronously like i loved number 14.2

1204
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,599
i'm listening to it already i'm going to

1205
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,520
write down a few keywords that were

1206
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,520
spoken that's a huge way to help the lab

1207
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,520
think about how many times a podcast or

1208
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,280
live stream is listened to

1209
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,280
and no one enriches it or makes it

1210
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,240
searchable so this will help improve

1211
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,680
that situation

1212
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,480
and

1213
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,920
connect these resources to each other

1214
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,680
so if you want to get involved in dot

1215
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,119
coms if you like communication and you

1216
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,960
are familiar with active inference or

1217
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,359
not of course all activities are open to

1218
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:32,800
everyone

1219
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,720
special roles

1220
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,240
or practices that could help a lot would

1221
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,920
be somebody who wants to like lead and

1222
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,400
grow and automate active lab social

1223
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,920
media accounts because that's not really

1224
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,960
our

1225
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,480
jam

1226
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,920
also if you want to get involved in

1227
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,920
co-organizing or facilitating or

1228
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,880
broadcasting live streams

1229
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,040
introducing new series compiling and

1230
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,280
curating research products onboarding

1231
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,800
participants

1232
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,839
new kinds of communications like blogs

1233
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,640
short writings tutorials there's so many

1234
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,400
things that we can

1235
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,280
do in comms and if you just think that's

1236
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,200
a communication i

1237
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,359
expected to have existed i i expect that

1238
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,960
five minute video on markov blankets to

1239
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,200
have existed or i would prefer it

1240
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,400
existed

1241
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,560
we'll connect you with the affordance so

1242
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,960
that you can reduce your free energy by

1243
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,079
doing it and also helping people any

1244
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,200
comments on comms

1245
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,720
okay final organizational unit dot tools

1246
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,000
so in tools the overall goal is to

1247
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,559
enable the effective tool and instrument

1248
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,440
use for all active lab processes

1249
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,680
the second goal is to explore and design

1250
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,680
affordances for our niche resulting in

1251
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,440
effective action as well as innovations

1252
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,280
and tool development so it's a lot like

1253
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,760
comms there's this interior

1254
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,520
connective tissue role and then there's

1255
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,319
an external side in tools the internal

1256
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,680
side is our tools what we use in the lab

1257
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,760
and that's what the participants are

1258
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,040
engaged in because we're all

1259
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,400
participants here

1260
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,680
and then there's like

1261
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,000
this medium and deeper question

1262
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,880
of

1263
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,079
what do active inference tools look like

1264
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,040
recommendation engines and robotics and

1265
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,599
all these kinds of things and we have

1266
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,440
explored that in some depth during the

1267
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,200
year but let's go over the projects

1268
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,119
themselves

1269
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,599
so first is the cloud infrastructure so

1270
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,079
this is an internal but eventually we'll

1271
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,720
have an external component as well

1272
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,599
we're looking to develop accessible and

1273
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,240
powerful computational resources for the

1274
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,200
lab

1275
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,280
there are several use cases that are

1276
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,880
very important

1277
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,599
so

1278
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,480
some of them are admin tasks like having

1279
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,240
the website emails file storage crm like

1280
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,079
personnel management

1281
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,520
in um a secure cloud environment

1282
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,200
there's also use cases like a

1283
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,280
personalized learning dashboard or

1284
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,760
workspace so somebody can just log into

1285
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,559
their active lab accounts and have their

1286
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,640
resources and learnings right there for

1287
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,440
them in a high attention and high trust

1288
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,520
setting

1289
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,200
two special use cases that are

1290
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,119
can be mentioned here

1291
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,240
one is ontology development and natural

1292
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,480
language processing so sumo it's an

1293
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,480
ontology but it's actually written like

1294
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,599
a text program kind of like lisp

1295
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,880
so having an environment with sigma and

1296
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,839
a few other pieces will allow people who

1297
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,079
might not be able to set up these

1298
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,240
often esoteric programs on their own

1299
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,680
computer

1300
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,920
will have the cloud image

1301
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,240
virtualized and ready so that you can

1302
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,880
play around in this sandbox where all

1303
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,400
the toys work

1304
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,079
and then similarly

1305
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,000
on the machine learning side

1306
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,839
although much of early work in this vein

1307
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,400
was done in matlab in the spm

1308
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,520
statistical parametric mapping toolbox

1309
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,280
increasingly modern development is

1310
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,200
happening using the languages of python

1311
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,920
and julia and we spoke with people in

1312
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,440
live streams and guest streams who

1313
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,440
talked a lot about that and so we want

1314
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,359
to have a

1315
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,559
what's a fairly common setup in

1316
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,800
industry and in computer science

1317
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,960
research labs to have a cloud interface

1318
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,599
with for example interactable notebooks

1319
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,200
that helps you do machine learning in

1320
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,599
the cloud without having

1321
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,240
hardware or software installed locally

1322
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,280
so that's kind of the cloud

1323
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,599
infrastructure side and of course these

1324
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,520
aren't done projects these are things

1325
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,480
that people are involved in and can be

1326
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,839
involved in

1327
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:43,839
feel free to just raise hands if you

1328
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,240
have any other thoughts but um another

1329
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,440
project is the actin agent development

1330
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,119
so we

1331
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,960
here are curious with

1332
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,880
what does the future of active software

1333
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,880
agents look like can we make an

1334
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,040
interoperable

1335
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,319
software

1336
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,400
package for active inference agent

1337
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,440
modeling

1338
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,440
and where could that be applied we

1339
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,240
started with the nethack challenge which

1340
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,640
we didn't muster the regime of attention

1341
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,960
for this year but it was ambitious and

1342
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,520
we had many many

1343
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,520
good discussions and we made a lot of

1344
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,640
useful

1345
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,079
advances we just

1346
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,680
didn't end up doing this very

1347
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,400
challenging

1348
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,240
machine learning competition

1349
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:24,960
but

1350
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,040
there'll be so many cool areas to apply

1351
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,480
active inference to

1352
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,400
so that's kind of like just like people

1353
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,559
expect the edu to make courses but it

1354
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,640
does a ton of other stuff too

1355
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,319
tools sounds like it should be making

1356
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,920
something like this and we'll do other

1357
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,480
stuff too

1358
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,359
project three in tools is the

any any skill you you have already

1410

thank you yvonne

1411
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:05,920
and

1412
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,160
that relates to the crm integration

1413
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,280
which is

1414
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,839
usually using to refer to

1415
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,359
customer relationship manager but

1416
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,119
they're kind of like personal

1417
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,720
relationships

1418
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,839
and

1419
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,880
it's a project that is on coda

1420
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,800
it's under the dot coms but the

1421
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,079
integration is a tool's concern and so

1422
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,640
just like yvonne laid out here

1423
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,839
using these ontologies for projects much

1424
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,280
of which are derived from systems

1425
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,599
engineering and systems thinking we'll

1426
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,599
be able to have everybody entered into

1427
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,720
the crm and then it'll say okay

1428
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,040
blue and i are going to be doing this

1429
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,640
live stream

1430
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,200
they added us to a calendar the template

1431
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,680
is here the papers here the emails in

1432
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,880
the inbox

1433
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,200
that will allow um very flexible

1434
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,480
coordination

1435
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,799
and also improve the accessibility

1436
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,319
because not everybody is going to be

1437
00:54:58,319 --> 00:54:59,839
trying to um

1438
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,240
prune every part of the garden

1439
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,160
each person will be able to have a

1440
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,200
targeted regime of attention that

1441
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,280
is according to their preferences

1442
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,880
and also will be contributing to

1443
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,760
something bigger so these are projects

1444
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,960
involving

1445
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,200
making the organizational unit

1446
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,480
engagement more accessible

1447
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,839
project five

1448
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:25,440
uh yvonne again please describe what is

1449
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,040
the uh systems thinking reading and

1450
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,520
discussion group which was an edu

1451
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,920
project on the learning capacity what

1452
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,760
does it have to do with application in

1453
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,400
the dot tools

1454
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,000
so

1455
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,400
as each project where

1456
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,960
we can we have to divide the project

1457
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,880
itself and

1458
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:50,240
the project that enable this project so

1459
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,119
to provide

1460
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,680

and uh

1464
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,839
for

1465
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,559
more understanding of

1466
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,240
the course and the discipline

1467
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,079
of system thinking

1468
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,280
uh we decided to

1469
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,480
set up

1470
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,799

need to fix in the course

1535
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,520
thank you and this will be one of the

1536
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,359
kind of templates and inspirations for

1537
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,319
the active course that will be using

1538
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:54,640
tools that are state of the art

1539
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,640
which were selected from a rigorous

1540
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,319
process for

1541
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,440
the systems thinking course

1542
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,559
a sixth project for those who

1543
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,160
watch all the way to the end of lab

1544
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,880
meetings you know who you are

1545
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,559
is the graphical interface and

1546
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:13,119
extensible knowledge graph project so

1547
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,240
this is going to be something pretty

1548
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,319
cool heading into 2022 and beyond on the

1549
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,720
left side

1550
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,200
on the left side is an image

1551
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,040
that i'll just expand so it's a small

1552
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,319
this is

1553
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:29,359
within

1554
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:33,359
matlab which is a proprietary program

1555
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,119
that you have to pay to have a license

1556
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:36,079
for

1557
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,000
many academics are given access but

1558
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,359
that's not everybody

1559
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,520
within matlab the program

1560
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,079
there's a package called spm statistical

1561
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:45,520
parametric mapping which has been

1562
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,599
developed by professor carl firsten and

1563
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,240
many others for the previous decades

1564
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,839
inside of spm

1565
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:55,520
you'll find a function called dem demo

1566
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,240
and it will bring up this graphical

1567
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,359
interface

1568
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,640
which has kind of sundry links to

1569
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,520
some simulations some code examples some

1570
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,160
visualizations some papers but much of

1571
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,880
it is within matlab itself

1572
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,960
so this is kind of

1573
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,480
a resource that's been developed and

1574
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,880
locally optimized within this

1575
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,599
intra spm intra matlab

1576
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,040
format

1577
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,920
however one of our major projects for

1578
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,640
the lab and the community moving forward

1579
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,960
is going to be reimagining

1580
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,119
and deploying

1581
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,440
a graphical interface and an extensible

1582
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,079
knowledge graph for active inference

1583
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:39,040
so what does it look like to make a

1584
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,880
graphical interface an extensible

1585
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,760
knowledge graph that is participatory

1586
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,920
with open source development and modern

1587
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,880
affordances for knowledge graphs

1588
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,760
that uses the active ontology as a basis

1589
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,599
of the knowledge graph so for example

1590
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,000
here it's sorted by keywords but you

1591
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,680
know what do you do when one button fits

1592
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,920
under two keywords or two keywords apply

1593
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,160
to one button that's why this is a local

1594
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,640
optimization because to have that kind

1595
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,799
of advanced and even personalized

1596
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:08,880
re-rendering it's required to have a

1597
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,000
more advanced ontological system than

1598
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,760
just terms or principled hierarchies

1599
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,160
which is exactly why ontology working

1600
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,799
group has been involved in this work and

1601
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,240
these practices

1602
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,559
because the extensible knowledge graph

1603
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,480
starts coming into play on the far right

1604
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,040
of that spectrum

1605
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,680
we also wonder if it can be deployed in

1606
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,799
a website

1607
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,119
so not requiring you to have matlab

1608
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,240
install spm find dem and then maybe it

1609
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,920
works or maybe it doesn't

1610
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,880
how about a website where there's maybe

1611
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,720
even computational resources so people

1612
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,480
can run simulations and save their own

1613
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,400
versions of the code in their own

1614
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,599
workspace

1615
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,040
and of course

1616
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,680
what else this is a project that we're

1617
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,680
barely just beginning

1618
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,079
so if you're interested in

1619
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,359
user interface or education or tool

1620
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:03,920
development something that would

1621
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,079
be an ontologically

1622
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,599
scaffolded

1623
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,599
knowledge graph containing very

1624
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,160
heterogeneous resources like

1625
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,799
terms and educational courses papers

1626
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,440
videos etc

1627
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,960
this could be

1628
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,400
a very important

1629
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,119
and also very active project so if

1630
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,039
that's kind of sounding cool to you then

1631
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:26,880
get involved

1632
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,319
overall

1633
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:31,839
uh dot tools

1634
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,240
has all kinds of uh well we'll just

1635
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,359
delete this

1636
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:36,799
dot tools has ways for you to get

1637
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,640
involved if you'd like to contribute in

1638
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,038
any way

1639
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,319
let's go to the future and then of

1640
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:46,480
course everybody please feel free to

1641
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,920
raise your hand so the future

1642
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,280
section is

1643
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,359
short because we can actually just break

1644
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:55,119
it down

1645
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,599
systemically and systematically to use

1646
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:59,680
some vocabulary that i learned from

1647
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,440
systems thinking

1648
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,799
into these different levels of

1649
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:05,119
organization of our lab

1650
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,880
there are the next step steps for the

1651
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,000
lab

1652
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,400
as an entity which involves for example

1653
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,280
our nonprofit registration continue

1654
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,599
continuity and the onboarding of the

1655
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:18,720
inaugural cohort of the advisory board

1656
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,720
there's the next steps for the units

1657
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,440
inside of each lab which were discussed

1658
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,280
for most of the meeting today

1659
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,839
there's the next steps for the projects

1660
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:29,920
and the teams that are inside of each

1661
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,839
unit which have specific coda spaces and

1662
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:36,319
timelines and roles and requirements

1663
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:37,520
of themselves

1664
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,720
and then there's

1665
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,000
the next step for you as a participant

1666
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,200
so

1667
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,000
if you don't know that's perfect because

1668
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,920
that means that you'll have a lot to

1669
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,680
learn by doing and reduce your

1670
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,760
uncertainty through action

1671
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,680
so if you're listening to this or if

1672
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,680
you're aware of it you're already a

1673
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,520
participant you're engaging in the

1674
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,480
regime

1675
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,280
of attention regimes of expectations

1676
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,160
related to acting of lab and

1677
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,160
active inference more broadly

1678
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,680
so

1679
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,440
if you're here you're a participant

1680
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,599
if you know what your next steps are

1681
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,160
what policies you're going to select in

1682
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,799
the near future or now that's awesome

1683
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:19,359
if you do not know what your next action

1684
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:21,440
states should be what policies you

1685
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,960
should select or maybe even what

1686
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,799
policies you can select what your

1687
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:26,960
affordances are then

1688
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,599
you can get involved by just

1689
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,160
communicating with us so anyone can feel

1690
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,359
free to contact welcome scott to the

1691
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:37,359
very tail end

1692
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:40,319
um we're literally just

1693
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:43,520
closing up and uh just have about to

1694
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,880
have an open

1695
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,640
discussion where anyone can just

1696
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,480
add any points

1697
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,480
what was something that they

1698
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,720
liked about 2021 what's something they

1699
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,039
want to change what are they looking

1700
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,480
forward to in 2022

1701
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:02,280
anyone's welcome here

1702
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,200
well i'm too i'm late to the game so i'm

1703
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,079
i don't know what was said before but i

1704
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,839
um i feel like the we're on the cusp um

1705
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:23,039
of folks

1706
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:24,000
um

1707
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,640
benefiting from this kind of framing in

1708
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,880
a much more broadly

1709
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,240
and i think that was interesting i just

1710
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,480
saw on twitter there was an interesting

1711
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,400
article on the

1712
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,240
rethinking of pristine um pearl blankets

1713
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,280
versus fristen blankets discussion which

1714
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,640
i thought was interesting and it's not i

1715
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,000
haven't read the article yet but it's

1716
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
interesting that notion of

1717
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,680
the maturation

1718
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,240
of the concept and whether or not that

1719
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,400
critique is accurate

1720
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,079
the critiques

1721
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:57,680
are helpful because they start to bound

1722
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,400
the

1723
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,920
um framing and make it more useful for

1724
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,640
more people because it's not as

1725
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,920
over enthusiastic in its ambiguity on

1726
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,680
the at the edges

1727
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,760
and so i'm really excited about the

1728
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,680
maturation of

1729
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,079
both this concept and the communities

1730
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,079
that cluster around it and i feel like

1731
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,720
this particular initiative is going to

1732
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,240
be really pivotal

1733
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,319
in that and it's um i won't use the word

1734
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:27,200
priesthood and priestess hood here but

1735
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,119
um there's a lot of um

1736
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,240
evangelization that will be

1737
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,240
done in the in the next uh or

1738
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,920
evangelizing i guess that will be done

1739
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,119
in the next year

1740
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,880
and i'm really looking forward to it i

1741
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,359
think a lot of people are going to

1742
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:42,240
find

1743
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,079
that when they enter the space that

1744
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:47,200
people are are for some reason seem

1745
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,520
fairly reasonable given a lot of other

1746
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,000
spaces and willing to

1747
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,520
entertain the limitations and

1748
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,039
constraints what we have here because i

1749
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:58,240
think it is something that has

1750
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,440
a core

1751
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,000
of something that's new and offers

1752
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,440
helpful insights so i'm really excited

1753
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,760
about the coming year thanks

1754
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,280
thank you

1755
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,440
dean

1756
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,160
yeah i think my takeaway from the months

1757
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,880
that i've participated so far is that

1758
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,480
one of the big differences kind of a

1759
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,079
dramatic difference

1760
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:19,280
if you will

1761
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,720
is that i find that working in this

1762
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,079
medium it's more like a cnc mill than a

1763
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,359
than a printer a 3d printer because

1764
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:30,640
instead of

1765
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,319
a bunch of building up

1766
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:34,720
we're essentially removing a lot of

1767
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,760
noise

1768
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,799
and trying to get to the idea of

1769
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:40,640
what are some of the signals that we

1770
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,079
otherwise wouldn't be able to see

1771
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:43,839
because we have a chance to interact the

1772
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:44,960
way that we

1773
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,760
have and do i don't think it's uh

1774
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,200
i don't know that it's necessarily a

1775
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,039
consensus building

1776
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:53,440
platform but i do know that it is

1777
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,640
certainly a way of being able to

1778
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,440
uh

1779
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,520
cross pollinate

1780
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,839
we don't tend to collapse to one

1781
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:04,880
particular type here and

1782
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,799
that that last

1783
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:09,760
input being a perfect example of what

1784
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:10,880
we're trying i think what we're

1785
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,240
achieving here

1786
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,000
and i think that the going forward piece

1787
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,119
will be

1788
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:17,359
really interesting because it isn't

1789
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,560
always describable in this moment

1790
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,238
i think a year from now when when we're

1791
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:24,560
doing our fourth quarter a year from now

1792
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:25,759
god willing

1793
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:27,040
um i think

1794
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,158
again the updates will

1795
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,880
tell us a whole bunch about what we

1796
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,238
learned in the meantime instead of um

1797
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:38,399
trying to come to a particular

1798
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:40,158
specific outcome and i think that's

1799
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,600
probably one of the

1800
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,560
greatest joys of participating in this

1801
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,319
thanks dean

1802
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:50,239
fellow chitzer with a raised hand

1803
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:52,799
all that sorry

1804
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:54,560
somebody who's muted but i'm not sure

1805
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,560
who exactly it is

1806
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,319
is it me you might yeah

1807
01:08:58,319 --> 01:08:59,920
okay um

1808
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:00,799
yeah

1809
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:03,198
i i following on from what was said

1810
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:06,560
there is the idea of um

1811
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,120
the blanket early on was kind of like a

1812
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,560
part of

1813
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,279
active inference but the having been

1814
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:15,359
talking a lot more and you know thinking

1815
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:18,560
about the fristonian blanket as

1816
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,158
a particular way of thinking about

1817
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:22,238
blankets and knowing that these blankets

1818
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,238
are used in other

1819
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:26,960
contexts i think has has helped mature

1820
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,960
things i mean scott's been talking about

1821
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,279
the idea of maybe synthetic blankets in

1822
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,279
other contexts and i think

1823
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,120
what's quite interesting is i think the

1824
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,560
discussion

1825
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,439
um

1826
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,238
around the nature of blankets is going

1827
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:42,799
to be um

1828
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:44,479
as a tool or maybe as part of the

1829
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,839
ontology is going to

1830
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:49,439
help at least

1831
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,920
help separate out the discourse

1832
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:52,960
um

1833
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,800
and i think that's not a bad thing

1834
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,920
because uh there's there's there's um

1835
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,440
there's there's uh

1836
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,520
there's markov chains and there's lots

1837
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,000
of these processes are used in other

1838
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,239
fields which are allied but are not

1839
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:08,880
active inference um and then well what

1840
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,120
happens to these when we come into that

1841
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,080
field and uh i think it also then starts

1842
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,600
to help with some of the pluralistic

1843
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,640
ontological questions

1844
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,640
allowing other parts to maybe be more

1845
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,040
formalized and then the ontologies might

1846
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,239
happen more

1847
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:25,760
through the way that we think about the

1848
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,400
realization of the blanket form and the

1849
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,920
sensory states and the observation

1850
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,440
states been interacting with

1851
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,320
thank you stephen

1852
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,800
so anyone else can uh

1853
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,880
raise their hand definitely the core

1854
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,199
terms yup scott go for it

1855
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,800
so you know it's interesting steven just

1856
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,480
got me thinking so one of the things

1857
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,159
we're doing this nsf thing some of you

1858
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:49,679
know about it right now and doing it

1859
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:51,280
with some other folks in involved in

1860
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,640
complexity

1861
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,360
and um we're doing virtual uh excuse me

1862
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:58,000
uh verified information environments and

1863
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,840
you got me thinking stephen you know

1864
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,600
credit card system

1865
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,360
we say is a verified information

1866
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,040
environment we're defining it as a thing

1867
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,480
that has business operating legal

1868
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,480
technical and social variables that give

1869
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,400
it integrity

1870
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,239
so it's interesting when you think about

1871
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:13,360
blankets

1872
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,040
in a way a verified information

1873
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,880
environment what we're saying is there's

1874
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,560
an externality

1875
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,560
or an ex there's a an external

1876
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,719
environment that can be named

1877
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:25,440
and characterized so it's like before

1878
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,400
there were countries nation-states

1879
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,159
we didn't say they're nation-states we

1880
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,080
had the feudal kingdoms or whatever and

1881
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,880
it was a characterization of a set of

1882
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,560
relationships

1883
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,000
and it became paradigmatic only through

1884
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,840
broad adoption so we say now there's a

1885
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,760
society or we can say there's a museum

1886
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,280
or there's a school each one has a

1887
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,960
concept but it's really a set of

1888
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,880
relationships not a building

1889
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,679
and it feels like i wonder if markov

1890
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:54,560
blankets it just started feeling like

1891
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,679
perhaps

1892
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,920
there's a naming of a set of

1893
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,800
interactions a blob of interactions out

1894
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,640
there that can start to build up its own

1895
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,760
um not not rigor statistically but

1896
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,120
cultural

1897
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,360
um recognition

1898
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,920
and and if and that i wonder

1899
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,840
whether markov blankets

1900
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,600
are candidates for that i don't know if

1901
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,840
it's powerful enough a concept to me it

1902
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,880
feels like it may be but and and that

1903
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,440
set of practices that occur associated

1904
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,040
with markov blankets

1905
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,719
um i think can be elevated into best

1906
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,120
practices standards and institutions

1907
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,120
so we might actually see is the in

1908
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,719
markov blankets for instance might

1909
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:37,760
become institutionalized into fiduciary

1910
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,120
layers

1911
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,360
for representing parties things like

1912
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,120
that anyway you got me thinking stephen

1913
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,640
on that one

1914
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,760
nice

1915
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,159
thank you um

1916
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:49,679
i was just going to say that the core

1917
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:51,360
terms each of them

1918
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,400
are so

1919
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,120
rich and uh the opportunity to go into

1920
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,120
technical details and discussions as

1921
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,840
well as apply discussions

1922
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,840
um

1923
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,480
there's so much more that could be

1924
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,920
said

1925
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,520
the only thing i'll say is personally i

1926
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,840
don't think that having names associated

1927
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,159
with terms is helpful because it's not

1928
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:14,080
referring to a person themselves and so

1929
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,800
i think once we move beyond some of the

1930
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,600
name based nomenclature will open up

1931
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,840
into a more accessible and rigorous

1932
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,960
space

1933
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,120
not based around whether darwin really

1934
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,719
thought this way or not about evolution

1935
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:29,920
or whether markov which markov really

1936
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,239
thought this way or not about statistics

1937
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:33,920
we can just frame positively

1938
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,440
indefinitely and probably very austerely

1939
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,600
what we actually mean

1940
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,840
and that will enable translation

1941
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,159
automation and many new things that just

1942
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:46,480
last names don't give but that's going

1943
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,000
to be part of the fun

1944
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,760
i never even thought of the mark of part

1945
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,600
as and everything occurred to me it was

1946
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,800
a

1947
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,600
guy's name but of course it is but so i

1948
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,600
i vote for snuggly we should call it a

1949
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,520
snuggly as a generic

1950
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,520
term i think let's change all that into

1951
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,199
russian what's a russian what's russian

1952
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:04,960
for a schnoogley blanket what about

1953
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,360
snuggie like the blanket with arms

1954
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,040
it's already trademarked

1955
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,880
let's change that frequency to snugly

1956
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:16,640
um well um and then also one just mark

1957
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,159
off no just

1958
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:18,960
uh

1959
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,600
we are actually unsure which markov is

1960
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,120
being referenced this was some

1961
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,520
scholarship by dave to actually address

1962
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,480
the question which a markov the the

1963
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,480
elder or the younger

1964
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,400
are some of these terms referencing in

1965
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,640
the english-speaking literature and that

1966
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,800
is not always clear so

1967
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,719
there are just

1968
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,480
opportunities for international

1969
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,280
scholarship that we discover when we're

1970
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,320
curious

1971
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,080
stephen

1972
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,640
of course you've got the ian we can add

1973
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,120
on so the fristonian i mean it is

1974
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,280
problematic being his name but or the

1975
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,040
markovian

1976
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,880
um i mean that sort of opens it up to

1977
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,280
the hand waving but it um

1978
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,679
that may also sort of show that there's

1979
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:03,600
more than one version because you know

1980
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,080
you just hear markov blank it does

1981
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,679
to someone who came for the first time

1982
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:09,440
they may think well that's that's the

1983
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,440
thing it's not it's that's it right

1984
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,320
whereas

1985
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:16,080
um once you get into markovian monism

1986
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,199
um

1987
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:20,159
and even that maybe that there's i can

1988
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:21,440
see why carl wouldn't want to

1989
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,120
necessarily call them fristen blankets

1990
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,800
because then it gets into that whole

1991
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,800
thing about it being his name

1992
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,080
but there's there is something possibly

1993
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,600
between

1994
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,120
or beyond a markovian blanket that would

1995
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,120
help denote what is going on with an

1996
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,920
active influence blanket where it's

1997
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,560
bi-directional um but this is this is

1998
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,920
great conversation we'll talk more about

1999
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,840
this obviously

2000
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,719
yep

2001
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:47,540
perfect um

2002
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:48,719
[Music]

2003
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,640
that's all that uh we need to i think

2004
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,880
note for the lobbying but yeah thanks

2005
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,880
for sharing about that these are the

2006
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,280
literal discussions in the terms

2007
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,840
discussions in edu every week these are

2008
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,080
like the fun things that we get to

2009
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,760
talk about so

2010
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,600
um to those

2011
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,159
in this jitsi many of whom were

2012
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:11,040
um just totally

2013
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,360
essential and non-fungible in their

2014
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,679
contributions to the lab

2015
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:17,280
as well as those who are

2016
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,679
watching the replay and who participated

2017
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:22,239
in every activity this year it was just

2018
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:23,520
an awesome

2019
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,320
year

2020
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,199
who could have thought that one year ago

2021
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:29,760
things would be where they are now

2022
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,040
and

2023
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,560
the game is just

2024
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,960
beginning so we hope that

2025
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,880
everyone listening whatever their

2026
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,880
background or familiarity

2027
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,280
with active inference or other topics is

2028
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,000
they're just welcome to get involved

2029
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,719
any other last thoughts otherwise

2030
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,640
that's it for the fourth quarterly

2031
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,520
roundtable meeting

2032
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,000
