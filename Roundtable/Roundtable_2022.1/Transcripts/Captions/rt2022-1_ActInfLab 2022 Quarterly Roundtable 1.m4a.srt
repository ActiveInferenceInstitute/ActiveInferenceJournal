1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,770
Hey, everyone, thanks for tuning in.

2
00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:36,595
And today it is March 30, 2022.

3
00:00:36,672 --> 00:00:38,910
We're here in the ActInf Lab Quarterly,

4
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:42,925
roundtable number one for 2022. Welcome

5
00:00:42,987 --> 00:00:45,780
to the ActInf lab. We're a participatory

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,730
online lab that is communicating,

7
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,770
learning, and practicing applied active

8
00:00:49,785 --> 00:00:52,270
inference. You can find us at some of

9
00:00:52,272 --> 00:00:54,865
the links here on this slide. This is

10
00:00:54,882 --> 00:00:57,010
recorded in an archived Livestream, so

11
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:58,570
please provide us with feedback so that

12
00:00:58,572 --> 00:01:01,620
we can improve our work. All backgrounds

13
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:03,805
and perspectives are welcome here, and

14
00:01:03,852 --> 00:01:05,935
we'll be following video etiquette for

15
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:09,460
live streams today in

16
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:11,535
the ActInf Lab Quarterly, roundtable

17
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,695
number one for 22. We're going to have a

18
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:17,950
first section after our intros on lab

19
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:20,575
scale updates and then we'll talk about

20
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:22,890
project scale updates which are nested

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,510
within the lab scale and just close with

22
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:28,315
some preferences and expectation and

23
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:29,820
through and through. We hope that you'll

24
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:32,610
see many affordance for participation,

25
00:01:32,805 --> 00:01:35,560
many active cue signals in your

26
00:01:35,592 --> 00:01:38,680
epistemic niche that elicit action that

27
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:41,137
make you curious about something that

28
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:44,115
connect with your preexisting

29
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,120
preferences or update them so that you

30
00:01:46,197 --> 00:01:48,085
get involved with active inference or

31
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:50,215
possibly even the lab. So whenever you

32
00:01:50,232 --> 00:01:52,240
do see this or listen to it or some

33
00:01:52,257 --> 00:01:55,180
other combination, feel free to go to

34
00:01:55,227 --> 00:01:57,940
Active Inference.org or email us,

35
00:01:57,957 --> 00:02:00,535
Active Inference Lab@gmail.com, and

36
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:02,890
we'll be in touch from there. So we can

37
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:05,275
begin with just some introduction and

38
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:07,465
warm ups. And it feels so different to

39
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:10,450
do this without a paper that we've read

40
00:02:10,587 --> 00:02:13,270
before. So for these intros, we can just

41
00:02:13,347 --> 00:02:16,825
say hi and anyone can reflect on just

42
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,140
like, how is your generative models

43
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,785
updated this quarter? What did you

44
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:22,987
perceive or learn? How did you change?

45
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,455
And what might be something that you're

46
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:28,690
looking forward to as we Parr on the

47
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,900
latter of 75% of 2022?

48
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:35,365
So, I'm Daniel And, a researcher in

49
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:39,115
California. I think my generative model

50
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:41,575
updated and fragmented into a thousand

51
00:02:41,637 --> 00:02:44,620
little pieces with Coda and the way that

52
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,215
we used formal documents this quarter as

53
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:51,315
opposed to previous quarters, but it's

54
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:53,662
coherent in a way that is actually

55
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:56,812
helpful. I hope so.

56
00:02:57,175 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll pass to Alex.

57
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,825
Yes. Hi, rule one. I'm Alex Zotkin. I'm

58
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:08,980
one of the founders of the lab and also

59
00:03:09,027 --> 00:03:12,025
Researcher Assistance Management School.

60
00:03:12,162 --> 00:03:15,955
And from latest time, I feel like

61
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:18,610
we're sharing our generative models more

62
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:22,162
and more, and hopefully it will bring us

63
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,885
to new developments. And they

64
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:27,275
paste it to Bleu.

65
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,415
Hi, everyone. I'm Bleu. I am an

66
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:35,785
independent research consultant in New

67
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:39,850
Mexico. I think this quarter was

68
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:42,585
pretty special. Like, the Coda

69
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,187
restructuring was pretty awesome and

70
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,160
just contributing to building, like,

71
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:51,250
lab infrastructure in Coda and in

72
00:03:51,387 --> 00:03:53,785
YouTube with videos and timestamps and

73
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,605
podcasts and I don't know, it was fun.

74
00:03:56,727 --> 00:03:59,215
I think probably the biggest update was

75
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:01,660
the quantum paper because that was

76
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:04,525
pretty epic, the one that we just have

77
00:04:04,587 --> 00:04:06,562
discussed over the last couple of weeks.

78
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,205
And in the next quarter, I'm looking

79
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:12,945
forward to having some more quiet

80
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:15,945
time, less talking more doing. That's

81
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,950
what I'm looking forward to in Q. Two

82
00:04:18,012 --> 00:04:21,850
of, and I will pass it to

83
00:04:21,987 --> 00:04:23,000
Yvonne.

84
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:31,687
Thanks. Good. Yeah, that is very nice.

85
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,495
We finally run System

86
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:44,920
Thinking Study Group this

87
00:04:44,997 --> 00:04:48,945
border, and I hope Web participants

88
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:52,312
enjoy it and I see that they do.

89
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:59,137
And I hope we run next another

90
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,987
study group and it will be.

91
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:05,662
So. That is.

92
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:16,420
A lot going on. I'm becoming a

93
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:18,940
little less guilty about skipping at

94
00:05:18,957 --> 00:05:21,190
least half of the activities, but I get

95
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:23,590
to hear at least to read the papers and

96
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:26,280
listen to the live streams. And there's

97
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,640
lots of work going on with the

98
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:30,225
transcript, which is very gratifying.

99
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,385
Even if Daniel no longer believes

100
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,615
himself about how valuable it is to do

101
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:36,835
the print transcripts and put them in

102
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:39,430
service, I still am sticking with the

103
00:05:39,477 --> 00:05:42,460
10,000 times more value from a

104
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:46,695
transcribe talk than just a YouTube

105
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:50,440
audio with pictures. So who haven't we

106
00:05:50,457 --> 00:05:52,325
heard from? Stephen?

107
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,995
Hello? Yeah, we're still here. We're

108
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,765
still standing, sort of. So that's

109
00:05:57,795 --> 00:06:01,705
great. I'm here in Toronto. For me,

110
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:04,390
I'm appreciative for certain of the

111
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:07,330
capacity the labs offered, the

112
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:09,445
connections, the conversation, the

113
00:06:09,597 --> 00:06:12,840
ability to bounce the ideas.

114
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,495
And that's been really, really helpful.

115
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:19,635
And particularly with Mark's

116
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,285
songs and a lot of these ideas with

117
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:24,925
Quantum, which at first I thought some

118
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:27,505
might be quite abstract, we're starting

119
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:31,315
to synthesize and find ways to pull

120
00:06:31,332 --> 00:06:32,890
them together, and so I'm hoping that

121
00:06:32,907 --> 00:06:34,690
can be used. Now I'm working with some

122
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:37,885
embodied workshops and taking that into

123
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:40,162
communities and letting this work inform

124
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,015
how I coach, how I facilitate,

125
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:47,437
how I try and explain.

126
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,125
That's the hard bit, but Parr.

127
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:57,025
And it could but shouldn't go without

128
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:59,635
saying, just massive appreciation to

129
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:02,485
everybody who does and continues to show

130
00:07:02,517 --> 00:07:05,620
up for Active Lab. You see the tip of

131
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:07,945
the iceberg on the live streams, but

132
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:11,590
there are many others. So as we continue

133
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:15,165
to formalize and determine and reduce

134
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:16,930
our uncertainty about what kind of thing

135
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:19,105
we are here, we'll hopefully have

136
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:21,360
clearer and clearer ways to force

137
00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:25,540
attribution and to show recognition for

138
00:07:25,557 --> 00:07:27,580
all the people who contribute in just

139
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:30,625
the million ways that are possible from

140
00:07:30,687 --> 00:07:33,790
beginner to very familiar. So we will

141
00:07:33,807 --> 00:07:36,540
just provide a brief overview of ActInf

142
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,485
Lab from a narrative perspective before

143
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:40,530
we jump into our strategy discussion.

144
00:07:40,665 --> 00:07:43,195
So in 2020, towards the middle and in

145
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:47,305
the end, some of us wrote a paper in

146
00:07:47,502 --> 00:07:49,515
September was when it was published,

147
00:07:49,545 --> 00:07:51,180
active Inference Lab and Behavior

148
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,320
Engineering for Teams, which was

149
00:07:53,397 --> 00:07:55,615
addressing a gap that we perceived in

150
00:07:55,632 --> 00:07:56,740
the literature, which was the

151
00:07:56,757 --> 00:07:58,830
relationship between active inference

152
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,405
framework and remote teams and

153
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:04,090
communication. At the end of that year,

154
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:05,895
after thinking about what our next steps

155
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,085
would be after that paper, we thought

156
00:08:09,117 --> 00:08:11,035
that something like an active lab would

157
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:13,360
be cool. So we sent out an initial call

158
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,780
for collaboration. During all of 2021

159
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:19,810
was our first year of ActInf Lab project

160
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,810
operation. And the projects were in the

161
00:08:22,842 --> 00:08:24,910
three organizational units of education,

162
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:28,495
communication and tools this year in

163
00:08:28,572 --> 00:08:30,580
2022, which is what we're going to be

164
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:33,910
talking about today. A lot has

165
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:36,340
happened at both the Lab scale and the

166
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:38,530
project scale. So we're going to first

167
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:40,840
talk about the lab scale and the two

168
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:42,640
pieces under. Lab scale updates are

169
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:45,115
going to be the initial release of the

170
00:08:45,132 --> 00:08:47,560
lab strategy document. And we'll also

171
00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:49,405
discuss the initial advisory board

172
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:51,730
cohort. And then we'll go into the

173
00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:53,965
project scale and discuss some of the

174
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:57,160
ongoing projects that have

175
00:08:57,192 --> 00:08:59,310
resulted in all kinds of deliverables

176
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:03,125
and outputs. So first to the Lab scale.

177
00:09:03,925 --> 00:09:06,010
Alex, would you like to talk a little

178
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:08,410
bit about just from a high level

179
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:11,830
strategy? Yeah,

180
00:09:11,877 --> 00:09:15,535
thanks. I think

181
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:18,235
everything in our lab we are trying to

182
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:23,275
do things in some new

183
00:09:23,337 --> 00:09:27,535
ways that was not using before

184
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:31,030
and also trying to put it on some

185
00:09:31,077 --> 00:09:34,630
StateoftheART errors and approaches. So

186
00:09:34,677 --> 00:09:37,680
as for strategy, we consider strategy

187
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:42,570
not as a concrete document,

188
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,705
but as and ongoing process which

189
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,325
will have quarterly reviews

190
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,190
and updates. And on high level we

191
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:56,900
are following open address approach.

192
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,230
So who is interested? It now

193
00:10:02,277 --> 00:10:07,050
can be approached from developments

194
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:11,070
of Stanley and we are trying to avoid

195
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,520
using classic objective missions,

196
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,565
goals and other corporate stuff. So we

197
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:21,775
are trying to see in the future,

198
00:10:21,837 --> 00:10:23,715
we are trying to see some endstopping

199
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:26,905
stones that we can make next

200
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:29,812
steps. And also for sure,

201
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:33,060
as from the beginning we use active

202
00:10:33,105 --> 00:10:36,445
inference not only as a research field,

203
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:40,210
but also trying to implement and

204
00:10:40,242 --> 00:10:43,210
use concepts from there such as

205
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:46,810
preferences and expectation. And also we

206
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:50,485
consider that all our activities are

207
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:52,975
on different scales. So we need to

208
00:10:53,037 --> 00:10:55,605
follow and understand how it's applied

209
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,275
on different scales.

210
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,505
Thank you. So we will now go

211
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:05,905
through the current state of the

212
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:08,695
strategy document and just anyone here,

213
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:11,215
feel free to raise your hands and of

214
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:13,015
course anyone watching along, feel free

215
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:14,320
to write questions and we'll get to

216
00:11:14,322 --> 00:11:18,165
them. So pause

217
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:21,085
the video or check it out to read the

218
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:23,775
full text here. But just to summarize,

219
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,475
our strategic document preamble in

220
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:29,140
ActInf Lab, we're directing our

221
00:11:29,157 --> 00:11:31,390
attention to different phenomena across

222
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,790
multiple scales. And the scales that

223
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:36,085
we're most interested in, or the ones

224
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:38,410
that we are heuristically using are the

225
00:11:38,442 --> 00:11:40,620
personal, the individual human scale,

226
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:43,530
the Lab scale, that's active Lab scale

227
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:46,090
and then the Community or the Niche or

228
00:11:46,107 --> 00:11:47,935
the Environment scale which is the

229
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:50,755
epistemic surroundings of the Lab.

230
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:53,730
And what's special about the Lab scale

231
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,055
is that is where the lab can implement

232
00:11:56,115 --> 00:12:00,160
policy, we can least action that are

233
00:12:00,192 --> 00:12:02,740
perceived as sense states by individual

234
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:04,960
people or by the external community.

235
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:06,835
And that may or may not chance their

236
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:09,115
policy selection. But the Lab scale is

237
00:12:09,132 --> 00:12:10,815
where strategy happens because that's

238
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:12,370
where we can actually implement policy

239
00:12:12,447 --> 00:12:14,965
selection. And we're taking this

240
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:18,975
multiscale nested systems

241
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,340
perspective to five exafferent aspects

242
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,995
of act in Flap. And those five aspects

243
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,115
that we're going to talk about in the

244
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:28,810
next few slides are education,

245
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:31,425
research, outreach and engagement

246
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:34,025
methods and open endedness.

247
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,215
Any general comments before we

248
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:42,315
continue? Brea so act and Clark

249
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,015
is an educational nonprofit.

250
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:48,130
This plays out at all scales, as all

251
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:50,440
things do. But we're especially

252
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:53,070
interested here in the personal scale,

253
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,650
in educating individuals, in having

254
00:12:56,712 --> 00:12:59,110
individuals that learn and update their

255
00:12:59,142 --> 00:13:02,160
generative models, and also respecting

256
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:05,115
just the tremendous diversity of active

257
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:06,430
inference journeys that different

258
00:13:06,477 --> 00:13:09,325
individuals are coming in and through

259
00:13:09,462 --> 00:13:11,385
relationship with the active inference

260
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,420
lab. And at the more community scale,

261
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:18,285
our educational efforts are oriented

262
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,205
towards reducing research debt and

263
00:13:21,252 --> 00:13:23,695
increasing the applicability and the

264
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:25,990
comprehensibility and the rigor and

265
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:28,435
accessibility of active inference and

266
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:31,525
related ideas. Any concepts on

267
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:32,212
education?

268
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:40,552
Okay, the second aspects

269
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:43,927
of the lab is the research aspect,

270
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:46,397
and here it also plays out at the

271
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,827
personal and at the community scale. At

272
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:51,287
the personal scale, we hope to provide a

273
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,122
niche that scaffolds and catalyzes the

274
00:13:54,155 --> 00:13:56,092
research projects by participants,

275
00:13:56,152 --> 00:13:57,992
which is something we'll come back to

276
00:13:58,115 --> 00:14:01,607
later. But we both do research

277
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:04,297
in the lab as well as on the interface

278
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:07,607
and just hope to motivate and create a

279
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,822
space for people to share their

280
00:14:08,855 --> 00:14:12,257
individual research updates. And at the

281
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:15,572
community scale, we're recognizing that

282
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,482
research is carried out alongside

283
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:19,927
ongoing discussions about responsibility

284
00:14:20,032 --> 00:14:22,202
and ownership and many, many other

285
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,100
terms. So there we hope to

286
00:14:26,462 --> 00:14:30,122
learn practices and improve and give our

287
00:14:30,155 --> 00:14:33,422
own twist on what the future of

288
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,022
science, open science, decentralized

289
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:38,747
science, DSI, just science with no

290
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,207
adjectives, and education. What will

291
00:14:41,285 --> 00:14:44,507
research and education be in our future?

292
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,287
Esteves. Thanks, Daniel. Yeah,

293
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,557
this is really helpful to read and also

294
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,417
the fact that we've got lots of people

295
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:55,712
from different backgrounds coming

296
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:59,252
together. The research

297
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:00,917
that's happening is quite

298
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:05,152
transdisciplinary, and it's

299
00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:06,917
been informed by lots of different

300
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:09,137
ideas. So there's a kind of a mixture of

301
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,392
those processes. So it's helpful to have

302
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:15,692
the systems engineering work that

303
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,002
probably comes through later. But that's

304
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:20,177
helpful in letting us get a feel for

305
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:22,502
how the research doesn't get siloed as

306
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,487
purely a paper. But okay,

307
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,667
how could that be bounced off to maybe

308
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:30,632
make a difference in the world in ways

309
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,672
that maybe people who don't even know

310
00:15:32,705 --> 00:15:36,482
active inference find that they're using

311
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,032
something differently because active

312
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:40,472
coherence has helped the way that their

313
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:42,825
practice is shaped. So I like that.

314
00:15:43,487 --> 00:15:46,547
Awesome. The third

315
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,892
aspect is outreach and engagement and

316
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,532
active inference lab lab is working on a

317
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,517
Global scale with a participatory model.

318
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,222
So at the personal scale, we welcome all

319
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,087
participation and engagement, and that

320
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,537
means all time zones and spoken

321
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:08,147
languages and preferences and what

322
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,172
people want to do and where they're at.

323
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:11,932
With active coherence. Participation,

324
00:16:12,022 --> 00:16:13,727
in a sense, begins with where the

325
00:16:13,745 --> 00:16:17,192
participant is. And there is

326
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,667
of course, more that everybody can say

327
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:22,427
and add and show, not tell or show and

328
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:24,452
tell if they've brought enough for the

329
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,822
class in the coming years. And then at

330
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:30,227
the community scale, we also seek to

331
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:33,392
be part of a emergence landscape of high

332
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,747
quality science, communication and

333
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,087
participation, and inclusion in research

334
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,107
and projects around topics like active

335
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:44,025
inference, which is what we're most

336
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:46,357
attuned to in our regime of attention.

337
00:16:46,447 --> 00:16:48,797
But that doesn't mean we only talk

338
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,602
active inference lab people. So we hope

339
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,867
that our outreach and engagement is

340
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:56,862
meaningful and sustained and impactful

341
00:16:57,287 --> 00:17:00,087
any comments on outreach and agreement.

342
00:17:04,262 --> 00:17:07,552
Okay, methods.

343
00:17:07,732 --> 00:17:09,442
The Active Inference Lab applies

344
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:12,912
StateoftheART methods across domain

345
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:16,777
that refers to the methodology of active

346
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:19,592
inference and the emergence tools and

347
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,832
ways that we have of working with active

348
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:23,282
coherence, as well as other

349
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,962
methodologies like for project

350
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:27,392
management, for education, for

351
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,137
communication, etc. So at the personal

352
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:33,152
scale, we're educating participants so

353
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,492
that they can grow their expertise in

354
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,950
different disciplines and also develop

355
00:17:38,462 --> 00:17:41,147
as a person holistically like keeping it

356
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,172
balanced, you're not going to stay up

357
00:17:43,205 --> 00:17:45,397
and finish reading every single active

358
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:48,242
paper. So staying balanced and having

359
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,322
methodologies that help us be affordance

360
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:53,700
but also balanced are quite important.

361
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:57,512
And then at the lab scale, we hope to

362
00:17:57,575 --> 00:18:00,912
implement the cutting edge,

363
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:03,832
the Pareto optimal, the Bayesian optimal

364
00:18:03,922 --> 00:18:05,972
methodology, which includes our

365
00:18:06,005 --> 00:18:10,052
switching strategies, and we

366
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,497
fix typos on the fly. That's what

367
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,737
editable documents allow. Our

368
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,502
affordances as an organization are the

369
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,777
methodologies that we scaffold

370
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:26,462
in projects. So especially at the lab

371
00:18:26,525 --> 00:18:30,322
scale, we hope that we use methodology

372
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,662
that's powerful and facilitates

373
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,937
collective intelligence and also

374
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,502
clarifies the distinction or the

375
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,887
inclination of partition, perhaps even

376
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:42,707
between those who are following along

377
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,422
and listening ActInf Livestream,

378
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:46,402
reading the papers in the game. That's

379
00:18:46,432 --> 00:18:49,097
awesome. And then those who actually on

380
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,802
board into the lab and eventually have a

381
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,417
role in a project will be able

382
00:18:56,465 --> 00:18:59,702
to increasingly be clear about what that

383
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:02,100
means through the uses of different

384
00:19:02,612 --> 00:19:05,497
systems, ideas like practices, cases,

385
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:07,292
responsibilities and concerns. Yes.

386
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,112
Elon?

387
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:14,117
Yeah, thank you. I would like to add

388
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:18,262
that if we compile methods and outreach

389
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:20,747
so the lab provides a lot of

390
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,767
opportunities for the understanding of

391
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:27,107
active in. For instance, we provide a

392
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:31,022
lot of tools and for

393
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:35,152
those who already participate

394
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:39,602
in the lab and for those who just start

395
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,362
to deep inside the active coherence.

396
00:19:45,137 --> 00:19:49,067
Awesome. And the

397
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,897
lab. Last, but not really the last

398
00:19:51,005 --> 00:19:55,057
aspect is openendedness. As Alex

399
00:19:55,222 --> 00:19:58,867
mentioned earlier and has been bringing

400
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:01,397
and reminding us all of since the

401
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:04,247
beginning, that ActInf lab is on the

402
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,622
path of openendedness. It doesn't mean

403
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:09,542
that we sit and wait where the road

404
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,197
forks or when we have uncertainty about

405
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,942
the future. Those are fundamentals. And

406
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,797
in fact, openendedness is action amidst

407
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,752
uncertainty. So at the personal scale,

408
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:22,802
we recognize and support the

409
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,397
openendedness of the personal journey of

410
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,272
individuals who are learning and

411
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:29,702
applying active inference. So even if

412
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,627
you don't know exactly where you're

413
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:33,602
headed or what your finish line or your

414
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,417
milestones, your checkpoint looks like,

415
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:36,797
if you don't even know what your

416
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,342
preferences are, or you're unsure about

417
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,597
some other parameter in your generative

418
00:20:40,642 --> 00:20:43,667
models. That's all good. At the lab

419
00:20:43,715 --> 00:20:46,950
scale, our strategy is

420
00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:50,792
to say it is a work in progress, would

421
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,402
be to almost assume that there would be

422
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,492
a final strategy, but rather our

423
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,222
strategy is and encoding process that

424
00:20:59,255 --> 00:21:02,387
will always be updating in response to

425
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,072
changes in the niche and the effect that

426
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:07,472
our action have over multiple active

427
00:21:07,505 --> 00:21:10,522
states. So we do recognize

428
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:13,492
and utilize approaches to active

429
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:17,237
shortterm success and realizing products

430
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,847
and deliverables over short term. But

431
00:21:19,955 --> 00:21:22,127
also there's a time and a space and a

432
00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:24,232
place for thinking about active

433
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:26,357
coherence and the active inference lab

434
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:29,717
in deeper time. And that is especially

435
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,467
where diverse participation and our lab

436
00:21:33,515 --> 00:21:36,047
advisory board come into play, which

437
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,147
we'll talk about in a second. And then

438
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,037
just lastly, at the community scale,

439
00:21:41,912 --> 00:21:44,282
it's true in principle that active lab

440
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,102
can participate in various kinds of

441
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,387
activities that might be beyond

442
00:21:49,537 --> 00:21:51,827
education, research and outreach and

443
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:55,627
agreement. We will always be considering

444
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:58,247
those opportunities in a case by case

445
00:21:58,355 --> 00:22:00,887
way and assessing whether it's something

446
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,352
that fits best within the Markov blanket

447
00:22:03,457 --> 00:22:05,912
and the kind of thing that ActInf lab is

448
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:09,727
or maybe some thing else could exist

449
00:22:09,832 --> 00:22:11,402
that could play that role in the

450
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,487
ecosystem. Yes, Dave?

451
00:22:18,562 --> 00:22:22,027
Okay, Stephen, I'm interested

452
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,112
by the way that the ecosystem,

453
00:22:25,537 --> 00:22:27,177
this question of what's in the Markov

454
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:30,672
blanket and the nonequilibrium steady

455
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:34,717
state and what's in the niche and those

456
00:22:34,765 --> 00:22:37,957
three things are kind of dynamic. So I

457
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,152
think over time, looking at the way the

458
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,147
world is and without getting too

459
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:47,375
evangelical, there's lots of big

460
00:22:47,737 --> 00:22:49,882
claims made about active coherence and

461
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:53,127
its potential. And as we've

462
00:22:53,157 --> 00:22:55,252
been having conversations, we've seen a

463
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,322
lot of things at scale come up, which is

464
00:22:57,355 --> 00:22:59,525
quite exciting conversations around

465
00:22:59,887 --> 00:23:01,867
that, but often maybe a little bit

466
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:04,627
fuzzy, a little bit conceptual. So I

467
00:23:04,645 --> 00:23:06,877
think some of the stuff that's going to

468
00:23:06,895 --> 00:23:09,125
come out there, the lab is going to be

469
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:11,737
spinning off as much as it might be

470
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,175
holding on to.

471
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:18,537
Excellent. Thank you. So that concludes

472
00:23:18,612 --> 00:23:21,662
the discussion on the strategy update.

473
00:23:22,012 --> 00:23:26,182
The second lab scale update is to

474
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:30,097
mention our advisory board. So this

475
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,857
information can be found at our website

476
00:23:32,935 --> 00:23:35,257
Active Inference. And on the top right

477
00:23:35,335 --> 00:23:36,942
head over to where it says Advisory

478
00:23:37,002 --> 00:23:40,477
Board. The advisory board is and

479
00:23:40,645 --> 00:23:42,622
insight and guidance board. It's not a

480
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:45,772
managerial board and it exists to help

481
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:48,552
the lab make better strategic decisions.

482
00:23:48,732 --> 00:23:51,142
So we engage our advisory board

483
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,837
participants in terms of their

484
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,447
expertise, different recommendations and

485
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,522
questions they have for the lab and we

486
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:01,327
recognize and hope to draw on and

487
00:24:01,345 --> 00:24:04,072
synergize with their experience in many,

488
00:24:04,105 --> 00:24:07,302
many different areas. We have and image

489
00:24:07,332 --> 00:24:11,437
here from Kirchhoff Ant All 2018 about

490
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,487
nested systems and about the way

491
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,902
that as systems develop, for example,

492
00:24:17,995 --> 00:24:20,922
as potentially and overdevelopmental

493
00:24:20,967 --> 00:24:23,917
time, a zygote goes from being a single

494
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:26,557
cell enclosed by a lipid bilayer towards

495
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:30,327
increasingly ramified levels

496
00:24:30,357 --> 00:24:32,377
of embryonic complexity or similar

497
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,922
transitions could be happening over

498
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:36,397
evolutionary time. Something like that

499
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,142
is occurring as we elaborate and build

500
00:24:39,265 --> 00:24:42,500
the ActInf lab. We have an awesome

501
00:24:42,862 --> 00:24:45,502
initial Conor of the advisory board,

502
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,517
and it includes Bradley, Alicia, john

503
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:51,477
Boyke, matt Brain, john Kippinger,

504
00:24:51,582 --> 00:24:55,212
scott David Jeff, Emmett, Chris Fields,

505
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:57,972
karl Friston, raphael Kaufman,

506
00:24:58,092 --> 00:25:01,677
anatole Levinschuk, roslyn Morin, elvis

507
00:25:01,707 --> 00:25:05,127
Arano, cheryl Benhoof tim Rebellion,

508
00:25:05,232 --> 00:25:08,827
swan Webb and Michael Zargam. And we

509
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,467
have already received really important

510
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,797
and meaningful feedback from them and

511
00:25:14,905 --> 00:25:17,302
really appreciate it. And for those who

512
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,972
are interested in the kinds of work that

513
00:25:20,005 --> 00:25:23,347
we're up to and might have experience in

514
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,137
a certain domain that could be helpful,

515
00:25:25,212 --> 00:25:27,102
for example, related to educational

516
00:25:27,132 --> 00:25:30,202
nonprofits, then perhaps get in touch

517
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,427
with us. But this is a major change to

518
00:25:33,445 --> 00:25:36,312
the Lab scale to introduce and advisory

519
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:39,727
board and we're off to a fun start with

520
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:41,677
them so far. So we look forward to just

521
00:25:41,695 --> 00:25:43,337
seeing how that continues.

522
00:25:45,412 --> 00:25:48,442
Any other comments on Active at the Lab

523
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:51,212
scale or we can head to the projects.

524
00:25:54,837 --> 00:25:58,542
Okay, so as we head through these

525
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,827
projects, feel free to raise your hand

526
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:03,537
ant any point if you want to add a

527
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,577
comment or a question. And as a

528
00:26:05,595 --> 00:26:07,767
participatory lab, those who are

529
00:26:07,815 --> 00:26:09,550
listening and you've made it this far,

530
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:12,252
recognize that all of these reflect the

531
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,862
contributions of participants and

532
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,097
reflect affordances for you to

533
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,152
contribute further, even if only to

534
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,727
reduce your uncertainty about the

535
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,497
documentation or the way that something

536
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,422
is occurring. So hopefully if you're

537
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:26,642
listening to this string of symbols,

538
00:26:26,777 --> 00:26:28,152
know that you can participate and

539
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,777
perhaps you even should. We're going to

540
00:26:30,795 --> 00:26:33,077
talk about a few different projects

541
00:26:33,107 --> 00:26:36,102
today, in fact eleven different of them.

542
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,622
And you can see loosely on the left that

543
00:26:38,655 --> 00:26:41,372
these are in three organizational

544
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:44,222
units.edu, comma and tools.

545
00:26:44,342 --> 00:26:47,487
But the project scale is really where

546
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,637
the team and the roles and the practices

547
00:26:49,712 --> 00:26:52,182
occur. So we're highlighting the project

548
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,707
scale and the project is also the unit

549
00:26:54,722 --> 00:26:56,922
of Granularity where you can really get

550
00:26:56,955 --> 00:26:58,962
involved and make a contribution. So

551
00:26:59,025 --> 00:27:00,347
showing up for our synchronous

552
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:02,772
organizational unit meetings is an

553
00:27:02,805 --> 00:27:05,517
awesome way to kind of paint a first

554
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:07,677
Costa and to be exposed to many of the

555
00:27:07,695 --> 00:27:10,122
projects. But by and large, the

556
00:27:10,155 --> 00:27:11,862
contributions happen at the project

557
00:27:11,925 --> 00:27:14,772
scale and asynchronously so, all

558
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:17,432
backgrounds, all time zones, all levels

559
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:19,917
of commitment, everyone is welcome to

560
00:27:19,965 --> 00:27:21,897
get involved with these projects, which

561
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,077
we're going to go through now. They're

562
00:27:24,107 --> 00:27:25,727
going to be the active coherence

563
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:28,377
ontology the active inference course,

564
00:27:28,545 --> 00:27:30,627
internal educational initiatives like

565
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:31,847
the systems thinking, reading,

566
00:27:31,892 --> 00:27:33,492
discussion group and ontology working

567
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,162
group active inference journal research

568
00:27:36,225 --> 00:27:39,722
updates, live streams, podcasts,

569
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:42,527
social media, active blockerents

570
00:27:42,632 --> 00:27:45,267
robotics and embodied and active lab

571
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:49,387
meta modeling. On we go to the ontology.

572
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:54,032
We've just recently pushed an update

573
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:57,012
to the Active Coherence ontology and

574
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:00,475
it's available at this Coda link here.

575
00:28:00,837 --> 00:28:02,252
The goal of the Active Inference

576
00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:04,092
Ontology is to increase the

577
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,077
accessibility and impact of active

578
00:28:06,107 --> 00:28:08,397
inference by increasing clarity and

579
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,872
interoperability and expressivity and

580
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:13,032
all these other good things about terms

581
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,017
and ideas. And when you go to this site,

582
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,262
you'll find that there's and explanatory

583
00:28:19,337 --> 00:28:22,457
preamble. And what this ontology

584
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:25,317
release contains primarily are two

585
00:28:25,365 --> 00:28:27,122
different kinds of things, proposed

586
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:29,472
definitions and translations. So first,

587
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:31,782
the proposed definitions. This is what

588
00:28:31,785 --> 00:28:33,702
the proposed definitions look like for

589
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,822
the core terms. The terms are

590
00:28:36,855 --> 00:28:39,312
on the left column here and then

591
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,472
everywhere there's an app and a Bleu is

592
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:43,817
like a clickable link to another term.

593
00:28:43,877 --> 00:28:45,632
So it's kind of like how dictionaries

594
00:28:45,722 --> 00:28:48,327
use other words in that language and it

595
00:28:48,345 --> 00:28:50,747
will say A is kind of like B, except

596
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:53,087
it's different than C. And so that's

597
00:28:53,162 --> 00:28:55,697
what the definitions are. Their natural

598
00:28:55,742 --> 00:28:59,217
language answers to the question what is

599
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,922
X? And so these proposed definitions are

600
00:29:02,955 --> 00:29:05,247
currently in natural language, but there

601
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,017
are other ways to develop them. More

602
00:29:07,065 --> 00:29:09,582
formally, the proposed definitions are

603
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,172
there for those who just say, well,

604
00:29:11,205 --> 00:29:14,177
what does this term mean? It also helps

605
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:16,212
with computationally aided sense making.

606
00:29:16,275 --> 00:29:18,327
And then the second piece that is in

607
00:29:18,345 --> 00:29:21,372
this current release of the ontology is

608
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:23,652
the translations. And so here's the

609
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,302
current view of the top of the

610
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,832
translations table. So we have the term

611
00:29:28,922 --> 00:29:32,172
in the English on the left side and then

612
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,352
we have so far complete translations of

613
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,967
the core ontology terms into Spanish,

614
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:40,387
Portuguese, French, Italian,

615
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:44,127
Czech, Russian and Hebrew, and some

616
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,047
German and some others that are sort of

617
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,897
beginning. So especially if you have

618
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:52,197
fluency or friends with fluency in some

619
00:29:52,305 --> 00:29:54,717
of these languages, but especially new

620
00:29:54,765 --> 00:29:56,682
and different languages, this is a

621
00:29:56,685 --> 00:29:59,477
really awesome opportunity to translate

622
00:29:59,582 --> 00:30:02,762
some terms, which are mostly normal

623
00:30:02,837 --> 00:30:06,325
natural language terms, into another

624
00:30:06,687 --> 00:30:09,267
human natural language. And that will

625
00:30:09,315 --> 00:30:12,222
facilitate the ability to, for example,

626
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,897
deploy educational information or

627
00:30:16,005 --> 00:30:18,657
transcripts and their translations do it

628
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,582
in a way that's rigorous and accessible

629
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,397
and meets people where they are in terms

630
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,437
of their language fluency. Yes. Dave

631
00:30:32,637 --> 00:30:36,487
okay, so that's the Active Ontology

632
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:39,932
project where we're developing

633
00:30:40,022 --> 00:30:43,427
participatory biology for active

634
00:30:43,457 --> 00:30:46,647
inference terms. Stephen, can I just

635
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,732
ask, not putting you on the spot, but if

636
00:30:48,735 --> 00:30:51,117
I was to ask you what areas have been

637
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:59,892
the most challenging or the most

638
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,402
difficult to overcome? And what

639
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,652
are the sort of questions that are still

640
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,837
being grappled with on the ontology?

641
00:31:08,187 --> 00:31:09,912
And which ones have we overcome already?

642
00:31:09,975 --> 00:31:12,072
And which ones are still sitting there

643
00:31:12,105 --> 00:31:14,052
in the background? I'm just curious if

644
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,482
you got any thoughts on that. Yeah,

645
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,027
good question. I'll give a thought and

646
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:19,752
then anyone else is welcome to if they

647
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:23,262
want. One interesting thing is

648
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:25,547
these definitions, although many papers

649
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,737
do sometimes define their terms either

650
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,702
in the text or in a box or in a

651
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,297
glossary, that doesn't mean that the way

652
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,792
that the terms are defined are coherent

653
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,252
or compatible or consistent.

654
00:31:38,432 --> 00:31:40,707
And a lot of times it's like a yes and

655
00:31:40,785 --> 00:31:42,342
someone defines it one way and someone

656
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:43,877
else just kind of takes a different spin

657
00:31:43,907 --> 00:31:45,972
on it. But other times we have come

658
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:48,362
across several situations altogether,

659
00:31:48,437 --> 00:31:50,772
all of us, at least here, where there

660
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:54,072
were incompatible seeming uses of

661
00:31:54,105 --> 00:31:56,922
terms. And perhaps that happens with all

662
00:31:56,955 --> 00:31:59,427
kinds of linguistic elements. So that

663
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:02,027
was one interesting thing, was that it's

664
00:32:02,057 --> 00:32:03,642
not just like we're looking through

665
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,152
papers and copying sentences. There's

666
00:32:06,182 --> 00:32:09,552
actually a really powerful process of

667
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,297
the discussion that we had focusing week

668
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,672
by week on just a few terms or one term

669
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:17,322
where we were seeing all the different

670
00:32:17,355 --> 00:32:19,407
ways that different terms are being used

671
00:32:19,485 --> 00:32:21,452
inside and outside of active inference

672
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:23,922
and just trying to work towards some

673
00:32:23,955 --> 00:32:26,587
kind of grip on that. Bleu.

674
00:32:30,387 --> 00:32:33,522
So one of the biggest challenges that I

675
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:36,677
think we face is dirty and incomplete

676
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:40,752
data, which is like pervasive across

677
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,377
field and disciplines everywhere. So I

678
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,897
mean, trying to be the bridge to fill

679
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,967
the gaps, to make the data, to complete

680
00:32:48,015 --> 00:32:51,242
the data. There's always opportunities

681
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,577
if people want to get involved, like in

682
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,900
filling out the data, like helping us to

683
00:32:57,312 --> 00:32:59,802
have a complete picture of which to

684
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,222
metamodel. Awesome. And there are

685
00:33:03,255 --> 00:33:06,327
other columns and features of the

686
00:33:06,345 --> 00:33:08,577
ontology that we're working on in the

687
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:10,047
lab for anybody who wants to get

688
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,677
involved, like correct examples,

689
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,917
just simple declarative, concise

690
00:33:16,052 --> 00:33:18,807
positive examples of terms being used

691
00:33:18,885 --> 00:33:21,372
correctly, that's awesome.

692
00:33:21,555 --> 00:33:25,077
Incorrect examples, people who are using

693
00:33:25,245 --> 00:33:27,302
sentences. It doesn't have to be caught

694
00:33:27,332 --> 00:33:29,292
in the wild, but it could be but just

695
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,077
generative sentences that are like

696
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:34,922
counterexamples can be very helpful

697
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:37,002
for both humans and computers in their

698
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,087
learning. And so we have examples,

699
00:33:40,587 --> 00:33:43,652
counter examples, formalisms connecting

700
00:33:43,757 --> 00:33:46,562
Jorge terms and other terms to equations

701
00:33:46,637 --> 00:33:48,732
and papers and connecting it with

702
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,892
literature corpus. So there's so many

703
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,477
angles. Those with curiosity and

704
00:33:54,495 --> 00:33:56,907
expertise in active inference and or

705
00:33:56,985 --> 00:33:59,657
ontology should absolutely get involved

706
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:01,892
with this, which will be a long term

707
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:04,032
project of the lab and we hope to find

708
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,027
new ways of deploying it. And just to

709
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,597
give one little contextualizing slide

710
00:34:08,642 --> 00:34:12,722
here, this entire continuum

711
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,872
can be considered to be different types

712
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:18,237
or grades or like a taxonomy of

713
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,417
ontologies. And so ontologies in their

714
00:34:21,465 --> 00:34:23,847
most informal can be as simple as a list

715
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,227
of terms or glossaries the sources or

716
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,687
what we have right now with the current

717
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,017
release, which is like a principled,

718
00:34:33,077 --> 00:34:35,172
informal, hierarchical and some

719
00:34:35,205 --> 00:34:36,902
relationships amongst terms. And that's

720
00:34:36,932 --> 00:34:38,942
what we have right now with the proposed

721
00:34:39,002 --> 00:34:42,492
definitions and translations. We're also

722
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,247
working with the Ontology working group

723
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,657
which we'll talk about in a few minutes

724
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:48,777
on foraging that ontology, for example,

725
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:52,242
using Sumo and cue Kev and thinking

726
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,377
about how do we integrate the ontology

727
00:34:54,482 --> 00:34:56,297
with course development, with knowledge

728
00:34:56,342 --> 00:34:58,817
engineering and literature integration.

729
00:34:58,952 --> 00:35:02,187
So some of the many things that people

730
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,925
can look forward to.

731
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:09,282
Okay, on to the second project,

732
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,152
which is the Active Course. So in

733
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,872
the active Course project we are seeking

734
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:17,997
to create a learning platform that

735
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,727
embodies the principles of active

736
00:35:19,757 --> 00:35:21,942
inference and facilitates the learning

737
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,072
of its principles and concepts to

738
00:35:24,105 --> 00:35:26,657
learners of many different backgrounds.

739
00:35:26,822 --> 00:35:30,775
And this is something that we are not

740
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:35,642
too far down the road on but are eagerly

741
00:35:35,702 --> 00:35:37,947
looking forward to especially in light

742
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,452
of some recent epistemic changes in our

743
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,552
niche which we'll talk about soon but

744
00:35:42,645 --> 00:35:46,277
there's a massive potential for active

745
00:35:46,307 --> 00:35:48,777
inference education and we hope to have

746
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,702
course offerings and educational

747
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:53,082
experiences that meet that opportunity.

748
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:56,742
Alex? Yes, just a quick

749
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,537
note to avoid possible misunderstanding

750
00:35:59,612 --> 00:36:02,667
that action platform here is not

751
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:07,150
like for some It platform but more about

752
00:36:07,587 --> 00:36:11,052
set of educational services which will

753
00:36:11,145 --> 00:36:13,825
be supported to improve learning

754
00:36:14,262 --> 00:36:17,382
affordance. Yes,

755
00:36:17,535 --> 00:36:20,050
good call, thanks for clarifying that.

756
00:36:20,562 --> 00:36:23,847
So if you're interested or

757
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,725
curious about course design education,

758
00:36:27,162 --> 00:36:29,772
education in a participatory way

759
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:33,167
nonprofits, those are all excellent cues

760
00:36:33,227 --> 00:36:34,962
for people who'd like to come on board

761
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:37,422
and help in a serious way for this

762
00:36:37,455 --> 00:36:39,147
course as we start to think about what

763
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,075
it can be.

764
00:36:41,562 --> 00:36:42,325
Okay,

765
00:36:44,487 --> 00:36:47,792
third project we have several internal

766
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:50,892
educational initiatives in active lab

767
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:54,902
and so on the left we see the Systems

768
00:36:54,932 --> 00:36:57,027
thinking reading discussion group and on

769
00:36:57,045 --> 00:36:58,752
the right ontology working group the

770
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:02,277
OWG. Alex or anyone? Would you like

771
00:37:02,295 --> 00:37:04,677
to describe or give a note on either of

772
00:37:04,695 --> 00:37:05,662
these sides?

773
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,955
I just want to say that from the very

774
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:18,930
beginning we consider that we should not

775
00:37:18,977 --> 00:37:22,460
only learn and educate

776
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:25,737
active coherence but also to learn.

777
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,380
As you mentioned before, state of our

778
00:37:28,427 --> 00:37:32,187
practices and systems was one of the

779
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:35,535
main discipline from the beginning what

780
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:39,335
we think is very useful for collective

781
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,430
work especially in remote mode. So it's

782
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:46,212
great right now more and more people

783
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,685
start learning and it definitely will

784
00:37:50,717 --> 00:37:53,325
improve our communication and speed up

785
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:55,825
our activity on the projects.

786
00:37:56,925 --> 00:38:00,060
Thank you. Yes, Ivanne has been

787
00:38:00,092 --> 00:38:02,025
facilitating the Systems Thinking

788
00:38:02,087 --> 00:38:05,160
Reading discussion group strdg and we

789
00:38:05,192 --> 00:38:07,685
have an intrepid group of participants

790
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:10,860
who are working their way through this

791
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:12,755
online course and having regular

792
00:38:12,815 --> 00:38:14,495
discussions and asynchronous

793
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:17,385
conversation as well around it. And as

794
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:19,620
Alex said, this is really important for

795
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,540
the ways that we work together and

796
00:38:21,557 --> 00:38:24,510
communication. And on the right side we

797
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:27,315
have the Ontology Working Group. So

798
00:38:27,482 --> 00:38:29,660
previously we were discussing the active

799
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:32,420
ontology as a project where we're

800
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,620
talking about active inference terms and

801
00:38:34,622 --> 00:38:36,620
how they're related in the ontology

802
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:39,300
working group. We are increasing our

803
00:38:39,362 --> 00:38:42,900
competency in computational ontology and

804
00:38:42,962 --> 00:38:44,630
what that chaos looked like primarily

805
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,645
has been working with the Sumo suggested

806
00:38:47,735 --> 00:38:51,455
upper merged ontology system in Suo Kif

807
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,990
and working through the textbook of

808
00:38:55,007 --> 00:38:57,975
Adam Tie. And this has been an awesome

809
00:38:58,037 --> 00:39:00,635
experience. Dave has made a massive

810
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,000
amount of contributions and ontological

811
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,940
limericks of different formats. And that

812
00:39:08,957 --> 00:39:10,920
has also been a great learning

813
00:39:10,997 --> 00:39:13,230
experience that hopefully will fold back

814
00:39:13,277 --> 00:39:16,265
in towards improving the active

815
00:39:16,295 --> 00:39:18,090
inference ontology. But it's also just a

816
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:21,315
learning initiative. And that brings us

817
00:39:21,332 --> 00:39:24,900
to an ongoing learning

818
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:27,365
initiative which is the release,

819
00:39:27,545 --> 00:39:31,620
literally, in the last several DAGs of

820
00:39:31,772 --> 00:39:35,315
the textbook by thomas Parr, Giovanni

821
00:39:35,345 --> 00:39:37,710
Pezzulo, and karl Friston, it's the

822
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:41,955
active inference textbook. And we asked,

823
00:39:42,077 --> 00:39:45,795
well, what can the ActInf lab do for

824
00:39:45,872 --> 00:39:50,115
slash with? Around the

825
00:39:50,132 --> 00:39:53,450
textbook. Do you want to join a textbook

826
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:56,040
group? Not just a reading group, just a

827
00:39:56,057 --> 00:39:58,665
textbook group, because we are going to

828
00:39:58,682 --> 00:40:01,475
be organizing cohorts of textbook groups

829
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:03,840
and you can email us for the form if you

830
00:40:03,857 --> 00:40:06,090
don't already have access to it, but you

831
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:09,405
will fill out a form that asks whether

832
00:40:09,452 --> 00:40:13,400
you'd like to join an upcoming textbook

833
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,680
group cohort and it will be done in

834
00:40:16,727 --> 00:40:19,650
groups and cohorts. Yes, you're ready or

835
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,810
no, you'd like to perhaps hear about

836
00:40:21,842 --> 00:40:24,237
that affordance in a few months?

837
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,465
We ask for name, email address and

838
00:40:27,482 --> 00:40:29,490
country, whether you have a textbook or

839
00:40:29,507 --> 00:40:31,350
not, and then just for you to provide

840
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:33,855
several sentences or more on your level

841
00:40:33,902 --> 00:40:35,835
of familiarity and your interest in

842
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:39,540
active inference and all backgrounds and

843
00:40:39,557 --> 00:40:41,705
familiarities, as with all activities,

844
00:40:41,765 --> 00:40:43,815
are welcome. This is going to be a

845
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:47,085
really awesome experience, I think, to

846
00:40:47,192 --> 00:40:50,535
work through this textbook and see

847
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:53,775
it as just one pebble on the ant hill or

848
00:40:53,837 --> 00:40:56,025
the tip of the iceberg or any other

849
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:58,515
metaphor that people use. For the way in

850
00:40:58,532 --> 00:41:02,415
which this textbook will both be a

851
00:41:02,432 --> 00:41:05,835
visible and centralizing artifact as

852
00:41:05,867 --> 00:41:08,220
well as something that is really only a

853
00:41:08,222 --> 00:41:09,885
few hundred pages long. And it's a

854
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:13,580
relatively small physical book. So it's

855
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,585
just the beginning, it's not the end of

856
00:41:15,617 --> 00:41:17,835
active inference and those in the

857
00:41:17,867 --> 00:41:20,385
textbook groups will realize that and

858
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:23,810
enact it. Any comments on internal

859
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:25,375
educational initiatives?

860
00:41:28,575 --> 00:41:29,412
All right.

861
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,940
Number four, the active inference

862
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,800
journal. So in this project we are

863
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:40,185
publishing knowledge artifacts so that

864
00:41:40,217 --> 00:41:42,615
they are searchable, indexable and

865
00:41:42,632 --> 00:41:45,470
citable. Most recently, in the active

866
00:41:45,485 --> 00:41:47,940
inference journal, we uploaded a second

867
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:51,510
improved version of the transcript of

868
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,465
the Karl Friston symposium applied

869
00:41:53,495 --> 00:41:55,935
active inference symposium. That was in

870
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:59,160
June 2021. And from that

871
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:02,325
we are improving our methodology that we

872
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:05,175
learnt and learnt by doing in that first

873
00:42:05,237 --> 00:42:07,950
symposium transcript process and

874
00:42:08,012 --> 00:42:10,970
applying that to other event recordings.

875
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,680
For example, Gas stream 16 with Mark

876
00:42:13,727 --> 00:42:16,635
Solms and Livestream number 40 with a

877
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,887
quantum free free energy principle.

878
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:23,205
The journal is going to be a great place

879
00:42:23,252 --> 00:42:25,740
where we continue to build a

880
00:42:25,757 --> 00:42:28,375
participatory pipeline for improving

881
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,125
spoken and written dissemination.

882
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,290
Anything that anyone wants to add on

883
00:42:34,307 --> 00:42:37,450
this? Yes, Dave.

884
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:42,860
Yeah, I sent the original

885
00:42:42,905 --> 00:42:47,235
paper and the three video

886
00:42:47,342 --> 00:42:50,085
segments to Sean Carroll along with a

887
00:42:50,117 --> 00:42:53,400
summary of the three big points.

888
00:42:53,462 --> 00:42:56,790
In the summary he says this is cool,

889
00:42:56,882 --> 00:43:01,065
I will check it out, which I'm sure

890
00:43:01,157 --> 00:43:03,015
incentivizes the gentleman who

891
00:43:03,032 --> 00:43:05,705
volunteered to go through our transcript

892
00:43:05,765 --> 00:43:08,205
and make it more presentable to get

893
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,235
through that. And then we can send that

894
00:43:11,267 --> 00:43:13,560
to the very busy Dr. Carol who just has

895
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:15,687
a new appointment. He is something like

896
00:43:16,875 --> 00:43:20,105
the chair of the Philosophy of Science

897
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:24,225
at Johns Hopkins. So all his

898
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:28,560
pain of being denied tenure is paying

899
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:32,280
off and he may

900
00:43:32,327 --> 00:43:34,155
pay off. He already, I think, gets along

901
00:43:34,202 --> 00:43:37,590
very well with Professor Friston. He

902
00:43:37,607 --> 00:43:39,810
says, I have never had to work so hard

903
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,645
in an interview with somebody who is so

904
00:43:42,722 --> 00:43:44,565
knowledgeable and well spoken and

905
00:43:44,582 --> 00:43:47,937
anxious to communicate. Awesome.

906
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:51,450
And it's a great example of a project

907
00:43:51,512 --> 00:43:53,960
that increases accessibility.

908
00:43:54,155 --> 00:43:57,825
For example, by taking two or 6

909
00:43:57,887 --> 00:44:01,230
hours of YouTube discussions and making

910
00:44:01,277 --> 00:44:04,215
them searchable and translatable and

911
00:44:04,232 --> 00:44:06,785
then also reduces reachers research debt

912
00:44:06,905 --> 00:44:10,845
because we can have somebody spend three

913
00:44:10,922 --> 00:44:13,695
or 7 hours improving and foraging a

914
00:44:13,697 --> 00:44:15,900
manuscript and finding when somebody

915
00:44:15,962 --> 00:44:18,225
mentioned this paper here's that

916
00:44:18,287 --> 00:44:21,810
specific citation that multiplied by

917
00:44:21,842 --> 00:44:23,835
thousands of people searching for that

918
00:44:23,867 --> 00:44:25,530
paper. Maybe they have access, maybe

919
00:44:25,577 --> 00:44:26,865
they don't, maybe they misheard the

920
00:44:26,882 --> 00:44:29,760
name. There's so much that we can be

921
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,475
proactive about in terms of making our

922
00:44:32,537 --> 00:44:34,635
knowledge corpus really accessible and

923
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:38,135
meaningful and woven according to Modern

924
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,355
practices. Okay, awesome work though.

925
00:44:41,402 --> 00:44:44,805
Dave and others on the journal Maria and

926
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:48,045
others as well. Okay,

927
00:44:48,197 --> 00:44:51,585
on five we have research

928
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:55,260
updates. So this is not a project that

929
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,860
we actively steward per se in the lab,

930
00:44:58,892 --> 00:45:01,470
but this is just capturing research

931
00:45:01,547 --> 00:45:04,080
that's in progress and finished by lab

932
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:08,115
participants. So just to highlight a few

933
00:45:08,282 --> 00:45:10,320
papers and products that have been

934
00:45:10,397 --> 00:45:12,075
released by active inference lab

935
00:45:12,137 --> 00:45:15,015
participants, but not necessarily as an

936
00:45:15,032 --> 00:45:16,935
active lab project in the last few

937
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:20,315
months. So by Avel, Gwen and Carlos,

938
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,625
aka Serval, aka Icarus, the paper

939
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,940
cognitive agency in sociocultural

940
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:29,760
evolution, and then and awesome

941
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:33,480
collaborative paper that we wrote with

942
00:45:33,602 --> 00:45:37,085
myself, Sean, Arhan, RJ, Shadi,

943
00:45:37,205 --> 00:45:39,620
Avel, Bleu, Yvonne, Sid,

944
00:45:39,785 --> 00:45:42,965
Amit, Jacob, Caleb and Alex,

945
00:45:43,145 --> 00:45:46,235
where we talked about decentralized

946
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,020
science DSI. We integrated some of the

947
00:45:49,022 --> 00:45:51,800
more technological perspectives on DSI,

948
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,910
for example, related to Web Three, and

949
00:45:53,942 --> 00:45:57,090
Blockchain and juxtapose that with some

950
00:45:57,107 --> 00:45:58,965
of the bottom up, the view from the

951
00:45:58,982 --> 00:46:02,400
bottom participatory sense making and

952
00:46:02,537 --> 00:46:06,485
epistemic, commons and produced.

953
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,570
An active entity ontology for science

954
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:12,195
AOS that we hope will allow us to have a

955
00:46:12,197 --> 00:46:14,000
way to model some of these complex

956
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:16,635
epidemic ecosystems in the encoding

957
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:18,900
months. So that's just some of the

958
00:46:18,962 --> 00:46:21,210
research and there's other awesome

959
00:46:21,317 --> 00:46:23,050
research. Seth in progress.

960
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,812
Okay, on to yes, Steven, go for it.

961
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,955
Yeah, I'd be curious. I think this work

962
00:46:33,002 --> 00:46:35,460
with situated sense making the

963
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:38,205
decentralized science is really

964
00:46:38,252 --> 00:46:41,700
interesting and I think there'd be ways

965
00:46:41,762 --> 00:46:44,475
that the other areas of sense making

966
00:46:44,537 --> 00:46:47,505
which this can be helpful to bridge that

967
00:46:47,552 --> 00:46:50,220
active coherence generative model

968
00:46:50,222 --> 00:46:53,655
modeling approach with other ways. So

969
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,980
I'm really glad that you did this work,

970
00:46:56,027 --> 00:46:58,745
actually, as a group, and I think it's

971
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,530
going to help tell another story, which

972
00:47:01,577 --> 00:47:04,005
might have been a bit too hard to tell

973
00:47:04,127 --> 00:47:06,045
from the ground up, but now you've got a

974
00:47:06,047 --> 00:47:09,462
bridge. So. Thanks, Conor.

975
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,060
Okay, on to six. So we

976
00:47:15,092 --> 00:47:19,410
had awesome live streams as usual in

977
00:47:19,442 --> 00:47:23,180
this quarter at the Coda IO

978
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,040
Slash ActInf Lab, active lab, you can

979
00:47:26,132 --> 00:47:29,425
find the past and upcoming live streams.

980
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:34,425
We had several guest streams and other

981
00:47:34,487 --> 00:47:36,360
kinds of streams, but most of our

982
00:47:36,392 --> 00:47:38,910
streams in the last few months were the

983
00:47:39,017 --> 00:47:42,215
paper discussions. So in Livestream

984
00:47:42,245 --> 00:47:46,065
number 35, one and two. So, as with all

985
00:47:46,082 --> 00:47:48,390
of these there was a dot zero, a

986
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,712
background and contextualizing video

987
00:47:51,075 --> 00:47:53,240
that was prepared in the weeks leading

988
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,625
up to the dot one, dot two discussions

989
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,405
which are participatory group

990
00:47:57,452 --> 00:47:59,760
discussions. So if you ever see a paper

991
00:47:59,867 --> 00:48:01,665
where you want to be in the dot one or

992
00:48:01,682 --> 00:48:04,155
the dot two and be part of a group and

993
00:48:04,202 --> 00:48:05,690
you don't need to say a ton, no one's

994
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,080
going to call on you, you can ask

995
00:48:07,127 --> 00:48:08,505
anything you want, provide any

996
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,590
perspectives. You're always welcome to

997
00:48:10,607 --> 00:48:12,890
join that way. And then something that's

998
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,510
incredibly helpful for the lab is to

999
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:18,660
commit assuredly ahead of time and

1000
00:48:18,692 --> 00:48:20,835
contribute to the dot zero making the

1001
00:48:20,867 --> 00:48:23,640
slides and helping contextualize the

1002
00:48:23,657 --> 00:48:26,540
paper ahead of the dot one and the dot

1003
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,535
two. So we in the last few months have

1004
00:48:29,567 --> 00:48:32,910
talked about in number 35 we talked

1005
00:48:32,942 --> 00:48:34,755
about a tail of two architectures, free

1006
00:48:34,802 --> 00:48:37,150
energy, its models and modularity.

1007
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,085
Check out the live streams to learn

1008
00:48:41,117 --> 00:48:43,055
more. I won't even attempt to summarize

1009
00:48:43,115 --> 00:48:44,685
the papers other than just to state

1010
00:48:44,717 --> 00:48:48,290
their titles. In 36 we discussed

1011
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,325
modeling ourselves what the free energy

1012
00:48:50,387 --> 00:48:52,460
principle reveals about our implicit

1013
00:48:52,505 --> 00:48:55,910
notions of representation. We then dove

1014
00:48:55,955 --> 00:48:58,905
a bit into the technical in 37 with Free

1015
00:48:58,952 --> 00:49:02,505
Energy a user's guide in 38

1016
00:49:02,552 --> 00:49:04,160
discussed the evolution of brain

1017
00:49:04,205 --> 00:49:06,035
architecture's for predictive coding.

1018
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:10,175
Active inference lab in 39 discussed

1019
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,440
Morphogenesis as Bayesian Coherence, a

1020
00:49:13,457 --> 00:49:15,185
variational approach to pattern

1021
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:17,255
formation and control in complex

1022
00:49:17,315 --> 00:49:20,760
biological systems. And then in 40 we

1023
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:22,905
discussed a free energy principle for

1024
00:49:22,952 --> 00:49:26,310
generic quantum systems which was, as

1025
00:49:26,342 --> 00:49:29,430
anybody who was there before or during

1026
00:49:29,477 --> 00:49:31,755
or after it happened, can attest, was

1027
00:49:31,877 --> 00:49:33,825
quite a special and interesting

1028
00:49:33,962 --> 00:49:37,110
experience. And just to show what that

1029
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:39,360
Coda a page looks like, if you head over

1030
00:49:39,392 --> 00:49:42,785
there, you'll see the encoding streams.

1031
00:49:42,905 --> 00:49:46,280
Here we are in the end of March. It's

1032
00:49:46,415 --> 00:49:48,240
not in the live stream section, it's in

1033
00:49:48,257 --> 00:49:52,040
the roundtable

1034
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:56,250
section. Here we are right now. But in

1035
00:49:56,312 --> 00:49:58,845
live streams you'll see the papers that

1036
00:49:58,847 --> 00:50:00,960
we're going to be discussing in the

1037
00:50:00,992 --> 00:50:03,150
coming months. So if you're interested

1038
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:05,760
in any of these upcoming papers, please

1039
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:08,175
get involved in the dot zero zero or the

1040
00:50:08,237 --> 00:50:10,935
dot one and two. If you're interested in

1041
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:13,215
inviting anybody or yourself, being a

1042
00:50:13,232 --> 00:50:16,485
guest on a guest stream, that's always

1043
00:50:16,517 --> 00:50:19,995
an affordance. These are like one off or

1044
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:22,790
small series that can be on active

1045
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,905
inference research or related topics.

1046
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,990
And we've had some great discussions in

1047
00:50:28,007 --> 00:50:31,665
the last few weeks on guest streams. We

1048
00:50:31,682 --> 00:50:35,010
have model streams and math streams that

1049
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:36,935
are for presenting some of the formal

1050
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,215
and model based components of active

1051
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:42,135
inference, and streams where we talk

1052
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:44,310
about organizational principles and

1053
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:47,040
organizational design. So those are just

1054
00:50:47,057 --> 00:50:48,555
some of the live streams that we've had

1055
00:50:48,677 --> 00:50:51,915
and it's been fun. So especially

1056
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,210
if you want to give a guest stream, or

1057
00:50:54,242 --> 00:50:57,075
if you can connect to somebody who does

1058
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,325
want to or encourage or recommend

1059
00:50:59,387 --> 00:51:00,495
somebody, or you want to be a

1060
00:51:00,497 --> 00:51:02,205
facilitator for someone else to present

1061
00:51:02,327 --> 00:51:05,165
or any other combination of affordances.

1062
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,530
Let's make it happen because we can get

1063
00:51:07,577 --> 00:51:11,340
a lot of awesome modifications in our

1064
00:51:11,357 --> 00:51:14,010
niche. I think what they used to call

1065
00:51:14,042 --> 00:51:15,735
making content back in the web. Two

1066
00:51:15,767 --> 00:51:19,375
days. So that's all for Live Streams

1067
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:23,490
podcast Bleu, do you want to give an

1068
00:51:23,507 --> 00:51:27,225
update? Sure. So we are moving through

1069
00:51:27,287 --> 00:51:29,340
the podcast, really revisits a lot of

1070
00:51:29,357 --> 00:51:31,565
the early livestreams. So like if you're

1071
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,165
playing catch up, like if you caught a

1072
00:51:33,182 --> 00:51:34,290
live stream you're like, I should go

1073
00:51:34,307 --> 00:51:35,865
through the back catalog. Like maybe now

1074
00:51:35,882 --> 00:51:37,950
you're on live stream 20 something.

1075
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:40,185
Like the podcast starts with the early

1076
00:51:40,217 --> 00:51:41,505
episodes and I think we're through

1077
00:51:41,552 --> 00:51:44,562
episode nine Livestream number nine now.

1078
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,940
So yeah, check it out. It's fun. Also a

1079
00:51:47,957 --> 00:51:49,950
great chance to get involved if you have

1080
00:51:50,012 --> 00:51:53,010
like AV expertise. Would love to get

1081
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:55,530
some pointers. Also like, I know some

1082
00:51:55,577 --> 00:51:57,485
stuff. I've been clipping the podcast

1083
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,115
for a little bit. So if you'd like to

1084
00:51:59,132 --> 00:52:01,035
learn like the basic things that I know

1085
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:03,615
and want to get involved in making the

1086
00:52:03,632 --> 00:52:06,210
podcast reach out, I could always use

1087
00:52:06,242 --> 00:52:07,485
help. If you want to listen to more

1088
00:52:07,517 --> 00:52:10,512
podcasts, come help me make them.

1089
00:52:11,925 --> 00:52:16,475
Dave? Yeah. If you have listed

1090
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,890
the podcast after nine that

1091
00:52:19,907 --> 00:52:21,765
you're planning to do, I'd like to get

1092
00:52:21,782 --> 00:52:24,762
that because I want to get started with

1093
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,690
just doing basic text conversion on

1094
00:52:27,707 --> 00:52:31,365
this. That assumes that these are

1095
00:52:31,382 --> 00:52:34,110
the priorities, is that correct? These

1096
00:52:34,142 --> 00:52:36,390
are the ones that we want to get in

1097
00:52:36,407 --> 00:52:39,660
front of people. I don't know

1098
00:52:39,692 --> 00:52:41,865
what the priority is there, Dave, but I

1099
00:52:41,882 --> 00:52:43,920
will say, like, there's definitely value

1100
00:52:44,072 --> 00:52:47,550
to having a transcript. I actually

1101
00:52:47,612 --> 00:52:49,730
looked at Pod Dean who is our podcast

1102
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:52,035
platform the other day and they will

1103
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:54,210
transcribe our podcast for us actually

1104
00:52:54,317 --> 00:52:57,465
at if you really want to know what the

1105
00:52:57,482 --> 00:53:00,690
value of transcription is, just the

1106
00:53:00,707 --> 00:53:02,595
value to just put it into text. Now, I

1107
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:04,560
don't know if that comes with periods or

1108
00:53:04,592 --> 00:53:06,660
punctuation or I don't know what that

1109
00:53:06,692 --> 00:53:08,015
output looks like, but there's

1110
00:53:08,045 --> 00:53:10,595
definitely value to having a transcript

1111
00:53:10,685 --> 00:53:12,240
there. I'm not sure that these are

1112
00:53:12,257 --> 00:53:14,100
necessarily the priority, but it's just

1113
00:53:14,162 --> 00:53:15,545
going through the back catalog, it's

1114
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,865
helping me catch up. So I just kind of

1115
00:53:17,882 --> 00:53:20,340
started where I wanted to start at the

1116
00:53:20,357 --> 00:53:21,390
beginning. Why not start at the

1117
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:24,165
beginning, right? I don't know. What I

1118
00:53:24,182 --> 00:53:26,450
love about these podcasts is they're

1119
00:53:26,525 --> 00:53:30,315
short. They're like from four to maybe

1120
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:33,315
15 or ten minutes long.

1121
00:53:33,482 --> 00:53:36,035
And the first time that a speaker

1122
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,780
speaks, they introduction themselves and

1123
00:53:39,902 --> 00:53:42,980
there have been some probable clippings

1124
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,505
and rearrangements which are very

1125
00:53:44,552 --> 00:53:47,645
subtle, that help that listenable

1126
00:53:47,735 --> 00:53:50,675
piece be like coherent.

1127
00:53:50,825 --> 00:53:53,010
It's like an extended thought, even one

1128
00:53:53,042 --> 00:53:54,485
that's distributed across multiple

1129
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:57,312
speakers. So like you hit play,

1130
00:53:57,675 --> 00:54:01,290
listen to it and then you can think and

1131
00:54:01,307 --> 00:54:03,135
reflect because sometimes when it's 2

1132
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:05,495
hours on a paper, it feels like it's

1133
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:07,520
like a rail car coming through. It's

1134
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,585
like every single idea and thing. And

1135
00:54:09,692 --> 00:54:11,535
people say that they pause the live

1136
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:12,960
streams and there's so much and then

1137
00:54:12,992 --> 00:54:14,800
also as the priorities.

1138
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,375
That's something we can figure out and

1139
00:54:18,437 --> 00:54:22,395
discuss. But won't it be amazing when

1140
00:54:22,547 --> 00:54:25,860
the live stream is the

1141
00:54:25,892 --> 00:54:29,430
front car of that train, piercing into

1142
00:54:29,477 --> 00:54:33,060
the future, hashtag doing it live? And

1143
00:54:33,092 --> 00:54:35,865
then there's transcripts for all the

1144
00:54:35,882 --> 00:54:38,355
live streams and that can be on one hand

1145
00:54:38,402 --> 00:54:41,135
connected to the ontology a transcript

1146
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,400
of the live stream itself could exist.

1147
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,255
There could be some clipping and some

1148
00:54:45,302 --> 00:54:48,210
transcripts for the podcast. So as we

1149
00:54:48,317 --> 00:54:51,100
develop our informational biology,

1150
00:54:51,825 --> 00:54:54,285
all of these kinds of connections and

1151
00:54:54,317 --> 00:54:55,935
tasks are in play. It's just a question

1152
00:54:55,967 --> 00:54:59,315
of how late can you stay up, which I've

1153
00:54:59,345 --> 00:55:02,615
wondered about for a long time. Dave

1154
00:55:02,645 --> 00:55:05,490
needs no sleep. The other cool thing

1155
00:55:05,507 --> 00:55:07,880
about the podcast is that it's slide

1156
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,290
free. So where when you're on the

1157
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,540
YouTube watching the live stream, often

1158
00:55:12,632 --> 00:55:15,590
it's associated with some visual image

1159
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,190
and sometimes there will be like a

1160
00:55:17,207 --> 00:55:18,755
description of the image in the podcast,

1161
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,760
but it's nothing that you need to pull.

1162
00:55:20,792 --> 00:55:23,190
Over and look at, which is sometimes if

1163
00:55:23,207 --> 00:55:24,785
you're trying to watch the YouTube

1164
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:26,865
videos on a long drive, it's like that

1165
00:55:26,882 --> 00:55:28,440
might not be safe, but the podcasts are

1166
00:55:28,457 --> 00:55:31,695
definitely commute friendly because you

1167
00:55:31,697 --> 00:55:34,125
don't have to see anything. You can just

1168
00:55:34,187 --> 00:55:36,165
listen. So that's another it just

1169
00:55:36,257 --> 00:55:39,090
offloads the visual input as well. Good

1170
00:55:39,107 --> 00:55:40,962
for the treadmill, stuff like that.

1171
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,300
Great point. Okay, on to

1172
00:55:45,437 --> 00:55:48,875
eight. So some updates

1173
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:53,390
on our I'll

1174
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:57,375
just call it social media. We have our

1175
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:01,185
Twitter with 1359

1176
00:56:01,217 --> 00:56:03,540
followers. We have about, I think we

1177
00:56:03,557 --> 00:56:06,100
cross 300 members in the discord.

1178
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:10,835
Over 770 subscribers on YouTube

1179
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:14,865
and some several hundreds of

1180
00:56:14,882 --> 00:56:18,140
people reached in Facebook

1181
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,720
and anyone who is interested in

1182
00:56:21,797 --> 00:56:24,900
automating social media, that would be

1183
00:56:24,962 --> 00:56:28,215
an excellent affordance Bleu. Yeah,

1184
00:56:28,232 --> 00:56:29,445
definitely. I was just you took the

1185
00:56:29,447 --> 00:56:30,585
words right out of my mouth. And

1186
00:56:30,617 --> 00:56:32,910
Facebook is very new, so we have like

1187
00:56:32,942 --> 00:56:35,040
just 40 likes on our Facebook page. So

1188
00:56:35,057 --> 00:56:37,080
if you're listening to this and you use

1189
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:39,345
Facebook regularly for whatever, I mean,

1190
00:56:39,422 --> 00:56:40,860
it will ping you to remind you about

1191
00:56:40,892 --> 00:56:43,325
podcasts and sometimes live streams.

1192
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,240
Sometimes I say because like I said, we

1193
00:56:45,257 --> 00:56:47,055
need an automated so that's your

1194
00:56:47,102 --> 00:56:48,465
expertise and you want to always be

1195
00:56:48,482 --> 00:56:50,940
reminded about the live streams. Get in

1196
00:56:50,957 --> 00:56:54,200
touch. Yes. Just to be able to preload

1197
00:56:54,275 --> 00:56:57,870
a buffer here in

1198
00:56:57,872 --> 00:57:00,890
the front car of the train, it's

1199
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,350
sometimes hard to clean up the pieces.

1200
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,840
So if you're feeling like that's

1201
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:07,185
something that's interesting to you,

1202
00:57:07,217 --> 00:57:10,365
then there's many opportunities to have

1203
00:57:10,457 --> 00:57:12,720
engagements on different platforms and

1204
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:16,910
just feel free to just engage

1205
00:57:16,955 --> 00:57:18,440
in the comments and in the threads.

1206
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:19,887
However it makes sense.

1207
00:57:21,825 --> 00:57:24,462
Great. Enough with social media.

1208
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:27,960
Okay, onto nine.

1209
00:57:28,142 --> 00:57:29,865
So now we're heading more towards the

1210
00:57:29,882 --> 00:57:32,950
tools. Part of this discussion,

1211
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:38,055
primarily the work of Jacob Smithel has

1212
00:57:38,102 --> 00:57:41,240
Beren just excellent on Active

1213
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:43,515
blockfronts, which is a package that

1214
00:57:43,532 --> 00:57:45,890
we're developing in order to facilitate

1215
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,690
cognitive agent modeling. And if you

1216
00:57:48,707 --> 00:57:51,785
look up Active blockfronts on GitHub

1217
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:54,250
you'll find the open source repository.

1218
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,905
What we've done with Active blockfronts

1219
00:57:57,965 --> 00:58:00,905
is implement active inference entities,

1220
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,905
the kind that you will see graphically

1221
00:58:03,965 --> 00:58:06,495
described in papers or the kind that

1222
00:58:06,497 --> 00:58:08,585
have been implemented in Python via

1223
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:11,975
PMDP. And we built upon

1224
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:15,485
PY MDP, as well as a complex systems

1225
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:19,335
modeling framework called Cadcat. And by

1226
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:22,940
integrating the active kernel

1227
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,760
of the entity action exteroception loop

1228
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,785
with the complex systems modeling

1229
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:31,310
framework, we hope to have engineering

1230
00:58:31,355 --> 00:58:34,445
grade approaches towards modeling

1231
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:38,250
complex cognitive ecosystems. So if you

1232
00:58:38,312 --> 00:58:41,055
are interested in Python or Julia or

1233
00:58:41,102 --> 00:58:43,355
other aspects that are computational

1234
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:46,155
related to active inference and you like

1235
00:58:46,202 --> 00:58:48,605
complexity and complex adaptive systems

1236
00:58:48,665 --> 00:58:51,585
and everything else that you might see

1237
00:58:51,617 --> 00:58:53,820
on this slide, active Lock Force

1238
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:56,130
Instance is an open source project. So

1239
00:58:56,252 --> 00:58:59,175
go ahead and fork it,

1240
00:58:59,312 --> 00:59:01,965
make your contributions and come get in

1241
00:59:01,982 --> 00:59:03,345
touch with us if you'd like to be a

1242
00:59:03,347 --> 00:59:07,425
little bit more in the loop and really

1243
00:59:07,562 --> 00:59:10,005
looking forward to seeing how this

1244
00:59:10,127 --> 00:59:15,312
project develops in the coming years in

1245
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:18,210
tools. Also, we've been having some

1246
00:59:18,242 --> 00:59:21,045
awesome discussions around robotics and

1247
00:59:21,122 --> 00:59:24,435
embodied cognitive entities. So we

1248
00:59:24,467 --> 00:59:27,915
have been characterizing kind of like a

1249
00:59:27,932 --> 00:59:30,320
literature review on different cognitive

1250
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:32,880
agent modeling frameworks. Active

1251
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:36,105
Coherence Lab is often proposed as a

1252
00:59:36,152 --> 00:59:39,135
unified cognitive entity model.

1253
00:59:39,317 --> 00:59:42,420
And so we've been just curating many

1254
00:59:42,497 --> 00:59:44,390
other cognitive agent modeling

1255
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:47,430
frameworks from the past and present and

1256
00:59:47,477 --> 00:59:49,785
then assessing them in terms of their

1257
00:59:49,817 --> 00:59:52,110
language, what cognitive features they

1258
00:59:52,142 --> 00:59:53,790
implement, whether they deal with

1259
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:55,940
embodiment, what is their mathematical

1260
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:59,450
underpinnings, and so on. And meanwhile

1261
00:59:59,525 --> 01:00:01,355
characterizing some of those cognitive

1262
01:00:01,415 --> 01:00:03,950
features and elements like anticipation,

1263
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,410
memory, counterfactuals, abductive

1264
01:00:06,455 --> 01:00:09,095
reasoning, different kinds of cognitive

1265
01:00:09,185 --> 01:00:11,910
features or motifs, and then trying to

1266
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,725
understand how do these different

1267
01:00:13,787 --> 01:00:17,520
cognitive model frameworks line up on

1268
01:00:17,522 --> 01:00:19,305
the rubric of wanting to have

1269
01:00:19,427 --> 01:00:21,960
expressivity across all of these

1270
01:00:21,992 --> 01:00:23,640
different cognitive features and to

1271
01:00:23,657 --> 01:00:26,310
integrate them. And that's a little bit

1272
01:00:26,342 --> 01:00:30,325
more on the symbolic cognitive.

1273
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:33,660
We've also been thinking a little bit

1274
01:00:33,692 --> 01:00:36,710
about the embodied, whether the embodied

1275
01:00:36,755 --> 01:00:40,205
and spatial and bodily or the embodied

1276
01:00:40,265 --> 01:00:43,287
and robotics. So here is

1277
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:48,435
a screenshot from the

1278
01:00:48,617 --> 01:00:50,985
work of JF. Claudia, who's been an

1279
01:00:51,017 --> 01:00:53,025
awesome participant in this past

1280
01:00:53,162 --> 01:00:57,400
quarter, and some active robots

1281
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:00,960
that are Karl and Andy. I think people

1282
01:01:00,992 --> 01:01:02,540
can probably guess what their last names

1283
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:06,690
are and there

1284
01:01:06,707 --> 01:01:08,535
isn't too much more to add here other

1285
01:01:08,567 --> 01:01:12,000
than check out this woefully under

1286
01:01:12,062 --> 01:01:15,015
acknowledged channel and work. And if

1287
01:01:15,032 --> 01:01:17,990
you're interested in any of these areas

1288
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:21,960
like related to cognitive modeling and

1289
01:01:21,992 --> 01:01:25,460
robotics and embodied cognitive systems,

1290
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:27,660
those are the kinds of things that will

1291
01:01:27,692 --> 01:01:29,937
be awesome to scaffold in the lab.

1292
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:34,995
Okay, and to our

1293
01:01:35,147 --> 01:01:39,020
final of the eleven projects active

1294
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:42,525
Metamodelling so ActInf Lab

1295
01:01:42,587 --> 01:01:45,585
metamodelling aka Alma. So there's and

1296
01:01:45,617 --> 01:01:47,715
A, and an L, and there's an M and

1297
01:01:47,732 --> 01:01:49,485
there's an A, and I think that was

1298
01:01:49,592 --> 01:01:51,990
Jessica's suggestion because Alma has

1299
01:01:52,007 --> 01:01:55,020
nice connotations as well. This project

1300
01:01:55,097 --> 01:01:57,800
is using meta modeling tools like Coda

1301
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:00,500
to provide the capacity for lab scale

1302
01:02:00,575 --> 01:02:02,535
generative model modeling updates and

1303
01:02:02,567 --> 01:02:04,860
reconfiguring. So the ability for the

1304
01:02:04,892 --> 01:02:08,385
lab to reflect and to modify itself and

1305
01:02:08,417 --> 01:02:12,360
its niche in order to design the kind

1306
01:02:12,392 --> 01:02:15,110
of participatory niche that facilitates

1307
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,850
successful policy selection by lab

1308
01:02:17,912 --> 01:02:20,535
members. Like what does the lab need to

1309
01:02:20,567 --> 01:02:23,135
provide the individual as the action

1310
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,540
state of the lab, sense state of the

1311
01:02:24,557 --> 01:02:27,065
individual in terms of the communication

1312
01:02:27,245 --> 01:02:31,685
such that that participant is chill

1313
01:02:31,805 --> 01:02:33,615
but also making the right decisions that

1314
01:02:33,632 --> 01:02:36,960
are productive. And we're using

1315
01:02:37,067 --> 01:02:39,015
primarily Coda. That's why the font is

1316
01:02:39,032 --> 01:02:42,230
bigger here. But we're also implementing

1317
01:02:42,365 --> 01:02:44,885
the active entity ontology for science

1318
01:02:45,005 --> 01:02:47,300
that we discussed on the research slide

1319
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:49,835
and active block prints just two slides

1320
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,565
ago as a more formal way to get at

1321
01:02:53,582 --> 01:02:56,385
some of these meta modeling. And this is

1322
01:02:56,417 --> 01:02:59,250
a figure from our 2020 paper,

1323
01:02:59,387 --> 01:03:01,940
that first early paper on systems

1324
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:03,960
engineering and active inference and

1325
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:07,065
remote teams, where we also looked at

1326
01:03:07,157 --> 01:03:09,785
the informational niche, the shared

1327
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:11,790
informational niche of the team. This is

1328
01:03:11,807 --> 01:03:13,485
their shared folder, their shared code,

1329
01:03:13,517 --> 01:03:15,470
a document, their formal documents,

1330
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,215
their drive, the chat threads. That's

1331
01:03:18,245 --> 01:03:21,080
the shared epistemic niche where actions

1332
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:24,065
to modify the niche by one participant

1333
01:03:24,245 --> 01:03:27,440
can then be like stigmaji modifying

1334
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,865
the environment so that themselves later

1335
01:03:29,957 --> 01:03:33,090
or other participants then or in the

1336
01:03:33,107 --> 01:03:36,125
future take different action selection

1337
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:38,885
as mediated by the way that that sensory

1338
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:41,735
state updates their generative models.

1339
01:03:41,855 --> 01:03:44,870
And then we have narrative. And so we've

1340
01:03:44,885 --> 01:03:47,325
been very interested for a long time in

1341
01:03:47,387 --> 01:03:49,860
rhetorical and narrative approaches to

1342
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:53,160
cognition. And so now we're just

1343
01:03:53,192 --> 01:03:54,540
beginning to see how some of these

1344
01:03:54,557 --> 01:03:56,490
approaches can come into play in the

1345
01:03:56,507 --> 01:03:58,740
context active coherence lab and in the

1346
01:03:58,757 --> 01:04:02,400
lab. So that's like the meta on

1347
01:04:02,537 --> 01:04:05,937
active lab. And this is also an awesome

1348
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,675
project set of affordance if you like

1349
01:04:09,737 --> 01:04:12,515
Coda, if you liked Douglas Hofstadter's,

1350
01:04:12,545 --> 01:04:16,310
Gerdle Escherbock, if you like act infer

1351
01:04:16,355 --> 01:04:18,450
Serve. All of these would be great

1352
01:04:18,512 --> 01:04:20,235
diagnostic cues that perhaps you would

1353
01:04:20,267 --> 01:04:22,525
like ActInf lab metamodelly.

1354
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:27,275
Yes, Steven. Yeah, thanks for sharing.

1355
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:29,685
I was wondering how this also might even

1356
01:04:29,717 --> 01:04:32,810
be able to tie in in the future to micro

1357
01:04:32,855 --> 01:04:36,585
phenomenological kind of modeling, that

1358
01:04:36,617 --> 01:04:38,810
kind of approach. So we've got the meta,

1359
01:04:38,855 --> 01:04:41,112
the narrative, the story,

1360
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:45,312
and hopefully maybe some sort of

1361
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,065
microphone biological approaches as

1362
01:04:49,082 --> 01:04:51,390
well. But I think we dot two walk, but

1363
01:04:51,407 --> 01:04:54,165
we'll get there. So thanks. When you

1364
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,280
said microphone logical, I thought, oh,

1365
01:04:56,327 --> 01:04:59,337
like the experiences of children. Yeah.

1366
01:05:01,425 --> 01:05:05,760
Cool. So that is it for the project

1367
01:05:05,942 --> 01:05:10,750
updates. They're all ongoing.

1368
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:15,135
Let's just kind of go over some next

1369
01:05:15,242 --> 01:05:18,850
steps at the lab scale.

1370
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:21,435
Several areas that were especially

1371
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,710
looking for assistance or contributions

1372
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:28,362
on would be on the legal side.

1373
01:05:29,475 --> 01:05:31,590
For example, potentially connecting with

1374
01:05:31,607 --> 01:05:33,675
a firm that would be interested in

1375
01:05:33,737 --> 01:05:37,155
providing pro bono assistance who has

1376
01:05:37,202 --> 01:05:40,445
experience with education, nonprofits,

1377
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:44,200
intellectual property tech, etc.

1378
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:48,090
And also helping our lab navigate a

1379
01:05:48,107 --> 01:05:50,350
course towards financial sustainability,

1380
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,410
whether through grants or other

1381
01:05:52,442 --> 01:05:54,750
mechanisms, but just finding a way that

1382
01:05:54,812 --> 01:05:57,915
we can reward and stabilize the

1383
01:05:57,932 --> 01:06:00,900
contributions of participants. And then

1384
01:06:00,962 --> 01:06:04,560
at the project scale, any and

1385
01:06:04,592 --> 01:06:07,590
all participants who want to be in the

1386
01:06:07,607 --> 01:06:09,800
strange loop, in the strange attractor

1387
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:11,820
want to be on the path towards

1388
01:06:11,897 --> 01:06:14,085
contributing active inference lab. Lab

1389
01:06:14,192 --> 01:06:16,665
as they also grow and develop as an

1390
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:19,935
active inference and as a person. So if

1391
01:06:19,967 --> 01:06:23,100
any of these projects or some other

1392
01:06:23,162 --> 01:06:25,350
opportunity that you see and want to

1393
01:06:25,412 --> 01:06:29,370
take the initiative on any of these

1394
01:06:29,447 --> 01:06:31,920
reflect affordances for you. So

1395
01:06:31,997 --> 01:06:34,200
hopefully if you're listening this far

1396
01:06:34,262 --> 01:06:38,000
in a minute and 6 hours in or wherever

1397
01:06:38,075 --> 01:06:41,175
it's clipped out in a podcast, then just

1398
01:06:41,237 --> 01:06:44,390
recognize that these are all reflecting

1399
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:46,600
the past contributions of participants

1400
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:50,265
like yourself. And this is just an

1401
01:06:50,282 --> 01:06:52,005
opening. It's only the first quarter of

1402
01:06:52,052 --> 01:06:55,335
2022. We're just beginning and

1403
01:06:55,367 --> 01:06:58,920
so there's so much in the field and in

1404
01:06:58,922 --> 01:07:02,085
the lab to be done that there will

1405
01:07:02,117 --> 01:07:04,800
be something to do that's meaningful and

1406
01:07:04,862 --> 01:07:07,205
chill and aligned with your preferences

1407
01:07:07,265 --> 01:07:10,020
and expectations and availability. Just

1408
01:07:10,172 --> 01:07:13,440
belief it okay.

1409
01:07:13,607 --> 01:07:17,295
So that takes us close to the end and a

1410
01:07:17,297 --> 01:07:20,330
little modification of our common ending

1411
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:23,760
slide. Where do we

1412
01:07:23,867 --> 01:07:26,130
go from here? What are people still

1413
01:07:26,252 --> 01:07:29,835
curious about learning and applying and

1414
01:07:29,942 --> 01:07:31,580
what are we going to do differently

1415
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:34,000
maybe in the next quarter?

1416
01:07:40,725 --> 01:07:43,740
Yes. Bleu. So I think I already put it

1417
01:07:43,757 --> 01:07:45,920
out there at the beginning, but I'm

1418
01:07:45,935 --> 01:07:48,900
really like interested in not talking

1419
01:07:48,962 --> 01:07:50,955
about things anymore, spending less time

1420
01:07:51,002 --> 01:07:53,385
talking about things and more time

1421
01:07:53,417 --> 01:07:55,065
actually doing things. So that's what

1422
01:07:55,082 --> 01:07:56,265
I'm going to do differently in the next

1423
01:07:56,282 --> 01:07:58,785
quarter and that's me on a personal

1424
01:07:58,967 --> 01:08:01,290
scale has nothing to do really with the

1425
01:08:01,307 --> 01:08:04,485
lab, but I just want to just work now.

1426
01:08:04,667 --> 01:08:06,170
I just want to put my head in the books

1427
01:08:06,185 --> 01:08:08,790
and get to it. Awesome. Yeah.

1428
01:08:08,882 --> 01:08:12,555
Sometimes it

1429
01:08:12,602 --> 01:08:14,490
helps to get caught up through

1430
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:17,370
conversation and just being in the

1431
01:08:17,372 --> 01:08:20,835
synchronous meetings, but 1 hour per

1432
01:08:20,867 --> 01:08:24,837
week is not how we build

1433
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,090
a course or not how we go through a

1434
01:08:27,107 --> 01:08:29,985
textbook. And so that is a very

1435
01:08:30,017 --> 01:08:32,187
important balance to keep in mind.

1436
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:36,325
Esteves or Dave, any other thoughts?

1437
01:08:46,912 --> 01:08:50,797
Yes or no? There's a lot

1438
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:53,392
of good work going on. I'd say just keep

1439
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:56,692
doing it and talk about

1440
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:58,642
talk about what's working well, what

1441
01:08:58,690 --> 01:09:00,292
needs to be improved with the

1442
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:03,067
bottlenecks are mentioned. Some

1443
01:09:03,115 --> 01:09:06,800
bottlenecks sometimes

1444
01:09:07,462 --> 01:09:10,492
maybe some of the fun projects that

1445
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,832
could be pushed back in favor of some of

1446
01:09:12,835 --> 01:09:14,900
the more difficult things that actually

1447
01:09:15,862 --> 01:09:17,922
will end up being leveraged heavily.

1448
01:09:17,967 --> 01:09:19,562
The ontology.

1449
01:09:21,637 --> 01:09:24,097
It may not be fun to slog through this

1450
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:26,017
stuff, but it's going to really pay off

1451
01:09:26,065 --> 01:09:29,987
and get some transitive closure

1452
01:09:30,487 --> 01:09:32,075
aspects of it.

1453
01:09:33,862 --> 01:09:36,847
Awesome. For those who are studying or

1454
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,767
curious about active inference but feel

1455
01:09:38,815 --> 01:09:41,377
kind of like on their own, whether no

1456
01:09:41,395 --> 01:09:43,797
one else in their local niche or network

1457
01:09:43,842 --> 01:09:46,972
or lab or university or organization is

1458
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,957
working, active inference lab, that's

1459
01:09:48,972 --> 01:09:51,472
like one of the most powerful things is

1460
01:09:51,505 --> 01:09:53,407
just knowing. Like if you have an idea

1461
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,647
that you're not even going to pursue,

1462
01:09:55,842 --> 01:09:57,952
but just somebody should do this or it

1463
01:09:57,970 --> 01:10:00,232
would be cool if this existed, having a

1464
01:10:00,235 --> 01:10:02,947
space where you can add that pebble and

1465
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:05,227
maybe down the road or maybe sooner than

1466
01:10:05,245 --> 01:10:07,927
you expect, somebody else seeing that

1467
01:10:07,945 --> 01:10:11,407
pebble is stimulated to act. And so

1468
01:10:11,485 --> 01:10:13,657
that's what can happen when we have

1469
01:10:13,735 --> 01:10:16,222
shared ways of working and that's just

1470
01:10:16,255 --> 01:10:18,662
what we're beginning to see. Stephen

1471
01:10:19,837 --> 01:10:22,250
yeah, sort of bouncing off that as well.

1472
01:10:22,762 --> 01:10:24,427
I keep thinking about stages of

1473
01:10:24,445 --> 01:10:27,627
readiness, which I'm

1474
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:29,452
normally working with community

1475
01:10:29,545 --> 01:10:31,775
participants who are marginalized, but

1476
01:10:32,137 --> 01:10:34,447
I've had that myself feeling a bit

1477
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,182
marginalized feeling, am I ready? And it

1478
01:10:38,185 --> 01:10:41,377
was like a little jump, but it can be a

1479
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:45,022
chasm trying to get to that stage and

1480
01:10:45,055 --> 01:10:46,642
I think that can be for a lot of people

1481
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,487
you don't quite know on different

1482
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:51,697
things, whether you're near that

1483
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:54,112
threshold or not. And you're often a lot

1484
01:10:54,175 --> 01:10:57,352
closer to being ready and you maybe just

1485
01:10:57,370 --> 01:10:59,377
need someone to give you a kick up the

1486
01:10:59,395 --> 01:11:02,302
bum and say, just go for it.

1487
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:04,297
But having said that, that's when you

1488
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:08,167
appreciate the quality of getting

1489
01:11:08,215 --> 01:11:09,802
some things under your belt on the way

1490
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:12,402
to the line. So I think, like Bleu

1491
01:11:12,432 --> 01:11:15,142
Sajid, it's time to act. And for me

1492
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:18,717
personally, yes, the stage of readiness

1493
01:11:18,777 --> 01:11:21,427
I'm at is very different to where I was

1494
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:24,967
a year ago, for sure, both in

1495
01:11:25,015 --> 01:11:26,752
my knowledge when I look back to where I

1496
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:30,297
was, but also in my heart. And that's

1497
01:11:30,342 --> 01:11:32,677
not an insignificant piece of the

1498
01:11:32,695 --> 01:11:36,247
equation. So, thanks. Awesome.

1499
01:11:36,355 --> 01:11:38,887
I'll just wait one more minute if anyone

1500
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:41,062
who's watching live has any questions

1501
01:11:41,125 --> 01:11:43,527
that they would like to see addressed,

1502
01:11:43,707 --> 01:11:47,367
but totally agree, it's a multi

1503
01:11:47,427 --> 01:11:50,002
year journey. I mean, we're all on a

1504
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,222
lifelong journey of some sort, but

1505
01:11:52,255 --> 01:11:54,072
hopefully even active inference lab

1506
01:11:54,117 --> 01:11:57,547
journey is multi year. And so being

1507
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:00,732
able to connect our policy selection,

1508
01:12:00,822 --> 01:12:03,650
our behavior decisions in the next

1509
01:12:04,012 --> 01:12:06,847
microsocade of the eyes, the next place

1510
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,812
your eye is going to look, the next

1511
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:10,537
action you're going to take in terms of

1512
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,102
opening up. A hyperlink or reaching for

1513
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,772
a book or a pencil, but being able to

1514
01:12:15,805 --> 01:12:19,597
connect those very rapid actions with

1515
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:22,927
a bigger picture and with a longer

1516
01:12:23,095 --> 01:12:26,547
temporal time scale and acting amidst

1517
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,407
uncertainty. That's what active

1518
01:12:28,422 --> 01:12:31,777
coherence is about one aspect of it.

1519
01:12:31,795 --> 01:12:35,332
And so if anything that you've heard

1520
01:12:35,485 --> 01:12:38,332
resonates just hopefully see this

1521
01:12:38,485 --> 01:12:42,172
roundtable presentation as like an

1522
01:12:42,205 --> 01:12:46,087
invitation less than a stand

1523
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:49,882
and deliver because there's so much

1524
01:12:50,035 --> 01:12:53,075
openness in the area and in the lab and

1525
01:12:53,587 --> 01:12:56,107
it maybe can feel like one is starting

1526
01:12:56,185 --> 01:12:59,982
late. But that's just human knowledge

1527
01:13:00,072 --> 01:13:02,277
development. It's a treadmill that's

1528
01:13:02,307 --> 01:13:05,392
been going and through coming together

1529
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,302
in the lab we can actually leverage each

1530
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:11,317
other's contributions and catch up on

1531
01:13:11,365 --> 01:13:13,222
Fields that have thousands of hours of

1532
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:16,837
reading and hopefully get somewhere cool

1533
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,350
together. So,

1534
01:13:20,137 --> 01:13:22,872
Dave, Bleu, Esteves and Yvonne and Alex

1535
01:13:22,917 --> 01:13:26,212
from earlier and all the other lab

1536
01:13:26,275 --> 01:13:29,122
participants, big thanks for this

1537
01:13:29,305 --> 01:13:33,777
amazing quarter and it's

1538
01:13:33,807 --> 01:13:38,347
been a fast one and on

1539
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,825
to the next one. Okay,

1540
01:13:42,937 --> 01:13:46,342
bye. Thanks all.

1541
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:46,650
Have fun.
