1
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,615
Welcome, everyone. This is the Active

2
00:00:29,645 --> 00:00:32,075
Inference Institute quarterly roundtable

3
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,870
number three in 2022. It is September

4
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,337
28, 2022.

5
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:41,240
Welcome to the active inference

6
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,340
institute. The Active Inference

7
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,435
Institute is dedicated to learning,

8
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:47,345
researching, and applying active

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,320
inference. You can find us at some of

10
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:52,335
the links here on this slide. This is

11
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:54,855
recorded in an archived Livestream, so

12
00:00:54,902 --> 00:00:56,520
please provide us with feedback so we

13
00:00:56,522 --> 00:00:59,280
can be improving our work. All

14
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:01,035
backgrounds and perspectives are

15
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:03,030
welcome, and we'll be following video

16
00:01:03,077 --> 00:01:07,170
etiquette for live streams today

17
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:09,105
in the quarterly Livestream number

18
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,545
three, we are going to have three broad

19
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:14,985
action. They won't be too long. There

20
00:01:15,017 --> 00:01:17,220
will be a lot of time. If you want to

21
00:01:17,297 --> 00:01:19,845
add any other notes in the live chat or

22
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:23,790
maybe even if anybody wants to say hi

23
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:26,960
in live chaos and join the Livestream

24
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:29,235
itself. We're going to first have

25
00:01:29,342 --> 00:01:31,590
institute scale updates. We'll talk

26
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:34,140
about some changes in development at the

27
00:01:34,157 --> 00:01:37,212
institute level. We'll then talk about

28
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:40,335
projects and the education and research

29
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:42,480
endeavors that we've been involved in

30
00:01:42,527 --> 00:01:44,835
and that have been developing over this

31
00:01:44,867 --> 00:01:47,325
quarter. And then we'll close with some

32
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:49,305
next steps and affordances for getting

33
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:52,665
involved. Let's go first to

34
00:01:52,757 --> 00:01:55,985
the Active Coherence Institute AII

35
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:59,745
updates at the institute scale. All

36
00:01:59,747 --> 00:02:02,330
right, I'll just give some overview,

37
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,290
and then Alex or Yvonne, feel free to

38
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:07,305
add more. We're continuing to work with

39
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:11,310
Fried Frank in a pro bono capacity to

40
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:14,735
help with the legal side of formalizing

41
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,425
our incorporation as a nonprofit.

42
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,405
We are formalized in terms of what

43
00:02:21,452 --> 00:02:23,435
members we have, our five founding

44
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,535
members, and some of our governance

45
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,365
structures. Currently, we are on the

46
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:32,310
stage of selecting and electing the

47
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:34,755
Board of directors. So at this point,

48
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:37,770
at the end of September 2022, we are

49
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:40,380
extremely active seeking self

50
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,620
nominations, as well as suggestions for

51
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,765
people who might like to serve in the

52
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:48,540
Board of directors, especially with

53
00:02:48,632 --> 00:02:51,810
expertise or experience serving on board

54
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:55,535
of directors for nonprofits,

55
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,810
and any other relevant experience

56
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:00,725
related to governance, financial,

57
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,312
nonprofit education, and research.

58
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:06,885
Following the selection of the Board of

59
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:09,735
Directors, the board will then select

60
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:13,395
officers who are in more of a direct

61
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:16,215
operations role at the institute. And

62
00:03:16,232 --> 00:03:18,410
we've also joined the Delaware Alliance

63
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:21,750
for Nonprofit Advancement Dana to

64
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:24,230
provide us with access to nonprofit

65
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,815
resources and support. Alex or Yvonne,

66
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:30,400
want to give any comments?

67
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,860
If you're talking, Alex, you're muted,

68
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:44,350
but I see yellow.

69
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:50,187
Okay,

70
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:54,462
carrying forward,

71
00:03:57,225 --> 00:04:00,045
we are continuing to develop our

72
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:03,450
institute branding. First, we are

73
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:07,245
working with some external expertise on

74
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:10,440
some logo and brand redesigns for the

75
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:13,155
institute. This is really exciting, and

76
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:15,450
more will be announced when the work

77
00:04:15,512 --> 00:04:19,215
here is ready to be shown. So enjoy the

78
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:21,570
black, white, and red and the current

79
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:23,685
fonts and layouts that we have while you

80
00:04:23,717 --> 00:04:26,315
can. They'll still be there. They'll

81
00:04:26,345 --> 00:04:29,705
still be around. And we've also updated

82
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:32,820
our website with a restructured short

83
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,765
description of the institute, which I'll

84
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:37,490
just read now and then. Alex Ravon,

85
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,630
please make any extra comment or provide

86
00:04:39,677 --> 00:04:42,410
any context. The Active Inference

87
00:04:42,455 --> 00:04:44,460
Institute is dedicated to learning,

88
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:46,265
researching, and applying active

89
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:48,750
inference. We provide avenues for

90
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:50,885
connection and integration with broad

91
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,415
audiences and disciplines. Active

92
00:04:53,432 --> 00:04:55,365
Inference Lab Institute provides a

93
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:57,765
setting for people to aid each other in

94
00:04:57,782 --> 00:05:00,135
pursuit of a better understanding of

95
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,585
active inference. The Institute

96
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,710
organizes education, research and

97
00:05:04,742 --> 00:05:07,355
communication to advance the progress

98
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:09,005
and public awareness of frontier

99
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:10,635
knowledge in active inference and

100
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:13,440
closely related topics. Restructure our

101
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:15,315
strategy with the building blocks of

102
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:17,275
participatory, open science,

103
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,440
accessibility and service to our

104
00:05:19,457 --> 00:05:20,637
epistemic community.

105
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:32,475
Yes, Yvonne. Yes. Sure.

106
00:05:34,187 --> 00:05:37,875
As and institution, we are educated to

107
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:43,762
having understanding in broad

108
00:05:43,837 --> 00:05:46,577
audience about active inference, what is

109
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:50,852
it, how we

110
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,497
can use it, and as

111
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,512
we know that active coherence is

112
00:05:57,575 --> 00:06:01,432
applicable for a lot of field

113
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:04,967
and domain, we are

114
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:11,522
open to the community from all

115
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:14,412
of those Fields and domain.

116
00:06:15,962 --> 00:06:19,592
Thanks. Yeah agreed that one of the best

117
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,962
ways for a connection to be made between

118
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:24,675
active coherence and some other field is

119
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:27,677
kind of the micro agreement. When people

120
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,527
from that field get involved and get

121
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:33,052
involved in learning, and then they'll

122
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:35,527
see all these affordances for connecting

123
00:06:35,557 --> 00:06:37,397
active coherence theoretically and in

124
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,022
practice to their area. It's not like

125
00:06:40,055 --> 00:06:42,172
there's just a tree and the connections

126
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:45,632
are ready to be pulled at first site.

127
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,232
It takes a little integration and

128
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,527
including different communities in the

129
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:54,167
conversation. So that's what we're happy

130
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:57,002
to be building and working on and also

131
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,352
in a participatory way where people's

132
00:07:00,382 --> 00:07:03,472
feedback is really welcome and people's

133
00:07:03,517 --> 00:07:06,847
engagement is essential. So we'll

134
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:08,897
continue with a few more notes on the

135
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,372
institute scale, and then we'll talk

136
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:13,112
more about projects that are happening

137
00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:15,092
at the institute, all of which people

138
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,250
can get involved in if they would like.

139
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:21,932
So, just a structural note. As a

140
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:25,742
summary, the focus and functions of our

141
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,025
institute are research, education,

142
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:32,187
outreach, and engagement and methods.

143
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:36,122
And these Foci are playing out across

144
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,097
multiple scales. There's the participant

145
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:41,147
scale, which is the human and their

146
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,807
engagement with the institute. There's

147
00:07:43,822 --> 00:07:46,712
the institute scale, which is the system

148
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:49,267
of interest that we're able to enact

149
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:52,412
policy in at the institute level. And

150
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:54,542
there's our broader epistemic community,

151
00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:57,722
which includes the really exciting and

152
00:07:57,755 --> 00:08:00,677
growing active inference community and

153
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:02,762
all the amazing developments happening

154
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:05,887
in that area, as well as more broadly

155
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:09,322
and more distantly.

156
00:08:09,517 --> 00:08:11,147
Many Adjacencies that have been

157
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,267
identified or have not been identified,

158
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:16,342
ranging from neuroscience and medicine

159
00:08:16,477 --> 00:08:18,907
to machine learning, computer science,

160
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:22,277
ecology, robotics, all these amazing

161
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,312
areas we have discussions around. And we

162
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,687
have two organizational units that are

163
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,357
kind of like departments. They are

164
00:08:32,435 --> 00:08:34,922
organizational constructions that help

165
00:08:34,955 --> 00:08:38,302
us coordinate projects

166
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:41,032
and efforts and allocate attention

167
00:08:41,197 --> 00:08:44,572
around our two primary missions in Foci,

168
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:47,042
which are research and education. So

169
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,522
Edge you active is the organizational

170
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:52,867
unit that hosts education projects,

171
00:08:53,002 --> 00:08:56,102
whereas the research unit hosts research

172
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:59,527
projects. And we joked

173
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:02,102
about having a kind of competition or an

174
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,047
opening of window for renaming. But as

175
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,737
anyone who has watched these roundtables

176
00:09:08,887 --> 00:09:12,227
know we show up on the day of with what

177
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:15,922
we know that day. So your engagement

178
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:17,912
or suggestions and ideas are always

179
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,047
welcome and that's how we update,

180
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,397
that's how we learn. But that's just

181
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,217
reflecting some of our structural

182
00:09:24,352 --> 00:09:26,822
learning and updating that's the

183
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:28,772
institute level. Anything else to add

184
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:31,397
here? Alex Ravon or we'll continue on to

185
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,637
the project scale.

186
00:09:34,862 --> 00:09:37,232
All right, let's talk first about

187
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:40,292
education. This is going to be education

188
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:42,647
at the active inference institute and

189
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,575
project updates over Q three 2022.

190
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:49,972
First, the active inference textbook

191
00:09:50,017 --> 00:09:52,817
group. So we've been having two

192
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:54,802
concurrent cohorts of the active

193
00:09:54,832 --> 00:09:57,017
inference textbook group. The first

194
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:59,777
cohort of the textbook group began in

195
00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:03,092
May 2022 and over the following three

196
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,417
months they completed the first five

197
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:08,117
chapters of the textbook. And now that

198
00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:10,942
first Conor, the intrepid adventurers,

199
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:14,072
the early foragers, are continuing on in

200
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:16,337
chapter six through ten, which is where

201
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,737
the textbook turns towards model

202
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,342
building and recipes for model

203
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,992
construction, which has been really

204
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,967
exciting. And we also in September 2022

205
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,627
began the second cohort of the active

206
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:30,872
inference textbook group. So this is

207
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,032
some people who are rejoining from the

208
00:10:33,035 --> 00:10:35,372
first cohort as well as many, many new

209
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:38,702
people joining in. And it's another

210
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,627
concurrence cohort that's starting from

211
00:10:41,645 --> 00:10:44,042
the beginning of the book. So this is

212
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,997
the kind of minimal templating of a

213
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,187
continuous delivery textbook group

214
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,757
format where as more and more people

215
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,292
are interested and curious to learn

216
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,022
about active inference and increase

217
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:59,987
their familiarity and competency in

218
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,057
engaging and positive social

219
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:05,342
environments. We will be able to have

220
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,717
the familiarity of people who have

221
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:11,902
taken the Conor experience of a textbook

222
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:13,997
group before to then return, for

223
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,217
example, as facilitators or in other

224
00:11:16,265 --> 00:11:18,572
roles, and therefore scale the

225
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:20,612
continuous delivery of textbook group

226
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:23,702
experiences around the Par Pazulo Karl

227
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,912
Friston 2022 textbook, but also around

228
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:29,337
other texts that may be arising.

229
00:11:30,662 --> 00:11:33,877
As we work as a group, we're in a shared

230
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:36,242
epistemic niche and we provide a whole

231
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,872
host of valueadded services that deeply

232
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:40,897
enrich your learning. So if you're

233
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:45,017
currently spending one or more hours per

234
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:47,752
week or month curious about active

235
00:11:47,782 --> 00:11:49,847
inference, especially curious about this

236
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,127
textbook, your learning and your

237
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,347
contributions will be leveraged if you

238
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,742
join a textbook group cohort we curate

239
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:00,602
and we compile and address questions

240
00:12:00,695 --> 00:12:02,912
that we're having relating to different

241
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:06,472
parts of the textbook. And we've created

242
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,882
just an amazing repository of questions

243
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,337
that grows every day and they contain

244
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:15,017
questions that are confirmatory and

245
00:12:15,065 --> 00:12:17,387
basic, what does this word mean here?

246
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,802
Or what do you think this means? All the

247
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,652
way on up to speculative and research

248
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:24,622
oriented or application oriented

249
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,207
questions. So questions, questions,

250
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,367
questions are really important part of

251
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,837
learning and they're really important

252
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,912
part of the textbook group. And also

253
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:34,967
through being in the textbook group,

254
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,942
one becomes more familiar with a variety

255
00:12:38,002 --> 00:12:40,442
of biology scaffolded learning

256
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,277
approaches that we use in the active

257
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:45,182
inference institute related to our work

258
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,527
from the very beginning with the active

259
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:49,712
inference ontology. So, for example,

260
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:52,202
here's equation two five with the

261
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,502
variational free energy. And here we

262
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,302
have just a screenshot of what the

263
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,677
annotation looks like in the

264
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:02,902
shared knowledge resource in the Coda

265
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:04,397
for those who are learning and

266
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,152
discussing equation two five. And

267
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,217
there's a whole host of other

268
00:13:07,265 --> 00:13:08,972
information questions that people are

269
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:11,402
having and what does this mean and what

270
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,442
are the relations to other areas? But

271
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,262
this kind of a learning environment

272
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:17,042
allows people who have different

273
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,222
backgrounds in math or the formalisms or

274
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,697
in some of these other theoretical

275
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:23,597
domains that come into play in

276
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,637
relationship with active inference to

277
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,777
have a really exciting space where we're

278
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,937
all learning a ton. So it's been awesome

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,427
to have two coherent cohorts going in

280
00:13:34,445 --> 00:13:36,617
the textbook group. And we're looking

281
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:40,427
forward to in the close of 2022,

282
00:13:40,595 --> 00:13:43,622
to have the first cohort complete the

283
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:46,772
book and then have a second cohort get

284
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:48,632
up to the midpoint. And then in the

285
00:13:48,635 --> 00:13:52,027
beginning of 2023, we will likely

286
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,397
continue with the second cohort,

287
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:57,227
chapter six through ten, and begin a

288
00:13:57,245 --> 00:13:59,177
third cohort and see where things are

289
00:13:59,195 --> 00:14:01,200
ant in the active inference world then.

290
00:14:02,612 --> 00:14:06,067
Any comments or thoughts on the textbook

291
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:09,375
group? Yeah, sure.

292
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:13,962
Textbook group is very valuable

293
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:20,342
tradition for education, and when

294
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,692
you learn something and you get feedback

295
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:26,447
from your peers, you have more

296
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,022
understanding. And in our groups,

297
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:32,962
we are providing a lot of useful

298
00:14:33,112 --> 00:14:36,782
instruments that help to understand

299
00:14:36,935 --> 00:14:40,157
not so clear theory as

300
00:14:40,235 --> 00:14:41,637
active inference.

301
00:14:43,412 --> 00:14:47,002
Awesome. And one kind of note or seed

302
00:14:47,032 --> 00:14:49,517
for the future is the textbook is open

303
00:14:49,565 --> 00:14:51,322
source, which is awesome. It increases

304
00:14:51,367 --> 00:14:53,637
the accessibility and downloadability,

305
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:57,277
but it also offers some incredible

306
00:14:57,382 --> 00:14:59,897
future opportunities in terms of

307
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,372
remixing the book, transposing Axel

308
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:05,527
constant into GitHub, rerendering

309
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:07,637
translating, doing some amazing

310
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,397
secondary work with a textbook, and

311
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,377
again, seeing that as templating for

312
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:15,002
future versions or other textbooks. So

313
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,477
that's a textbook group on where's we

314
00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:21,317
go. Once again, the main

315
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:25,877
goal of this activity is to help

316
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:30,617
understand our main idea. And we

317
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,787
plan to do this activity on a regular

318
00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:36,977
basis, and you can join us wherever you

319
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:40,052
want and wherever you are ready. Thank

320
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,832
you, Yvonne. Very true. All right,

321
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,977
in July 31,

322
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:49,897
2022, we had our second applied

323
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:53,262
active inference symposium on robotics.

324
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:56,312
There were two live streams of about 4

325
00:15:56,375 --> 00:16:00,442
hours each, and there were a handful

326
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:03,197
of co organizers from within the

327
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,877
institute. And from outside the

328
00:16:04,895 --> 00:16:08,192
institute. We had a whole range of

329
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,147
formats presentations, roundtables and

330
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,367
discussions. The two sessions are shown

331
00:16:15,427 --> 00:16:18,977
here, and when somebody else

332
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:21,002
is talking, make sure to post links in

333
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,522
the YouTube live chat so people can go

334
00:16:23,555 --> 00:16:25,292
check them out or they're available just

335
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,750
on our Livestream Costa page.

336
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:34,117
There were about nine presentations

337
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:37,457
of around 20 to 30 minutes each, people

338
00:16:37,535 --> 00:16:39,797
talking about specific applications of

339
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,472
active inference. So if you're wondering

340
00:16:42,592 --> 00:16:44,377
where is active inference being applied

341
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:46,447
or how can active inference be applied,

342
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:49,432
this symposium gives nine case studies

343
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:53,047
and settings from the robotics domain

344
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:55,297
where active inference is being applied

345
00:16:55,342 --> 00:16:57,977
today and tomorrow. And at the end of

346
00:16:57,995 --> 00:17:00,517
each session, we also had a round table

347
00:17:00,577 --> 00:17:03,727
discussion that was really interactive

348
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:07,432
and connected the dots and provided

349
00:17:07,447 --> 00:17:09,482
some context beyond the more research

350
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,222
oriented presentations that were

351
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:12,632
happening for the bulk of the

352
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:14,627
presentations. So for those who are

353
00:17:14,645 --> 00:17:16,477
interested in applications of active

354
00:17:16,507 --> 00:17:19,427
inference or in robotics, this was a

355
00:17:19,445 --> 00:17:22,142
really exciting event. And this is also,

356
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,402
we hope, a tradition to continue applied

357
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:28,622
active inference symposia where people

358
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:31,247
who want to co organize or present on

359
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,472
their applications in knowledge

360
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:37,172
management or in medicine or

361
00:17:37,205 --> 00:17:40,687
in ecology, we can convene

362
00:17:40,837 --> 00:17:43,397
and coordinate around the symposium and

363
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,727
have exafferent formats. So we're

364
00:17:45,757 --> 00:17:47,747
currently working to transcribe the

365
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,867
products of this symposium and make them

366
00:17:50,915 --> 00:17:52,512
citable proceedings.

367
00:17:54,212 --> 00:17:57,237
Any thoughts you have on this ethylus?

368
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:09,637
I think that robotics in terms

369
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,222
of applied field is one of

370
00:18:13,255 --> 00:18:15,622
the most straightforward application

371
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,262
active inference lab, and possibly

372
00:18:20,737 --> 00:18:24,875
in future providing real

373
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:29,722
breakthroughs in results of robots that

374
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:33,950
will be active inference lab work for

375
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:38,017
robotics, cognition and so on.

376
00:18:38,215 --> 00:18:41,392
And as we Sajid from web

377
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,267
communication, there are different

378
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,027
groups of researchers all over the

379
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:49,072
world. We are interested in

380
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:52,402
communication, we are interested in

381
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,082
presenting results, and hopefully

382
00:18:56,247 --> 00:19:00,027
more people next years will join

383
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:04,137
in with active inference robotics

384
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:08,107
movement and some dates. In some days in

385
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:12,712
the close future, we'll see really

386
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:16,692
great application and autonomous

387
00:19:16,752 --> 00:19:19,787
robots based on active inference.

388
00:19:20,812 --> 00:19:24,802
Awesome. Thank you. All right,

389
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:26,757
speaking of the active inference

390
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,842
journal, so the goal of the active

391
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:31,402
inference journal is to increase the

392
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,167
accessibility and the indexability,

393
00:19:34,302 --> 00:19:37,782
citability and utility of live streams

394
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:40,197
and various audio visual material

395
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:43,257
produced in and around the active

396
00:19:43,272 --> 00:19:46,857
inference institute. So currently we've

397
00:19:46,872 --> 00:19:49,850
been working on around four specific

398
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:54,127
streams and events to improve and

399
00:19:54,145 --> 00:19:56,202
template our process that we're hoping

400
00:19:56,232 --> 00:19:59,827
to build and scale on. Further, what we

401
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:01,972
do in the journal is we take the

402
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:03,942
outcomes of the Livestream, the audio

403
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:07,642
visuals of the Livestream, and we get a

404
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,912
primary artificial intelligence

405
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:13,812
Aigenerated transcript and then engage

406
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:16,782
in a sequence of enrichments, editing

407
00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:18,772
and curations. So we edit the

408
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:21,277
transcripts by listening carefully to

409
00:20:21,295 --> 00:20:23,287
the audio and making sure that the

410
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,572
speaker's sense is to the extent

411
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:28,012
possible, captured. And then we also

412
00:20:28,075 --> 00:20:30,847
develop, for example, appendices and

413
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,982
other scholarship around the document.

414
00:20:33,072 --> 00:20:35,077
So when somebody mentions a paper or

415
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:37,042
when somebody mentions a person, those

416
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,102
kinds of information can be included and

417
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,727
the discourse can be connected to the

418
00:20:42,745 --> 00:20:45,397
active inference ontology in cases where

419
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:49,732
the terms are being used. And again,

420
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,287
that will enable more accessible

421
00:20:52,362 --> 00:20:55,552
searching in the language of the

422
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,417
live stream. For example, people have

423
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,802
asked questions that somebody might want

424
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,767
to query again or might want to hear

425
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:05,032
someone's response at a given time too,

426
00:21:05,185 --> 00:21:07,492
and cite that or just learn from it.

427
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:09,397
And then also it's really important to

428
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,902
have such standardized pipelines for

429
00:21:11,995 --> 00:21:14,547
transcription in order to ensemble

430
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:17,237
translation into different languages.

431
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:20,377
Ways that you can get involved in a

432
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:22,467
journal if you're interested or curious.

433
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:25,032
In this area, whether you have editing

434
00:21:25,122 --> 00:21:27,650
or proofreading experience or not,

435
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,892
there are many affordances to edit

436
00:21:29,952 --> 00:21:32,152
transcripts. So listening carefully to

437
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,962
the audio and providing suggested edits

438
00:21:35,037 --> 00:21:37,777
on texts. And also we're especially

439
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,997
interested to research and develop

440
00:21:40,105 --> 00:21:42,425
methodologies for the journal process.

441
00:21:42,787 --> 00:21:46,422
So anyone familiar or curious about AI

442
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:48,812
assisted transcription in translation,

443
00:21:49,387 --> 00:21:51,522
modular implication, decentralized

444
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:54,802
science and DSI, the usage of Git as a

445
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,632
versioning system, any of these areas,

446
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:01,102
we would welcome your engagement in the

447
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,102
journal project because that's the

448
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,427
direction that we want to head. And that

449
00:22:06,445 --> 00:22:08,632
is what is going to unlock some of the

450
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:11,697
potential of the 200 plus live streams

451
00:22:11,742 --> 00:22:13,522
that we've already carried out and the

452
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:16,027
many hundreds that we'll carry out in

453
00:22:16,045 --> 00:22:19,087
the future. It will enable these past

454
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,522
and future live streams to be able to be

455
00:22:22,555 --> 00:22:25,342
searched, cited, translated, and used

456
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,702
more broadly. So, if you want to join

457
00:22:27,732 --> 00:22:29,752
the meetings for the journal project,

458
00:22:29,845 --> 00:22:33,097
they're on Mondays at 13 UTC in our

459
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,517
discord. So, a few next

460
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:38,767
steps I mentioned before, but I'll just

461
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:43,557
give a quick shout out to At Clopath,

462
00:22:43,722 --> 00:22:46,317
who recently for the Lex Friedman

463
00:22:46,377 --> 00:22:50,742
podcast spun up a site using the OpenAI

464
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,997
Whisper platform and made transcripts

465
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:57,907
for all Lex Friedman episodes. And so

466
00:22:57,985 --> 00:23:00,592
we imagined something similar, because

467
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:04,327
in our Coda for

468
00:23:04,345 --> 00:23:07,325
the live streams, we have 200 plus

469
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,337
journal discussions, research,

470
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,087
presentations, we are ready to be Open,

471
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,937
AI, Whispered or other pipelines.

472
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:19,722
So if that's something you're curious

473
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:22,552
about, or Karpathy or others, if you

474
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,402
want to come get involved, you're

475
00:23:24,432 --> 00:23:27,052
absolutely welcome. There's a lot of

476
00:23:27,145 --> 00:23:31,182
learning and accessibility and rigor

477
00:23:31,272 --> 00:23:34,132
that can be improved with these kinds of

478
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,422
rapidly emerging text engineering

479
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:40,102
developments. Any other comments you

480
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,062
want to make on active journal?

481
00:23:44,512 --> 00:23:50,750
Yes, and this 200 plus videos,

482
00:23:51,337 --> 00:23:55,152
there are a lot of useful

483
00:23:55,332 --> 00:23:58,912
information that's very available, and

484
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,962
if it will be extracted, it will move

485
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:03,650
forward.

486
00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:15,247
Totally agreed. There's ways of saying

487
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:19,777
and conversing in the live streams that

488
00:24:19,945 --> 00:24:24,342
certainly are clearer restatements

489
00:24:24,402 --> 00:24:27,967
of and developments beyond what is

490
00:24:28,015 --> 00:24:31,102
in the written literature. So especially

491
00:24:31,195 --> 00:24:34,325
as we move towards a multimedia future

492
00:24:34,837 --> 00:24:37,587
and a more participatory and inclusive

493
00:24:37,662 --> 00:24:40,372
science sector, it's important that we

494
00:24:40,405 --> 00:24:44,092
have the systems in place with

495
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,522
low human bandwidth to be able to

496
00:24:46,555 --> 00:24:48,652
improve and distribute scholarship on

497
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,562
these topics.

498
00:24:52,162 --> 00:24:54,672
All right, moving on to the live streams

499
00:24:54,717 --> 00:24:58,222
themselves. So we had one month off in

500
00:24:58,255 --> 00:25:01,957
July from live streams where we just

501
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:05,017
chilled read other papers, not these

502
00:25:05,065 --> 00:25:08,457
papers. And then we've had a bunch

503
00:25:08,472 --> 00:25:11,525
of great live streams so far in Q Three.

504
00:25:11,962 --> 00:25:14,277
We had guest streams with Brett

505
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:17,122
Anderson, with Ronan Tamari et al. And

506
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:20,577
with John Verveki. And we discussed

507
00:25:20,757 --> 00:25:24,327
papers in the Live Stream series

508
00:25:24,507 --> 00:25:27,612
on active cognition, abductive logic,

509
00:25:27,687 --> 00:25:29,877
active inference lab, and active

510
00:25:29,907 --> 00:25:32,237
inference as ecological communication.

511
00:25:32,737 --> 00:25:35,587
We also have a wide range of really

512
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,067
interesting live streams coming up,

513
00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:42,892
including on Bayesian mechanics on

514
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,527
neural networks, on all kinds of areas

515
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:49,507
of active inference, application and a

516
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,937
lot of really exciting theoretical

517
00:25:51,012 --> 00:25:54,547
developments also. So if you want to be

518
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,122
involved in live streams in the YouTube

519
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:00,397
live chat you'll find the past and

520
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,572
encoding streams. So one way to get

521
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:06,007
involved is to watch, listen, share,

522
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,677
comment and be involved. That way, if

523
00:26:08,695 --> 00:26:10,702
you want to play a role, for example,

524
00:26:10,795 --> 00:26:12,822
speaking on a live stream or helping

525
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:14,857
contribute to the preparation around a

526
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,967
live stream, that can also be incredibly

527
00:26:18,027 --> 00:26:21,102
important. As well as making connections

528
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:23,617
and recommendations for whom we should

529
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,047
invite so that we can have a really

530
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,842
powerful and diverse range of guest

531
00:26:28,902 --> 00:26:30,772
dreams and papers selected for the live

532
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:34,932
streams. So Live Streams have continued

533
00:26:35,097 --> 00:26:39,247
in their educational function and just

534
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,787
wanted to highlight each one of these

535
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:46,207
projects. There have been many people to

536
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,772
mention and I hope that we can by

537
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,847
next quarterly lab meeting have some

538
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,342
clearer pathways for making those clear.

539
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:02,367
But just wanted to in bulk acknowledge

540
00:27:02,427 --> 00:27:04,722
everybody who contributes to the weekly

541
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:07,147
meetings for live stream preparation and

542
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,167
organizing and those who join the stream

543
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:11,847
as well as those who help prepare

544
00:27:11,892 --> 00:27:15,052
content and coordinate questions for the

545
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,272
live stream in the background and may

546
00:27:17,305 --> 00:27:19,882
not be on the video themselves,

547
00:27:20,035 --> 00:27:23,077
so that's the live streams we continue

548
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,037
on there. Any other comments?

549
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:31,132
Just once again, one obvious

550
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:35,000
thing the more you

551
00:27:37,162 --> 00:27:40,492
involved in and of

552
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:44,525
our activity and Live Streams is

553
00:27:47,887 --> 00:27:51,137
extremely useful for understanding,

554
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:56,292
to see the way of application affect

555
00:27:56,352 --> 00:27:58,852
this coherence, why you are engaged and

556
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,962
why you understand this topic.

557
00:28:03,637 --> 00:28:07,642
Great point. And sometimes just

558
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,027
scanning the titles of the papers that

559
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:12,652
we discussed in the 50 papers that we

560
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,007
have discussed, almost 50 by the end of

561
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:19,182
the year. These are curated

562
00:28:19,272 --> 00:28:21,762
selections, usually with the authors

563
00:28:21,837 --> 00:28:24,447
joining and almost always with a dot

564
00:28:24,492 --> 00:28:27,622
zero video where people who cared made

565
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:29,827
background and context to make it as

566
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:32,227
accessible as possible. So this is a

567
00:28:32,245 --> 00:28:34,882
unique learning resource. If you have a

568
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:37,672
regime of attention and availability or

569
00:28:37,705 --> 00:28:40,902
capacity for these topics or you're

570
00:28:40,932 --> 00:28:43,897
curious and think you might, it's going

571
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,837
to be a really unique learning resource

572
00:28:45,912 --> 00:28:48,052
for you to check out our past videos.

573
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,062
And then if you're curious about media

574
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:52,927
production, communication, you want to

575
00:28:52,945 --> 00:28:55,252
explore short formats, you'd like to

576
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,567
facilitate a discussion in a English

577
00:28:57,627 --> 00:29:00,462
language, you want to make an animation

578
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:03,127
video. There's so many affordances that

579
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:05,397
we can support. So if you're curious

580
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:07,775
about those areas, just get in touch.

581
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:11,962
Okay? Continuing on education,

582
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,322
internal systems thinking, ongoing

583
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:16,797
activity yvonne, I'll let you describe

584
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:19,700
it. Thanks.

585
00:29:20,362 --> 00:29:23,975
Yes, we also have not

586
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:28,317
actually related active

587
00:29:28,377 --> 00:29:32,677
inference our activity and

588
00:29:32,845 --> 00:29:36,897
this August we launched

589
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:40,925
four weeks session for System Thinking

590
00:29:42,562 --> 00:29:45,802
course, part of it that related to

591
00:29:45,895 --> 00:29:47,462
the role concepts.

592
00:29:51,937 --> 00:30:10,852
For four weeks we

593
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,347
can't cover the whole course, but four

594
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,750
weeks for understanding role concept is

595
00:30:18,637 --> 00:30:19,700
fair enough.

596
00:30:23,362 --> 00:30:26,982
We also run this October

597
00:30:27,147 --> 00:30:30,717
next Cohort and for previous

598
00:30:30,777 --> 00:30:35,537
one, we have good feedback

599
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:37,937
from our participants.

600
00:30:40,387 --> 00:30:42,587
Could you show next slide,

601
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:44,525
please? Thank you.

602
00:30:48,037 --> 00:30:51,667
Next. This October, we start new

603
00:30:51,715 --> 00:30:55,057
cohort and here is a link

604
00:30:55,135 --> 00:30:58,807
for participation. It will

605
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:02,225
also take four weeks,

606
00:31:02,887 --> 00:31:06,847
and during these weeks we

607
00:31:06,955 --> 00:31:11,450
consider concepts from System Thinking

608
00:31:13,312 --> 00:31:17,307
course and we'll

609
00:31:17,397 --> 00:31:22,192
apply these concepts to your

610
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,072
projects or maybe even

611
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,657
live projects. And next

612
00:31:31,735 --> 00:31:36,567
one, we have this activity

613
00:31:36,627 --> 00:31:40,177
with our partner, institute for

614
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,007
Advanced Intelligence and

615
00:31:42,085 --> 00:31:44,047
Entrepreneurship, Engineering and

616
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,500
Management. And this fall,

617
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:53,167
the EAM Institute launched for

618
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:56,152
courses. Now, these courses are

619
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:59,242
available for free, and we also

620
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:04,552
encourage you to discuss

621
00:32:04,645 --> 00:32:08,600
these courses. For sure you will find

622
00:32:10,612 --> 00:32:14,082
a lot of useful information also related

623
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:17,975
to the active inference as

624
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:20,012
evolutionary theory.

625
00:32:22,837 --> 00:32:25,862
Awesome. Yes. So this Systems

626
00:32:27,037 --> 00:32:28,537
Engineering and Systems Thinking

627
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,022
activity helps us learn about roles

628
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:34,942
and how to apply them in projects. And

629
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,152
we are applying them in Active Inference

630
00:32:37,182 --> 00:32:39,972
institute projects. So it also upskills

631
00:32:40,017 --> 00:32:42,322
participants and gets them ready to take

632
00:32:42,355 --> 00:32:46,002
on more involved and responsible roles

633
00:32:46,182 --> 00:32:49,177
in our institute. And it's all a

634
00:32:49,195 --> 00:32:52,692
coevolutionary dance. As the institute

635
00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:56,437
formalizes and gains resources and

636
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,257
establishes itself in the niche, then

637
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,777
such roles will also be the ones that we

638
00:33:01,795 --> 00:33:05,167
can support. All right,

639
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:10,227
any other comments onto

640
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:12,837
the research? So the previous updates

641
00:33:12,912 --> 00:33:15,777
were from Education. Just to briefly

642
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:18,402
summarize textbook group two ongoing

643
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:21,387

649
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,892
Systems Thinking education activity

650
00:33:38,952 --> 00:33:41,922
ongoing open to all of these projects.

651
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:45,517
Your involvement on to the research?

652
00:33:45,715 --> 00:33:48,277
So, it's been a great quarter for

653
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:51,087
research. First, we'd like to highlight

654
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,287
our active block Force development.

655
00:33:54,787 --> 00:33:56,572
Activeblock Force Instance is an open

656
00:33:56,605 --> 00:33:58,872
source package that is implementing

657
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:01,422
classic and novel active inference

658
00:34:01,467 --> 00:34:04,092
ModelStream within the system simulation

659
00:34:04,152 --> 00:34:07,417
framework of Cadcat. So we have a few

660
00:34:07,465 --> 00:34:10,717
updates on active blockerents. First,

661
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,382
Jacob Smithall presented a poster

662
00:34:14,547 --> 00:34:18,237
at the Iy 2022 3rd International

663
00:34:18,312 --> 00:34:20,737
Workshop on Active Inference. So

664
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,272
congratulations, Jacob, for this awesome

665
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,557
poster, presenting it in person, and to

666
00:34:26,635 --> 00:34:28,837
all others who have been contributing to

667
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,012
development on Active blockfronts. It's

668
00:34:32,662 --> 00:34:36,322
really great to see the development of

669
00:34:36,505 --> 00:34:38,842
this project and also a lot of other

670
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,182
work in the active inference community.

671
00:34:41,335 --> 00:34:44,847
So please check out Iy if you're curious

672
00:34:44,892 --> 00:34:47,167
to see what is cutting edge active

673
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:48,952
inference lab research. They really did

674
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:52,087
a great job in getting some of the best

675
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,525
projects in the space.

676
00:34:55,837 --> 00:34:59,287
Also, Active Lock Force Instance has

677
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:02,842
received some funding through

678
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,962
the Bitcoin Gr 15 round that just

679
00:35:06,025 --> 00:35:09,050
completed. So our Agent COVID project

680
00:35:09,937 --> 00:35:12,997
was Active Lock Force Instance, an open

681
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,052
source package for cognitive modeling in

682
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:18,292
web three. And we

683
00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:21,822
specifically framed how we could utilize

684
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:23,292
cognitive modeling approaches

685
00:35:23,352 --> 00:35:25,962
integrating active inference and CAD CAD

686
00:35:26,112 --> 00:35:28,492
for cognitive modeling in web Three

687
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,837
ecosystems. So big appreciation to

688
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,727
everyone who provided even $1

689
00:35:35,832 --> 00:35:38,947
to this funding opportunity. And in

690
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,792
several weeks, we'll know the final

691
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,117
amount that we've received after the

692
00:35:43,165 --> 00:35:45,277
quadratic funding algorithms have all

693
00:35:45,295 --> 00:35:47,122
been applied, but suffice to say that we

694
00:35:47,155 --> 00:35:50,452
have some money in our tank to

695
00:35:50,545 --> 00:35:53,947
develop active block prints. So there

696
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,197
are many ways in Brea people can get

697
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:59,622
applied in. There are weekly meetings,

698
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:01,972
there are weekly meetings at twelve and

699
00:36:02,005 --> 00:36:05,422
17 UTC on Wednesday in the discord. And

700
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:08,997
also we discussed this with Yaccup

701
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:12,697
today. Mondays at 18 UTC is

702
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,947
going to be a code development specific

703
00:36:15,055 --> 00:36:17,422
session. So if you want to get a little

704
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:19,777
bit more technical and collaborate with

705
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:23,187
Markov and others on the Cadcad

706
00:36:23,262 --> 00:36:26,322
active inference modeling, then Mondays

707
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:30,397
18 UTC is a great synchronous time at

708
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,217
twelve and 17 UTC on Wednesdays. Those

709
00:36:33,265 --> 00:36:36,277
are slightly more open sessions where we

710
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:38,367
can also split off and have technical

711
00:36:38,427 --> 00:36:40,672
development, but we talk about a whole

712
00:36:40,705 --> 00:36:43,237
range of areas. So I'm going to mention

713
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,107
some areas and then tasks and how we're

714
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:48,547
going to use some of our funding to

715
00:36:48,655 --> 00:36:51,622
accelerate development. These are just

716
00:36:51,655 --> 00:36:54,097
showing a few of the areas where we

717
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,317
believe cognitive modeling could be used

718
00:36:56,365 --> 00:36:58,252
or might be important or relevant to

719
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:01,642
consider, ranging from a range of social

720
00:37:01,765 --> 00:37:04,342
settings, education,

721
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,627
governance, legal, online work,

722
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:11,752
stigma, G, so on, to a

723
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,922
host of Web Three cases. So Dows,

724
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:17,825
Decentralized, finance, D, school,

725
00:37:18,187 --> 00:37:21,577
DSI, Ethereum, a lot

726
00:37:21,595 --> 00:37:24,922
of other areas in Web Three, and then

727
00:37:24,955 --> 00:37:28,702
also on the ground with

728
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,972
the ants in terms of developing the

729
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:34,497
active infra ant model for ant colony

730
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:37,077
foraging and ultimately larger task

731
00:37:37,107 --> 00:37:39,517
allocation questions. These are all

732
00:37:39,565 --> 00:37:41,877
areas where we see the active

733
00:37:41,907 --> 00:37:45,622
blockfronts package as being able to

734
00:37:45,655 --> 00:37:48,127
address them eventually. And what it

735
00:37:48,145 --> 00:37:50,482
takes to address an active block force

736
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:52,252
instance model in one of these cases and

737
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,672
settings is for someone with domain

738
00:37:54,717 --> 00:37:58,027
expertise or knowledge to provide the

739
00:37:58,045 --> 00:38:00,202
bridge building from one side and then

740
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,217
the package to develop the generalized

741
00:38:02,277 --> 00:38:04,377
capacities from the other side. So we're

742
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:07,192
working from both ends to enable really

743
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,222
powerful domain specific implication of

744
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:13,737
active inference while building modular

745
00:38:13,812 --> 00:38:15,897
structure of the active blockfront

746
00:38:15,942 --> 00:38:18,612
package so that those functionalities

747
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:21,322
can be used in other settings. For

748
00:38:21,355 --> 00:38:23,647
example, a navigation setting that might

749
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,547
arise from our work on ant foraging

750
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:29,872
might be used in a different context in

751
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,307
another nonant setting. So that's a

752
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,777
little bit about how we approach the

753
00:38:34,795 --> 00:38:37,072
development of the package. We think

754
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:38,722
about the functionalities of the

755
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:41,752
package, modulars as modules that can be

756
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,447
invoked and functions that can be

757
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,612
called, and then we develop different

758
00:38:46,675 --> 00:38:49,852
settings. For cognitive modeling. There

759
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,972
are a range of tasks that people can get

760
00:38:53,005 --> 00:38:56,197
involved in ranging from Cadcat and

761
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:59,002
active inference technical tasks, to a

762
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,552
whole host of package level and

763
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,597
documentation and community engagement

764
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:05,962
tasks. So if this sounds like a cool

765
00:39:06,025 --> 00:39:07,627
direction or you would just like to

766
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:10,252
learn more, then please join a

767
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,487
synchronous meeting or get in touch

768
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,812
another way, because this is a super

769
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:17,347
exciting area of development. We hope

770
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,297
that active blockfronts can be a really

771
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:22,492
important package in this area and so

772
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,007
come be involved with the funding.

773
00:39:26,172 --> 00:39:27,927
What we're going to be experimenting

774
00:39:27,957 --> 00:39:30,922
with in the coming weeks and months is a

775
00:39:30,955 --> 00:39:33,582
task based payment scheme.

776
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:37,042
So individuals or small teams will

777
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:40,627
propose how much funding they would like

778
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:43,402
to receive for what specific tasks, and

779
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,172
there's a form that will be filled out.

780
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,947
And so we can show you that if you join

781
00:39:46,992 --> 00:39:50,525
Synchronously, completing that form will

782
00:39:50,962 --> 00:39:53,572
raise your task request to

783
00:39:53,605 --> 00:39:57,427
consideration. And then if the task is

784
00:39:57,445 --> 00:39:59,952
approved and you complete it as laid

785
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:01,807
out, you will be paid the amount that

786
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:05,877
you requested. So if funding ever felt

787
00:40:05,907 --> 00:40:07,477
like it was a rate limiting step for

788
00:40:07,495 --> 00:40:09,987
your involvement in learning or applying

789
00:40:10,062 --> 00:40:11,977
active inference and contributing to

790
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:15,352
open source public goods, then consider

791
00:40:15,445 --> 00:40:18,247
it differently now, because we can

792
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,397
support this type of work. And we

793
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,367
also see some really exciting

794
00:40:23,427 --> 00:40:25,837
opportunities for people, for example,

795
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,222
to propose tasks around applying to

796
00:40:28,255 --> 00:40:31,057
other grants or to including more

797
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,617
developers or more documenters,

798
00:40:34,677 --> 00:40:36,327
or people who want to make Active Block

799
00:40:36,357 --> 00:40:38,302
Force its live streams. There's a

800
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,227
million areas where people can develop

801
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,702
here, so join the weekly meetings is the

802
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,622
best way to get involved there. Any

803
00:40:45,655 --> 00:40:47,537
other comments on blockfronts?

804
00:40:52,312 --> 00:40:56,287
Okay, then, just one last

805
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,827
research update. This is not presenting

806
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,652
all the research happening in the

807
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,577
institute. This is just to kind of raise

808
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:06,622
a few projects up. We have had

809
00:41:06,655 --> 00:41:08,547
a project on cognitive modeling

810
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:11,077
framework and their comparisons. The

811
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:13,027
goal of this project is to understand

812
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,322
similarities and differentiate with

813
00:41:15,355 --> 00:41:17,097
active coherence and other cognitive

814
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,402
modeling framework. So the approach that

815
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,772
we're taking here is to review and

816
00:41:21,805 --> 00:41:23,577
assess different cognitive modeling

817
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:26,982
frameworks in terms of their features,

818
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:30,472
their functions, their elements, their

819
00:41:30,505 --> 00:41:33,050
areas of application, and so on.

820
00:41:33,862 --> 00:41:35,422
And that will help us understand

821
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,422
similarities and differences amongst

822
00:41:37,467 --> 00:41:40,947
frameworks, as well as more formally

823
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:43,527
and historically integrate active

824
00:41:43,557 --> 00:41:46,402
inference with other models. So this is

825
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,777
one of a research task that could

826
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:53,107
open up quite broad vistas for

827
00:41:53,185 --> 00:41:56,197
application. Anyone who's curious or

828
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,147
engaged in cognitive modeling would be

829
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,797
welcome to get involved with this

830
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:02,527
project. And one can even see the

831
00:42:02,545 --> 00:42:04,797
pathway here, kind of like the epistemic

832
00:42:04,842 --> 00:42:07,422
chaining example in Pi MDP.

833
00:42:07,617 --> 00:42:09,607
If someone identifies that there is a

834
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,772
common cognitive modeling framework that

835
00:42:12,805 --> 00:42:16,707
has features ABC and is used in domain

836
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:20,737
F, then domain F

837
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:23,122
becomes an area of application for

838
00:42:23,155 --> 00:42:26,397
active inference. If functions ABC

839
00:42:26,592 --> 00:42:28,602
can be implemented better in active

840
00:42:28,632 --> 00:42:31,037
inference than the initial framework.

841
00:42:31,462 --> 00:42:34,627
So that kind of work on the landscape of

842
00:42:34,645 --> 00:42:37,282
cognitive modeling is a really important

843
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,807
precursor to understanding where and how

844
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,562
and with an emphasis on which

845
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:45,547
functionalities it even makes sense to

846
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,502
talk about applying active inference.

847
00:42:47,682 --> 00:42:50,302
And we hope and expect to prefer that

848
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,522
there will be active inference

849
00:42:51,567 --> 00:42:53,842
applications that haven't been within

850
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:55,752
the range of traditionally considered

851
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:58,222
cognitive settings. For example, I'm not

852
00:42:58,255 --> 00:43:02,247
sure how often in multiscale ecology

853
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:04,672
cognitive modeling frameworks are used

854
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,927
as a simulation tool. Now we know

855
00:43:07,945 --> 00:43:09,477
that active inference. Is being applied

856
00:43:09,507 --> 00:43:12,327
in those areas, but there are also areas

857
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:14,407
where cognitive modeling is already

858
00:43:14,485 --> 00:43:17,662
happening and it may or may not be using

859
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:19,392
active inference. So those represent

860
00:43:19,452 --> 00:43:22,102
adjacencies where by developing the

861
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,632
connection between how they're doing it

862
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:25,925
today and how it could be done,

863
00:43:26,512 --> 00:43:29,077
people will be opening up really large

864
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:31,567
areas for active inference application

865
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:34,027
and also massive areas of attention and

866
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:36,187
support. So this is kind of a cool

867
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,442
direction. Any notes on this or anything

868
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:40,550
else on research?

869
00:43:46,312 --> 00:43:48,472
All right, let's just go to some last

870
00:43:48,505 --> 00:43:51,322
steps and close. If anyone in the live

871
00:43:51,355 --> 00:43:52,912
chat has any questions, they're welcome

872
00:43:52,975 --> 00:43:56,517
to add them. So, next steps

873
00:43:56,577 --> 00:44:00,187
for the Institute? Well, on the

874
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,912
engagement and outreach frontier,

875
00:44:03,337 --> 00:44:05,975
we continue to grow and develop.

876
00:44:06,637 --> 00:44:10,117
We host most of our communication at our

877
00:44:10,165 --> 00:44:13,417
discord, which has over 450 members.

878
00:44:13,465 --> 00:44:17,242
Now, our Twitter as well as our

879
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:20,122
podcast and video channels are all

880
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:23,987
growing in terms of their niche.

881
00:44:24,637 --> 00:44:28,012
So if you support us on any of these

882
00:44:28,075 --> 00:44:30,772
platforms and can share or just even

883
00:44:30,805 --> 00:44:32,617
tell one person, that can be quite

884
00:44:32,665 --> 00:44:35,227
helpful. And always provide us with

885
00:44:35,245 --> 00:44:37,492
feedback on how we can improve our

886
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,797
environment, our agreement with external

887
00:44:40,842 --> 00:44:44,842
interfaces, and then just to provide

888
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,372
a summary of some steps and directions

889
00:44:48,567 --> 00:44:52,447
for how we go from Q Three on beyond to

890
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,662
Q Four, any of these areas.

891
00:44:55,812 --> 00:44:58,637
If you are interested or curious,

892
00:44:59,062 --> 00:45:02,227
please be involved. The earlier and the

893
00:45:02,245 --> 00:45:05,227
more involved, simply the better and the

894
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:06,877
higher leverage point that is for the

895
00:45:06,895 --> 00:45:10,567
future. We are continuing education and

896
00:45:10,615 --> 00:45:12,727
research. It's the main focus of active

897
00:45:12,745 --> 00:45:14,947
inference lab Institute, and we will

898
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,150
always continue education and research.

899
00:45:17,737 --> 00:45:19,687
We're also, during these months

900
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,262
undergoing a really creative and unique

901
00:45:23,337 --> 00:45:25,550
organizational development opportunity,

902
00:45:25,987 --> 00:45:28,597
for example, around assembling the board

903
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,592
of directors and some of the early

904
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,067
decisions around governance and

905
00:45:33,115 --> 00:45:35,302
organizational structure. So if you have

906
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,117
input or want to be more involved here

907
00:45:37,165 --> 00:45:39,652
as well, otherwise just to know that

908
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:43,312
it's happening. We are looking towards

909
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:46,372
several directions ant the end of 2022

910
00:45:46,405 --> 00:45:49,477
and to really come into in

911
00:45:49,495 --> 00:45:53,197
a new way in 2023. We're looking towards

912
00:45:53,305 --> 00:45:56,422
increased participation in projects and

913
00:45:56,455 --> 00:45:58,597
learning groups, as well as the

914
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,042
development of an internship program

915
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,242
that will help structure your engagement

916
00:46:04,377 --> 00:46:06,727
with a mentor and in a project specific

917
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,947
way so that you can stay engaged and

918
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,257
also have something clearer to point to

919
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:12,877
about your engagement with the

920
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:16,477
Institute. We are continuing to,

921
00:46:16,645 --> 00:46:18,727
as we finish the first cohort of the

922
00:46:18,745 --> 00:46:20,887
textbook group, think more and more

923
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:22,687
about active coherence course

924
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,787
developments. So we'd encourage anyone

925
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,472
who wants to partner or be involved in

926
00:46:27,505 --> 00:46:31,177
that area to get in touch in

927
00:46:31,195 --> 00:46:34,377
the journal project and in a slightly

928
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:36,112
different way in the textbook group.

929
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:39,372
We're working towards the captioning,

930
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:41,532
the subtitles and language translations

931
00:46:41,622 --> 00:46:44,677
where possible. And especially with our

932
00:46:44,695 --> 00:46:47,277
new organizational structure, we're

933
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:49,347
looking towards funding opportunities

934
00:46:49,467 --> 00:46:52,582
and partnerships. So if you have any

935
00:46:52,735 --> 00:46:56,547
thoughts or capacities or feedback

936
00:46:56,592 --> 00:46:58,612
in these Brea, they're all super

937
00:46:58,675 --> 00:47:01,192
important areas for the institute going

938
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,037
forward and it would be really

939
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:06,597
appreciated as we are a participatory

940
00:47:06,642 --> 00:47:10,512
open science institute and only recently

941
00:47:10,587 --> 00:47:12,352
received our first small amount of

942
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,077
funding through the Agent Coin grant for

943
00:47:14,095 --> 00:47:17,152
blockfronts to explore new

944
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,277
avenues of partnership, funding,

945
00:47:20,457 --> 00:47:23,197
service and beyond that we have not

946
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:27,772
done. So what hasn't happened yet is

947
00:47:27,805 --> 00:47:30,217
not too strong of a prior on what we may

948
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:33,487
do in the future, if that makes sense.

949
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:36,082
We'll be doing different things and I

950
00:47:36,085 --> 00:47:37,432
hope that you can be a part of it

951
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,997
because it grows and changes in

952
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:43,432
coengagements when and only when

953
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,522
people get engaged. That's

954
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:47,542
interactionism, this is not

955
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:50,825
instructionism. So if you have any

956
00:47:51,637 --> 00:47:55,087
excitement around these topics or any

957
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:56,527
others that you would want to have on

958
00:47:56,545 --> 00:47:59,707
here, then getting in contact with us

959
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,452
will be a great first step. Join our

960
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:04,647
discord, join any of the synchronous

961
00:48:04,692 --> 00:48:08,122
meetings, email us and we can

962
00:48:08,155 --> 00:48:09,875
start a conversation that way.

963
00:48:11,362 --> 00:48:15,297
Well, that is all for this roundtable.

964
00:48:15,417 --> 00:48:18,427
It was a short quarter, it was

965
00:48:18,445 --> 00:48:23,902
only like a few months from

966
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,592
our previous Livestream. Time went by

967
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,042
quite fast and a lot did

968
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:33,875
happen. So once again,

969
00:48:34,312 --> 00:48:38,137
next quarter promises to. Be more

970
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,832
active and as you understood,

971
00:48:41,922 --> 00:48:45,212
they are very open to participation.

972
00:48:45,937 --> 00:48:50,150
So in the class, see you on our

973
00:48:51,937 --> 00:48:55,612
synchrony meetings in this course.

974
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,875
Subscribe us and share.

975
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:02,837
Yes? Alex, any last comments?

976
00:49:08,562 --> 00:49:13,162
I can only repeat that the participation

977
00:49:13,662 --> 00:49:16,997
of people who will join

978
00:49:17,042 --> 00:49:19,467
us in the future is the main focus for

979
00:49:19,515 --> 00:49:23,307
us and everything what we are doing is

980
00:49:23,385 --> 00:49:27,850
related to help others to

981
00:49:29,412 --> 00:49:32,337
learn about active coherence, to learn

982
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,712
active coherence and find ways to apply

983
00:49:35,775 --> 00:49:39,507
it. And we are on open

984
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:44,022
ended path and actually we

985
00:49:44,055 --> 00:49:46,482
don't know what will be in three months

986
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,727
from here but we will adaptive and

987
00:49:50,895 --> 00:49:54,882
provide possible

988
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,750
affordance for hours to join and learn.

989
00:49:59,187 --> 00:50:02,252
So welcome indeed,

990
00:50:02,357 --> 00:50:04,847
welcome to those who are and haven't

991
00:50:04,892 --> 00:50:07,917
joined yet and a big appreciation again

992
00:50:07,965 --> 00:50:10,827
for everyone who's contributed to the

993
00:50:10,845 --> 00:50:13,482
Institute to make things how they are

994
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,907
today. So thanks everyone. Alex,

995
00:50:17,072 --> 00:50:20,525
see you later. Thank you. Thank you.
