1
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,987
All right. Hello. Welcome, everyone.

2
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,950
This is the ActInf Lab quarterly

3
00:00:34,025 --> 00:00:37,440
roundtable number 20. Number two in

4
00:00:37,457 --> 00:00:40,455
2022. It's June 29,

5
00:00:40,577 --> 00:00:44,015
2022. So welcome to the active

6
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:46,730
inference lab. We're a participatory

7
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,665
online lab that is communicating,

8
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,515
learning and practicing applied active

9
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:53,735
coherence. You can find us at the links

10
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,715
on the slide. This is a recorded and an

11
00:00:56,732 --> 00:00:59,115
archive Livestream, so please provide us

12
00:00:59,132 --> 00:01:00,885
with feedback so we can improve our

13
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:03,680
work. All backgrounds and perspectives

14
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,255
are welcome and will be following video

15
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:08,125
etiquette for live streams.

16
00:01:09,975 --> 00:01:13,530
Today, it's a quarterly round table lab

17
00:01:13,577 --> 00:01:15,885
meeting, so we're going to have a lot of

18
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:19,085
updates to share on some of the activity

19
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:22,785
of the second quarter of 2022 and

20
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:25,845
also share a lot of next steps at the

21
00:01:25,997 --> 00:01:29,200
project and at the organizational scale.

22
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,035
So let's begin with an introduction

23
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,930
warmup. We can say hello and

24
00:01:37,052 --> 00:01:39,210
maybe as if it were a paper. We were

25
00:01:39,242 --> 00:01:43,140
discussing what was just one memory or

26
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:46,145
something that you learned this quarter

27
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:48,630
or some participation that you just want

28
00:01:48,677 --> 00:01:51,530
to call out and highlight.

29
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:54,840
So I'll go first. I'm Daniel. I'm a

30
00:01:54,857 --> 00:01:58,770
researcher in California and have a

31
00:01:58,772 --> 00:02:02,550
lot to add, but just saw so much amazing

32
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:06,510
parameterisation and development this

33
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:10,065
quarter without having

34
00:02:10,232 --> 00:02:13,212
compiled these slides with everybody.

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,280
So much would have just it all happened

36
00:02:17,327 --> 00:02:20,670
so fast and so looking forward to

37
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:22,710
catching up on this and also building

38
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:26,160
structures so that we can even have

39
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:28,430
more clarity internally and externally

40
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,540
about what we're working on. Like,

41
00:02:30,557 --> 00:02:32,100
there's just quite a contrast with

42
00:02:32,162 --> 00:02:34,635
hopefully this lab meeting and even our

43
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:37,740
previous five or six. And I'll pass it

44
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,950
to Bleu.

45
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,710
Yeah, this quarter was awesome. I think

46
00:02:43,742 --> 00:02:45,735
the launch of the textbook group has

47
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:48,965
been pretty mindblowing for me. That's

48
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:52,512
like a new thing that we've done. And,

49
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:55,605
yeah, I am enjoying it and looking

50
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:57,705
forward to future cohorts. Andy Clark

51
00:02:57,752 --> 00:02:59,880
two, the textbook group. But that to me

52
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:03,815
was kind of like a pivotal

53
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:07,365
moment in this last three months. And

54
00:03:07,382 --> 00:03:11,480
I'll pass to Jacob. Hi, I'm Eko.

55
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,165
I'm a student in the UK, and the

56
00:03:15,182 --> 00:03:19,525
textbook group was also the highlight

57
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,585
this quarter for me. And one

58
00:03:24,617 --> 00:03:27,840
thing that I learned probably would

59
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:31,490
have to be that multi agent active

60
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,385
inference is a lot more interesting

61
00:03:35,492 --> 00:03:38,800
and harder than initially means the eye.

62
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,725
And I'll pass it to Alex.

63
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:48,547
Yeah, thanks. I'm Alex, and I

64
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,102
can agree that education as

65
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,767
a service from the lab is the most

66
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:57,742
important thing for this quarter. So for

67
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,072
study group as well as for

68
00:04:01,105 --> 00:04:04,117
our formers what we are planning and now

69
00:04:04,165 --> 00:04:06,472
preparing for participants and more

70
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:11,047
broader community most

71
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,462
important thing, from deposit to Bijan.

72
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:19,422
Thank you, Alex. My name is Bijan.

73
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:23,112
I'm in Romania. I'm a researcherian,

74
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:27,117
systems management school. Last quarter

75
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:31,175
we done a lot of work

76
00:04:31,987 --> 00:04:36,200
in case of education as well as

77
00:04:36,637 --> 00:04:40,550
in case of administration in

78
00:04:41,962 --> 00:04:46,025
the lab level. So I'm looking forward to

79
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:50,750
development for all the directions we

80
00:04:53,362 --> 00:04:56,842
are dealing with. All right,

81
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,547
let's get into the projects. So first

82
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,102
we're going to provide some updates on

83
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:06,472
the project scale. So these are things

84
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:09,367
that happen during second quarter for a

85
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:13,222
variety of projects. All right,

86
00:05:13,255 --> 00:05:16,162
first, as mentioned by several of us

87
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:19,642
here, we began the first cohort of

88
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,577
the Active Inference textbook group in

89
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:25,212
May 2022 and that will go through July

90
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:28,447
2022. And we are working on the

91
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,377
first five chapters of this active

92
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:34,227
inference textbook by Thomas Parr,

93
00:05:34,257 --> 00:05:36,772
Giovanni Pezzulo and Karl Friston. And

94
00:05:36,805 --> 00:05:38,497
just to give a little taste though,

95
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,402
there's a few other pieces too that

96
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:42,897
people who participate in future cohorts

97
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:46,402
will get to experience. There's a

98
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,807
collaborative questions and Discourse

99
00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:52,057
Affordance, which has allowed people to

100
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:55,747
introduce basic clarifying questions as

101
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,597
well as questions about application and

102
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,252
about philosophy. All different kinds of

103
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,722
questions have been addressed in a way

104
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:04,717
that really clearly references which

105
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,922
part of the text it's about, which page

106
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,427
or which figure. And in fact, all the

107
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:11,932
tables, figures, equations and so on

108
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,427
have been annotated using Coda such that

109
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,097
by just clicking on it you can see a pop

110
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,422
up of a figure and that allows a very

111
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:23,137
interactive way of dealing with

112
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:27,207
different terms and different objects

113
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:29,947
of attention. And then on the right we

114
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,442
have some of the work by those engaged

115
00:06:32,502 --> 00:06:35,002
most in the math learning, where for

116
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,852
each equation we are aiming to have a

117
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,077
natural language description. First,

118
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,792
just reading out the equation as it is.

119
00:06:43,915 --> 00:06:47,157
And also here active coherence ontology

120
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:49,402
terms are in Bleu. So this will

121
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,527
facilitate the translation of equations

122
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:56,332
across human languages as well as the

123
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:58,422
development of multiple programming

124
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:00,682
languages maybe that are representing a

125
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:02,722
certain equation and giving a lot of

126
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,502
continuity with terms and the tools and

127
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,277
the points of reference within the book.

128
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,427
And all of that is being threaded

129
00:07:11,457 --> 00:07:13,752
together really by the active inference

130
00:07:13,782 --> 00:07:16,317
ontology which has been in development

131
00:07:16,377 --> 00:07:19,252
since really the initial days of the

132
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,622
lab. So it's just awesome to see this

133
00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:24,352
new knowledge artifacts come onto the

134
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:27,297
scene, new modification in the niche,

135
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:29,677
new textbook has entered the chat and

136
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:32,647
then be able to organize rapidly and

137
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,522
have a bunch of participants get

138
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,652
involved. What would anybody else like

139
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,525
to add about the textbook group?

140
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,585
It's different than a paper, it has

141
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:55,885
similarities with papers, but it is very

142
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:57,835
different. So it's been a great

143
00:07:57,867 --> 00:07:59,530
experience. Anything else though? Yeah,

144
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:03,262
Alex. Yeah, I think it was also

145
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,910
interesting experience how Subgroup for

146
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:09,650
Math Learning was organized,

147
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,405
like my initiative of participants and

148
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,787
how it started to work on like

149
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,225
additional direction and provide more

150
00:08:19,287 --> 00:08:22,215
energy and more efforts to structure

151
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:24,637
math side of the book.

152
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:33,562
This is our first

153
00:08:33,925 --> 00:08:36,200
attempt in such activity.

154
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,270
As I see, it has a lot of opportunities

155
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:46,710
for learners and it helps

156
00:08:46,755 --> 00:08:50,230
to acknowledge all the concepts and all

157
00:08:50,277 --> 00:08:53,375
the idea of exercise.

158
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,820
Great. Okay, moving on to another

159
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:03,165
educational effort, the internal systems

160
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:05,995
thinking ongoing activity. Alex, would

161
00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:08,110
you like to describe a little bit here?

162
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:08,737
Or.

163
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:18,272
I can say this from the beginning, it

164
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:21,107
hae Parr of our strategy to use system

165
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,612
thinking intelligence to organize work

166
00:09:23,675 --> 00:09:28,427
on projects and it is like a

167
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:31,022
requirement for participants to have an

168
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:33,302
understanding of concepts of system

169
00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:36,772
thinking. So having this computational

170
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:39,677
activity for people who are willing to

171
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:42,812
learn it and later to take part in

172
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,350
different roles in Labs project,

173
00:09:47,912 --> 00:09:51,587
for us, it's like a

174
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,647
basement for all we are doing and we are

175
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,922
also learning. By doing visit occasion

176
00:09:58,117 --> 00:10:01,282
and hopefully new version of textbook

177
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:04,862
and the program which we are using here

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,897
to help us to be more and more

179
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,552
efficient in all projects that we are

180
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,150
doing.

181
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:17,700
Any other comments here?

182
00:10:19,937 --> 00:10:23,347
Yeah, we launched this type of activity

183
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:27,450
to have a common language for all

184
00:10:28,187 --> 00:10:32,627
the participants and this course is

185
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:38,747
providing such language and it

186
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,382
is one

187
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,417
of such activity and

188
00:10:47,465 --> 00:10:52,200
I hope we will continue with different

189
00:10:55,262 --> 00:10:58,287
types of educational formats.

190
00:10:59,837 --> 00:11:02,250
Great. Okay,

191
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:07,127
continuing on, we have also

192
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,527
in education, there was a lot of

193
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:12,217
development in Q Two with our Knowledge

194
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:15,542
Engineering and Knowledge Corpus project

195
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,452
Bleu. Would you like to provide initial

196
00:11:17,482 --> 00:11:18,162
summary?

197
00:11:20,537 --> 00:11:23,477
Sure. So I think we've described this

198
00:11:23,495 --> 00:11:26,147
project before, but just briefly, we are

199
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:29,812
taking the open force papers from PubMed

200
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:32,447
that have active inference or free

201
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,237
energy principle as keywords. And we've

202
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:41,262
put all of these papers into a database

203
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:43,952
with all of the authors and all of the

204
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,002
metadata and we are

205
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,272
then scraping them and parsing out the

206
00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:55,887
text for keywords from our ontology.

207
00:11:56,312 --> 00:11:59,712
And this is shown here in the heat map,

208
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:03,422
this top right figure, it shows all the

209
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:07,277
different ontology words and how they

210
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,172
cluster per paper. So we've looked at

211
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,622
keyword clustering and authorship. Like

212
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:16,350
this is first author papers by year,

213
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:20,527
so we can kind of see trends in active

214
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:24,450
inference. But this will serve as then

215
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:29,372
a way for our ontology to access the

216
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:32,027
original data. So if you're looking for

217
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,557
words in the ontology, something you

218
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,792
don't understand, like Markov blanket or

219
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,847
something like this, you can actually go

220
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,677
straight to the horse's mouth, so to

221
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:41,947
speak, and find papers that reference

222
00:12:41,992 --> 00:12:43,950
this, maybe that reference it a lot.

223
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:47,072
And so we're intending to publish this

224
00:12:47,105 --> 00:12:50,492
and then really we want to build a

225
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,747
reflexive system and invite people to

226
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,597
upload their own papers. And we're also

227
00:12:56,705 --> 00:12:59,297
starting to get papers from archive now.

228
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,352
And then we also will invite people to

229
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,542
upload papers that maybe are not open

230
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,972
access that they want to have catalog in

231
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:08,762
our database. So it's really a fun,

232
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:11,582
interesting data evidence project that

233
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:14,087
I've enjoyed working on with Daniel and

234
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,875
our colleague RJ. So yeah.

235
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:22,252
Just to show that heat

236
00:13:22,282 --> 00:13:25,717
map again, where the columns

237
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:28,322
are the terms and the frequency of their

238
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:31,747
use and the rows are different clusters

239
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,847
of papers. So this is like topic

240
00:13:33,892 --> 00:13:36,782
modeling, it's identifying clusters of

241
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,117
terms that have a similar co expression

242
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:42,347
pattern. And so it was really fun to

243
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,522
apply this kind of heat mapping and

244
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:46,042
clustering and some statistical

245
00:13:46,102 --> 00:13:49,292
techniques because both Bleu and I have

246
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,367
worked with gene expression analyses

247
00:13:51,502 --> 00:13:53,827
where the rows would be like the genes

248
00:13:53,857 --> 00:13:56,312
and the genome and the columns would be

249
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,377
how much different genes are expressed

250
00:13:59,407 --> 00:14:01,277
in different samples. And so the

251
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:03,912
ontology is kind of like the genome

252
00:14:04,337 --> 00:14:06,472
because there's one copy of every term.

253
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:09,662
It's like a dictionary and then some

254
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:12,227
terms are used a lot or little or not at

255
00:14:12,245 --> 00:14:15,842
all in any given library, in any given

256
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,397
sample of text. And so it's showing how

257
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,697
the expression of the ontology and of

258
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,442
terms relates to this.

259
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:28,717
In our case, a reference genome

260
00:14:28,777 --> 00:14:30,322
of not just the whole language

261
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,947
dictionary, but specifically the active

262
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:35,677
ontology as a versioning and developing

263
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:39,152
artifact. So then rhetorical and

264
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,002
conceptual relationships can be drawn in

265
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,662
principle amongst ontology terms like

266
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:47,677
here's the relationship between Markov

267
00:14:47,707 --> 00:14:49,667
Blanket and Friston Blanket or whatever

268
00:14:49,715 --> 00:14:51,767
other terms are being linked and also

269
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:54,217
that can be integrated with empirical

270
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,942
results from the literature and also

271
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,922
translated across different language to

272
00:14:58,955 --> 00:15:02,132
facilitate all kinds of education and

273
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,577
research assistance. So this will be

274
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,497
really fun. And as Bleu mentioned,

275
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,572
we're hoping to release the written

276
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:11,777
paper and the tooling around this kind

277
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:14,342
of a pipeline which includes people

278
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,022
being able to submit papers in annotate

279
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:20,492
and update the information and then also

280
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,850
have a rendering output and

281
00:15:24,212 --> 00:15:25,757
hopefully we'll provide an update on

282
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,632
that soon. But it was a fun quarter for

283
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,417
this project. Any other comments

284
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:33,237
on knowledge engineering?

285
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:41,400
Okay, all right. In education

286
00:15:41,762 --> 00:15:44,557
we also had a great quarter,

287
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:48,242
ActInf Livestream. So the two

288
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:51,752
main series of live streams that we had

289
00:15:51,845 --> 00:15:55,162
this quarter, we had some guest dreams

290
00:15:55,312 --> 00:15:57,397
and we had our regular paper discussions

291
00:15:57,442 --> 00:16:00,947
live streams. So in the guest streams we

292
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,627
hae Parr Fatchen, Adam SAFRON, Shannon

293
00:16:04,657 --> 00:16:07,747
Proch, Anna Lemke, Maxwell Ramstead

294
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:11,717
and Dalton Sakthivadivel as well as just

295
00:16:11,765 --> 00:16:13,177
yesterday with professor Stephen

296
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:15,742
Grossberg. So a lot of awesome guest

297
00:16:15,802 --> 00:16:19,312
dreams, one off presentations

298
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:21,742
and discussions on active inference

299
00:16:21,802 --> 00:16:23,647
research really like core and cutting

300
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,447
edge work as well as work that might not

301
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,627
explicitly attention active inference

302
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:31,757
but is super consistent and of general

303
00:16:31,835 --> 00:16:34,007
interest. Like with Professor Lemke, it

304
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:39,752
was a great discussion on dopamine and

305
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:42,600
in the paper, Livestream number had

306
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:47,747
paper 414-243-4445

307
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,172
and 46 working my way through the

308
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:54,902
was on extended active inference, 42 was

309
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,252
on Robotic Inclination and the Slam

310
00:16:58,357 --> 00:17:00,912
Simultaneous Inclination and Mapping.

311
00:17:01,337 --> 00:17:04,177
43 was a theoretical and experimental

312
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:06,572
review related to predictive coding and

313
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:08,987
active it was a mathematical review

314
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,092
paper 44 was

315
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,852
Therapeutic Alliance Active Inference

316
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:16,832
Lab the Role of Therapeutic Touch and

317
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,307
there Bijan Tenant was really

318
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:21,197
instrumental in coordinating those

319
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,767
discussions and preparing, as was Sid in

320
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:28,022
42. In 45 we talked

321
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:30,187
about free energy principle made simpler

322
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:33,727
but not too simple where Karl Friston

323
00:17:33,757 --> 00:17:36,167
and Thomas Parr joined for those

324
00:17:36,215 --> 00:17:40,592
discussions and provided some great

325
00:17:40,715 --> 00:17:43,607
insights into this paper. And we had a

326
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,127
very cheerful time and there was a lot

327
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:48,697
of surprises and a lot of Bayesian

328
00:17:48,742 --> 00:17:50,777
Surprise too. And no, surprise and

329
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:52,607
Bayesian Surprise are not the same thing

330
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,032
as we've been discussing in the

331
00:17:54,035 --> 00:17:56,717
textbook. And then in the last two weeks

332
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:59,417
we've just completed Livestream number

333
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:02,617
46 on active models do not contradict

334
00:18:02,677 --> 00:18:05,312
folk psychology, which was great.

335
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,697
Brought in some new people into live

336
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,177
streaming, had some conversations of

337
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:13,327
broad interest related to folk

338
00:18:13,357 --> 00:18:16,667
psychology and just the way that the

339
00:18:16,715 --> 00:18:20,775
academic, the lived and the DAG to DAG

340
00:18:21,362 --> 00:18:24,167
perspectives on cognitive science and

341
00:18:24,215 --> 00:18:27,542
experience all come together and even

342
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,842
uncovered some of the adjacencies there

343
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:33,467
that go into philosophical and even

344
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:37,292
biological angles. So awesome live

345
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,597
streams by everyone who had joined.

346
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:44,327
And yes, a lot of learning

347
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:47,902
happening within these streams.

348
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:51,347
Any other comments or things that people

349
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,077
want to know? Particularly fun stream

350
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:55,137
that they watched or joined?

351
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:00,722
I had so much fun in 45.1,

352
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:02,852
like, where I was deferred to as like,

353
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,342
the expert on the paper. It's really

354
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,347
funny. Like Carl's, like, well, Bleu,

355
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:11,250
what do you think? Okay,

356
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:14,262
that was really like, amusing. And cue.

357
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,717
Yeah, it was really a memorable

358
00:19:16,777 --> 00:19:20,552
experience was beginning 45 one,

359
00:19:20,645 --> 00:19:23,417
I think. And when we hit start

360
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:25,367
streaming, Bleu and I were the only

361
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:29,492
people in the chat and we didn't have

362
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,947
confirmation that anyone else would

363
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,927
join. So we just trusted

364
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:38,192
the plan and had authors join quickly.

365
00:19:38,315 --> 00:19:41,937
And so it was very rapid

366
00:19:42,287 --> 00:19:45,497
reduction of uncertainty and yes, as

367
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,777
tradition dictates the authors passing

368
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:52,892
to us. And it's that kind of like

369
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,325
participatory engagement where

370
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,075
even though they wrote the paper,

371
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:03,602
the expertise and the perspectives are

372
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,832
still very attributes and hopefully it's

373
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:10,697
striking a new and productive and

374
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,507
also value align way to talk about.

375
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,552
Research and to continue to develop

376
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:20,017
research after artifacts are published

377
00:20:20,077 --> 00:20:23,775
in advance of other artifacts and just

378
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:27,367
hope that we can continue to integrate

379
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,282
in these discussions as like, the tip of

380
00:20:29,285 --> 00:20:33,292
the iceberg, the best of all worlds.

381
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:36,527
In terms of having the rigor and the

382
00:20:36,545 --> 00:20:39,197
clarity and the conciseness where and as

383
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,752
we need it, and also holding space for

384
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,497
everything from basic questions, things

385
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,562
that might not initially seem related,

386
00:20:49,337 --> 00:20:52,022
everything in between. So any other

387
00:20:52,055 --> 00:20:54,462
comments on live streams?

388
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,675
All right, we didn't talk about this

389
00:21:04,812 --> 00:21:07,900
in the last quarterly lab meeting, but

390
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:11,455
this was a paper from March 1,

391
00:21:11,502 --> 00:21:14,575
2022. The authors were

392
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:18,015
myself, Sean Appliquetz watson Arhan

393
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:21,160
chaudhary RJ. Coda shadi l.

394
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:23,485
Damati Abel a k.

395
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:27,112
Serval Bleu here. Yvonne here.

396
00:21:27,475 --> 00:21:31,230
Sid. Sid. Code Amit Singh.

397
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,605
Madameth Jacob. Here. Caleb.

398
00:21:34,665 --> 00:21:38,140
Tuttle and Alex. Here. So a bunch of

399
00:21:38,157 --> 00:21:40,395
us and a bunch of other colleagues.

400
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,125
We had a great time working on this

401
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:48,195
paper. And what we did was we evaluated

402
00:21:48,285 --> 00:21:51,235
web three and blockchain technology in

403
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:54,280
relationship to the emergence area of

404
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:57,050
decentralized science, DCM.

405
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,880
We also explored some opportunities for

406
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:02,685
where active inference could interface

407
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:06,105
with DCM in theory and in practice

408
00:22:06,165 --> 00:22:09,175
as well. And that highlighted some

409
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:13,050
important conversations around DSI

410
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,165
in its technological aspects. What kind

411
00:22:16,182 --> 00:22:18,415
of technology is composing or moving the

412
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:21,685
frontier of DCM in 2022 and

413
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:24,190
then more in principle, what does it

414
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:26,145
mean for science to be decentralized?

415
00:22:26,235 --> 00:22:28,765
Decentralized in what way? Wasn't it

416
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:30,715
always decentralized? What kinds of

417
00:22:30,732 --> 00:22:34,660
failure modes across multiple scales do

418
00:22:34,692 --> 00:22:37,465
decentralized systems present themselves

419
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:40,360
with? So we in the first part of this

420
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,710
paper evaluated decentralized science

421
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:47,115
DCM and just covered some historical

422
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,020
threads that a lot of the coauthors just

423
00:22:50,097 --> 00:22:53,665
shared amazing views on. We then

424
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,440
presented an Active Entity Biology for

425
00:22:56,457 --> 00:23:00,015
Science or AOS and presented

426
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,860
it in Coda of tables, but we'll talk

427
00:23:02,892 --> 00:23:04,315
more about how we're continuing to

428
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:07,015
develop it. It is a composable and

429
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:10,590
versionable modeling system that uses

430
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,810
the active inference entity partition

431
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,350
with the blankets and the same ontology

432
00:23:16,425 --> 00:23:17,925
terms that we would use to describe

433
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,110
particular entities partitioned states

434
00:23:20,217 --> 00:23:22,930
like affordances and policies and so on.

435
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:26,220
And separated types of entities

436
00:23:26,385 --> 00:23:28,695
into two main types active entities,

437
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,275
which are like adaptive active entities

438
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,160
that are able to undertake actions and

439
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:36,060
modify their niche and informational

440
00:23:36,105 --> 00:23:38,985
entities, which are also partitioned

441
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,535
entities but do not engage in action

442
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,530
selection. So, like a PDF of a paper,

443
00:23:44,652 --> 00:23:46,495
it's an informational entity, it's in

444
00:23:46,497 --> 00:23:48,700
the epistemic niche, but it's not taking

445
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,840
actions. Whereas active entities ranging

446
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,165
from humans or programs as well

447
00:23:55,182 --> 00:23:57,085
as organizational institutional type

448
00:23:57,117 --> 00:23:59,530
entities across multiple scales are

449
00:23:59,577 --> 00:24:01,935
engaging in communication and actions

450
00:24:02,055 --> 00:24:04,625
around their epistemic niche.

451
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:10,240
That is providing a foundation and a

452
00:24:10,257 --> 00:24:13,105
grounding for continued discussions that

453
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,385
we're having about how to bring

454
00:24:15,492 --> 00:24:18,840
integrity and continuity amongst natural

455
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,955
language representations, visual

456
00:24:21,015 --> 00:24:23,455
representations, and simulation type

457
00:24:23,502 --> 00:24:26,890
representations of complex digital and

458
00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:29,740
cyber physical systems. So would any of

459
00:24:29,757 --> 00:24:33,010
the other authors like to share, like

460
00:24:33,192 --> 00:24:36,175
anything that I missed or one part about

461
00:24:36,237 --> 00:24:39,385
this paper that they found useful or

462
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:40,987
interesting to work on?

463
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:53,960
So I'll share. I thought this paper was

464
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,260
interesting because there was a or there

465
00:24:57,292 --> 00:25:00,200
is quite a bit of tension between

466
00:25:00,337 --> 00:25:04,180
decentralization in terms of distributed

467
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,330
effort and labor and also DCM as

468
00:25:08,527 --> 00:25:13,085
a market based entity or idea.

469
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:17,480
And so resolving these two

470
00:25:17,527 --> 00:25:19,340
things or like the tension and

471
00:25:19,357 --> 00:25:21,815
juxtaposition of what is decided, is it

472
00:25:21,832 --> 00:25:24,737
just the distribution of knowledge and

473
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,095
resources or is it more based on markets

474
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,670
and blockchain? I think that was one of

475
00:25:31,672 --> 00:25:33,785
the key insights brought upon by this

476
00:25:33,817 --> 00:25:37,355
paper. Yes.

477
00:25:37,552 --> 00:25:40,715
And hopefully we'll have more spaces and

478
00:25:40,732 --> 00:25:42,740
time to explore and draw out some of

479
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:44,365
these threads, maybe even a guest stream

480
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:48,185
with these authors. But what

481
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:50,015
is today known as Web Three and

482
00:25:50,032 --> 00:25:53,360
blockchain is developing and growing out

483
00:25:53,392 --> 00:25:55,412
of and beyond financial technology.

484
00:25:56,075 --> 00:25:58,715
And perhaps there's a sense of an

485
00:25:58,732 --> 00:26:01,385
agreement in which financial technology

486
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:03,640
are some of the sinews and connective

487
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,220
tissues by which science occurs,

488
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:11,020
like value and financial action

489
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,810
occur in scientific and epistemic

490
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:17,030
ecosystems. But is that the common

491
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,480
denominator? Will we be financial

492
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,785
reductionists with respect to how we

493
00:26:21,817 --> 00:26:25,310
model, for example, motivation and all

494
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:28,490
these types of cognitive features in

495
00:26:28,582 --> 00:26:32,180
epistemic ecosystems? At the same

496
00:26:32,227 --> 00:26:35,765
time, there's many features of

497
00:26:35,932 --> 00:26:38,465
blockchain systems that make them a

498
00:26:38,482 --> 00:26:41,687
natural fit for scientific information.

499
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:45,200
So it's an ongoing discussion, and

500
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:48,860
hopefully those with interest in DCM or

501
00:26:48,892 --> 00:26:51,580
in these kinds of technologies overall

502
00:26:51,715 --> 00:26:54,955
will just stay tuned and get involved

503
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:57,505
because we're just beginning this avenue

504
00:26:57,565 --> 00:27:00,635
of development. Okay, any comments here?

505
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:01,712
Or we'll continue.

506
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,380
Okay, next we'll talk about some

507
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,465
research and applications. We'll talk

508
00:27:11,482 --> 00:27:13,490
about the active Block Force project.

509
00:27:13,657 --> 00:27:15,935
So, Jacob, do you want to provide a

510
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:18,375
little summary of active blockfronts?

511
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:23,162
Yeah. So active Blockchains is

512
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,355
foraging progress Python package that

513
00:27:28,477 --> 00:27:32,395
concepts the recent

514
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,675
new library for modeling

515
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:40,685
agent with active inference called

516
00:27:40,717 --> 00:27:43,925
Time DP, and another library called

517
00:27:43,987 --> 00:27:47,905
Catcat, which is used a lot in economic

518
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:50,690
and complex system simulations. So

519
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:53,345
Active Ballard is right now a

520
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,315
combination of the two where active

521
00:27:55,345 --> 00:27:59,675
imprint agents are

522
00:27:59,737 --> 00:28:04,562
modeled within Catcad and

523
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,715
currently still very much work in

524
00:28:07,732 --> 00:28:11,765
progress. The overall structure of the

525
00:28:11,782 --> 00:28:14,390
package is still being developed, and

526
00:28:14,482 --> 00:28:20,485
we're working on polishing

527
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,565
the implementation of Time DP and

528
00:28:22,582 --> 00:28:25,855
tailoring it more towards the Catcat

529
00:28:25,915 --> 00:28:28,580
style of development and also working on

530
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:32,335
problems how to increase

531
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,060
the complexity of the models with like,

532
00:28:35,092 --> 00:28:37,040
multiagine modeling or different

533
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,175
constraints.

534
00:28:40,475 --> 00:28:43,780
Thanks. So Pymdp, just for context,

535
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,570
is a Python package that

536
00:28:47,647 --> 00:28:50,555
has recently been developed, and it

537
00:28:50,602 --> 00:28:54,055
provides a very simplified

538
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,035
foothold for Python programming to be

539
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:58,990
implementing the kinds of Markov

540
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,255
decision processes that's MDP that are

541
00:29:02,302 --> 00:29:05,065
used in some formulations of active

542
00:29:05,095 --> 00:29:08,485
inference. And so it's an incredibly

543
00:29:08,605 --> 00:29:11,870
important package to use. And also

544
00:29:11,947 --> 00:29:14,495
there are some other features that are

545
00:29:14,572 --> 00:29:17,550
requisite to use for systems engineering

546
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,390
for the kinds of generative models and

547
00:29:20,407 --> 00:29:22,190
generative process that we might want to

548
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:25,465
implement in real applied active

549
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:27,020
coherence settings. For example,

550
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:29,735
parameter brain architectures and being

551
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:32,675
able to specify execution orders and

552
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,730
have some reproducibility around certain

553
00:29:34,777 --> 00:29:37,090
kinds of simulations, various features

554
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,785
that the CAD CAD framework provides for.

555
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:41,960
So as Jakob mentioned at the very

556
00:29:41,992 --> 00:29:45,065
beginning, the multiagent case is quite

557
00:29:45,157 --> 00:29:48,825
interesting. Like, does each entity

558
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,455
perceive and then act and then we

559
00:29:51,502 --> 00:29:53,405
cascade through them in the same order,

560
00:29:53,452 --> 00:29:56,012
different order, or is there some other

561
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,865
structures and execution orders? How

562
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:01,465
does that influence active inference

563
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:04,700
simulations? With Metamath, I've been

564
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:06,335
continuing to work on the next

565
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:09,220
generative model, the active infraant

566
00:30:09,385 --> 00:30:11,675
Colony implication, so I hope to share

567
00:30:11,737 --> 00:30:14,390
more specifics when we have it. But this

568
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:17,285
is a continuation of the work that was

569
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:21,450
done in 2021 with several colleagues.

570
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:24,835
We're working on various other aspects

571
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,725
of the package, and this last one here

572
00:30:27,862 --> 00:30:29,780
connecting to Ethereum or other Web

573
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:32,735
three ecosystems. So just to kind of

574
00:30:32,842 --> 00:30:34,985
hinge on that and Clark into the next

575
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:39,137
slide. For the Active Blueprint project,

576
00:30:39,725 --> 00:30:42,110
there was an Ecosystem Support Program

577
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:44,185
grant available from the Ethereum

578
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:47,560
Foundation, and we proposed in a grant

579
00:30:47,605 --> 00:30:50,875
application about a month ago to expand

580
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,990
our current simulations into multi agent

581
00:30:54,082 --> 00:30:56,485
setting in order to explore cognition

582
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,870
and behavior underlying DCM and D five

583
00:30:59,947 --> 00:31:02,915
projects. The grant was not funded, so

584
00:31:02,932 --> 00:31:05,720
the foraging continuum but it was a

585
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:09,340
great learning experience and it helped

586
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,850
us sharpen and elaborate

587
00:31:12,925 --> 00:31:15,620
on everything from the substance of the

588
00:31:15,697 --> 00:31:17,620
package itself to the Communications

589
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,735
around it, and have preliminary

590
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,895
discussions on how do we balance in a

591
00:31:22,897 --> 00:31:26,665
distributed team, retroactive funding,

592
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,012
proactive funding, and so on.

593
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,415
Specifically, we were proposing to

594
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:34,010
develop multi agent ant, some case

595
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:36,275
studies and digital twins that already

596
00:31:36,337 --> 00:31:38,575
exist in the ethereum ecosystem,

597
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:43,040
porting those over into Active

598
00:31:43,057 --> 00:31:46,640
coherence lab framework and

599
00:31:46,732 --> 00:31:50,090
helping characterize scenarios and

600
00:31:50,107 --> 00:31:52,460
phenomena that had previously been only

601
00:31:52,492 --> 00:31:54,895
approached from a top down, essentially

602
00:31:54,985 --> 00:31:58,360
macroeconomic type of simulation.

603
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,055
Like if the interest rate is this amount

604
00:32:01,177 --> 00:32:03,320
and this is the other parameter on this

605
00:32:03,397 --> 00:32:06,440
macro, then here's how the system will

606
00:32:06,532 --> 00:32:10,340
evolve. Trying to coherent that with a

607
00:32:10,432 --> 00:32:13,435
bottom up cognitive entity decision

608
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,295
making framework that could be used in a

609
00:32:16,297 --> 00:32:18,535
lot of interesting ways. Specifically,

610
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,090
we were interested about the

611
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:22,130
possibility, and still are, of

612
00:32:22,177 --> 00:32:24,325
performing these kinds of cognitive

613
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,350
audits, which is a terminology used in

614
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:30,010
various artificial intelligence Fields.

615
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,912
But a cognitive audit could provide

616
00:32:33,425 --> 00:32:36,035
insights into if potentially there was

617
00:32:36,142 --> 00:32:39,685
some smart contract or series of cyber

618
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,215
physical relationships where from a

619
00:32:42,232 --> 00:32:44,090
computer security or network security

620
00:32:44,182 --> 00:32:47,035
perspective, it was airtight.

621
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:50,290
However, in the cognitive niche,

622
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,650
perhaps there were destabilizing forces

623
00:32:53,725 --> 00:32:56,440
or dynamics. And although it wouldn't

624
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,775
have been part of our initial work, we

625
00:32:58,837 --> 00:33:01,180
hope to eventually include cognitive

626
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,990
features even like for example,

627
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:05,300
narrative and sentiment, such that

628
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:07,465
different kinds of information, natural

629
00:33:07,495 --> 00:33:10,010
language, reading and writing, all these

630
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:12,175
kinds of features of real cognitive

631
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:15,980
systems could be integrated into these

632
00:33:16,102 --> 00:33:19,350
increasingly actionable and coherent

633
00:33:20,075 --> 00:33:23,615
digital twin type simulations. So if

634
00:33:23,632 --> 00:33:26,060
anybody is interested to get more

635
00:33:26,092 --> 00:33:28,280
involved in Active blockprints, whether

636
00:33:28,327 --> 00:33:30,325
they have familiarity with Python,

637
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,515
Cadcad Academy, all or none of the

638
00:33:33,532 --> 00:33:36,035
above, everybody is welcome to get

639
00:33:36,067 --> 00:33:38,150
involved. And also, if anyone has

640
00:33:38,212 --> 00:33:41,855
insights into how such a project might

641
00:33:41,902 --> 00:33:44,810
receive some funding, we're also open to

642
00:33:44,842 --> 00:33:47,300
those thoughts. Anything else on the

643
00:33:47,362 --> 00:33:48,437
grant application?

644
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,865
Okay, we on the engagement and outreach

645
00:33:58,045 --> 00:34:00,600
frontier continuum,

646
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,140
connecting with new and returning

647
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,060
participants on different platforms. We

648
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:12,445
saw growth across our Discord Twitter

649
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:16,487
podcast channel and YouTube channel,

650
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:20,687
so it was a good

651
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,400
quarter of activity on these fronts.

652
00:34:24,475 --> 00:34:27,125
And of course, always feel free to share

653
00:34:27,187 --> 00:34:30,635
our public information or invite other

654
00:34:30,817 --> 00:34:33,110
people who you think might want to get

655
00:34:33,142 --> 00:34:35,855
involved. But we continue with the work.

656
00:34:35,902 --> 00:34:38,915
And these are our Active states in the

657
00:34:38,932 --> 00:34:42,940
epistemic niche. Any funny

658
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:46,200
tweets, any memorable emojis?

659
00:34:49,475 --> 00:34:53,515
Okay? And then closing

660
00:34:53,545 --> 00:34:57,040
out the project updates on the staying

661
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,265
on the engagement in outreach theme,

662
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:04,685
we have some directions that

663
00:35:04,717 --> 00:35:06,980
are coalescing relating to the

664
00:35:07,027 --> 00:35:10,487
engagement and outreach at Active. So

665
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:13,480
first we are developing an internship

666
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,565
program that will share more details on,

667
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:19,255
but will provide a much more scaffolded

668
00:35:19,315 --> 00:35:22,280
project specific way for individuals who

669
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:25,055
want to on ramp into the lab or to step

670
00:35:25,102 --> 00:35:28,130
up their activity and learn by doing

671
00:35:28,177 --> 00:35:31,040
that way. We've written some letters of

672
00:35:31,057 --> 00:35:33,895
support for applications at university

673
00:35:33,985 --> 00:35:36,485
programs with more information. Should

674
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:40,105
these applications of our colleagues

675
00:35:40,165 --> 00:35:43,610
be accepted? We believe that this kind

676
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,570
of institution to institution

677
00:35:46,735 --> 00:35:50,320
partnership is going to be, there's

678
00:35:50,335 --> 00:35:51,980
going to be a lot of affordances for win

679
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:54,755
win opportunities with different

680
00:35:54,802 --> 00:35:56,945
institutions reaching out to active lab

681
00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:59,615
and having a relationship where we can

682
00:35:59,632 --> 00:36:03,635
each contribute what we can do and be

683
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:05,765
part of some joint action and

684
00:36:05,782 --> 00:36:08,930
generalized synchrony. And also

685
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:12,620
especially through the relentless work

686
00:36:12,772 --> 00:36:16,105
of Dave Douglas, we've been improving

687
00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:19,975
our subtitles and language translation

688
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:22,445
progress which we'll talk more about.

689
00:36:22,522 --> 00:36:25,450
But language translation includes math.

690
00:36:25,525 --> 00:36:28,660
So just at this first pass it's raising

691
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,630
attention to the way in which whether

692
00:36:32,677 --> 00:36:36,005
it's audio content or textual content or

693
00:36:36,052 --> 00:36:37,805
morphing in between with speech to text

694
00:36:37,852 --> 00:36:40,835
and TextToSpeech annotation and

695
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:43,885
translation is the basis of rigorous

696
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,925
scholarship as well as accessible

697
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,755
information. So making sure that

698
00:36:48,877 --> 00:36:51,815
whatever the initial artifact is that it

699
00:36:51,832 --> 00:36:54,455
can be consumed and enjoyed in the

700
00:36:54,502 --> 00:36:56,725
sensory modality that's most accessible

701
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,800
to a given person and translated into

702
00:37:00,862 --> 00:37:03,070
the natural language, computer languages

703
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,585
and so on that are most familiar to

704
00:37:05,617 --> 00:37:07,610
somebody, again, also helps with

705
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,085
accessibility and rigor. So just like we

706
00:37:10,117 --> 00:37:11,960
looked at with a textbook group, with

707
00:37:11,992 --> 00:37:14,630
the math as a language truly being

708
00:37:14,677 --> 00:37:17,810
translated into natural language, using

709
00:37:17,842 --> 00:37:20,305
ontology terms that will facilitate

710
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:21,755
translations amongst different

711
00:37:21,802 --> 00:37:24,590
languages, that will just make sure that

712
00:37:24,682 --> 00:37:27,725
from the first step to the 99th step

713
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:29,515
of learning and applying active

714
00:37:29,545 --> 00:37:32,240
inference that it's really coherent and

715
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:35,720
a comprehensive experience. So really

716
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:38,560
awesome directions. And if anyone sees

717
00:37:38,605 --> 00:37:42,160
opportunities to join in engagement

718
00:37:42,205 --> 00:37:44,855
and outreach with us, of course, please

719
00:37:44,902 --> 00:37:47,312
feel free to just contact us.

720
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,460
Any other comments on project updates on

721
00:37:52,492 --> 00:37:53,625
this action?

722
00:38:00,387 --> 00:38:04,017
Okay, so the next section of this lab

723
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:06,297
meeting will be about the next steps at

724
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,837
the project scale,

725
00:38:09,612 --> 00:38:11,575
starting with the theme of education.

726
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:15,897
As mentioned, we are completing the

727
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:19,022
first cohort first part of the active

728
00:38:19,067 --> 00:38:22,422
textbook group. After Cohort Hae,

729
00:38:22,455 --> 00:38:24,617
Park One will finish up through Chapter

730
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,537
Five. In the end of July we're going to

731
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,342
take August off and then we are going to

732
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,187
pick back up with two parallel cohorts.

733
00:38:34,337 --> 00:38:36,942
There's going to be cohort one

734
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,447
continuing on with part two of the

735
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,687
textbook so that those first Conor can

736
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,892
finish the textbook, at least a first

737
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,852
pass on it during 2022. We will

738
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:52,692
then also begin cohort two of part

739
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,792
one. So these will be a totally new

740
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,922
batch of people who are coming in and

741
00:38:56,955 --> 00:39:00,747
starting on chapter one and people

742
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:03,582
from cohort one who want to just take a

743
00:39:03,585 --> 00:39:07,107
second pass. I think we all do

744
00:39:07,185 --> 00:39:09,377
in a sense. Whether we take the plunge

745
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:11,382
to be in cohort two or not is a

746
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:13,707
different question. But all these

747
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,702
materials are the kinds of things that

748
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,042
we can just get many coats of, paint on

749
00:39:18,165 --> 00:39:20,050
and learn and read again and again.

750
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:22,887
We're really excited for this second

751
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,007
cohort because we'll be incorporating a

752
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,702
lot of what we're learning from the

753
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,897
first Conor into how we proceed with

754
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:34,002
this second cohort as well as

755
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,487
with part two in the first cohort.

756
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:39,657
And hopefully this is just the first few

757
00:39:39,735 --> 00:39:42,332
of many, many textbook group cohorts

758
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:45,147
because it provides a very accessible on

759
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,582
ramp into learning and applying active

760
00:39:47,597 --> 00:39:50,367
coherence. The textbook is written with

761
00:39:50,415 --> 00:39:52,497
that kind of learning and applying in

762
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:55,922
mind and hopefully these textbook

763
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:58,392
groups are providing a service that

764
00:39:58,515 --> 00:40:02,112
makes that onramp even smoother and more

765
00:40:02,175 --> 00:40:05,142
fun and with more image memes and with

766
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,942
more connecting the dots and more

767
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,927
exercises to test more opportunities to

768
00:40:09,945 --> 00:40:13,602
ask questions. And I'll put the

769
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,652
link in the YouTube chat for registering

770
00:40:16,682 --> 00:40:19,337
to participate in an upcoming cohort.

771
00:40:19,412 --> 00:40:21,237
Does anyone else want to add anything

772
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,077
about this next steps on the textbook

773
00:40:24,107 --> 00:40:24,700
group?

774
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,975
Just that it's a great opportunity to

775
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:32,535
get involved if you ant to learn more

776
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:35,165
about active coherence or even if you're

777
00:40:35,195 --> 00:40:36,810
starting at ground zero. We've had some

778
00:40:36,842 --> 00:40:39,240
people come in with no idea about the

779
00:40:39,257 --> 00:40:43,140
math and yeah it's been I think really

780
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,810
useful to work with everyone from all

781
00:40:45,842 --> 00:40:48,465
levels to kind of try to make this field

782
00:40:48,557 --> 00:40:50,262
more accessible for you.

783
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:55,025
Awesome. Okay.

784
00:40:56,137 --> 00:40:59,687
Also on the education theme

785
00:41:00,487 --> 00:41:03,757
as suggested in some of the

786
00:41:03,835 --> 00:41:07,102
updates we're learning a lot from the

787
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,942
textbook group and other educational

788
00:41:10,002 --> 00:41:12,862
projects that are occurring in the lab

789
00:41:12,925 --> 00:41:14,487
like the active inference ontology

790
00:41:14,562 --> 00:41:18,367
development and livestreams and with

791
00:41:18,415 --> 00:41:20,712
education and research as our mission

792
00:41:20,787 --> 00:41:22,567
we've always been interested in

793
00:41:22,615 --> 00:41:25,542
developing some active inference courses

794
00:41:25,602 --> 00:41:27,587
and educational experiences.

795
00:41:29,437 --> 00:41:31,012
Alex, do you want to provide some

796
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:34,400
updates on how we'll be continuing here?

797
00:41:39,037 --> 00:41:40,100
Yeah, thanks.

798
00:41:41,962 --> 00:41:45,052
This activity on creating online course

799
00:41:45,145 --> 00:41:49,657
is also many hours learning

800
00:41:49,735 --> 00:41:52,947
by doing force our own for creating

801
00:41:52,992 --> 00:41:55,117
courses because we understand that for

802
00:41:55,165 --> 00:41:58,002
different audiences different courses

803
00:41:58,107 --> 00:42:01,267
need to be created and finally we should

804
00:42:01,315 --> 00:42:05,332
have like a bunch of different ones

805
00:42:05,485 --> 00:42:09,517
and this introductory course

806
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,372
will be and example of organizing the

807
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:17,247
team of different educational roles

808
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,687
which understand the needed to take part

809
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:22,775
of creating course which should be

810
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:27,667
quality, have quality and have

811
00:42:27,715 --> 00:42:31,342
accessibility and so on. That's why

812
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,552
based on experience and materials and

813
00:42:34,645 --> 00:42:38,727
results of textbook group including

814
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:41,892
and developing different types of cases

815
00:42:41,952 --> 00:42:45,187
and examples into online form which

816
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:49,462
can be supported by online platform

817
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,927
which we'll be using from Systems

818
00:42:51,957 --> 00:42:54,907
Management School it will be the first

819
00:42:54,985 --> 00:42:58,522
step to broad set

820
00:42:58,555 --> 00:43:01,792
of educational materials for any

821
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,017
new people who will start to learn

822
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:09,202
active coherence and we will create

823
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,525
courses and improve it.

824
00:43:13,762 --> 00:43:17,225
Improved set of courses to make it

825
00:43:17,587 --> 00:43:20,197
accessible to as much people as

826
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:24,425
possible. Yes, in the

827
00:43:25,462 --> 00:43:29,737
long arc of education and

828
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,925
even just active inference education.

829
00:43:32,512 --> 00:43:35,167
This is a modified curio card.

830
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:38,872
Yes, I right click saved it and now on

831
00:43:38,905 --> 00:43:41,302
the top of this pile of books is the

832
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,447
active inference textbook and it's just

833
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,452
reflecting like one more epistemic niche

834
00:43:46,482 --> 00:43:50,377
modification and it is coming

835
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:53,662
after of course many papers and also

836
00:43:53,725 --> 00:43:55,977
other kinds of educational materials

837
00:43:56,007 --> 00:43:58,297
that have been prepared foraging from

838
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:00,922
short form workshops. That have been

839
00:44:00,955 --> 00:44:04,867
held in different locations to blogs and

840
00:44:04,915 --> 00:44:07,552
GitHub repositories like famously ant

841
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:10,137
Beren Millidge of just informative

842
00:44:10,212 --> 00:44:12,652
links. And those are all very important

843
00:44:12,745 --> 00:44:15,442
educational formats. However,

844
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,427
there is nothing like an active

845
00:44:17,457 --> 00:44:21,337
inference course. And for a course to be

846
00:44:21,475 --> 00:44:25,252
done right and versioned in our

847
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,792
attention situation and with

848
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,077
our conceptual focus on active

849
00:44:31,107 --> 00:44:34,222
inference, it's quite a challenge. But

850
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,112
there's also an amazing opportunity

851
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:39,682
here. So for those who would like to be

852
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,562
learning more about how to participate,

853
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:45,487
this is one way to be getting

854
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,862
involved at some stage with a team

855
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,892
or with feedback on the initial course.

856
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,697
Or of course, just as with the textbook

857
00:44:53,742 --> 00:44:57,052
group, the early cohorts who cocreate in

858
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:00,232
this participatory way. So this is super

859
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:03,232
exciting. And also we've had a lot of

860
00:45:03,385 --> 00:45:06,162
great contributions from participants

861
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:09,237
from Dean Jessica Brock,

862
00:45:09,312 --> 00:45:11,952
so many others who've added and helped

863
00:45:11,982 --> 00:45:15,847
us build a lot of like

864
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:19,887
a garage of spare parts and motifs

865
00:45:19,962 --> 00:45:23,697
and conversation that when we formalize

866
00:45:23,742 --> 00:45:26,302
the course, team will be able to be

867
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,912
taken into account and implemented.

868
00:45:31,237 --> 00:45:35,122
Okay. Alright.

869
00:45:35,305 --> 00:45:38,802
On the education theme as well, let's

870
00:45:38,832 --> 00:45:42,972
talk about the systems thinking summer

871
00:45:43,017 --> 00:45:45,622
intensive. Yvonne or Alex, want to

872
00:45:45,655 --> 00:45:47,707
describe what will be happening in

873
00:45:47,785 --> 00:45:49,325
August 22?

874
00:45:52,462 --> 00:45:56,302
Yes, in August we will launch a

875
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,832
branch active States Thinking course and

876
00:46:00,985 --> 00:46:05,542
it will unpack the

877
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:08,527
base concepts of the system. One of the

878
00:46:08,545 --> 00:46:10,902
base concepts system thinking, It's

879
00:46:10,932 --> 00:46:14,975
roles and role based

880
00:46:15,562 --> 00:46:16,712
descriptions.

881
00:46:20,362 --> 00:46:23,872
For four weeks we

882
00:46:23,905 --> 00:46:27,457
will define what the roles are,

883
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:31,625
how we can use it to have

884
00:46:32,212 --> 00:46:37,447
common meaning with how

885
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:41,677
we can see different things in

886
00:46:41,845 --> 00:46:44,150
a way to understand each other.

887
00:46:45,112 --> 00:46:47,675
Yeah, that's it.

888
00:46:50,287 --> 00:46:52,400
Great. Alex, anything?

889
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:06,645
Okay. All right. So in

890
00:47:06,722 --> 00:47:09,765
educational activities, we are

891
00:47:09,857 --> 00:47:12,905
announcing some of the early sketching

892
00:47:12,965 --> 00:47:16,230
around the internship program, which

893
00:47:16,352 --> 00:47:19,535
perhaps by any other name would it smell

894
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,635
so sweet. It's really like a learning by

895
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:26,640
doing scaffolded affordance. It is a

896
00:47:26,807 --> 00:47:29,735
selfdriven opportunity for individuals

897
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:33,110
of all ages, entorhinal states,

898
00:47:33,305 --> 00:47:36,825
backgrounds, etc. To engage in personal

899
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:38,715
learning and development that will be

900
00:47:38,807 --> 00:47:42,225
related in a large part to project based

901
00:47:42,287 --> 00:47:46,005
contributions to ActInf lab. So it'll be

902
00:47:46,202 --> 00:47:48,885
win win. You'll be learning by doing and

903
00:47:48,917 --> 00:47:51,360
contributing to the lab as well and

904
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:56,415
helping projects develop the

905
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,150
duration and time commitment. We're

906
00:47:59,225 --> 00:48:01,740
figuring out some details, but will be

907
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:03,465
able to make it work for people who want

908
00:48:03,482 --> 00:48:05,640
to be involved. We'll find a way to make

909
00:48:05,657 --> 00:48:08,870
it happen. For those who engage

910
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,795
in this type of internship,

911
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,990
beyond the priceless value of

912
00:48:16,082 --> 00:48:20,055
learning and development and being

913
00:48:20,102 --> 00:48:23,240
on the trajectory of active inference,

914
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:26,112
serving the lab can also offer

915
00:48:26,475 --> 00:48:28,035
everything from letters of

916
00:48:28,067 --> 00:48:29,910
recommendation and evidence and

917
00:48:29,942 --> 00:48:33,270
mentorship, as well as increased access

918
00:48:33,347 --> 00:48:35,835
to the digital research architectures of

919
00:48:35,867 --> 00:48:39,945
the lab. And we also hope to provide

920
00:48:40,022 --> 00:48:43,430
more affordances as we gain resources

921
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:47,625
and organizational complexity. And these

922
00:48:47,762 --> 00:48:50,010
internships will be centered around a

923
00:48:50,042 --> 00:48:52,725
target project, although there will also

924
00:48:52,787 --> 00:48:55,740
be curriculum of the internship that is

925
00:48:55,757 --> 00:48:58,662
not related to a project like related to

926
00:48:59,475 --> 00:49:02,190
watching live streams or engaging in the

927
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,965
textbook group cohorts. But a lot of the

928
00:49:04,982 --> 00:49:07,440
contribution will be focused on a

929
00:49:07,457 --> 00:49:10,230
project that will be carried out in a

930
00:49:10,352 --> 00:49:12,960
structured way, so it'll provide again

931
00:49:13,067 --> 00:49:15,165
great opportunities for people who have

932
00:49:15,257 --> 00:49:16,965
skills that they would like to apply,

933
00:49:17,132 --> 00:49:19,725
skills they'd like to learn. For now,

934
00:49:19,787 --> 00:49:21,780
the best way to learn more about this

935
00:49:21,827 --> 00:49:25,095
internship, whether you're interested or

936
00:49:25,172 --> 00:49:26,985
whether you know of somebody who might

937
00:49:27,017 --> 00:49:30,210
like to maybe get involved, would be

938
00:49:30,242 --> 00:49:31,785
to contact us, active

939
00:49:31,817 --> 00:49:35,670
coherence@gmail.com and or to

940
00:49:35,747 --> 00:49:37,910
register for the systems thinking summer

941
00:49:37,955 --> 00:49:40,635
intensive, because these projects will

942
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:42,360
have role based approaches to

943
00:49:42,392 --> 00:49:45,605
participating. So the Summer intensive

944
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:48,480
is a couple weeks long, couple of hours

945
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,087
per week, and it will provide a nice

946
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:54,290
warm up for getting involved in a role

947
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,737
based internship program.

948
00:49:57,825 --> 00:49:59,637
Okay, any other thoughts here?

949
00:50:04,837 --> 00:50:08,352
Okay, also in our next steps,

950
00:50:08,532 --> 00:50:11,727
we are expanding and scaling the active

951
00:50:11,757 --> 00:50:15,202
inference journal. So this is again

952
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:18,397
work with several participants and

953
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:23,162
especially Dave. We've been preparing

954
00:50:24,112 --> 00:50:27,322
a sequence of work and practices and

955
00:50:27,355 --> 00:50:31,092
roles so that for our past catalog

956
00:50:31,227 --> 00:50:34,302
of live streams and other presentations

957
00:50:34,482 --> 00:50:37,987
and going forward we will be able to

958
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:41,122
have a effective and automatable and

959
00:50:41,155 --> 00:50:43,632
also just documentable. And reproducible

960
00:50:43,797 --> 00:50:47,922
approach for preparing the transcript

961
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:52,362
of a speech event into an edited,

962
00:50:52,437 --> 00:50:55,122
curated format that can then be rendered

963
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:58,392
into, on one hand, a prose based format

964
00:50:58,527 --> 00:51:01,092
which can be published for indexing,

965
00:51:01,152 --> 00:51:03,322
citing and searching and on the other

966
00:51:03,355 --> 00:51:06,892
hand, into a subtitle format that will

967
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,597
facilitate accessibility of the videos

968
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,497
and also that can all be translated

969
00:51:13,542 --> 00:51:16,792
across different languages. So it'll be

970
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,782
really exciting to really nail down

971
00:51:20,935 --> 00:51:24,472
our practices and ways of working

972
00:51:24,655 --> 00:51:27,787
such that within several days,

973
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:29,922
potentially after a live stream

974
00:51:29,967 --> 00:51:33,367
occurring, we could publish a very high

975
00:51:33,415 --> 00:51:36,812
quality annotated artifact

976
00:51:37,162 --> 00:51:39,802
that could leverage the impact of a lot

977
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,292
of these very important conversations

978
00:51:41,352 --> 00:51:46,237
that are happening and anything

979
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,512
else to add on the journal.

980
00:51:54,662 --> 00:51:55,500
All right,

981
00:51:58,562 --> 00:52:03,525
we will announce here that

982
00:52:04,112 --> 00:52:07,102
we are having a second applied active

983
00:52:07,132 --> 00:52:09,617
inference symposium on the theme of

984
00:52:09,665 --> 00:52:13,907
robotics. It will be held on July 31,

985
00:52:13,985 --> 00:52:18,152
2022, from four to eight and

986
00:52:18,245 --> 00:52:21,632
16 to 20 UTC. So all the

987
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:23,597
dates and times are UTC. It's a four

988
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:26,625
hour first interval, twelve hour break,

989
00:52:27,437 --> 00:52:29,972
or sorry, eight hour break,

990
00:52:30,155 --> 00:52:33,987
and then another four hour entorhinal

991
00:52:35,087 --> 00:52:37,337
states tuned on social media in our

992
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,767
newsletter for more information,

993
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,437
including presenters. We've been having

994
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,377
a great time collaborating with

995
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,947
coorganizers Matt Brown and Mark Miller,

996
00:52:47,992 --> 00:52:50,700
as well as some of us on this call.

997
00:52:51,062 --> 00:52:54,077
And in the last year or two, there have

998
00:52:54,095 --> 00:52:57,112
just been many important introduction

999
00:52:57,187 --> 00:53:00,827
works bridging, active inference and

1000
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,902
robotics. So for example, here's an

1001
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,822
image from how active coherence could

1002
00:53:05,855 --> 00:53:08,837
revolutionize robotics DA Costa, Ant all

1003
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,747
recently, as well as the paper that we

1004
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:15,752
discussed of Data et al. In April in

1005
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:18,172
Livestream 42 on the simultaneous

1006
00:53:18,217 --> 00:53:22,472
localization and mapping. So we hope to

1007
00:53:22,655 --> 00:53:25,832
hold this symposium where there will be

1008
00:53:25,985 --> 00:53:28,667
presentations and roundtable type

1009
00:53:28,715 --> 00:53:31,052
discussions that are live streamed as

1010
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:33,797
well as recorded and rewatchable, and

1011
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:35,747
also with transcripts that will be

1012
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,872
published as proceedings to highlight

1013
00:53:38,917 --> 00:53:43,262
some issues and opportunities in this

1014
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,952
increasingly important area of active

1015
00:53:45,982 --> 00:53:48,527
inference and robotics. So we hope to be

1016
00:53:48,545 --> 00:53:51,977
drawing on many perspectives, those who

1017
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:54,637
are coming at the active robotics

1018
00:53:54,712 --> 00:53:58,397
intersection from the perspective of

1019
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:01,997
researchers, industries involved in

1020
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,322
robotics or active inference, those with

1021
00:54:04,355 --> 00:54:06,172
curiosity, those with philosophical

1022
00:54:06,217 --> 00:54:08,627
interest in these topics, ethics, and

1023
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:10,607
the social implications. There's going

1024
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:12,797
to be a lot of great discussions around

1025
00:54:12,905 --> 00:54:15,347
this symposium, so just stay tuned and

1026
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,117
we'll have more information coming out

1027
00:54:17,165 --> 00:54:20,552
soon. Any other comments on the

1028
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:22,952
symposium or any other next steps for

1029
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:23,862
projects?

1030
00:54:32,662 --> 00:54:36,350
Okay, so one new thing,

1031
00:54:36,787 --> 00:54:38,975
special announcement time.

1032
00:54:41,437 --> 00:54:45,442
As of June 2022 this month,

1033
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,922
we are formalizing a transformation at

1034
00:54:48,955 --> 00:54:51,957
the organizational scale from the active

1035
00:54:51,972 --> 00:54:54,477
coherence lab into the active active

1036
00:54:54,507 --> 00:54:56,300
inference institute.

1037
00:54:58,537 --> 00:55:02,377
Use those emojis, but this has been a

1038
00:55:02,395 --> 00:55:05,152
really exciting development and we like

1039
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:07,175
to just share a little bit about it now.

1040
00:55:07,612 --> 00:55:11,092
We've been working with Fried Frank in

1041
00:55:11,215 --> 00:55:14,757
pro bono law firm Capacity and they've

1042
00:55:14,772 --> 00:55:17,067
been helping guide this developmental

1043
00:55:17,127 --> 00:55:20,442
process. We're initiating

1044
00:55:20,577 --> 00:55:23,837
some enterprise architecture development

1045
00:55:24,862 --> 00:55:28,237
such as updating and improving our

1046
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:31,122
governance structure, obtaining funding

1047
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:33,792
and hiring for research and educational

1048
00:55:33,852 --> 00:55:36,672
roles, and identification of focal

1049
00:55:36,717 --> 00:55:39,362
projects as affordances for encoding.

1050
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:43,867
More generally. This move in

1051
00:55:43,915 --> 00:55:46,642
generative models or Markov blanket from

1052
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:49,197
the active lab to the active coherence

1053
00:55:49,242 --> 00:55:53,302
institute helps us clarify and continue

1054
00:55:53,395 --> 00:55:56,707
on with our strategy around education

1055
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:00,622
and research. And the time has

1056
00:56:00,655 --> 00:56:03,477
come for something different and bigger.

1057
00:56:03,582 --> 00:56:09,837
And so we hope that the AI organization

1058
00:56:09,987 --> 00:56:12,712
will be able to represent that and

1059
00:56:12,775 --> 00:56:15,172
scaffold that and provide those services

1060
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,425
to our niche in the best possible way.

1061
00:56:19,612 --> 00:56:23,137
I guess there's a ton to share and ask

1062
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,597
and in the coming few slides we'll talk

1063
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:28,852
a little bit about strategy. But what do

1064
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:31,897
people want to and here about this just

1065
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:32,675
for now.

1066
00:56:37,687 --> 00:56:41,032
I want to say that these changes on

1067
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:43,882
organizational scale from one hand

1068
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,317
reflects the growing number of services

1069
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,142
that we are providing to the niche and

1070
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:54,697
from the other hand is an answer for

1071
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:58,897
growing complexity of activities. And I

1072
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:01,347
believe that after we're analyzing

1073
00:57:01,467 --> 00:57:04,972
immigration projects before

1074
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,187
the beginning of next semester,

1075
00:57:07,987 --> 00:57:12,072
we will be really ready for scaling

1076
00:57:12,117 --> 00:57:15,817
of our activities and to include more

1077
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:19,700
people to participate and having that

1078
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:24,637
scale to the opportunity

1079
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:32,572
to grow and having to

1080
00:57:32,605 --> 00:57:36,522
grow with new skills

1081
00:57:36,567 --> 00:57:40,347
and having new possibly

1082
00:57:40,392 --> 00:57:43,207
group departments and different types of

1083
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:45,502
projects and support different types of

1084
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,462
collaborations. Thanks.

1085
00:57:49,525 --> 00:57:53,167
Anyone else want to add before we talk

1086
00:57:53,215 --> 00:57:54,950
about strategy a little bit?

1087
00:57:57,112 --> 00:58:00,502
You just want to Bleu, please. I just

1088
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:04,037
wanted to add that I don't know, it's

1089
00:58:05,887 --> 00:58:10,032
really involved process becoming

1090
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:12,222
a 503 C and thinking about governance

1091
00:58:12,267 --> 00:58:14,902
structure and how that fits into our

1092
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,172
strategy and balancing the things we

1093
00:58:18,205 --> 00:58:20,012
have to do like obligational

1094
00:58:20,812 --> 00:58:23,692
commitments. In order to further the

1095
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,227
success of the active inference

1096
00:58:25,257 --> 00:58:27,307
institute and also the fun things that

1097
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:29,472
we like to do, like research and papers

1098
00:58:29,517 --> 00:58:31,552
and textbook groups and things like

1099
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:34,192
that. So striking a balance has been

1100
00:58:34,315 --> 00:58:37,167
interesting, challenging, and hopefully

1101
00:58:37,227 --> 00:58:38,537
it'll be rewarding.

1102
00:58:41,525 --> 00:58:45,655
Yes, it's only 18

1103
00:58:45,715 --> 00:58:49,355
months ago when we began a lot

1104
00:58:49,477 --> 00:58:51,695
in the beginning of 2021,

1105
00:58:51,697 --> 00:58:55,825
and we very immediately afterwards

1106
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,295
began the process of foraging as a

1107
00:58:58,297 --> 00:59:01,415
nonprofit. We did end up doing that in a

1108
00:59:01,432 --> 00:59:05,075
California nonprofit and that

1109
00:59:05,137 --> 00:59:08,930
was a good

1110
00:59:09,052 --> 00:59:11,810
step that helped us get a taste of the

1111
00:59:11,842 --> 00:59:15,035
kinds of enterprise architecture that we

1112
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:18,655
would ultimately need. And now we're

1113
00:59:18,715 --> 00:59:21,890
ready to face those challenges and

1114
00:59:21,907 --> 00:59:23,975
opportunities really directly with this

1115
00:59:24,037 --> 00:59:26,735
new approach. So it's super exciting and

1116
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:28,850
we just wanted to include it in this lab

1117
00:59:28,912 --> 00:59:32,750
meeting as recent developments and more

1118
00:59:32,812 --> 00:59:35,987
will be coming in the coming months.

1119
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:40,235
In July of 22, we'll take kind of a

1120
00:59:40,342 --> 00:59:42,185
summer break. There won't be any live

1121
00:59:42,217 --> 00:59:45,080
stream paper discussions, and during

1122
00:59:45,127 --> 00:59:49,475
that time we'll be having

1123
00:59:49,537 --> 00:59:52,375
a lot of migrations and updates.

1124
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:56,420
So just stay tuned for things to be

1125
00:59:56,572 --> 01:00:00,425
updating as they do in the Act

1126
01:00:00,487 --> 01:00:04,355
Institute. Let's talk a little bit about

1127
01:00:04,477 --> 01:00:08,155
strategy. So here we'll present a update

1128
01:00:08,215 --> 01:00:12,575
on our strategy, documents that as

1129
01:00:12,712 --> 01:00:14,905
we update this at the Cordially scale,

1130
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,990
we'll be helping to guide some of the

1131
01:00:18,007 --> 01:00:20,740
next development steps in active

1132
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:24,010
Institute. So, Active Inference

1133
01:00:24,055 --> 01:00:27,590
Institute AI, or you can use Emojis with

1134
01:00:27,607 --> 01:00:30,860
just an A and then the two I. Emoji is

1135
01:00:30,892 --> 01:00:32,735
on the path of openendedness. Our

1136
01:00:32,767 --> 01:00:34,960
strategy considers learning and applying

1137
01:00:35,005 --> 01:00:36,740
active inference for changes in the

1138
01:00:36,757 --> 01:00:39,265
niche over multiple nested scales.

1139
01:00:39,445 --> 01:00:41,465
Through time, we increase the degree of

1140
01:00:41,482 --> 01:00:44,210
hierarchical communication complexity to

1141
01:00:44,242 --> 01:00:46,415
overcome competing interactions and

1142
01:00:46,432 --> 01:00:49,100
frustrated states. We engage in policy

1143
01:00:49,162 --> 01:00:51,355
selection, reducing our uncertainty

1144
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:53,585
about realizing our expectations and

1145
01:00:53,617 --> 01:00:55,645
preferences for epistemic value values

1146
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:58,505
as a nonprofit organization. At the same

1147
01:00:58,552 --> 01:01:01,210
time, to ensure Institute development,

1148
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:03,385
we need to secure pragmatic financial

1149
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:06,075
sustainability with enabling activity.

1150
01:01:06,575 --> 01:01:10,670
And the three scales that the AII is

1151
01:01:10,747 --> 01:01:13,955
modifying and interacting with are

1152
01:01:14,152 --> 01:01:16,910
first, the participant as an agent, the

1153
01:01:16,942 --> 01:01:19,510
human participant. The Institute

1154
01:01:19,555 --> 01:01:21,205
provides affordances and updates

1155
01:01:21,265 --> 01:01:23,470
participants generative models via

1156
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:27,290
providing them a modified niche with

1157
01:01:27,307 --> 01:01:31,265
the Institute as an agent. This level

1158
01:01:31,432 --> 01:01:34,210
is where we can engage in Institutelevel

1159
01:01:34,255 --> 01:01:37,465
policy selection and evolve a shared

1160
01:01:37,495 --> 01:01:39,770
generative model that goes beyond any

1161
01:01:39,847 --> 01:01:42,715
one participant. And then lastly,

1162
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:44,900
we are modifying and interacting with

1163
01:01:44,962 --> 01:01:48,295
our communities and peer organizations

1164
01:01:48,385 --> 01:01:51,755
in our epistemic niche, where we provide

1165
01:01:51,877 --> 01:01:54,665
services and opportunities and engage in

1166
01:01:54,757 --> 01:01:58,505
collaborations with community. So, any

1167
01:01:58,552 --> 01:02:00,212
overall thoughts on this?

1168
01:02:04,662 --> 01:02:08,575
Okay, to our

1169
01:02:09,162 --> 01:02:12,402
first area of focus. Thank you,

1170
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:13,087
Bleu.

1171
01:02:15,987 --> 01:02:18,325
Our first area of focus is education.

1172
01:02:18,987 --> 01:02:21,422
At the participant's scale, we approach

1173
01:02:21,467 --> 01:02:23,222
the participants active inference

1174
01:02:23,267 --> 01:02:26,802
mastery as the system of interest to

1175
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,572
reflect the plurality of individual

1176
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,997
priors expertise levels and preferences.

1177
01:02:32,192 --> 01:02:34,592
We develop different educational formats

1178
01:02:34,652 --> 01:02:36,797
such as workshops, discussion groups,

1179
01:02:36,917 --> 01:02:38,832
online courses, project based learning,

1180
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:42,087
internships, and more. And our

1181
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:44,967
preference is to have up to a hundred

1182
01:02:45,015 --> 01:02:47,052
participants involved in education by

1183
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:50,427
the end of 2022 at the

1184
01:02:50,445 --> 01:02:52,092
Institute scale, we're learning

1185
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,297
StateoftheART ways of working and

1186
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:56,847
practices across functional domains to

1187
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,162
build and strengthen our organizational

1188
01:02:59,237 --> 01:03:02,162
capacities. And at the Community Scale,

1189
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:04,967
we work on education and reducing

1190
01:03:05,027 --> 01:03:07,612
research debt for broad communities.

1191
01:03:08,037 --> 01:03:10,517
We develop public video and audio

1192
01:03:10,577 --> 01:03:13,742
content that spreads, and we prefer

1193
01:03:13,802 --> 01:03:16,652
to reach out to many dozens of thousands

1194
01:03:16,682 --> 01:03:19,092
of people with the information that we

1195
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:22,652
create. Any other like thoughts

1196
01:03:22,682 --> 01:03:24,775
or ideas on education?

1197
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:35,680
I think it's exciting to explore what

1198
01:03:35,877 --> 01:03:38,830
the future and the present of education

1199
01:03:38,952 --> 01:03:42,280
are. We've seen only the early

1200
01:03:42,327 --> 01:03:44,962
days of online education,

1201
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,400
even though there's been many effective

1202
01:03:47,475 --> 01:03:50,587
or less effective approaches tried.

1203
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:56,062
There's so much to

1204
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:58,980
develop around how we educate,

1205
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,912
especially for active inference lab area

1206
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:06,715
two related to research at the

1207
01:04:06,732 --> 01:04:08,455
participant scale, we provide

1208
01:04:08,502 --> 01:04:10,230
affordances to scaffold and launch

1209
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:12,730
research and development projects by

1210
01:04:12,777 --> 01:04:15,430
participants. Projects can be driven by

1211
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:18,010
participants inside or outside of our

1212
01:04:18,042 --> 01:04:20,335
organization, and the Institute will

1213
01:04:20,367 --> 01:04:23,365
provide relevant support. We expect to

1214
01:04:23,382 --> 01:04:25,615
see dozens of research outcomes in the

1215
01:04:25,632 --> 01:04:27,865
coming months and years, ranging from

1216
01:04:27,957 --> 01:04:29,940
papers, workshops and conference

1217
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:33,385
presentations and from the basic to the

1218
01:04:33,417 --> 01:04:36,650
applied. At the Institute scale,

1219
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,105
as an organization, we rearrange, we

1220
01:04:40,152 --> 01:04:42,840
catalyze and participate in active

1221
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:45,355
inference research projects with long

1222
01:04:45,402 --> 01:04:48,210
term impact or public goods features

1223
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:50,355
like ontology development, knowledge

1224
01:04:50,415 --> 01:04:52,960
engineering, and also events such as

1225
01:04:52,992 --> 01:04:56,590
symposiums and conferences. At the

1226
01:04:56,607 --> 01:04:59,265
Community scale, we recognize and seek

1227
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:02,070
to carry out, apply and improve upon

1228
01:05:02,235 --> 01:05:05,075
research practices from open science,

1229
01:05:05,425 --> 01:05:07,550
DCM, beyond,

1230
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:14,545
so to be caught up education,

1231
01:05:14,697 --> 01:05:17,935
D school and then to go beyond and

1232
01:05:17,967 --> 01:05:21,310
create novelty and discover on the

1233
01:05:21,342 --> 01:05:24,125
frontier research like DSI.

1234
01:05:24,775 --> 01:05:28,455
Those are the two key and first focuses

1235
01:05:28,515 --> 01:05:31,930
of the active Institute. The third is

1236
01:05:31,977 --> 01:05:34,165
outreach and engagement. So at the

1237
01:05:34,182 --> 01:05:36,160
participants scale, we think of

1238
01:05:36,192 --> 01:05:38,065
participants as ambassadors of the

1239
01:05:38,082 --> 01:05:40,225
Institute, so we welcome and support

1240
01:05:40,287 --> 01:05:42,355
their initiatives to share a voice about

1241
01:05:42,402 --> 01:05:44,940
active inference in various situations

1242
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:48,810
and communities. At the Institute scale,

1243
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:51,325
we aim to set up partnerships with other

1244
01:05:51,387 --> 01:05:53,610
organizations from academia, industry

1245
01:05:53,655 --> 01:05:56,740
and beyond. This supports high quality

1246
01:05:56,907 --> 01:05:59,140
science communication education and

1247
01:05:59,157 --> 01:06:01,425
collaborations around research topics

1248
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,865
such as active inference. And at the

1249
01:06:03,882 --> 01:06:06,115
Community scale, we acknowledge the

1250
01:06:06,132 --> 01:06:08,750
diversity of people's initial cognition

1251
01:06:09,175 --> 01:06:11,500
for example, their familiarity with

1252
01:06:11,562 --> 01:06:13,725
different languages, science,

1253
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,387
philosophy, computation, everything.

1254
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:20,640
We develop projects like the active

1255
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:22,600
Coherence online journal and create

1256
01:06:22,662 --> 01:06:24,580
popular science content for different

1257
01:06:24,627 --> 01:06:27,787
social media. And we hope to provide

1258
01:06:28,825 --> 01:06:31,530
portfolio of outreach and engagement

1259
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:34,945
opportunities again to meet those who

1260
01:06:34,947 --> 01:06:39,037
are interested where and how they are.

1261
01:06:42,025 --> 01:06:44,962
Any other thoughts or ideas on this?

1262
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,690
So, just a thought on the research

1263
01:06:49,857 --> 01:06:53,080
strategy for people that might have

1264
01:06:53,127 --> 01:06:54,990
projects that didn't start in the active

1265
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:57,190
inference lab or projects that they want

1266
01:06:57,207 --> 01:07:00,235
to start and haven't yet started. We

1267
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:03,090
don't necessarily start projects.

1268
01:07:03,195 --> 01:07:05,515
Sometimes projects come to us. So if

1269
01:07:05,532 --> 01:07:07,270
you're looking for a network of people

1270
01:07:07,347 --> 01:07:09,765
or maybe weekly meetings with feedback

1271
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:12,445
or something else to scaffold your

1272
01:07:12,522 --> 01:07:15,580
project, we can provide access to a big

1273
01:07:15,627 --> 01:07:17,040
community of active inference

1274
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:19,525
researchers and like would welcome

1275
01:07:19,662 --> 01:07:22,000
projects that have already taken off.

1276
01:07:22,062 --> 01:07:23,740
So if you have a project that you want

1277
01:07:23,757 --> 01:07:25,825
to bring into the lab that is open

1278
01:07:25,887 --> 01:07:28,045
science that's I think one of the key

1279
01:07:28,122 --> 01:07:31,090
things force the lab, we would just

1280
01:07:31,107 --> 01:07:32,710
welcome that opportunity to work with

1281
01:07:32,742 --> 01:07:34,440
anyone who wants to do active inference

1282
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:38,380
lab based project. Thanks Lou. And yeah,

1283
01:07:38,427 --> 01:07:41,962
hopefully we can have more exemplars and

1284
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:46,780
clear lanes and the

1285
01:07:46,902 --> 01:07:48,910
mystery lanes for those that don't even

1286
01:07:48,942 --> 01:07:51,310
yet exist. But there's a continuum of

1287
01:07:51,342 --> 01:07:53,560
ways to participate in project based

1288
01:07:53,592 --> 01:07:57,055
learning ranging from coming to

1289
01:07:57,177 --> 01:08:00,010
an Act Institute scaffolded project

1290
01:08:00,192 --> 01:08:02,935
where we will help with the rhythm, the

1291
01:08:02,967 --> 01:08:05,185
infrastructure, the role assignment and

1292
01:08:05,217 --> 01:08:07,570
everything. It's kind of like a show up

1293
01:08:07,647 --> 01:08:10,537
and enter the game type project.

1294
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:13,660
There also might be projects that are

1295
01:08:13,692 --> 01:08:16,635
totally off the radar of Act Institute.

1296
01:08:16,755 --> 01:08:20,395
It's just you are participating in a

1297
01:08:20,397 --> 01:08:21,990
project or not, but you're connecting

1298
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:25,215
with participants in the organization

1299
01:08:25,395 --> 01:08:27,685
and you find a latent interest and you

1300
01:08:27,717 --> 01:08:31,475
collaborate that way with your own font,

1301
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,575
formal documents, ontologies narratives

1302
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:37,090
and tools or something in the middle

1303
01:08:37,182 --> 01:08:38,770
where you have a project that's at a

1304
01:08:38,772 --> 01:08:41,310
stage where you're ready to get feedback

1305
01:08:41,355 --> 01:08:43,135
from the active inference community or

1306
01:08:43,167 --> 01:08:45,430
just from any interested people. Maybe

1307
01:08:45,477 --> 01:08:47,410
there's opportunities to collaborate or

1308
01:08:47,442 --> 01:08:49,360
maybe you're looking for just some help

1309
01:08:49,392 --> 01:08:52,210
on tweaking it and fine tuning it as you

1310
01:08:52,242 --> 01:08:54,430
prepare, for example, to submit a paper

1311
01:08:54,477 --> 01:08:56,140
or develop the next version of

1312
01:08:56,157 --> 01:08:59,035
something. So there's so many ways to do

1313
01:08:59,217 --> 01:09:02,995
research and education that we will

1314
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:07,162
just have clarity around where is

1315
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,000
the projects that the institute is

1316
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:12,925
scaffolding and moving the needle on.

1317
01:09:13,062 --> 01:09:14,985
And those are the kind of massively

1318
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:17,485
collaborative projects where people who

1319
01:09:17,517 --> 01:09:19,885
want to be involved can kind of get

1320
01:09:19,917 --> 01:09:22,465
involved and check back in and out all

1321
01:09:22,482 --> 01:09:24,975
the way to projects that are self driven

1322
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:28,165
and you're seeing the lab as again a

1323
01:09:28,182 --> 01:09:30,295
niche that is modified for you to

1324
01:09:30,372 --> 01:09:32,430
support those kinds of research efforts.

1325
01:09:32,565 --> 01:09:35,605
Like one exciting opportunity there is

1326
01:09:35,727 --> 01:09:38,305
for individuals who would like to be

1327
01:09:38,427 --> 01:09:42,055
writing or building applications that

1328
01:09:42,102 --> 01:09:44,410
use active inference to gain some

1329
01:09:44,442 --> 01:09:47,605
familiarity with the ontology. Could go

1330
01:09:47,652 --> 01:09:50,190
a long way, and somebody could just hang

1331
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:52,870
out in the relevant meetings or read the

1332
01:09:52,872 --> 01:09:54,960
relevant documents and publications.

1333
01:09:55,155 --> 01:09:57,790
And then that is like a way to close the

1334
01:09:57,807 --> 01:10:00,415
feedback loop and to use these services

1335
01:10:00,507 --> 01:10:02,040
that are being provided in the niche,

1336
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:04,785
like the ontology. And so reduce

1337
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:08,085
research debt by promoting coherent

1338
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:09,690
and comprehensive use of active

1339
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:13,015
inference terms and concepts. And so

1340
01:10:13,032 --> 01:10:17,320
there's many ways to learn and research

1341
01:10:17,397 --> 01:10:21,425
and apply aligned with this overview

1342
01:10:21,925 --> 01:10:23,790
strategy, work and progress we're

1343
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:27,400
presenting here. And lastly four

1344
01:10:27,462 --> 01:10:31,215
methods. At the participant scale,

1345
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,235
we educate participants so they grow

1346
01:10:33,267 --> 01:10:34,930
their expertise level in different

1347
01:10:34,977 --> 01:10:38,430
disciplines as disciplinary expertise

1348
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:41,295
entails competency in various practices

1349
01:10:41,385 --> 01:10:44,145
and tools. We take a holistic approach

1350
01:10:44,235 --> 01:10:46,925
to participant professional development

1351
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,730
at the Institute scale, communication

1352
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:53,287
and organizational design our

1353
01:10:54,325 --> 01:10:56,715
fundamental effort. We apply active

1354
01:10:56,745 --> 01:10:58,705
inference systems thinking and other

1355
01:10:58,752 --> 01:11:00,655
first principles approaches to the

1356
01:11:00,702 --> 01:11:03,640
institute operations and at the

1357
01:11:03,657 --> 01:11:05,955
community scale we share and promote

1358
01:11:06,015 --> 01:11:08,305
methods we use throughout the community

1359
01:11:08,427 --> 01:11:10,380
to increase the quality and efficiency

1360
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:13,465
of collaborations and we're also open to

1361
01:11:13,557 --> 01:11:15,835
recommendations for new methods and

1362
01:11:15,867 --> 01:11:17,437
strategies to consider.

1363
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:22,270
So methods is a little bit of the how

1364
01:11:22,422 --> 01:11:24,562
just as if it were a scientific paper

1365
01:11:24,925 --> 01:11:27,790
and the what is education,

1366
01:11:27,957 --> 01:11:30,575
research, outreach and engagement.

1367
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:34,830
So this lab meeting has consisted

1368
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:38,685
a little bit of and introduction

1369
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:40,135
section. Again sticking with this

1370
01:11:40,167 --> 01:11:42,235
scientific paper metaphor, an

1371
01:11:42,267 --> 01:11:46,330
introduction of updates maybe also

1372
01:11:46,377 --> 01:11:48,975
those are our results, some discussions

1373
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:52,987
and next steps. And now

1374
01:11:53,425 --> 01:11:56,845
with this one new thing we are

1375
01:11:56,922 --> 01:12:00,412
also pointing the way in which

1376
01:12:01,075 --> 01:12:04,260
we are heading during this ongoing

1377
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:07,440
transformation into the Active Inference

1378
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:12,480
Institute. It's a really exciting

1379
01:12:12,615 --> 01:12:17,925
time for those who are involved

1380
01:12:18,075 --> 01:12:22,135
in paying attention. We expect and

1381
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:26,125
prefer and there's many

1382
01:12:26,262 --> 01:12:28,960
opportunities to be getting more

1383
01:12:28,992 --> 01:12:33,360
involved in any number of ways ranging

1384
01:12:33,405 --> 01:12:36,220
from educational opportunities to

1385
01:12:36,297 --> 01:12:38,965
joining the kinds of projects where you

1386
01:12:38,982 --> 01:12:42,235
can be engaged in research, education,

1387
01:12:42,342 --> 01:12:44,587
development, application.

1388
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:49,740
Many opportunities there and it's

1389
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:52,785
just the beginning for the institute.

1390
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:56,437
So much more will be happening

1391
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,625
as time flies.

1392
01:13:01,825 --> 01:13:04,450
What else would people like to address

1393
01:13:04,587 --> 01:13:08,900
or ask or bring up? In closing.

1394
01:13:14,537 --> 01:13:18,277
I want to say that results and plans

1395
01:13:18,307 --> 01:13:21,150
that we're having reflects our

1396
01:13:23,762 --> 01:13:27,502
initiatives in a really long time scale

1397
01:13:27,607 --> 01:13:31,192
and we understand that we can evaluate

1398
01:13:31,252 --> 01:13:34,172
results like in one or two decades and

1399
01:13:34,205 --> 01:13:37,212
say that this first initial small steps

1400
01:13:37,712 --> 01:13:41,357
Beren like a beginning on something

1401
01:13:41,435 --> 01:13:45,467
big. And as for strategy and

1402
01:13:45,515 --> 01:13:47,747
all that we have now is like

1403
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:50,542
applications of approaches that we chose

1404
01:13:50,602 --> 01:13:53,387
in the beginning and an example of

1405
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:56,492
strategy, which is like a process for

1406
01:13:56,540 --> 01:14:00,547
us. And that updates on quarterly

1407
01:14:00,592 --> 01:14:03,647
base updates. Of the strategy is

1408
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,702
important because it provides a way to

1409
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:09,150
be adaptive and react on changes, on

1410
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:12,077
information we are getting in the

1411
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:15,237
process of work and also consideration

1412
01:14:17,162 --> 01:14:20,402
an institute. And the strategy on at

1413
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:23,552
least three scales that we

1414
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:25,522
are paying attention to and planning

1415
01:14:25,567 --> 01:14:28,187
changes for free scales is also

1416
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:31,807
providing to us a lot of opportunities

1417
01:14:31,972 --> 01:14:35,917
to affect different aspects

1418
01:14:35,977 --> 01:14:38,862
and niches which are related.

1419
01:14:39,362 --> 01:14:43,022
And that's why being on one hand

1420
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:46,412
have a very long time horizontal in our

1421
01:14:46,475 --> 01:14:50,325
planning and ant the same time

1422
01:14:50,837 --> 01:14:53,897
having very flexible approach to

1423
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:59,722
development like this cornerstone

1424
01:14:59,842 --> 01:15:02,627
of false principles and kind of

1425
01:15:02,795 --> 01:15:07,247
evolution and open ended approach I

1426
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:11,072
believe will bring us very

1427
01:15:11,105 --> 01:15:13,362
interesting results advanced.

1428
01:15:18,675 --> 01:15:20,490
Does anyone else want to add anything or

1429
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:21,975
I'll make a note we can continue

1430
01:15:22,037 --> 01:15:22,975
discussing.

1431
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,860
So one conversation that Jacob and

1432
01:15:28,892 --> 01:15:31,755
I and others were kind of developing and

1433
01:15:31,877 --> 01:15:35,865
meming out over the quarter was like

1434
01:15:35,957 --> 01:15:38,265
what if active inference only works for

1435
01:15:38,282 --> 01:15:40,610
like one or two times steps.

1436
01:15:40,805 --> 01:15:43,895
And as we consider deeper and deeper,

1437
01:15:43,985 --> 01:15:46,550
even potentially two in the most extreme

1438
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:49,050
versions of the meme that the

1439
01:15:49,112 --> 01:15:53,235
combinatorics of decision making in

1440
01:15:53,267 --> 01:15:56,790
principle and or in practice become

1441
01:15:56,957 --> 01:16:00,050
challenging to evaluate and compute

1442
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,645
like the computational complexity grows

1443
01:16:02,735 --> 01:16:05,200
potentially extremely rapidly

1444
01:16:06,525 --> 01:16:09,645
considering even two moves deep, so to

1445
01:16:09,647 --> 01:16:13,310
speak. We've seen several approaches

1446
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:15,915
to dealing with this. First is the

1447
01:16:15,932 --> 01:16:18,890
continuous time approximation of active

1448
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,990
inference where there is no explicit

1449
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:22,635
time series prediction of future time

1450
01:16:22,667 --> 01:16:24,215
points. There's just like a Taylor

1451
01:16:24,245 --> 01:16:26,640
series approximation based upon the

1452
01:16:26,657 --> 01:16:28,525
generalized coordinates of motion.

1453
01:16:29,175 --> 01:16:31,850
Other approaches we've seen are deep

1454
01:16:31,925 --> 01:16:34,485
active inference, just rolling out that

1455
01:16:34,517 --> 01:16:36,060
prediction to deeper and deeper time

1456
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,525
points anyway, and then utilizing

1457
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:41,195
heuristics and other algorithmic

1458
01:16:41,285 --> 01:16:43,875
approaches to ameliorate that

1459
01:16:43,937 --> 01:16:46,362
combinatoric. And we've also seen

1460
01:16:46,725 --> 01:16:49,640
sophisticated or hierarchical active

1461
01:16:49,670 --> 01:16:53,010
inference modeling where potentially at

1462
01:16:53,117 --> 01:16:56,715
two or more hierarchical model scales of

1463
01:16:56,732 --> 01:16:59,730
the model, still only one or two time

1464
01:16:59,777 --> 01:17:01,920
points or only a few time points have to

1465
01:17:01,922 --> 01:17:04,185
be reflected. So it would be like to

1466
01:17:04,217 --> 01:17:07,215
predict out 100 years. One could have a

1467
01:17:07,232 --> 01:17:10,200
model with a temporal depth of 100, or

1468
01:17:10,262 --> 01:17:14,205
there could be ten time

1469
01:17:14,252 --> 01:17:16,440
points, each consisting of a decade of

1470
01:17:16,457 --> 01:17:20,235
ten years. And so then that could even

1471
01:17:20,267 --> 01:17:23,415
be broken down further. And so

1472
01:17:23,432 --> 01:17:26,340
when Alex was talking about the way in

1473
01:17:26,357 --> 01:17:30,180
which there's an imperative to

1474
01:17:30,302 --> 01:17:34,365
act in an adaptive way to

1475
01:17:34,457 --> 01:17:37,080
not die and to live and to thrive and to

1476
01:17:37,127 --> 01:17:40,350
serve, of course, but in many

1477
01:17:40,412 --> 01:17:43,505
cases there are some challenges

1478
01:17:43,565 --> 01:17:46,065
associated with decision making. We

1479
01:17:46,082 --> 01:17:48,935
don't have the ability to do a B testing

1480
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:51,405
or null hypothesis or even just

1481
01:17:51,452 --> 01:17:54,440
alternatives over very long time scales,

1482
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:57,615
over certain levels of organization. It

1483
01:17:57,632 --> 01:18:00,105
might be possible to do for an agent

1484
01:18:00,152 --> 01:18:03,815
that's rapid or has a lot of individuals

1485
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:06,285
engaging with it, like a website. A B

1486
01:18:06,317 --> 01:18:08,835
testing might work super well if 100

1487
01:18:08,867 --> 01:18:10,365
people are looking at the website every

1488
01:18:10,382 --> 01:18:13,395
day, whereas in organizational design

1489
01:18:13,547 --> 01:18:15,900
there isn't that much of the same

1490
01:18:15,962 --> 01:18:19,815
affordance. And it speaks to the

1491
01:18:19,832 --> 01:18:23,135
way in which our multiple nested

1492
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:27,545
timescales of updating hopefully

1493
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:30,930
provide clarity so that we don't need to

1494
01:18:31,052 --> 01:18:34,535
be at the fast cycle trying to predict

1495
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:38,255
out 100 years. But with increasingly

1496
01:18:38,315 --> 01:18:41,310
deep hierarchical temporal models, we

1497
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:43,995
might be able to act adaptive in a

1498
01:18:43,997 --> 01:18:48,012
multiscale way. So, for example, in 2021

1499
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:51,470
we were planning heavily on the quarter

1500
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:55,205
timescale we introduction and assembled

1501
01:18:55,265 --> 01:18:57,675
our scientific advisory board which

1502
01:18:57,737 --> 01:19:00,810
began operating in 2022. And that was

1503
01:19:00,842 --> 01:19:04,150
explicitly after one year of operations,

1504
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:06,735
expanding our temporal horizon to the

1505
01:19:06,767 --> 01:19:09,480
one year time scale. Now,

1506
01:19:09,602 --> 01:19:12,380
with the Kind brain architectures

1507
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:16,635
updates that the Act Institute is

1508
01:19:16,817 --> 01:19:19,640
providing and necessitating, we're

1509
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:23,330
thinking beyond one year explicitly

1510
01:19:23,465 --> 01:19:27,855
because questions like who can elect who

1511
01:19:28,052 --> 01:19:31,230
in the organization? They do play out

1512
01:19:31,277 --> 01:19:33,695
over slower and slower time scales.

1513
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:38,037
So it's Beren quite interesting,

1514
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:42,090
even mostly qualitatively, to be

1515
01:19:42,182 --> 01:19:45,065
applying and transferring what we're

1516
01:19:45,095 --> 01:19:47,255
learning about multi scale decision

1517
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:50,165
making under uncertainty from active

1518
01:19:50,195 --> 01:19:52,490
inference, which is kind of what it's

1519
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:55,410
about, and apply it in the

1520
01:19:55,442 --> 01:19:58,890
organizational multiscale context with a

1521
01:19:58,907 --> 01:20:01,040
participant in the projects and teams

1522
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:03,015
and the institute scale and the

1523
01:20:03,032 --> 01:20:05,505
community in the niche scale. And so

1524
01:20:05,552 --> 01:20:09,135
it's already been very rewarding and

1525
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:12,312
we hope effective to,

1526
01:20:12,825 --> 01:20:16,512
in a principled way,

1527
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:20,010
bring our learnings and ideas about

1528
01:20:20,117 --> 01:20:22,580
organizational design and the vast

1529
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,245
emergence that so many participants do

1530
01:20:25,322 --> 01:20:27,987
bring to the table on these issues.

1531
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:32,585
And coordinate around carrying

1532
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:35,840
that out in the active inference

1533
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:39,690
ontology in a sense, and using other

1534
01:20:39,782 --> 01:20:43,380
pieces of the puzzle that aren't now or

1535
01:20:43,427 --> 01:20:45,870
in the future even necessarily part of

1536
01:20:45,872 --> 01:20:48,540
the active inference biology. A lot of

1537
01:20:48,557 --> 01:20:51,215
those features we derive from systems

1538
01:20:51,245 --> 01:20:53,190
thinking. Active inference isn't a

1539
01:20:53,207 --> 01:20:55,565
project management approach so there's

1540
01:20:55,595 --> 01:20:58,455
going to have to be like more than just

1541
01:20:58,502 --> 01:21:01,305
the active ontology to carry out

1542
01:21:01,352 --> 01:21:04,490
effective team management. But that's

1543
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:08,250
why we use multiple ways of learning

1544
01:21:08,312 --> 01:21:11,835
and researching. So it just was

1545
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:14,145
very interesting how some of the

1546
01:21:14,222 --> 01:21:16,260
theoretical discussions that we were

1547
01:21:16,292 --> 01:21:18,935
having literally about multiscale

1548
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:21,965
planning in multiagent active

1549
01:21:21,995 --> 01:21:25,685
simulations and the kind of cognitive

1550
01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:28,350
complexity that needs to happen on board

1551
01:21:28,412 --> 01:21:30,645
the entity, what is their actual

1552
01:21:30,722 --> 01:21:32,940
cognitive complexity and awareness and

1553
01:21:32,957 --> 01:21:34,590
affordances versus how are we going to

1554
01:21:34,607 --> 01:21:36,315
simulate it? How do we prevent the

1555
01:21:36,332 --> 01:21:38,325
simulation from, like, sneaking in extra

1556
01:21:38,387 --> 01:21:41,085
indoctrination? How do we think about

1557
01:21:41,117 --> 01:21:43,865
the role of stigma and the modifications

1558
01:21:43,895 --> 01:21:45,875
of the niche and the cognitive

1559
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:47,970
offloading that could happen in a

1560
01:21:47,972 --> 01:21:50,510
multiagent setting or in a stigmergic

1561
01:21:50,555 --> 01:21:54,155
context that is in tight

1562
01:21:54,215 --> 01:21:57,360
feedback with the ways in

1563
01:21:57,392 --> 01:22:01,425
which we're also structuring our own

1564
01:22:01,562 --> 01:22:05,562
niche. And a lot of that

1565
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,875
really started to take an acceleration

1566
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:13,995
point in the last several months with

1567
01:22:14,147 --> 01:22:16,520
Jacob's contribution of active lock

1568
01:22:16,535 --> 01:22:18,410
friends and other individuals

1569
01:22:18,455 --> 01:22:22,515
contributions and the seeds were

1570
01:22:22,607 --> 01:22:25,535
planted in the work even before active

1571
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:29,145
lab existed. With Violkin it all 2020

1572
01:22:29,222 --> 01:22:31,565
active coherence lab and behavior

1573
01:22:31,595 --> 01:22:33,240
engineering and systems thinking and

1574
01:22:33,257 --> 01:22:36,705
remote teams. So it is

1575
01:22:36,752 --> 01:22:39,312
a long game,

1576
01:22:40,125 --> 01:22:42,815
but then long compared to what? It's

1577
01:22:42,845 --> 01:22:46,565
just the game it is. And multiscale

1578
01:22:46,595 --> 01:22:48,440
decision making with diverse

1579
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:50,820
perspectives over multiple spatial and

1580
01:22:50,822 --> 01:22:54,255
temporal scales are not like the end

1581
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:57,180
point or some hot take that is our

1582
01:22:57,227 --> 01:23:00,960
starting point for planning as

1583
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:04,665
inference. And I hope

1584
01:23:04,682 --> 01:23:06,555
that all these threads can just continue

1585
01:23:06,677 --> 01:23:09,165
to develop over the timescales that are

1586
01:23:09,182 --> 01:23:11,115
appropriate and that we can connect with

1587
01:23:11,207 --> 01:23:14,412
participants who are interested

1588
01:23:15,150 --> 01:23:18,462
or those who see that high quality

1589
01:23:18,825 --> 01:23:21,660
engagement and relationship building and

1590
01:23:21,692 --> 01:23:25,440
development are worthwhile in

1591
01:23:25,457 --> 01:23:28,137
terms of epistemic and pragmatic value.

1592
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,190
And sometimes that takes multiple years

1593
01:23:32,282 --> 01:23:36,230
to approach this exciting and developing

1594
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:38,775
topic which is changing month by month

1595
01:23:38,837 --> 01:23:41,610
as our guest dreams just recently have

1596
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:45,285
been highlighting. So for those who

1597
01:23:45,317 --> 01:23:49,610
feel uncertain about participating,

1598
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:52,865
they feel some impulse to get involved

1599
01:23:53,045 --> 01:23:55,635
now watching Livestream or in the

1600
01:23:55,667 --> 01:23:59,085
future. Yes, it's easy and absolutely

1601
01:23:59,192 --> 01:24:02,345
valid to feel busy and like it's

1602
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,235
an affordance that's not immediately

1603
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:07,310
preferable and I'm not saying drop

1604
01:24:07,355 --> 01:24:09,850
everything and join Act Institute.

1605
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:12,990
However, again, we hope that those who

1606
01:24:13,007 --> 01:24:16,235
have paid attention to what we've shared

1607
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,630
today and hopefully continue to share

1608
01:24:18,827 --> 01:24:20,565
and for those who resonate with the

1609
01:24:20,582 --> 01:24:22,610
approach that we're taking, adaptively

1610
01:24:22,655 --> 01:24:26,650
resonate with the strategic vision

1611
01:24:27,075 --> 01:24:30,210
and with the increasingly clear and

1612
01:24:30,242 --> 01:24:33,390
numerous affordances for learning and

1613
01:24:33,482 --> 01:24:36,630
researching. We hope to connect with you

1614
01:24:36,752 --> 01:24:40,737
individuals and create services

1615
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:44,115
that scale even beyond those who get

1616
01:24:44,207 --> 01:24:46,737
very active in the Institute itself.

1617
01:24:47,475 --> 01:24:51,480
And so much more is

1618
01:24:51,527 --> 01:24:54,530
to come. Again, it has been quite a ride

1619
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:58,140
in the last six quarters, and people can

1620
01:24:58,157 --> 01:24:59,705
check our quarterly round table

1621
01:24:59,765 --> 01:25:03,305
meetings, which are slides

1622
01:25:03,365 --> 01:25:05,445
being modified up to the day,

1623
01:25:05,597 --> 01:25:09,735
basically, and they're like an

1624
01:25:09,767 --> 01:25:12,435
honest representation of how things are

1625
01:25:12,467 --> 01:25:14,670
developing. Our uncertainties around

1626
01:25:14,747 --> 01:25:17,637
different developments in the lab.

1627
01:25:18,825 --> 01:25:22,380
We have nothing if not honesty and

1628
01:25:22,427 --> 01:25:28,565
clarity and vision, so there's

1629
01:25:28,595 --> 01:25:31,185
no clean way to end it when one has

1630
01:25:31,217 --> 01:25:33,255
walked this deep down the Planck. But

1631
01:25:33,302 --> 01:25:36,005
I'll just, again, you know, appreciate

1632
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:39,705
everyone who's helped in every way

1633
01:25:39,902 --> 01:25:42,735
to get us to this point. From the people

1634
01:25:42,767 --> 01:25:45,900
who, like, first were enthusiastic about

1635
01:25:46,037 --> 01:25:48,615
the idea of active inference Lab lab in

1636
01:25:48,632 --> 01:25:51,462
the beginning of 2021. And end of 2020,

1637
01:25:52,275 --> 01:25:54,470
more than a year before the textbook,

1638
01:25:54,635 --> 01:25:57,305
when it was, and still, to some extent,

1639
01:25:57,365 --> 01:26:01,055
is, an assemblage of papers

1640
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:03,660
with partially overlapping focus and

1641
01:26:03,692 --> 01:26:07,505
ontology uses and notation. And amidst

1642
01:26:07,565 --> 01:26:11,730
that uncertainty, some people did

1643
01:26:11,852 --> 01:26:15,240
step up, and they acted, and they

1644
01:26:15,257 --> 01:26:17,540
inferred and they served. And now we're

1645
01:26:17,645 --> 01:26:21,135
starting another chapter, and the

1646
01:26:21,167 --> 01:26:24,600
logo doesn't change, and everything else

1647
01:26:24,662 --> 01:26:27,545
is just continuing to develop. So it's

1648
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:30,240
been a great ride, and thanks again to

1649
01:26:30,407 --> 01:26:33,170
everybody who, even as just a listener

1650
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:36,930
for now, has been involved in some way

1651
01:26:37,127 --> 01:26:40,730
in really being a part of the embodiment

1652
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:45,775
and the action of ActInf activinstitute.

1653
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:52,115
So just expect and prefer epistemic

1654
01:26:52,145 --> 01:26:56,310
and pragmatic value, and may

1655
01:26:56,342 --> 01:26:57,762
the gradient be with you.

1656
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:02,565
