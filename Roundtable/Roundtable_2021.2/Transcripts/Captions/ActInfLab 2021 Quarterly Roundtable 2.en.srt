00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,040
hello everyone

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,960
welcome to the actin flab and to our

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,120
2021

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,520
quarterly roundtable number two it's

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,400
june 1st

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,680
2021 and we're excited to be sharing

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,320
with you

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,000
some updates and some plans for our lab

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,080
if you're watching it live feel free to

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,720
ask questions or provide ideas in the

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,840
live chat or

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,200
afterwards you can do that in the

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,360
comments

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,120
welcome to the active inference lab

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,440
everybody we're a participatory

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,920
online lab that is communicating

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,079
learning and practicing applied active

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:44,800
inference

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,039
you can find us at our links here on

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,320
this slide

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,239
this is recorded in an archived live

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,079
stream so please provide us with

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,840
feedback so that we can improve on our

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,719
work

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,640
all backgrounds and perspectives are

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,760
welcome here

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,399
and we'll be following good and normal

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,359
video etiquette for live streams

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,519
today in the quarterly round table

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,439
number two we're going to

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,560
first start with a brief rehearsal of

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:10,960
some

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,760
of our lab goals and that will serve to

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,400
update

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,520
as well as to motivate then we will go

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,040
through each of the three organizational

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,240
units of the lab

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,439
dot edu dot coms and dot tools

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,759
and be providing updates on what has

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,600
happened over the last quarter

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,840
and about where we want to be going in

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,640
the coming quarter

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,759
any thoughts uh at the outset or we can

44
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,400
go right into the goals

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,040
so cool here are act and flap goals

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,240
for the one slide here we've just put up

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,360
a screenshot of

48
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,799
our updated website because we want

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,560
our website to be the point of reference

50
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,759
and the sort of interface for

51
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,759
our lab to the external world so

52
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,680
our first line there is the goal of act

53
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,439
lab is to produce cutting cutting-edge

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,000
research

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,639
and enable real-world applications of

56
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,160
active inference

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,360
and enabling architecture in the systems

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,000
engineering

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,319
way of thinking about enabling systems

60
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,280
can be

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,520
hardware it can be software it can be

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,200
people and teams

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,920
so by thinking broadly about what

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,480
actually

65
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,800
enables real world applications of

66
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,160
active inference

67
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,959
it will hopefully help us stay open to

68
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,640
enabling what needs to be

69
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,560
enabled and catalyzing what needs to be

70
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,920
catalyzed steven

71
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,440
and then anyone else with a raised hand

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,360
yeah i think that point you make about

73
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,440
what needs to be enabled is a good one

74
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,160
because there's this idea of

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,560
pushing beyond what's currently possible

76
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,480
if that makes sense in terms of

77
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,519
how these applications happen so i think

78
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,879
one thing that has been quite

79
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,800
interesting is that

80
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,239
practical applied desire

81
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,680
to apply active inference has been quite

82
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,480
fertile

83
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,879
so even if it's actually happening or

84
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,480
it's that edge of trying to make it

85
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480
happen i think that's a good struggle

86
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,879
to be together in

87
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,760
and i think in tools we'll return to

88
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,440
talking a bit more about what those

89
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,319
applications

90
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,760
could be but i agree and the systems

91
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,400
engineering

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,599
approach of the enabling system at least

93
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,799
for me opened up to being focused on

94
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,840
what we want to

95
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,319
see happen while also being open-minded

96
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,080
to different things that could be

97
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,120
outcomes

98
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,400
and along the way of those outcomes any

99
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,920
enabling system

100
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,519
that needs to come into play is going to

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,599
be the right one so if we have to set up

102
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,360
a new tool or a new communication

103
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,319
mechanism

104
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,360
or do some other application it's all

105
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,280
part of the enabling architecture of the

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,640
lab

107
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,120
all right any comments on the website

108
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,319
activeinference.org overall or we can

109
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,519
just head right into

110
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,640
the updates cool because this is

111
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,159
hopefully an informative

112
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,040
roundtable lab meeting presentation so

113
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,760
here we come

114
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,400
to the updates first there's going to be

115
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,760
a general

116
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,639
admin or organizer update and then we're

117
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,199
going to go

118
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,479
into the organizational units

119
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,280
so first there's a special announcement

120
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,560
which is that

121
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,520
actinflab has a new steady state as a

122
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,280
non-profit organization

123
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,520
registered in california united states

124
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,880
of america

125
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,199
and the registration as a non-profit

126
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,560
organization

127
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,320
has been consistent with our lab

128
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,560
strategy to be a center of gravity

129
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,120
for education and open science research

130
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,960
related to active inference

131
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,600
and also increasingly incorporate

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,560
governance

133
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,720
and informational activities that are

134
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,639
related to our values

135
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,880
registering as a nonprofit will allow us

136
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,840
to enact

137
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,160
the kinds of policies that we expect to

138
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
see as consistent with ourself

139
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,759
while we also figure out what kind of a

140
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,160
lab we are and we want to see

141
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,479
the active inference community be as

142
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,440
participatory

143
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,880
accessible and productive as possible

144
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,960
so that's sort of a special announcement

145
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,800
on that front

146
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,039
and a big rationale or motivator behind

147
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,960
all of our activities as well as the

148
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,479
non-profit here

149
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,759
is this topic of research debt

150
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,280
so um alex maybe you could give us just

151
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,600
a

152
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,440
couple of minutes breakdown on what is

153
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,120
research debt and how does it apply

154
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,199
to active inference at this moment and

155
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,120
then anyone feel free to

156
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,759
ask a question

157
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,320
yeah thanks first i

158
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,840
saw that notion for research depth

159
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,520
in a blog post of jared timur

160
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,680
on in his syllabus for active influence

161
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,000
and he mentioned that he's trying to

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,360
work with research depth

163
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,479
and it's

164
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,520
very well accepted for

165
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,720
developers and developers

166
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,960
works a lot with their depth on

167
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,000
programming and usually

168
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,880
it's happening when people work with

169
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,520
some

170
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,000
new domain or some cutting edge

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,360
technologies

172
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,400
and trying to work on

173
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,840
new fields and developments and we just

174
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,960
not don't have enough time

175
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,080
to make some additional work on

176
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,600
bringing their developments

177
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,639
more closely to our people to have

178
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,319
understanding to start learning

179
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,680
it and so on and

180
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,880
definitely we understand that for

181
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,440
active inference as a new knowledge area

182
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,039
and for community a lot of

183
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,240
very bright minds working on

184
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,360
research part of it and

185
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,720
produced a lot of works and papers

186
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,400
and we should continue but

187
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,599
somebody should take with results

188
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,750
and try to

189
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,960
[Music]

190
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,680
to simply simplify it in some way to

191
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,880
maybe to

192
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,240
make it more clear and precise and

193
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,720
create some informational materials and

194
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,319
artifacts

195
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,319
for people who are not so

196
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,440
well developed in irea and start just

197
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,080
starting

198
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,759
to learn active inference

199
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,879
that's why somebody just have to do it

200
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,840
and

201
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,919
in the lab we decided that it should be

202
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,440
our concern and we have

203
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,879
time and energy start with work and

204
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,840
actually i think we started it already

205
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,840
and what all what we are doing for now

206
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,039
in some sense related to this

207
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,240
big area so that's why we

208
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,280
decided to make it like explicit

209
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,240
statement about it like one of the goal

210
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,319
of the lab and for activities of the lab

211
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,840
so let's start think

212
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,000
and talk about it and think how we

213
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,479
should structure it

214
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,519
again in engineering way because

215
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,120
it's just a part of knowledge

216
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,640
life cycle and if you are working with

217
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,839
knowledge engineering it's a part

218
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,440
of knowledge life cycle and in our case

219
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,880
knowledge about active inference

220
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,920
cool thanks alex it just makes me think

221
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,240
of

222
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,000
um code that needs comments to be really

223
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,560
understandable and accessible that's a

224
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,120
problem

225
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,440
on the cutting edge if code is not being

226
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,600
applied properly to its fullest extent

227
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,959
or in a non-confusing way but it's also

228
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,839
a problem

229
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,000
for learners everybody other than the

230
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,080
cutting edge is also suffering from that

231
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,839
lack of commented code

232
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,320
and so we can just imagine if it was

233
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,440
just a script

234
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,160
that had one input and one output having

235
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,519
a function that didn't have an

236
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,480
explanation

237
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,920
would still be a hindrance to the

238
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,000
advanced performance as well as to

239
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,760
accessibility and onboarding

240
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,640
but we're talking about a rapidly moving

241
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,000
and evolving

242
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,440
body of theory and practice so it's even

243
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,040
more than just commenting

244
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,160
code it comes down to hopefully a lot of

245
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,519
the kinds of projects

246
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,760
that we're going to be exploring and

247
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,680
collaborating on

248
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,000
welcome blue anyone want to give a

249
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
thought on research debt or like what's

250
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:55,920
one

251
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,720
area of active inference that seems

252
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,000
especially

253
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,160
um underwater or is at the risk of going

254
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,079
into a debt mode

255
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,279
something we can think about and

256
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,519
hopefully draw out in this

257
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,680
round table and beyond like the

258
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,440
mathematical underpinnings

259
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,519
what is the relationship between free

260
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,640
energy principle

261
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,440
and active inference all these kinds of

262
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,399
questions

263
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,200
we can't just leave them unresolved we

264
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,079
might be able to

265
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,079
paint around them and make a clear

266
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,920
demarcation but that will be so that we

267
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,320
can

268
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,680
address it later stephen

269
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,959
did i ask a question as much as a

270
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,000
comment is could you just say a bit more

271
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,680
about

272
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,720
some of those concerns around

273
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,360
this research depth have been

274
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,959
overwhelming in some way

275
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,079
i get a sense that people might think

276
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,959
depth is just going to the most ultimate

277
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,640
abstract detail but we're talking about

278
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,200
a richness in a way i sense that you're

279
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,720
talking about a richness of

280
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,440
depth that can be accessible so maybe

281
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:05,760
just

282
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,399
explain a bit more about that be helpful

283
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,120
well

284
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,240
two similar sounding words like research

285
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,279
depth like how deep the field is we

286
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,079
would hope that

287
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,279
it's a field with depth and richness but

288
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,160
research debt is the hindrance that

289
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,760
prevents us from having

290
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,160
deep research and deep technology the

291
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,880
debt

292
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,800
is like if somebody puts in 100 hours of

293
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,480
work to learn something

294
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,800
and then it never gets distilled and

295
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,760
reintegrated

296
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,480
into the knowledge community it's kind

297
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:36,959
of like

298
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,320
we're building out very unsteady bridges

299
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,880
and so then there becomes 20 hours of

300
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
work to comment the code but then nobody

301
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,720
does that so somebody else spends 100

302
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,600
hours

303
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,200
and then they don't have the 20 hours to

304
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,360
comment the code and then someone spends

305
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
10 hours but it gets half done and never

306
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,320
gets completed

307
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,880
and so we accrue this debt just like

308
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,480
financial debt

309
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,320
about inexplicable models and partially

310
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,880
performed projects and just ways that

311
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,680
make the field

312
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,519
internally and externally incoherent

313
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,720
which prevents

314
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,120
deep research and deep thinking but we

315
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,399
want to approach it from

316
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,639
an engineering and almost like a sort of

317
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,920
information economy

318
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,680
perspective stephen so it's almost like

319
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,839
you know you have these bad instruments

320
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,440
or bad derivatives that they had in the

321
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,880
financial markets where they sort of

322
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,800
bundled up debts which

323
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,839
basically are non-productive in a way

324
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,639
and they just

325
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,320
so you're saying that type of thing

326
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,839
could happen there can be a lot of stuff

327
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,959
that can happen and it

328
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,399
ends up being not as productive and

329
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,440
just sort of jamming up the system when

330
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,040
it could actually be

331
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,399
leveraged and used potentially yep like

332
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,480
bloatware you know we won't call out any

333
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,560
operating systems or programs

334
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,079
but there's entire engineering

335
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,720
departments that are just focusing on

336
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,560
very low level bugs

337
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,800
and so then they're treading water

338
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,279
trying to fix the bugs or security flaws

339
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,480
in a really large piece of software and

340
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,000
that is a difficult struggle

341
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,399
whereas we want to be moving forward in

342
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,560
a way where we're not carrying and

343
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,399
multiplying our debts but maybe we could

344
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,680
even be

345
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
improving our returns and distributing

346
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,000
them informationally in an appropriate

347
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,320
way so research that it's worth the time

348
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
to unpack that because it is kind of a

349
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,240
core idea for us

350
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,800
the non-profit registration updates the

351
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,480
phenotype of our lab

352
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,160
and provides us with several new

353
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,000
affordances and also access

354
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,320
to a few new niches so this is

355
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,360
information that was

356
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,920
in our mailing list if you didn't see it

357
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,560
but we're better able to scaffold

358
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,360
what our lab does essentially and we'll

359
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,199
be able to interact with some new

360
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,320
opportunities

361
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,880
like grants and institutional

362
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,160
partnerships

363
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,079
and be able to provide a really credible

364
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,600
and durable onboarding interface

365
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,560
and at this point we're opening the

366
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,760
invitation

367
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,199
to participation in our lab from

368
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,800
individuals with various kinds of

369
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,120
experience especially related to

370
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,519
non-profit management or research

371
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,880
program management

372
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,519
grant applications the kind of legal and

373
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,720
financial services

374
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,000
that uh support all these operations

375
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,720
as well as a few perhaps new kinds of

376
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,360
things like

377
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,920
crypto economics could we make

378
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,279
non-fungible tokens

379
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,720
nft could we use a governance approach

380
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,360
could we use

381
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,760
quadratic funding this is something

382
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,639
we're exploring

383
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,959
on a few different domains as well as

384
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,160
people who can help with

385
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,959
graphic design or user interface tool

386
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:43,760
development

387
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,320
so hopefully if you're curious about any

388
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
of these areas and want to

389
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
contribute to the actin flab there's a

390
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,519
spot for you stephen

391
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,240
i was just wondering if you could speak

392
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,839
a little bit more and you might talk

393
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,880
about you know the

394
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,639
oh nft the uh ontology formal documents

395
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,839
narrative

396
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,959
and tools um which is you know

397
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,519
kind of i actually met that recently

398
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,399
against my

399
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,000
infusions framework which was quite

400
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,720
useful um for how that gets embodied

401
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,440
so i noticed it's quite um a practical

402
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,160
way to

403
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,399
to leverage knowledge in a you know an

404
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,360
engineering way

405
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,440
so i was wondering that that's a

406
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,199
particular

407
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,279
focus as opposed to for instance people

408
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,000
doing a focus on how to leverage stuff

409
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,519
for use in dance events you know for

410
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,720
that that may they may take a slightly

411
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,839
more of a focus on um

412
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,920
affect and kinesthetics and stuff like

413
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,519
that so

414
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,440
would you better speak to that if that's

415
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,279
okay

416
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,120
alex would you like to give a first

417
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,839
comment on onft or i'm happy to

418
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,279
please go ahead okay so in our

419
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,079
september 2020 paper with some of us on

420
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,360
this conversation

421
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,839
we proposed the onft model which is

422
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,680
ontologies narratives formal documents

423
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,199
and tools

424
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,560
onft or font works both ways and

425
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,199
the idea is those are different domains

426
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,399
that describe

427
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,360
especially remote teams where the formal

428
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,759
specification of the team

429
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,040
is kind of a almost perfect map for the

430
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,800
actual team dynamics

431
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,240
so if you have an ontology of

432
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,320
communication like there's video

433
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,519
audio text and file sharing then

434
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,040
you can have a structured system for

435
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,800
thinking about those pieces

436
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,079
that's ontology it becomes manifest

437
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,880
and used through formal documents

438
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,320
whether it's a

439
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,440
spreadsheet or a cloud document as well

440
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,079
as tools

441
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,079
which kind of covers the whole range of

442
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,160
what we work on on our computer whether

443
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,240
it's an interactive cloud notebook

444
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,839
or docx that's sort of in the tools and

445
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,680
formal documents domain

446
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,720
structured by ontology and then

447
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,079
narrative is what threads it all

448
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,959
together

449
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,359
and active inference hopefully provides

450
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,959
us with a way of thinking about

451
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,400
multi-scale narratives and holding space

452
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:16,720
for

453
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,119
differences in narrative and perspective

454
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,039
so then we can have a team where

455
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,959
individuals have a different narrative

456
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,199
sense of the ontology or they understand

457
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,199
different aspects of the ontology

458
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,520
or they understand a different meaning

459
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,640
for the different tools

460
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,320
but what coordinates them is the

461
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,240
relationship of the tools

462
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,880
the ideas and the people so that's kind

463
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,799
of how we're using onft

464
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,799
to hopefully keep the human in mind

465
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,240
during the design

466
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,400
and maybe even integrate it with those

467
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
kinds of performance

468
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,480
uh insights that are really important

469
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,440
elsewhere alex

470
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,280
yeah i want to add that

471
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,480
we was thinking about it also in

472
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,080
connection to

473
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,120
communication structure for remote teams

474
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,320
and trying to find the ways how to

475
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,360
increase

476
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,400
efficiency of such communications for

477
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:10,880
people

478
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,720
with which is different languages which

479
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,200
have different cultural backgrounds and

480
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,000
all that

481
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,960
different difficulties that

482
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,039
that we meet when we start working

483
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,320
together

484
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,720
and we have that notion in the beginning

485
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,000
about uh

486
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,360
communication nightmare for especially

487
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,320
for

488
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,640
actually it's happening even in classic

489
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,120
form like in corporations

490
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,080
in big companies people trying to

491
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,600
discuss something but

492
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,799
they use they might use the same words

493
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,600
but just understand different by under

494
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,559
that words

495
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,840
and we was trying to find some object

496
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,520
that we can like make more formal

497
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,200
to and make explicit to think about

498
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,440
and maybe we will add something later

499
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,840
but for now that ontology formal

500
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,480
documents

501
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,600
those narratives looks like

502
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,280
basic object that we team need to pay

503
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,120
attention for

504
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,240
yep and it helps us generalize beyond

505
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,320
the language that we're using to deliver

506
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,280
a formal document

507
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,240
in so then adding a translation on a

508
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,919
cloud document or adding

509
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,400
text to speech or speech to text those

510
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,600
are not bolted on

511
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,760
second layers it's part of the delivery

512
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,600
mechanism for the information that

513
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,000
everybody

514
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,320
should be receiving in a given project

515
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,919
so we can incorporate

516
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,360
accessibility and differences in

517
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,840
people's tech setup into a fundamental

518
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,880
of the team

519
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,799
rather than imagining that there's some

520
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,320
single style of

521
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,840
default team member and then we're going

522
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,760
to have correction terms or something

523
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,360
like that

524
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,679
so here is a graphic of a few of the

525
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,360
parts of the lab and ecosystem we're

526
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,440
going to now go into

527
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,559
internal to the lab in q2 and

528
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,159
in q1 we have three organizational units

529
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:10,960
which are

530
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,360
dot edu education dot coms

531
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,000
communications and dot tools

532
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,440
and you'll see that dot coms

533
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,760
is having an interface with a live

534
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,799
stream like the one

535
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,240
right now which is the production of the

536
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,520
comms unit as well as comms

537
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,280
now and in the future potentially could

538
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,720
have interfaces

539
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,440
with broader communities adjacent

540
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,080
communities

541
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,159
um whether through the participants in

542
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,000
those communities like the blue square

543
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,440
on the right or whether to organizers

544
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,400
who then are able to participate in the

545
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,000
lab or somehow integrate active

546
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,520
inference into how they think about

547
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,039
their work

548
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,080
the live stream interfaces publicly so

549
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,799
that is

550
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,760
the external niche to the lab and that

551
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,720
includes

552
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,360
those who are learners and practitioners

553
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,720
of active inference

554
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,520
self-identified or otherwise as well as

555
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,320
those who are not

556
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,960
self-identified as active inference

557
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,440
learners and practitioners

558
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,559
edu also has an interface with a body of

559
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,120
knowledge

560
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,280
which we'll return to but that's an

561
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,120
ongoing project that will include

562
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,760
multiple

563
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,520
components and that's drawn from the

564
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,880
systems engineering

565
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,440
body of knowledge concept alex and then

566
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,000
anyone else

567
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,120
yeah this notion and with graphics for

568
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,400
interfaces it's not only from system

569
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,640
engineering but also we was trying to

570
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,600
apply it uh

571
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,760
concepts and understanding from active

572
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,039
inference

573
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,320
and to show that boundaries for us

574
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,320
as a lab and have an understanding that

575
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,320
such lab should have some interfaces to

576
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,080
environment and more but

577
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,240
as we understand it for example uh

578
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,640
interfaces should be connected to

579
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,480
communication units so

580
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,240
tools for example or edu shouldn't have

581
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,960
external connections just to have that

582
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,840
consistence

583
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,720
on the lab scale to understanding how

584
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,760
that communication

585
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,400
how it interfaces work and how we can

586
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,919
manage it

587
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,960
in most efficient way

588
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,640
cool any other thoughts here

589
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,400
otherwise stephen and then we'll head

590
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
into the units

591
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,120
well just to comment i like also you

592
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,400
refer to niche

593
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,880
there and i think talking about niches

594
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,320
and we talk about systems we've

595
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,880
talked about system boundaries and where

596
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,480
mike markov blanket

597
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,200
type interpretations been used so i

598
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,400
think

599
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,159
that way of thinking

600
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,960
is um we're kind of getting used to it

601
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,480
but actually it's kind of

602
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
quite unusual in a way there is some

603
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,520
work with niches

604
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,720
in um regimes some some

605
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,880
socio technical system work does use

606
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,440
regime but this ability to move

607
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
into thinking about things as a niche

608
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,880
types of niche

609
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,600
types of system having an internal state

610
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,000
that's

611
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,240
actually got an agent involved as well

612
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
at a smaller scale

613
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,520
and i think we're wrestling with that a

614
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,280
little bit exactly where that all lands

615
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,400
but i just thought i'd

616
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,880
notice because you use that term that's

617
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,960
been quite interesting

618
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,080
good point thanks yep we agree

619
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,400
thinking about interfaces is natural to

620
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,520
computer science

621
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,320
the idea of an api as well as to active

622
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,039
inference

623
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,600
so it's kind of like a bridge idea

624
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,640
between those two

625
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,000
ontologies or perspectives and

626
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,760
now we're seeing an increasing amount of

627
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,000
work from the computational the

628
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,200
ecological

629
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
all these different angles that are

630
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,360
coming together that

631
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,039
are describing systems the way that you

632
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,559
just laid out

633
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,840
okay so dot edu

634
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,919
is our first organizational unit

635
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,760
the goal of educationunit.edu

636
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,799
is to create a participatory

637
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,799
and dynamic active inference body of

638
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,360
knowledge so the body of knowledge

639
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,400
which we've described more

640
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,880
thoroughly in i think probably our first

641
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,159
round table

642
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,480
the body of knowledge is an idea drawn

643
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,400
from the systems engineering body of

644
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,679
knowledge and it includes

645
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,720
various kinds of products and enabling

646
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,320
architecture

647
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,720
all defined through interfaces and

648
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,760
relationships

649
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,120
with an ontology like this group creates

650
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,279
this one or this one consumes this one

651
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,320
pays for this one is paid by that one

652
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,640
and that allows us to have seemingly

653
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,000
disparate kinds of

654
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,080
units in the body of knowledge like

655
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,120
certification

656
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,919
practices competency training of course

657
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:52,720
educational

658
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,440
material and curriculum all these kinds

659
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:55,760
of

660
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,159
structures can exist within a broader

661
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:58,880
network

662
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
and we can identify where is something

663
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,960
needed where something redundant

664
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,799
where is something needing to be tweaked

665
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,360
and as far as our progress or actions on

666
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,880
that front

667
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,919
we have developed the ontology

668
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,840
a little bit which we'll walk through

669
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,760
and we'll also mention the ontology

670
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,200
working group

671
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,760
we've released our terms list v1 and

672
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,039
we're in the process of

673
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,760
updating terms to v2 with an increasing

674
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,799
number of language

675
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,360
translations and we'll cover the next

676
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,559
steps in a second

677
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,559
so here on 14 and 15

678
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,679
we're just showing a snapshot of

679
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,520
this document which everybody is welcome

680
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,720
to view

681
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,080
and comment on this is the first

682
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,120
tab of our working ontology document

683
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,159
and the first tab has the core terms

684
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,840
in green followed by their references

685
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,679
up to five per term at this point

686
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,480
and citable definitions where the term

687
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,279
is used

688
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,360
so not just papers where it's relevant

689
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,120
but actually where we can point to

690
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,679
and say the term was used in this way or

691
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,440
defined this way by these authors

692
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,919
at that time so this has been a big

693
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:14,960
literature

694
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,400
review effort and that's been quite fun

695
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,520
then on the second slide we have those

696
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,480
same exact

697
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,840
core terms and there's the introduction

698
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,080
of the columns reflecting

699
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,880
natural human language translations so

700
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,919
at this point

701
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,039
with the help of many on this call

702
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,080
we have russian portuguese spanish

703
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,679
french and italian all to reasonable

704
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,440
degree of completion and other ideas for

705
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,159
how we could

706
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,799
improve the state of those languages as

707
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:49,279
well as

708
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,559
introduce other languages and symbol

709
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,080
systems so we also have a supplementary

710
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,320
terms list which is sort of our holding

711
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,679
area for words that are

712
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,720
relevant but maybe not in the core

713
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,679
and one thing that we're looking to is

714
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,440
the kinds of governance mechanisms and

715
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
collective decision-making mechanisms

716
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,600
that would help us understand when to

717
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,440
elevate a term from the supplement

718
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,799
to the core and vice versa so any

719
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,480
comments on

720
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,960
just the terms translations references

721
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,799
definitions

722
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,279
alex i just want to share news

723
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,760
from yesterday that we have full

724
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,520
completion for portuguese and

725
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,640
russian nice crucial languages

726
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,159
um let's look at where this

727
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,720
ontology working document is in our

728
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,600
broader

729
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,120
past present and future so here

730
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,760
we have uh drawn from a figure a systems

731
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,559
engineering

732
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,080
dynamic life cycle ontology paper

733
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,240
from the left to the right there's a

734
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,080
continuum or a spectrum

735
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,279
of levels of formality of ontology

736
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,520
so the entire left side you can see is

737
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,279
defined as informal and lightweight

738
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,240
ontologies

739
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,000
whereas increasingly expressive and

740
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,480
formal ontologies and ontological

741
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,559
systems are towards the right

742
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,799
so in the q1 roundtable of 2021

743
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,760
what we had was a list of core and

744
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
supplemental english terms

745
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,640
so we were just then deciding what what

746
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,279
terms

747
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,000
should we make the first pass for core

748
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,600
terms

749
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,559
since then we have updated the term

750
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,760
membership we've added

751
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,799
terms as well as we've

752
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,799
started to think about how we can

753
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,480
clarify the distinction between core and

754
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,760
supplement

755
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,679
and what you've seen in these previous

756
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,600
two slides were the introduction of

757
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
references and definitions

758
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,159
which is as stated right now it's a

759
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:50,960
literature

760
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,520
quest but eventually we'll be looking to

761
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,919
synthesize and integrate definitions

762
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,120
and be able to say here is two senses of

763
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,520
this

764
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,600
term or this paper is using it in this

765
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,760
sense or even in this sentence it's used

766
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,880
in this way and then in the next

767
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,000
sentence it's used

768
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,880
in a different way we've also introduced

769
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,360
and really improved the translations

770
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,760
so that's something where everybody is

771
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,440
willing uh who's willing to

772
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,320
would be welcome to contribute and then

773
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:18,720
we've

774
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,559
continued our march from the terms to

775
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,120
the blue highlighted boxes which are web

776
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,080
directories

777
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,480
the references are a web directory they

778
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,240
point to links on the web

779
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,720
user classifications into the core and

780
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,159
supplement

781
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,840
data dictionaries and structured

782
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,080
glossaries which are describing

783
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,320
how definitions were used in papers

784
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,080
and then we have this sort of pink line

785
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,720
that's written as expert help and

786
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,320
ontology working group

787
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,919
and then here's ontology working group

788
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,919
like a train kind of pushing to the

789
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:54,960
right

790
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,360
and in the ontology working group where

791
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,720
we're working through

792
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,640
this awesome book by adam peace ontology

793
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,440
um we're going to be making that sort of

794
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,159
two hands

795
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,039
reaching out to each other so as we

796
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:09,600
improve

797
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,799
our ontological competence we're also

798
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,440
going to be

799
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,000
increasingly engaging with experts and

800
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,480
so

801
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,960
experts are welcome to assist whatever

802
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,520
their

803
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,240
level of interest is in active inference

804
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,919
and over the coming months

805
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,320
we're going to be working out in the

806
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,399
ontology working group

807
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,720
how we can be making an active inference

808
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,840
ontology

809
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,799
hello again yvonne

810
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,200
any other comments on this ontology

811
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,120
slide overall otherwise we can just

812
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,279
close and just say everyone's welcome to

813
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,399
get involved with project-based learning

814
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,720
and broadly this is knowledge

815
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,679
engineering

816
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,159
we're learning by doing and we're

817
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,159
learning by doing by engineering

818
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,799
and it's about language so especially

819
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,559
people who are interested in language

820
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,760
translations

821
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,799
if they see a language and they have a

822
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,640
friend or they know a language

823
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,519
that could be added there's just

824
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,360
millions to billions of people

825
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,320
who don't have the english skill per se

826
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:12,640
to

827
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,279
read the research literature so we can

828
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,159
reach out to them

829
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,159
and one way to do that is through

830
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,519
translation

831
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,039
we can explore definitions and

832
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,279
references better so for those who like

833
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,799
searching the literature for how things

834
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,120
were

835
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,399
said and meant edu will

836
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,399
as part of the body of knowledge focus

837
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,000
on curriculum developments

838
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,559
which is the structuring of those core

839
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,760
ideas

840
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,519
into curriculum that makes sense

841
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,240
and in our ontology working group where

842
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,360
we have a total

843
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,120
range of skills but we're all learning

844
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,600
by doing here and we're trying to

845
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,279
integrate best practices from the

846
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,640
ontology life cycle

847
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,279
models of systems engineering as well as

848
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,640
ontology developments

849
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,720
from sumo for example starting with a

850
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,080
list of core terms

851
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,320
and a narrative that concisely describes

852
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,200
the space

853
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,480
steven and then anyone else and also

854
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,840
comment how

855
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,880
it's actually been very useful from a

856
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,159
knowledge synthesis

857
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,000
just a learning perspective to go

858
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,279
through the terms

859
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,640
and see how they fit together and

860
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,000
get a bigger picture on what can be

861
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,279
quite overwhelming if you're just

862
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,200
reading papers

863
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,559
so things like what are

864
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,840
action states what are sensory states

865
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,039
and then you start to see there's a

866
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,519
number of these types of what's it to be

867
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,159
a non-equilibrium steady state so those

868
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,519
questions

869
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,519
are starting to sit in the background

870
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,120
we're holding back from getting too

871
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,399
sucked in by them

872
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,640
but there's certain patterns i think

873
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,080
that have come up with the

874
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,640
terms which has been quite useful

875
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,919
especially having done these live

876
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,519
streams with different people over the

877
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,640
last

878
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,960
year and seeing how some of those same

879
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,320
um ontological questions have come up so

880
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,519
i just thought i'd mention that thanks

881
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,480
uh yvonne did you want to add something

882
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,440
there yep go for it

883
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,960
yeah thanks i just want to

884
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,880
mention that this schema is quite

885
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,320
uh quite linear and it has

886
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,679
a lot of checkpoints and

887
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,200
during this quarter we made uh

888
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,799
for six i guess

889
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,480
six points and

890
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,919
if we have

891
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,200
we will have the same

892
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,000
the same speed

893
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,880
might be we did

894
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,120
we will we will make all all

895
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,039
this ontological work but but i think

896
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,519
now we uh just

897
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,120
from starting point and we have

898
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,918
a lot of

899
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,760
difficulty and interesting work within

900
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,960
this

901
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,320
anthology working group

902
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,679
thanks totally agree this um shouldn't

903
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,719
be understood as us being 40

904
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,280
done even when we're way way on the

905
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,320
right side

906
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,639
we still won't even be a little bit done

907
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,320
because there's so much to do

908
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,800
and also it's so true that whatever

909
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,719
level of skill we entered into

910
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,760
this ontology working group with we've

911
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,719
all learned about domains that

912
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,719
we just weren't working on so we weren't

913
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,320
on projects that involved

914
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,879
translation and just the issues that

915
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,079
were raised

916
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,879
regarding the subtlety of translation

917
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,800
and about how terms were used through

918
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,599
different

919
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,000
epochs in the literature these are

920
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,599
insights that just cannot be

921
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,000
achieved outside of learning by doing

922
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,520
there's no one who is waiting to tell us

923
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,599
that information and then we called them

924
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,160
this was like team working and finding

925
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,880
out cool

926
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,920
things about active inference

927
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,359
okay so on to comms

928
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,240
so this live stream a comms presentation

929
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,960
the goal of comms is to organize the

930
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,680
labs

931
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,200
internal projects and activities and

932
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,400
that's driven by an active inference and

933
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,359
communication

934
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,480
oriented worldview so for example

935
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,560
um a world unto themselves active

936
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,560
inference and communication one of the

937
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,760
early papers we read we started to see

938
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,400
the organization of teams especially

939
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,440
remote teams

940
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,920
as being related to the structure and

941
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,079
the quality of communication

942
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,640
so just like the capacity of the thing

943
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,480
on your desk to be a computer

944
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,240
is related to how the wires are

945
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,240
connected which is a communications

946
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,200
network

947
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,680
the structure or the capacity of a

948
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,119
social system

949
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,680
is related to the communication patterns

950
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,040
that it is using

951
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,320
at rest or in activity or

952
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,359
during realignment so communication

953
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,320
engineering is a key principle that

954
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,000
integrates what's happening

955
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,160
inside of the computer to between

956
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,119
computers

957
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,720
to the human in the computer the human

958
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,960
and the human computer in the middle

959
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,839
all these combinations are subsets of

960
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,280
broader ways of thinking about

961
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,520
communications architecture

962
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,640
so that's how we think about

963
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,040
communications internally and then

964
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,680
we of course think about communication

965
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,119
on the interface between

966
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,720
our lab and external stakeholders

967
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,440
because comms is in charge of carrying

968
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
out all the forms of communication with

969
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,560
external entities so comms is the one

970
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
who picks up the phone when you email

971
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,200
activeinference gmail.com it is the

972
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,640
interface that we have

973
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,280
and then information can be passed to

974
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,760
other

975
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,200
organizational units or roles as needed

976
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,720
our progress on this front was we

977
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,880
continue the podcast and blue you're

978
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,320
welcome to add anything

979
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,599
about the podcast we also continued

980
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,000
and developed with the help of

981
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,280
especially dean

982
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,320
and steven and blue on the live stream

983
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,440
where the dot zero video is becoming

984
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,480
contextualizing and a lot more it helps

985
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,200
us

986
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,720
learn the paper and prepare for the

987
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,560
discussions and that's really been

988
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,680
allowing us

989
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,079
in the point one and the point two along

990
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,520
with authors who

991
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,680
in almost every case have just been

992
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,680
extremely generous with their time

993
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,560
and in their interactions with our lab

994
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,800
it's helped the dot one and dot two

995
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,760
be real jumping off points like hop skip

996
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,720
and a jump

997
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,040
so a triple jump with the three sections

998
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,000
rather than just

999
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,760
logging through the content three times

1000
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,119
the same way

1001
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,960
and we'll talk more about it in a second

1002
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,040
but we also continued several of our

1003
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,440
streams um blue what would you like to

1004
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,200
add there

1005
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,720
yeah just about the podcast i think we

1006
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,240
were just launching it

1007
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,480
um in the very like in the last

1008
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,320
quarterly roundtable like maybe had one

1009
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,160
episode out or maybe not but we've been

1010
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,119
trying to release them

1011
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,920
weekly still trying to get interface

1012
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,280
with itunes but

1013
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,320
it's up on android uh google podcast

1014
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,160
um and one there's one more platform

1015
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,359
that it's on but it should be available

1016
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,480
and it's available through

1017
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,920
the rss feed so there's a like

1018
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,520
sequential episodes that are already

1019
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,359
ready just backlogged i'm just releasing

1020
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,119
them weekly to try to make it

1021
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,119
like more regular as i remember to

1022
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,400
release some weekly like

1023
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,920
some i'm trying to do it on the weekend

1024
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,359
but sometimes it's like tuesday like oh

1025
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,240
no i forgot

1026
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,680
uh or it's like i'm going out of town

1027
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,119
this weekend so i'll release it early

1028
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:41,440
but

1029
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,240
um hopefully that'll be automated at one

1030
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:44,640
point

1031
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,000
also so just update there cool

1032
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,320
and the podcast is awesome for those who

1033
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,280
haven't listened

1034
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,520
it takes audio sections from live

1035
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,320
streams

1036
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,920
earlier ones maybe that you haven't

1037
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,359
listened to and

1038
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,320
it slightly recombines them and provides

1039
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,240
introductory context

1040
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,800
that makes it a lot more direct

1041
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,760
listening

1042
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,200
and so to pick out the the trail to walk

1043
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,160
from just the map is an awesome skill

1044
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,560
and so thanks blue again for that

1045
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,400
yeah it's also just good for people who

1046
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,640
are maybe not looking at a computer you

1047
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,359
know i mean it's

1048
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,160
like if you're it's it's not an attempt

1049
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,240
to really get into the technical

1050
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,960
um like dive into active inference so

1051
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,520
it's very

1052
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,000
much just like an interesting discussion

1053
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,599
because like even though

1054
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,599
these concepts can be very technical the

1055
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,280
fvp and active inference and there's

1056
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,000
lots of

1057
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,240
equations in math going on and we are

1058
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,000
going through a paper this is like

1059
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,240
you can step away from the paper and and

1060
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,760
just listen to like the interesting

1061
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,720
conversations

1062
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,640
that have been sparked by the paper

1063
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,240
which that's kind of cool too to just

1064
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,920
see how people approach it and how they

1065
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,280
think about it

1066
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,160
and also um in many of the episodes

1067
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,760
somebody's introduction

1068
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,760
is placed before the first time they

1069
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,960
speak so

1070
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,560
like a question will be asked and then

1071
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,160
it will go to the introduction which

1072
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,960
probably happened

1073
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,720
20 minutes earlier in the stream and

1074
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,079
then someone says i'm in

1075
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,359
xyz area working on this topic and what

1076
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,040
i think about culture and communication

1077
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,760
and then it's like

1078
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,560
ah that connected the dots because that

1079
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,319
was very linearly distant

1080
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,400
and during the stream listening to it it

1081
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,880
doesn't always pop out that same way

1082
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,359
steven and then or blue and then yeah

1083
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,640
yeah let me just say one more thing

1084
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,760
so i am working on um

1085
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,319
like smoothing out the audio because we

1086
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,240
all have different microphones and as

1087
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,200
like i'm cutting

1088
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,599
different like excerpts out sometimes

1089
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,079
the audio is not like smooth so if

1090
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,680
anybody has any resources

1091
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,240
or skill like with audacity maybe i'm

1092
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,599
doing what i can with obs

1093
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,760
and the filters in there but um if

1094
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,280
anybody has any pointers on how to

1095
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,440
smooth out the audio like i'm so happy

1096
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:49,839
to

1097
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,200
uh take that advice on thanks

1098
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,400
stephen yeah good

1099
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,520
good good point i i just wanted to add

1100
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,480
that i think it's really useful for

1101
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,160
being able to go to just certain bits

1102
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,520
and re-listen to them

1103
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,359
because often it's really good to see

1104
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,760
the or to see or go back and see the

1105
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,359
whole of the um

1106
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,760
live stream but sometimes the useful bit

1107
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,599
is there's a certain

1108
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,440
20 seconds and sometimes it's useful

1109
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,280
just to listen again and again and it's

1110
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,920
like oh i get it now you know or

1111
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,800
because it's just too much sometimes the

1112
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,480
first time you listen to it and

1113
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,920
you know sometimes people probably see

1114
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,160
our eyes going a little bit panicky when

1115
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,440
it starts

1116
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,880
trying to track what exactly has just

1117
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,040
been said so sometimes though having the

1118
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,920
chance to

1119
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,560
yeah listen to it a few times because

1120
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,560
once you get one bit then you start to

1121
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,040
unlock

1122
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,440
the other pieces start to make sense and

1123
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,839
that that's quite useful so

1124
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,680
so yeah thanks for doing that blue it's

1125
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,359
really helpful

1126
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,079
yep it's like a many coats of paint on a

1127
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,119
really big

1128
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,680
mural so okay communication we're

1129
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,640
thinking about it

1130
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,680
this way instead of this other way okay

1131
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,440
got it and then you hear communication

1132
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,800
in another context so

1133
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,040
we add to the depth of our understanding

1134
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,560
we as we link

1135
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,520
ideas and see people who have come to

1136
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,040
the ideas from a lot of different

1137
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,240
angles here is some of our

1138
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,960
live streams that are just screenshotted

1139
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,760
out

1140
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,440
so we're up to almost 60

1141
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,640
after we do 23.1 and 2 in the coming

1142
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,599
weeks

1143
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,200
almost 60 classical live streams

1144
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,480
that's the regular tuesdays session

1145
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,720
we're up to seven completed guest

1146
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,839
streams

1147
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,119
so in the past quarter we've had some

1148
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,960
excellent discussion on the technical

1149
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,839
side and also on the technical critique

1150
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,359
side which is very important for the

1151
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,839
field in five guest stream

1152
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,079
from martin beale and then in guest

1153
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:50,880
stream seven

1154
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,640
with miguel aguilera and others and also

1155
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,960
with odyssey unica heard about

1156
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,440
co-embodiment and about first prior so

1157
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,560
expanding the gamut and those guest

1158
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,760
streams are

1159
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,640
are open invitation to anybody who wants

1160
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,160
to present on something that's

1161
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,160
relevant to be brought to the lab and

1162
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,839
hopefully we'll continue to show that

1163
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,319
there's many ways to do a guest stream

1164
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,640
in the model streaming just a couple of

1165
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,599
days ago

1166
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,800
we had uh ozone catal and tim verbellen

1167
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,480
talking about robotics and that was some

1168
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,000
of our first foray

1169
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,280
into robotics and it was just awesome

1170
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,920
and inspiring to see a little robot in

1171
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,119
the aisle

1172
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,839
and to understand how all of these

1173
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,599
different sensors could be

1174
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,400
integrated on the fly and then to hear

1175
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,160
their distinction between reinforcement

1176
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,839
learning and active inference

1177
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,079
so that's some awesome engineering work

1178
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,119
and it's exciting

1179
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,520
we also had a model stream 2 with noor

1180
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,560
sajid and philip

1181
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,000
ball also extremely helpful

1182
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,240
from their demystifying active inference

1183
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,160
paper so

1184
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,200
cool streams there we had six streams

1185
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,200
with john boyk four background streams

1186
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,160
where we went through on a jamboard his

1187
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,520
tripartite

1188
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,240
paper on sustainability and social

1189
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:10,800
systems

1190
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,680
change and science-driven transformation

1191
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,560
so john just

1192
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,200
really took it to the next level with

1193
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,400
with an author

1194
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,640
engaging with us before the guest

1195
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,599
appearances

1196
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,200
and then we were able to have a dot one

1197
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,640
and a dot two that was also

1198
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,200
really interesting and then on the

1199
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,240
bottom left there

1200
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,040
we've had two math streams both with

1201
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,319
shawna dobson

1202
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,400
and then we'll have another one with

1203
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,440
more of a group

1204
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,920
discussion with blue and shauna and

1205
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,480
others

1206
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,920
next week and so math stream again just

1207
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,160
there's so many cool ideas that come

1208
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,040
into play

1209
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,319
like dynamical systems or control theory

1210
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,920
category theory those are big topics

1211
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,520
you know you could have a whole section

1212
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,520
of a bookstore or a whole

1213
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,560
major on those kinds of topics and

1214
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,640
math is a big area math is the

1215
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,079
generalization layer

1216
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,480
for science in a lot of ways so we can

1217
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,760
work towards

1218
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,520
each of these series being able to

1219
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,839
raise up different aspects of active

1220
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:12,800
inference

1221
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,960
as well as be like a two directional

1222
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,839
highway

1223
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,680
connecting those who are interested in

1224
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,599
active inference to ideas that they

1225
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,079
might not have considered or known about

1226
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,920
and also people who are considering

1227
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,240
those ideas every single day

1228
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,480
bringing them a new perspective on

1229
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,599
active inference

1230
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,839
so yvonne and then stephen

1231
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,400
yeah thank you i just uh want to

1232
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,240
totally recommend for all who

1233
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,079
just starts to deep the active

1234
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,520
inference uh to

1235
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,040
watch uh dots uh

1236
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,240
zero streams with uh

1237
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,359
uh with our colleagues then dean and

1238
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,240
blue

1239
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,759
and uh say

1240
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,359
thank thank you guys it's uh

1241
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,800
it's totally helpful streams and

1242
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,839
uh for me now it's preferable

1243
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,440
type of watching streams it's uh

1244
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,560
just uh online youtube because when i

1245
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,520
watch it

1246
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,720
online with the room with

1247
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,640
people inside the room i

1248
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,560
often find myself lost so

1249
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,839
when i when i see it on youtube i have a

1250
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:38,960
chance

1251
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,280
to go back and after that just

1252
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,720
on doubles double speed to

1253
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,839
get it all almost uh

1254
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,359
online thank you yvonne

1255
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,680
stephen and then anyone else maybe dean

1256
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,880
if you have a thought on the

1257
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,319
dot zeros as well but stephen yeah

1258
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,240
those dot zeros are really helpful and

1259
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,800
it's been really really

1260
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,000
exciting to have these real specialists

1261
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:08,960
in math

1262
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,040
so he said this we think that active

1263
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,880
inference has got a lot of math but then

1264
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,280
these are the people that are more into

1265
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,119
the math than even the active inference

1266
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,800
that the active inference people are

1267
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,079
often talking to

1268
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,200
you know in some and to have them given

1269
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,640
a voice and i think they really

1270
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,480
appreciated that but to have a voice and

1271
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,599
to be questioned

1272
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,440
and to be brought back the other way i

1273
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,800
think it's really helpful because i

1274
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,359
think

1275
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,839
you see there's a lot of people coming

1276
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:34,720
attacking

1277
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,720
the word attacking is i'm not being too

1278
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,160
dramatic with that but

1279
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,000
attacking active influence from a math

1280
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,599
formalism perspective

1281
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,160
and so to have it just coming from

1282
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:44,640
people

1283
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,160
and they talk about their own area their

1284
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,079
own fields of math which might have

1285
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,839
stuff which isn't so clear they're

1286
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:50,559
questioning

1287
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,000
they're trying to explore particularly

1288
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,680
category theory stuff

1289
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,400
right on the edge i think that's really

1290
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,520
really valuable

1291
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,599
um and i think that's going to be

1292
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,440
something that i haven't seen anywhere

1293
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:01,839
else

1294
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,960
so i think that's really great yep it's

1295
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,400
been really fun

1296
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,839
so anyone else want to add a comment on

1297
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,119
just the

1298
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,839
live stream um repertoire or diversity

1299
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:14,240
dean

1300
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,279
and then anyone else

1301
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,640
yeah thanks ivan and thank you to steven

1302
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,680
and blue and

1303
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,280
daniel and anybody else that's done

1304
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,720
those um

1305
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,480
point zeros um so

1306
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,559
i i just wanna talk for one second about

1307
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,640
the getting lost piece i think that's

1308
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,160
something that should i know it doesn't

1309
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,319
sound like a doesn't sound fun who likes

1310
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,000
to be disoriented

1311
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,480
um and if you are if that's kind of

1312
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,119
personality you are the disorientation

1313
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,480
is your is your drip i guess then that's

1314
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,240
that's cool but for most people they

1315
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,599
want to kind of get the

1316
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,520
control back today being a perfect

1317
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,359
example i didn't have

1318
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,760
the slides i had to figure out how to

1319
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,079
get the youtube on a second

1320
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,440
window and turn the sound off and so

1321
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,440
i was dealing with my own markup blanket

1322
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,480
for the first

1323
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,520
25 minutes of this and i think

1324
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,359
one of the things about the point zero

1325
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,680
is and i i think it really matters

1326
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,359
is that nobody wants to be

1327
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,319
serially disoriented people want to be

1328
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,240
able to get into that place where they

1329
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,760
find themselves reoriented and i think

1330
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,760
however we go forward with the point

1331
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,440
zeros we always want to kind of keep

1332
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,000
that

1333
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,160
front of mind we want to really be

1334
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,079
explicit about the fact that

1335
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,520
at any given moment uh your ability to

1336
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,720
sort of keep up

1337
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,640
i keep talking about this all the time

1338
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,400
the ability to sort of keep up with the

1339
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,119
rate

1340
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,319
at which this information is

1341
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,880
unfolding isn't you're not always going

1342
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,040
to be able to keep your optimal grip or

1343
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,040
hold the butterfly or insert metaphor

1344
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,200
here thankfully we have daniel who's

1345
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,960
really good at metaphors

1346
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,000
um but most of the time if you can't

1347
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,920
bring it off the abstraction shelf

1348
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,400
and put it into some sort of material

1349
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,000
sense of something that you're familiar

1350
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,640
with you're

1351
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,960
constantly feeling like you're catching

1352
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,680
up and so

1353
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,960
i know there's going to be a lot of time

1354
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,800
spent on getting some sort of a

1355
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,800
standardization process and i

1356
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,640
i know i understand that you're trying

1357
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,240
to create

1358
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,319
an engineering piece that's not too

1359
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,520
instructionalist and his more

1360
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,280
interactionist and all that that stuff

1361
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,440
and i think that's that's happening

1362
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,000
but i think at the base of it it's just

1363
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
just a real empathy for the fact that

1364
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,640
people

1365
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,640
who do join i joined this part way

1366
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,720
through this quarter

1367
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,640
so i'm like a two-thirds of a quarter

1368
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,480
kind of guy right now that's why i

1369
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,680
kept my mouth shut um but i think we

1370
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,359
have that empathy for people

1371
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,119
who jump into this regardless of what

1372
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,240
their experience level is um i just

1373
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,400
think that that's um

1374
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,520
i think that's going to be really good

1375
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,920
in terms of maintaining and

1376
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,920
maybe building on this in terms of more

1377
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,559
people feeling comfortable with

1378
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,559
like me i don't even like to open my

1379
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,160
mouth in these situations but

1380
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,319
you guys have pulled it out of me so i'm

1381
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:11,440
just trying to figure out why that

1382
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,119
happened and i think it's because

1383
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,800
there's a certain kindness and empathy

1384
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,079
thanks dean yvonne

1385
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,079
i think all time long the

1386
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,280
lap will be exist

1387
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,680
every every time will be uh

1388
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,200
people who just started to

1389
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,920
try and understand active influence and

1390
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,359
and in this case where we will be

1391
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:48,720
in in the same point

1392
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,480
as as we now

1393
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,839
as we are now thanks

1394
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:59,599
blue so just in response to

1395
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:03,119
to dean i'm i'm like way farther in

1396
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,160
right maybe like

1397
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,599
i don't know nine months or something

1398
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,000
into the active inference study and

1399
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,440
um i still feel like i'm catching up so

1400
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,640
i think it has to do with your

1401
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,400
background there's like a relational

1402
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,200
framework

1403
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,480
we're all coming from different

1404
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,480
perspectives some people are well-versed

1405
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,400
in philosophy or mathematics

1406
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,640
or for me it's neuroscience so whatever

1407
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,720
your background is like you kind of can

1408
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,359
fit into the active inference from that

1409
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:28,400
angle but then like

1410
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,160
you're still trying to catch up in every

1411
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,000
other angle like i don't know anything

1412
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,839
about philosophy so it's all like new to

1413
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,760
me um and some of like the

1414
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,839
like i'm good with math but not like the

1415
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:40,000
formalisms of math and how like

1416
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,280
you know there's lots of symbols in

1417
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,200
there i'm like what does that even mean

1418
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,920
um so you know i think we're all kind of

1419
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,359
approaching it from a different space

1420
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:48,000
i'm still

1421
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,359
i still feel like i'm catching up all

1422
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,119
the time so i don't know if that feeling

1423
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,559
is ever going to go away i

1424
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,440
i kind of hope not

1425
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,480
nice totally agreed it's not a uh

1426
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,040
finished

1427
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,200
skyscraper it's not like everybody who

1428
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,119
has caught up is waiting on the 100th

1429
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:03,760
floor

1430
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,920
just laughing or something like that

1431
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,760
it's like a diffusion of an

1432
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,800
ink spill and so is any

1433
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,440
ink molecule catching up with what the

1434
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,319
edge

1435
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,160
well if they want to they could probably

1436
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,160
get there in time

1437
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,880
and um those questions what is active

1438
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,640
inference and how do we apply it just

1439
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,240
like what is complexity

1440
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,800
how do we apply complexity those are the

1441
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,440
questions

1442
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,200
that bring in an introductory

1443
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,400
person and also remind those who have

1444
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:34,800
been

1445
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,559
in the area a long time to have a

1446
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:37,839
beginner's mind

1447
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,839
so having a question that can be

1448
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,119
understood on multiple

1449
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,200
levels is really important for

1450
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,960
integrating the community

1451
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,319
because it's not like there's one

1452
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,000
question that gets you in the door

1453
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,440
and then we switch out the question for

1454
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,119
another question later

1455
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,559
we can be working as an integrated whole

1456
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,319
on what active inference is clarifying

1457
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,000
that for ourselves and

1458
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,079
through our um constructed niche stephen

1459
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,880
yeah i think that also dean makes quite

1460
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,599
a good point

1461
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,280
that the new affordance of the dot zero

1462
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,640
to help that orientation process

1463
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,119
it does help because often we're

1464
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,800
bringing someone in for the first time

1465
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,160
to meet us to share a paper and we may

1466
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,160
have slides we've prepared they may want

1467
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,680
to suddenly bring in some other slides

1468
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,880
because a couple of days before they

1469
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,200
suddenly had a synthesis themselves

1470
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,640
so having that dot zero is quite a nice

1471
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,800
way to sort of

1472
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,440
like you had in mind there as as a way

1473
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,240
to

1474
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,280
orientate people and maybe even feed

1475
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,559
a couple of um bones so to speak for

1476
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:43,760
people to chew on

1477
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,599
for the for their journey even if it

1478
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,160
doesn't go into all the details so maybe

1479
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,599
we'll learn some strategies or

1480
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,280
how dot zeros work and how to

1481
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,920
become more expert at using those

1482
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,440
opportunities

1483
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,319
yep we hopefully show the authors and

1484
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:02,799
our

1485
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,960
participatory audience that we're taking

1486
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,000
it seriously

1487
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,680
we haven't just asked them three months

1488
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,760
ago to show up at a random link and then

1489
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,400
we didn't think about it before then

1490
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,720
it's also the work that we have to do to

1491
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,119
have the slides and the fluidity

1492
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,720
ready and it does so many things and

1493
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,319
dot zero the prerequisite for

1494
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,160
participating isn't understanding the

1495
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:24,799
paper

1496
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,480
you'll find there was papers where we

1497
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,200
just traced out the section titles and

1498
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:29,920
said okay

1499
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,280
we want to learn about that we want to

1500
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,040
learn about that we're curious about

1501
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:33,520
this

1502
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,799
so those who can um

1503
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:39,200
come in a live stream and be curious or

1504
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,799
can assist in the slides if they don't

1505
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,680
want to come on

1506
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,480
live that could include every single

1507
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,359
background

1508
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:47,680
because we're not evaluating on a rubric

1509
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,599
of how tall are you on the active

1510
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,040
inference understanding scale which

1511
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,119
doesn't even exist at this point

1512
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,920
so cool about the dot zeros let's talk

1513
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,720
about

1514
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,839
another production of comms that will be

1515
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:03,040
the karl fristin mini symposium on june

1516
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:03,680
21st

1517
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,720
2021 so this is going to be and anyone's

1518
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,160
welcome to raise their hand and give a

1519
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,520
thought i'll just give kind of a

1520
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,559
logistical overview carl has written to

1521
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:12,960
us

1522
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,240
and said um in fancy italics

1523
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,480
i generally find these kinds of sessions

1524
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,359
most productive

1525
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,559
if we are i am in response mode and deal

1526
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,000
with questions that people bring to the

1527
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,799
table

1528
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:27,520
so to that end we've decided to

1529
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,280
structure the symposium

1530
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,400
along three sessions each driven by

1531
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,200
one of our organizational unit and then

1532
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,319
we've also

1533
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:39,200
been soliciting and compiling and

1534
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,000
integrating

1535
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,280
a lot of awesome questions so everybody

1536
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,520
here has helped uh generate questions

1537
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,119
and maria thanks so much for

1538
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,480
also helping on a few other aspects

1539
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,880
for anybody who wants to get involved

1540
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,559
there's a google form they can fill out

1541
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,240
if they want to stay updated when the

1542
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,599
videos are released

1543
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,280
it won't be live streamed but we'll

1544
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,000
release the videos shortly after

1545
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,680
and it's an opportunity if somebody

1546
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,000
wants to co-organize with us

1547
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,880
on this event and then be able to

1548
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,040
participate in the proceedings live

1549
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,079
that's totally an option and

1550
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,559
yes we're mentioning it on this live

1551
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:17,359
stream

1552
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:20,319
because we want to solicit the kinds of

1553
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:21,359
questions

1554
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:24,640
and foci for this event that would be

1555
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,599
most becoming of the special opportunity

1556
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:28,799
that it is

1557
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:32,400
so anyone want to add a thought

1558
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,839
on what might be exciting about this

1559
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,880
carl first in symposium it's also a

1560
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,319
little bit like our end of

1561
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:43,839
semester um moment

1562
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,280
so it'll be a amazing first semester

1563
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,000
and then we'll pull back for a few weeks

1564
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,720
continuing

1565
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,880
our operations and learning but

1566
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,200
preparing for the next semester to begin

1567
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,319
in august

1568
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,960
but it will be an awesome way to end the

1569
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,720
semester stephen and then

1570
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,079
yvonne and then anyone else yeah well

1571
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:05,119
i'm hoping

1572
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,680
carl fristan be really interested by the

1573
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,240
interdisciplinarity or trans

1574
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,240
disciplinarity of the uh

1575
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,319
the participants that are in this mix

1576
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,240
that we've been sort of

1577
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,680
sort of inside and exploring so

1578
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,720
i'm really curious how um

1579
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,920
we can bring those kind of

1580
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,440
applied questions to the table um

1581
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,799
and keep it all within um sort of a

1582
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,400
manageable

1583
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,760
scope because uh we're seeing so many

1584
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,880
things that could come up

1585
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,359
right and there's there's a lot of huge

1586
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,480
areas so

1587
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,920
i think as we start to refine the vision

1588
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,920
of active inference lab that also is

1589
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:48,480
happening

1590
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,680
is helping a little bit give him an

1591
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,920
anchor to where we're coming from so

1592
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,000
um i'm looking forward to this next

1593
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
couple of weeks as it starts to

1594
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,920
shape up totally agreed thank you

1595
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,319
uh yvonne and then if anyone else wants

1596
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,599
to add a comment

1597
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,040
yeah thank you uh

1598
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,640
to meet uh carl uh

1599
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,000
here in lab it's a very

1600
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,359
big pleasure big honor and saying

1601
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:22,480
thanks for all participants and for all

1602
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,680
guests

1603
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,480
that we have carlos attention

1604
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,559
and for a community as well

1605
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:35,599
as like other

1606
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,040
other community we we can have some

1607
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,520
special

1608
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,040
special event for one one year to

1609
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:51,760
have carl one once a year it will be

1610
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,559
like like our holiday

1611
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:01,280
cool thank you dean

1612
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,760
one of the things i want my

1613
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,079
participating in this is to get

1614
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,480
hopefully some more insights because i

1615
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,960
did a lot of programming

1616
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,559
using active inference before

1617
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:18,880
i joined this and

1618
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,720
most of the time my colleagues i

1619
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,960
couldn't i couldn't even broach the idea

1620
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,040
of active inference with them because

1621
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,079
they were so this was so in

1622
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:30,559
their opinion this was so out there that

1623
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:31,839
it wasn't even as

1624
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:33,920
accessible to them and i understand that

1625
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,839
this process here is to

1626
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,640
try and build a foundation and one of

1627
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,240
the things i'd like to talk to dr

1628
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,680
fursten about is

1629
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,799
so when does this

1630
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:48,079
when does this become more available to

1631
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,319
the general masses because i i truly

1632
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:51,200
believe

1633
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,280
you know based on the conversation of

1634
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,280
the last live stream

1635
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,640
there's still things that are being done

1636
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,720
every single day

1637
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,160
just because that's the way we've always

1638
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,319
done it and i think what he's

1639
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,799
introduced is some new ways of looking

1640
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:06,559
at things not to discard everything that

1641
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:07,119
was

1642
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:08,960
ever been done because that's not very

1643
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,960
respectful but

1644
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,119
i would really like to know how you can

1645
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:14,799
make this accessible so that when you're

1646
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:16,240
sitting in your backyard

1647
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,960
having some pops with some friends you

1648
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:19,520
you

1649
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,359
don't even want to talk about it because

1650
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,680
even though you find it super exciting

1651
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,640
um

1652
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,480
they look at you like you just grew a

1653
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,000
third eye and

1654
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,400
what i just came here to relax right

1655
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,240
because i think part of this

1656
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,839
for a lot of people is um

1657
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:37,520
it sounds really really cool and

1658
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,040
interesting but it also sounds like you

1659
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,839
need

1660
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:43,839
erickson's 10 000 hours just to begin

1661
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:46,079
looking at it with any degree of

1662
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:46,960
sentience

1663
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,599
so talking to dr firsten about how we

1664
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,520
make that

1665
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,200
that ant hill a little bit more

1666
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,000
accessible would be really cool

1667
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,599
cool for some reason sitting in the

1668
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,280
backyard it just made me think of

1669
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,480
some friends they're watching a bird are

1670
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,920
they going to understand the birds

1671
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,880
behavior

1672
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,680
in terms of reward maximization or will

1673
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,760
they understand the bird's behavior

1674
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,160
in terms of reducing its uncertainty

1675
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:12,960
about its

1676
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,359
generative model and its niche and the

1677
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,039
evolution of birds

1678
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:20,319
or will it be framed in the economic

1679
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,319
quote rational agent reinforcement

1680
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:23,680
learning framework

1681
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,839
so the shift could take place in the

1682
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:27,200
backyard as well

1683
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,960
stephen yeah and i think that's a good

1684
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:31,599
point

1685
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,119
that uh those different ways of seeing

1686
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:37,599
things and of course active inference

1687
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,680
in application it moves to approximate

1688
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,359
each of those at different times so i

1689
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,680
think that's what's quite interesting is

1690
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,760
um the general desire to give someone

1691
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,839
the answer

1692
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,920
is so ingrained in our culture because

1693
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,920
we happen to think we've got the answer

1694
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,640
to everything

1695
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,440
at some subliminal level so we're we're

1696
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,559
a little bit trapped

1697
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,480
and we all are to some extent in that

1698
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,079
because it's so ingrained even though we

1699
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:05,839
try not to be

1700
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:09,440
and therefore this idea

1701
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,039
that this question about you know

1702
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,400
what's this more like

1703
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,400
gets gets um gets into that so maybe

1704
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,119
having

1705
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:24,880
some different types of work around the

1706
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,039
types of metaphors the types of examples

1707
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,280
he has that classic one with the cat

1708
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,640
that looks like a the cat's ears that

1709
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,720
which in the shadow looks like a wolf

1710
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,000
howling right

1711
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,480
and then you realize you know but at the

1712
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,000
end of the day it did the job

1713
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,559
so you know there may be some of these

1714
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:44,000
questions around

1715
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,640
the sort of what would we say about this

1716
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,400
in the back garden could be actually

1717
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,160
quite useful because i've had this very

1718
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,520
similar

1719
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,559
trouble in many different ways and you

1720
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:54,799
know

1721
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:56,559
sometimes you just wish i hadn't brought

1722
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,960
it up you know because

1723
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,720
but that that is changing now

1724
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,160
yep fun stuff um okay and then

1725
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,599
just anyone raise their hand if they

1726
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:09,039
want to add anything else oh yeah alex

1727
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:11,520
go for it

1728
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,760
yeah thanks i just want uh to add

1729
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,039
shortly

1730
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,440
uh we had the red conclusion in some

1731
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,400
discussion that

1732
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,680
person need to be active inferent

1733
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,799
before he started to learn

1734
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:27,680
active influence right if someone the

1735
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,720
first question

1736
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,480
is how is this going to increase my

1737
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,160
paycheck tomorrow

1738
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,640
you know that's easy to answer it won't

1739
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,280
but

1740
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,280
for those who are wanting to reduce

1741
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,520
their uncertainty and understanding that

1742
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,079
exploratory play you know early on

1743
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:43,760
playing with a toy just like i'm playing

1744
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,640
with now

1745
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,319
it's exploratory and then maybe i'll

1746
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:48,000
make something rewarding with it later

1747
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:48,799
or maybe not

1748
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,720
maybe i never need to turn the dial that

1749
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,480
way and so people who

1750
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,079
approach the conceptual world

1751
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:59,200
with that kind of a spirit um

1752
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,920
with play and reward on a sort of

1753
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,799
fine-tuned

1754
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:05,839
balance and a sensitivity for

1755
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:08,880
uncommon patterns and just being

1756
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,359
in relationship with the material i

1757
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:12,960
think that they'll always go far in

1758
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,119
active inference and by doing so they'll

1759
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,160
push the whole field ahead

1760
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,599
so one other piece here is just the

1761
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:24,319
our live stream checklist which we kind

1762
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:24,640
of

1763
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,880
increasingly hope that individuals

1764
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,400
follow before they

1765
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,720
go on a live stream ranging from just

1766
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,839
things that they can do

1767
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:34,720
ergonomically to improving their

1768
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,319
internet bandwidth and their cognitive

1769
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:37,280
bandwidth

1770
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,200
these are things that could hopefully

1771
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,480
help us propagate

1772
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,480
good practice for online team

1773
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,760
communication

1774
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,599
in live streams at first where the

1775
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:46,799
performance is

1776
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:48,880
of the utmost but also in other

1777
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,240
situations like

1778
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,160
thinking about video chats that you're

1779
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,280
in as respecting your partner's time and

1780
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,240
requiring uh preparation and then we'll

1781
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,599
just close this section with the

1782
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:01,760
affordances for participating in dot

1783
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,319
coms blue go for it

1784
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:07,599
so just from the i am evaluating

1785
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:10,160
the quality of your audio um side uh

1786
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,920
just something to put in there in the

1787
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,039
facilitator

1788
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,240
checklist like having my my shiny new

1789
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,920
condenser microphone which i know some

1790
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:18,960
of us have

1791
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,000
it's like life changing in terms of how

1792
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,480
audio quality sounds so if you are

1793
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,680
replaying the

1794
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,799
um the live stream videos and you're

1795
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:29,520
wondering like

1796
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,359
why do i sound like crap well it's

1797
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:32,960
because your microphone is crap

1798
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,799
i just want to put that out there it's a

1799
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:36,720
small investment like 50 bucks i know it

1800
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,599
can be like

1801
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,440
life bank breaking if you're a college

1802
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,720
student sometimes but

1803
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,280
um you know i really just as someone

1804
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,799
who's evaluating the quality of your

1805
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:45,599
audio

1806
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,960
do us a favor audio engineer blue

1807
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,680
saying it so that others don't have to

1808
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,480
anyone who

1809
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,760
is a repeat participant will provide

1810
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,760
them the hardware to participate

1811
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,839
and that is going to be fun i think as

1812
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:01,520
we continue to explore

1813
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,079
hardware and software affordances for

1814
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:05,280
participants

1815
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,960
maybe a kit do you need just the

1816
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,640
microphone but your internet is good do

1817
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,839
you need just

1818
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,920
a connection to the internet there will

1819
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,200
be participants who will be able to

1820
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,079
contribute

1821
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:17,200
with that enabling architecture

1822
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,680
those who want to participate in dot

1823
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:20,480
coms

1824
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,319
well there's several things that can be

1825
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:23,920
done first

1826
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,839
anyone is welcome to get involved with

1827
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:27,680
contributing to the current series that

1828
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,240
we have

1829
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,079
whether the podcast which has been

1830
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,680
mostly blue's effort

1831
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,839
or any of these series that we have like

1832
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:35,920
the live stream paper discussions

1833
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,839
the guest stream model stream math

1834
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:39,280
stream so

1835
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,319
for these formats it's possible to help

1836
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:42,640
us

1837
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,240
co-organize make the connection to

1838
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,400
somebody who you think should come onto

1839
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,720
a stream or help structure a

1840
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,400
collaboration in another way

1841
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,400
but if you saw one of those videos and

1842
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,760
you liked it or you wished that there

1843
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,559
could have been one

1844
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,720
like another episode of the model stream

1845
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,319
with a different robotics lab

1846
01:07:58,319 --> 01:07:59,839
or another math stream on a different

1847
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:02,079
math topic that's the right way to go

1848
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:03,280
about it

1849
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,000
and also it's possible to introduce a

1850
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:06,720
new series

1851
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,880
or format maybe we'll have so many

1852
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,799
robotics discussions

1853
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:13,119
we'll have a robo stream or we'll have

1854
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:13,920
enough

1855
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,760
miramikology research to have an ant

1856
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,279
stream

1857
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,399
we can also focus on onboarding

1858
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:22,640
new participants to live streams so

1859
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,158
people who've come on once and kind of

1860
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:25,439
thought it was fun maybe they want to

1861
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,279
help others do the same

1862
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,759
we also want to explore other

1863
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,040
communications

1864
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,560
format and media like events

1865
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,359
uh series like a discussion series could

1866
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:38,080
be recorded

1867
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,839
or not you know what stephen just

1868
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:41,600
brought up with the metaphors or

1869
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,198
you know making active inference

1870
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:45,279
tangible you know active inference in

1871
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:46,158
your hands

1872
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:48,399
those are kinds of things that could be

1873
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,560
a fun different series

1874
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,600
also there's different formats blogs

1875
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,719
short writings tutorials

1876
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:00,158
meme generation of course always a job

1877
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:02,479
opening for meme engineering

1878
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:05,279
um but dot coms is the interface with

1879
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:06,080
the external

1880
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,000
so anybody who likes that sort of

1881
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,679
communication oriented

1882
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,479
work is going to find a home in comms

1883
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:13,359
and also

1884
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:14,719
comms plays a role in the internal

1885
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:16,880
structuring so for those who want to

1886
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,319
understand a little bit about how

1887
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:23,120
communications engineering internally is

1888
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:23,679
used

1889
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:25,600
for an efficient and inclusive and

1890
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,198
accessible teams

1891
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:30,560
that's a different environment operating

1892
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,880
than to the external but both kinds of

1893
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,198
communications are really important

1894
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:38,880
okay going on to tools anyone just

1895
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,319
raise their hand if they have any

1896
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,319
questions and the live chat people can

1897
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:43,439
ask if they have any

1898
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,759
comments or questions all right so here

1899
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:47,759
we are in our third

1900
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:51,279
organizational unit of tools

1901
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,400
the goal of tools is to enable effective

1902
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:54,960
tool

1903
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,360
and instrument use for everything that

1904
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,520
is happening in our lab

1905
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,320
the tools organizational unit explores

1906
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,800
and designs affordances for our niche

1907
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,960
which will result in effective action as

1908
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,239
well as innovations

1909
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:11,440
and probably product developments that

1910
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,320
are downstream of working on the areas

1911
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,199
that we see

1912
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:18,400
as important there's been awesome

1913
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,120
progress related to weekly meetings for

1914
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,000
sharing resource

1915
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,440
needs and ideas as well as a series

1916
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,440
of brainstorming and development product

1917
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,159
development uh meetings which i'll

1918
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:33,199
leave anyone else to describe and the

1919
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:34,239
current next steps

1920
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,800
are focusing on onboarding participant

1921
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,960
into the tools operations

1922
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,199
understanding the lab tool use and needs

1923
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:42,480
as well as some other

1924
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,719
outcomes of again this series that was

1925
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:45,760
undertaken by

1926
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,719
alex and others so alex do you want to

1927
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:50,000
describe what

1928
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,199
transpired there or

1929
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,880
with the tools um yeah yeah just

1930
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,080
i want to the comment and with

1931
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,199
connection

1932
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:04,400
for uh needs

1933
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,679
from blue that she mentioned so

1934
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:11,440
and it will be like an example for what

1935
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:16,400
the tools will will do so

1936
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,040
bloom mentioned about some needs for

1937
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,760
automation for podcast and also some

1938
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,600
maybe tools for smooth-out audios

1939
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,159
so we will need to have some maybe

1940
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:28,719
special

1941
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:32,400
session or just make it a synchronous

1942
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,840
to document such needs

1943
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,120
and then dot tools as

1944
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,320
enabling system to support uh

1945
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,600
technical parts of our organizational

1946
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,640
units

1947
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,840
jobs we will work on it and

1948
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,719
provide some solution to needs for

1949
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:54,560
working with podcasts

1950
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,080
and so it's for all our possible needs

1951
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:58,960
from

1952
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,199
organizational units what we have now or

1953
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,560
will be in future

1954
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,760
this entity will support them in

1955
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,960
technical needs yes yvonne

1956
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:15,199
i just wanted to add that there is no

1957
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:18,800
main unity in the lab

1958
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,560
so all three units are

1959
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,400
like uh each scuffles

1960
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,920
the other and from

1961
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:34,840
auto enabling system that every

1962
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,920
every so every

1963
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,120
one is the is the main and uh

1964
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,800
every is and issues has

1965
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,080
a special special program

1966
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,679
yeah to to help with

1967
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:55,040
you know others thanks great point it's

1968
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,159
like organs

1969
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:59,360
with specialized function you

1970
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,280
can't have one organ that does it all

1971
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,199
and so they co-enable

1972
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:05,440
each other in the context of a broader

1973
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,640
whole

1974
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,920
this is a figure from our september 2020

1975
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,600
paper

1976
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,040
active inference and behavior

1977
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,880
engineering for teams

1978
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,080
and this was our representation

1979
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,600
of thinking about how teams were linked

1980
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,960
through basically informational blankets

1981
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,960
and so inside of the team blanket the

1982
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,880
team markov blanket

1983
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,840
you have team members who are bounded by

1984
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:32,320
their

1985
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,120
human computer interface and they are

1986
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,440
able to pass information back and forth

1987
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,840
to databases single source of truths

1988
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,600
whether it's the jitsi server

1989
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,760
that all of our video information is

1990
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,440
relayed to before it gets

1991
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,560
re broadcast back out to us or whether

1992
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,360
team member b

1993
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,840
is watching the live stream and

1994
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,760
youtube's database is the one

1995
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,239
that is taking in my video streaming and

1996
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:56,960
outputting

1997
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,000
on their screen video however we want

1998
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,320
to model this this is kind of our big

1999
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,239
picture for thinking about for online

2000
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:05,360
teams

2001
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,080
what kinds of tools and systems are we

2002
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,159
engineering

2003
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:14,080
um steven yeah i like how you've got the

2004
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,760
database sort of

2005
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,560
inside the team mark off blanket as well

2006
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,640
so it sort of shows how you can have

2007
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,840
parts of the niche on the external world

2008
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,880
on the inside or the outside of another

2009
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,080
scale of blanket um so

2010
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:33,760
you know that type of um

2011
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,159
way of interacting that's not so common

2012
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,840
with other systems approaches

2013
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,800
so this this nestedness of there's no

2014
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,120
definitive inside outside

2015
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,239
as the scaling blends um so i

2016
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:47,840
you know i just thought i'd mention that

2017
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,760
yep cool

2018
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,600
and here's how we hierarchically nest

2019
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,480
in our google drive our cloud storage

2020
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,920
folder

2021
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,960
we have an admin folder for organizer

2022
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:01,679
information

2023
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,800
and then each organizational unit has

2024
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,120
information that's accessible to it and

2025
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,080
so in a

2026
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,640
unit and project project-based way we

2027
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:11,679
have nesting

2028
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:14,719
of reading and writing privileges

2029
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,199
that allows us to sort of unambiguously

2030
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:18,080
understand

2031
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,760
what information does somebody need to

2032
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,840
see and then what information

2033
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,600
are they contributing on yvonne do you

2034
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,000
still have your hand raised

2035
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,560
okay so that's our google drive just to

2036
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:29,920
sort of walk through a couple of our

2037
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,679
other tools

2038
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:34,719
on the right we have a lot of google

2039
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:37,280
documents and sheets this is our formal

2040
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,320
documents so we use

2041
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,719
various kinds like slides and sheets and

2042
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:41,920
docs

2043
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,880
on the ontology tools side we a little

2044
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:45,280
bit

2045
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,760
have used the online although there's a

2046
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,040
downloadable as well

2047
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:52,400
ontology editor protege and then also

2048
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,280
we've been with some help from tim and

2049
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:56,320
others

2050
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,480
working on setting up a sigma ontology

2051
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,480
development environment

2052
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,280
which is related to sumo the ontology

2053
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,080
approach that we're

2054
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,199
pursuing so this is a

2055
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:10,000
formal approach for ontology modeling

2056
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,400
and a

2057
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,679
example of a of a statement in pseudo

2058
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:14,159
kiff

2059
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:16,400
is written here so that's what the

2060
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,840
ontology working group

2061
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,400
is developing and it shows again the

2062
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,080
power of working on a team

2063
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,640
because how many of us could have ever

2064
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,320
set up the cloud

2065
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,600
uh sumo environment none

2066
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,679
or maybe one how many could even set it

2067
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,199
up locally again

2068
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:35,920
none or maybe even a few but we do have

2069
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,600
somebody who has experience with cloud

2070
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,320
setups

2071
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,360
so we will have a cloud working space

2072
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,520
and that is going to enable participants

2073
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,800
who want to

2074
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,080
have that ramp from not having sigma

2075
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,400
not knowing ontology to maybe having

2076
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,080
both and understanding both

2077
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,239
it's going to be an easier and a better

2078
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,640
ramp when we can share resources in our

2079
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:57,840
team especially the

2080
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:01,840
sigmontology development environment

2081
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:05,120
still use key base as our back end and

2082
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,239
single source of truth for organizing

2083
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:10,239
although we we have a discord as well

2084
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:11,600
that has been awesome for

2085
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,960
a lot of collaboration for communicating

2086
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,080
externally

2087
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,640
our primary source is our monthly

2088
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,760
newsletter

2089
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,120
which sometimes sends out other

2090
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,080
announcements as well and then we

2091
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:27,040
have a discord with people who want to

2092
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:27,920
be in a more

2093
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,719
uh web platform interface it's been

2094
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:31,360
great for

2095
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,600
the collective intelligence project that

2096
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,960
blue and several others

2097
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:38,000
have been involved in and then twitter

2098
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:38,960
we've

2099
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,440
used that social media affordance as

2100
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,600
it's where a lot of the community is

2101
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,640
then on the audio visual side this is

2102
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,640
sort of all down onto one slide

2103
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,360
um using youtube for live streaming and

2104
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,560
viewing

2105
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,000
using jitsi and gather town for video

2106
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,120
chat we're on a jitsi

2107
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,719
right now and then using obs broadcaster

2108
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,320
role

2109
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:06,080
okay any comments on tools otherwise

2110
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,360
we'll head to

2111
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:11,360
future and the next steps all right so

2112
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:16,239
hashtag future and really our next steps

2113
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:19,040
as we are heading into our third quarter

2114
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,640
of activity

2115
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,679
we first off are going to be taking the

2116
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:25,520
next steps that we described in each of

2117
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,520
those organizational units

2118
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,679
so edu comms and tools we'll continue

2119
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,480
navigating uh wayfinding sense making

2120
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,679
along

2121
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:37,440
the ways that they've been describing in

2122
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,239
this conversation

2123
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:42,560
as the lab as a whole heads into the

2124
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,800
third quarter of activity though

2125
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,440
we will be focusing more on defining

2126
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,560
governance structures

2127
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,480
and exploring new affordances that are

2128
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,199
now available to the non-profit

2129
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,280
which was part of our strategy from the

2130
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,440
beginning achieve the non-profit

2131
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,520
understand which affordances would now

2132
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:00,640
be possible

2133
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,679
or even likely and then enact those

2134
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,040
possibilities

2135
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,719
so the lab level that's what we would

2136
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,560
like to see and also

2137
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,440
experimenting and defining governance

2138
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,480
structures

2139
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,719
whether it's a governance structure that

2140
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:15,840
we don't need any new

2141
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,920
technology or tools for like just

2142
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,199
clarifying how do we

2143
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:21,520
make a vote on whether a certain guest

2144
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,760
is appropriate for a guest stream or not

2145
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,640
all the way up to the token engineering

2146
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:27,120
of

2147
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,920
nfts and more defy or distributed

2148
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:30,719
governance

2149
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:34,159
type applications for who knows what the

2150
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:35,440
next steps may be

2151
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,239
and then also during june it'll be an

2152
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,040
awesome

2153
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:42,239
note to end the semester on and then

2154
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,400
we'll have a third and a fourth round

2155
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,520
table

2156
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,280
before the year ends well

2157
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,000
we can be on this closing slide which is

2158
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:52,880
just

2159
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,000
anyone is we can open it up i see dean

2160
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,640
and then everyone else feel welcome to

2161
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,400
raise your hands

2162
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,520
dean go for it yeah just a quick

2163
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,719
question i

2164
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:07,840
i noticed that the terms of

2165
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,520
terms of whatever they call it on

2166
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,280
youtube changed and now

2167
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,120
when i've gone back to some of the

2168
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,600
active inference live streams

2169
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,840
before there was no advertisements and

2170
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,280
now i have to click through two

2171
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,600
advertisements for example

2172
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:26,719
to um actually access the live stream so

2173
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:28,800
would we get somebody to look at the

2174
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,639
adsense piece and start if it's a

2175
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:32,239
non-profit start

2176
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:34,800
collecting some money for people because

2177
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,480
the advertisements have been

2178
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,239
actually front end loaded on some of

2179
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:39,520
those live streams

2180
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,800
you probably weren't aware of it because

2181
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,040
it's just happened in the last

2182
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,080
i think 10 or 12 days

2183
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,679
thanks i'll give a thought on that blue

2184
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,760
yeah just to respond to that so like we

2185
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,600
as the active inference lab like

2186
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,719
can't we can't pay to

2187
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:59,840
remove the ads it's a user end payment

2188
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:00,320
which i

2189
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,480
that that's my understanding of it so

2190
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,320
just a quick update

2191
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,719
yeah i think there is a way to like have

2192
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:07,440
a channel

2193
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,280
under monetized or not i'm not sure if

2194
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,520
it removes all the ads

2195
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,280
uh but yes that's what changed

2196
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,600
right so even if you're that's exactly

2197
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:18,400
what changed

2198
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,719
there used to be like you could pay as a

2199
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:21,440
producer

2200
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,760
so that no one had to view ads but they

2201
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,920
flipped it so that now it's you have to

2202
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,600
you have to buy the youtube premium

2203
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,560
because they figured they would make

2204
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,239
more money that way i guess

2205
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:34,159
ah yeah i just searched ads

2206
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:37,840
maybe we can confer with the youtube uh

2207
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,360
terms of service or whatever but if it

2208
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,120
just recently changed then that totally

2209
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,719
could be

2210
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:45,679
and okay good to keep in mind stephen

2211
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:47,360
and that also can be where having a

2212
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,440
non-profit status can help

2213
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,719
because um they will if they see you

2214
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:54,400
have those values and

2215
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,880
you are registered then they often can

2216
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,239
give you a

2217
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:01,040
either a free or much reduced access to

2218
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,440
some of those services

2219
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,840
so i just looked at the youtube

2220
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,360
monetization

2221
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,280
and it says as a youtube partner you'll

2222
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,960
be able to earn money from your videos

2223
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,320
etc etc

2224
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,600
and it requires 1 000 subscribers

2225
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,880
and uh 4 000 watch hours we're not at

2226
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,360
either of those so we have no

2227
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,360
levers maybe when the channel is

2228
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,400
eligible it can be

2229
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,840
done or not but um we'll figure it out

2230
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:31,520
and of course have a spirit of cognitive

2231
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,600
security and attentional regime

2232
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,639
engineering and

2233
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:37,440
not having ads when we don't need them

2234
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,639
to be there

2235
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:40,880
and eventually working on avenues to

2236
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,239
self-sufficiency

2237
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:44,560
in a way where we won't be at the behest

2238
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,159
of any other platform

2239
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:48,960
but we could have some more subscribers

2240
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,920
that'd be cool

2241
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,320
dean and then anyone else i just think

2242
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,159
it's interesting because

2243
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:56,239
i don't think search engine optimization

2244
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:57,760
is active inference

2245
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:01,600
but what would happen if we got to that

2246
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,040
those minimum numbers in those

2247
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,760
thresholds right

2248
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:10,080
yep well there's a lot on our channel

2249
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,280
and um it'd be awesome to reach out to

2250
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:13,760
more

2251
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,199
people and let the search engines make

2252
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:18,560
it what they may

2253
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,080
because we'll be optimizing for

2254
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,400
something else

2255
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,480
so this closing slide is just again

2256
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,679
people can raise their hand if they want

2257
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:26,159
to add

2258
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:29,040
anything just what we'd like to learn

2259
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,080
more about and how we want to apply

2260
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,360
questions that every expert in the field

2261
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:36,960
will tell you that they are curious

2262
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,400
about as well

2263
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,360
and beginners too and then the questions

2264
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,320
that we ask

2265
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,719
usually in a more paper discussion

2266
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:45,920
context

2267
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,920
what does a good understanding of our

2268
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,760
lab enable

2269
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,159
since we're discovering what kind of lab

2270
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:54,000
we are and creating what kind of lab we

2271
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,719
are

2272
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:57,520
what would it mean if we understood that

2273
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:57,920
what

2274
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,120
would be the predictions and

2275
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,199
implications of different understandings

2276
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:02,560
what do we know now that we didn't know

2277
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,000
two hours ago

2278
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,120
um what are some next steps for

2279
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,480
free energy principle and active

2280
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:11,920
inference the ideas or the community

2281
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,639
tools too and then what are the goals of

2282
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:15,280
our

2283
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,199
research and of our system of interest

2284
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,520
which is the lab as organizers

2285
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,880
and then the participants as the lab

2286
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,080
so cool stuff and um

2287
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,880
thanks everyone for participating we

2288
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,880
hope that

2289
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,120
you stick around share the information

2290
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,480
with anyone else

2291
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:38,159
and um yeah if there's no other comments

2292
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:40,960
we'll end it there

2293
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,440
awesome
