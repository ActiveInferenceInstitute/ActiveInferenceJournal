00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,132
Daniel: Hello and welcome everyone.

2
00:00:06,264 --> 00:00:16,771
This is March 31, 2020, three's quarterly

3
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:16,771
roundtable number one from the Active

4
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:16,771
Inference Institute.

5
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:20,114
Welcome to the active inference

6
00:00:20,114 --> 00:00:20,114
institute.

7
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:26,770
We're a participatory online institute

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:26,770
that is communicating, learning and

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:26,770
practicing applied active inference.

10
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:29,038
You can find us at the links on this

11
00:00:29,038 --> 00:00:29,038
slide.

12
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:35,674
This is a recorded and an archived

13
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:35,674
Livestream, so please provide us feedback

14
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:35,674
so we can improve our work.

15
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:41,286
All backgrounds and perspectives are

16
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:41,286
welcome and we'll be following video

17
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:41,286
etiquette for live streams.

18
00:00:36,711 --> 00:00:48,975
Today we're going to be checking in with

19
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:48,975
our regular quarterly roundtable series.

20
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:53,489
We're going to first provide some updates

21
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:53,489
from the institute scale.

22
00:00:48,989 --> 00:01:04,974
Then we'll talk about ongoing education

23
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:04,974
and research projects before concluding

24
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:04,974
with some thoughts on the institute's

25
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:04,974
paths in the coming year.

26
00:00:54,507 --> 00:01:08,383
So first, would the two of you like to

27
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:08,383
introduce yourself?

28
00:01:04,992 --> 00:01:14,949
I'm Daniel, I'm a researcher in

29
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:14,949
California and also the president of the

30
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:14,949
institute.

31
00:01:08,394 --> 00:01:19,433
Alex?

32
00:01:18,347 --> 00:01:22,734
Alex: Yes.

33
00:01:21,668 --> 00:01:23,815
Hi.

34
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:25,016
My name is Alex.

35
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:33,873
I'm vice president of the institute and

36
00:01:33,873 --> 00:01:33,873
also educator and systems thinker.

37
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:35,088
Please go ahead.

38
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:37,270
Bleu: Hi.

39
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,343
I'm Blue Knight.

40
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:44,993
I'm an independent research consultant in

41
00:01:44,993 --> 00:01:44,993
New Mexico and the secretary for the

42
00:01:44,993 --> 00:01:44,993
active inference institute.

43
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:46,015
Back to you, Daniel.

44
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:47,025
Daniel: Awesome.

45
00:01:46,017 --> 00:01:55,105
Well, let's begin with some views on the

46
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:55,105
institute at the organizational scale.

47
00:01:47,027 --> 00:02:08,178
First, just as a summary overview put us

48
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:08,178
off to the side, we engage with our niche

49
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:08,178
and provide services to it on multiple

50
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:08,178
fronts.

51
00:01:56,114 --> 00:02:17,261
Here, who we are and what we are is

52
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:17,261
reflected visually at the institute

53
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:17,261
scale.

54
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:23,327
We have several groups, including the

55
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:23,327
ones that we'll be describing in the

56
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:23,327
coming slides.

57
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:28,372
The board of Directors, the officers and

58
00:02:28,372 --> 00:02:28,372
the scientific advisory board.

59
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:33,422
We have two organizational units,

60
00:02:33,422 --> 00:02:33,422
somewhat like departments.

61
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:41,503
These organizational units help support a

62
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:41,503
wide range of projects related to

63
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:41,503
education and research.

64
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:44,536
Any general comments that you'd like to

65
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:44,536
add?

66
00:02:41,504 --> 00:03:16,793
Alex: Yeah, let me add here that yes, we

67
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:16,793
are using it's kind of simple schema, but

68
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:16,793
it actually represents our vision to have

69
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:16,793
this hierarchical structure explicit and

70
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:16,793
represent in our attempts to align with

71
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:16,793
active inference approach or

72
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:16,793
organizational side of our activities.

73
00:02:48,575 --> 00:03:28,914
So here we have connections to the niche

74
00:03:28,914 --> 00:03:28,914
and different scales of institution in

75
00:03:28,914 --> 00:03:28,914
general units projects.

76
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:38,015
We are having intention on keeping a

77
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:38,015
structure alive and see how which

78
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:38,015
affordances provide us to development.

79
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:46,090
Daniel: As we undergo morphological

80
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:46,090
development.

81
00:03:41,039 --> 00:04:07,246
And just to give a bit more information

82
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:07,246
on the governance, the board of directors

83
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:07,246
serves to implement institute scale

84
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:07,246
formal strategy and governance they

85
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:07,246
specified and provide oversight for the

86
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:07,246
officers who are closer to the day to day

87
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:07,246
operations at the institute.

88
00:03:47,101 --> 00:04:12,290
And the board of directors applies active

89
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:12,290
inference at the organizational scale.

90
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:21,387
In contrast and in complement, the

91
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:21,387
scientific advisory board assists with a

92
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:21,387
wide range of tasks to reflect their

93
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:21,387
diverse backgrounds and approaches.

94
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:26,430
So let's talk a little bit more about the

95
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:26,430
Bod and the SAB.

96
00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:51,689
First, as to the board of directors, our

97
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:51,689
2022 to 2023 board of directors are

98
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:51,689
listed here and we've recently confirmed

99
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:51,689
three of us here on this stream as the

100
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:51,689
officers again close to the day to day

101
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:51,689
operations and who one is speaking with

102
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:51,689
most likely when they email the

103
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:51,689
Institute.

104
00:04:27,439 --> 00:05:08,799
Currently we are working towards our

105
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:08,799
nonprofit tax exemption status 501 C

106
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:08,799
three status for our nonprofit and we

107
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:08,799
continue to highlight bolts dimensions,

108
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:08,799
business, operational, legal, technical

109
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:08,799
and social.

110
00:04:52,695 --> 00:05:14,851
Anything else that either of you would

111
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:14,851
like to add about our formal

112
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:14,851
organizational structure?

113
00:05:09,804 --> 00:05:51,223
Alex: Let me possibly add here that on

114
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:51,223
the process of development it was like

115
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:51,223
needed legally activities to have all

116
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:51,223
these people, all these roles for the

117
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:51,223
legal structure of Institute and that's

118
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:51,223
great, so great people we have on board

119
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:51,223
and from the site.

120
00:05:18,894 --> 00:06:10,355
As I said, even having a team of this

121
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:10,355
size, the process and structure became

122
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:10,355
more complex and all such changes took

123
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:10,355
more time to restructuring.

124
00:05:51,224 --> 00:06:22,472
And like for first quarter we started

125
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:22,472
this process like last year and even

126
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:22,472
first quarter we'll need it to finalize

127
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:22,472
these activities.

128
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:50,759
But that's great that we are here now

129
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:50,759
having people in our roles and having

130
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:50,759
accordance to legal requirements and now

131
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:50,759
we can make next steps, possibly will

132
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:50,759
take again a lot of time, but it's kind

133
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:50,759
of new forum and the speed of such

134
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:50,759
changes on Institute scale takes more

135
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:50,759
time.

136
00:06:22,473 --> 00:06:52,776
Daniel: Thank you.

137
00:06:51,769 --> 00:07:18,969
It was definitely a memorable moment when

138
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:18,969
during a scientific advisory board

139
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:18,969
meeting, one member suggested that this

140
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:18,969
was stretching the upper limit of how

141
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:18,969
complex and complicated our organization

142
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:18,969
should be at our stage and another

143
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:18,969
contrasted that it was actually the

144
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:18,969
minimal level of complexity required to

145
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:18,969
pursue certain legal statuses and other

146
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:18,969
work.

147
00:06:52,776 --> 00:07:21,002
So we're kind of straddling that line

148
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:21,002
riding forward.

149
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:30,095
We have the second cohort of our

150
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:30,095
scientific advisory board in full swing

151
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:30,095
already.

152
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:34,136
Most have joined meetings or engaged in

153
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:34,136
other activities.

154
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:44,231
We have a healthy number of returning

155
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:44,231
advisory board members and some great new

156
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:44,231
advisory board members.

157
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:54,338
So thank you all for your work in the

158
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:54,338
scientific advisory board and we're

159
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:54,338
looking forward to bringing forth your

160
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:54,338
engagement in the coming year in many,

161
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:54,338
many ways.

162
00:07:44,232 --> 00:07:57,363
Anything either of you would like to add

163
00:07:57,363 --> 00:07:57,363
here?

164
00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:13,462
Alex: Maybe I have to mention about kind

165
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:13,462
of diversity in terms of people from

166
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:13,462
different domains and it's growing in the

167
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:13,462
number of participants.

168
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:20,537
Maybe it even looks like much more people

169
00:08:20,537 --> 00:08:20,537
when needed.

170
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:48,816
But having opportunity to discuss

171
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:48,816
relevant questions for research,

172
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:48,816
different research fields and to have

173
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:48,816
different sites, it's totally valuable

174
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:48,816
for us and provide us opportunities to

175
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:48,816
make right steps in needed directions

176
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:48,816
related to research site mostly for

177
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:48,816
sure.

178
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:50,836
Daniel: Thank you.

179
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:56,894
There are many ways to engage with the

180
00:08:56,894 --> 00:08:56,894
Institute.

181
00:08:52,855 --> 00:09:06,939
There's a lot of asynchronously available

182
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:06,939
materials like the recordings of the live

183
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:06,939
streams and other productions and the

184
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:06,939
transcripts and so on, things we'll

185
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:06,939
discuss more about.

186
00:08:56,895 --> 00:09:12,992
And also for those who want to get more

187
00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:12,992
involved, be active infra ants.

188
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:29,163
There are multiple opportunities for

189
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:29,163
action in the volunteer program by going

190
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:29,163
to our website and under education

191
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:29,163
finding Volunteer you can support your

192
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:29,163
engagement with one or as many projects

193
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:29,163
and activities as you'd like.

194
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:35,224
By registering as a volunteer, we'll keep

195
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:35,224
you in the loop about specific

196
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:35,224
affordances for your participation.

197
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:43,305
For example, registration, opening for an

198
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:43,305
upcoming learning group or some cool new

199
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:43,305
update with a given project.

200
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:49,368
And for those who are looking for even

201
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:49,368
more structure, we offer an internship

202
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:49,368
program.

203
00:09:44,309 --> 00:10:03,447
We have currently about ten active

204
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:03,447
inference from around the world who are

205
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:03,447
engaging with different research and

206
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:03,447
education affordances at the Institute in

207
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:03,447
their own ways, reflective of their own

208
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:03,447
situations.

209
00:09:50,372 --> 00:10:26,672
The interns engage in some element of

210
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:26,672
learning and education, usually with

211
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:26,672
textbook groups or other courses, some

212
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:26,672
element of project based learning where

213
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:26,672
they are going to be and are contributing

214
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:26,672
to different projects, making

215
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:26,672
translations in the ontology or

216
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:26,672
developing some other kind of work.

217
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:35,766
And the internship has a more active

218
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:35,766
mentorship and peer facilitation aspect

219
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:35,766
for whatever your educational and

220
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:35,766
research journeys are.

221
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:37,787
Any comments on that?

222
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:48,892
We hope that this becomes a very

223
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:48,892
important vector for people who want to

224
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:48,892
catalyze their active inference journey.

225
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:59,005
We basically cannot imagine a better way

226
00:10:59,005 --> 00:10:59,005
for someone who wants to dedicate 1 hour

227
00:10:59,005 --> 00:10:59,005
per week, 10 hours per week, 30 hours per

228
00:10:59,005 --> 00:10:59,005
week, whatever it may be.

229
00:10:48,893 --> 00:11:04,993
We can find a kind of relationship that's

230
00:11:04,993 --> 00:11:04,993
going to be mutually beneficial.

231
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:24,191
Alex: Yeah, I think it was quite a smart

232
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:24,191
mutation for our activities and having

233
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:24,191
that format and having that actually

234
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:24,191
active people in game, it's the most

235
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:24,191
valuable thing.

236
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:52,476
And having organizing it as flexible as

237
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:52,476
possible around people specific situation

238
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:52,476
and learning paths, we can keep it and

239
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:52,476
develop and hopefully it will bring more

240
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:52,476
people who are interested in active

241
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:52,476
inference to some actual activities and

242
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:52,476
learning path in that direction.

243
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:54,498
Daniel: Great.

244
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:08,579
With respect to what they call social

245
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:08,579
media, we have our main platforms and

246
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:08,579
numbers noted here, so it's been great to

247
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:08,579
see continued growth on these fronts.

248
00:11:55,505 --> 00:12:29,780
As to the big picture on our activities,

249
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:29,780
the above link provides an always updated

250
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:29,780
reference point for the activities that

251
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:29,780
are ongoing and the times of their

252
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:29,780
meeting and also links to those documents

253
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:29,780
if you want to learn more.

254
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:31,807
And we're going to go through many of

255
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:31,807
them today.

256
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:34,837
But first, just the 30,000 foot view.

257
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:52,014
These are some of the active activities

258
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:52,014
at the Institute, all of which are

259
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:52,014
participatory so if you're curious, just

260
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:52,014
wanting to know more or see a way for you

261
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:52,014
to contribute or maybe even want to spin

262
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:52,014
up your own project where you'd be a

263
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:52,014
facilitator, we can talk more about it.

264
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:57,068
As for learning groups, we continue to

265
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:57,068
have Par et al.

266
00:12:53,020 --> 00:13:01,042
Textbook groups which will be discussed

267
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:01,042
later.

268
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:17,201
We have been active with Sanjiv Namjoshi

269
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:17,201
in the Fundamentals of Active Inference

270
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:17,201
Group, working on Sanjiv's book in

271
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:17,201
progress and providing feedback which

272
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:17,201
will hopefully be surfaced more and

273
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:17,201
throughout the year and also to be

274
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:17,201
addressed later.

275
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:21,240
We're working on category theory as a

276
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,240
learning group.

277
00:13:17,202 --> 00:13:31,341
We organize and produce live streams and

278
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:31,341
with the transcripts of those live

279
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:31,341
streams, publish an archive and do other

280
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:31,341
things.

281
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:50,538
With the language Processing in Active

282
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:50,538
Inference Project we're developing

283
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:50,538
implementations for active inference at

284
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:50,538
this point, largely using approaches and

285
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:50,538
code that are scattered elsewhere,

286
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:50,538
bringing them together and help making it

287
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:50,538
more coherent for people who want to

288
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:50,538
engage in active inference modeling.

289
00:13:31,341 --> 00:14:00,575
So people who want to engage with the

290
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:00,575
actual code and see how it works in a

291
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:00,575
script rather than from a mathematical or

292
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:00,575
from a philosophical approach.

293
00:13:50,538 --> 00:14:06,634
This is a great project to add into your

294
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:06,634
toolkit in robotics and embodied.

295
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:06,638
JF.

296
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:17,743
Cloudier continues to present us with

297
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:17,743
progress on his work in symbolic active

298
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:17,743
inference and engage participants in this

299
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:17,743
very exciting area.

300
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:33,900
In the active inference ontology, we

301
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:33,900
continue to develop translations,

302
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:33,900
definitions, examples and counterexamples

303
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:33,900
and methodologies involving the active

304
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:33,900
inference ontology and how it's used.

305
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:43,000
And we also have several open hours per

306
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,000
week in our discord where we have wide

307
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,000
ranging conversations.

308
00:14:34,913 --> 00:14:50,078
These are really great entry points if

309
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:50,078
someone doesn't even find a specific

310
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:50,078
project that they're curious about but

311
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:50,078
they just want to learn more.

312
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:59,169
In general, joining any open discussion

313
00:14:59,169 --> 00:14:59,169
hour is a great option because we can

314
00:14:59,169 --> 00:14:59,169
field that conversation then.

315
00:14:50,079 --> 00:15:10,218
And just to show a few of our seed or

316
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:10,218
inactive projects starting in May, we'll

317
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:10,218
have a Physics as Information Processing

318
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:10,218
course by Chris Fields.

319
00:15:00,114 --> 00:15:12,239
We'll talk more about that in a few

320
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:12,239
minutes.

321
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:20,319
Podcast continues to exist, albeit a

322
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,319
little bit on the back burner in

323
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,319
software.

324
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:35,462
We have several software ideas and

325
00:15:35,462 --> 00:15:35,462
projects that have been sketched to some

326
00:15:35,462 --> 00:15:35,462
extent but are not engaging regularly to

327
00:15:35,462 --> 00:15:35,462
meet, as well as the development of

328
00:15:35,462 --> 00:15:35,462
frameworks for cognitive agent modeling

329
00:15:35,462 --> 00:15:35,462
and course development.

330
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:47,583
So we have a good portfolio for those who

331
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:47,583
choose to engage with one or more

332
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:47,583
activity, and there are always burners

333
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:47,583
that are on low or off.

334
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:54,658
Let's go into the educational project

335
00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:54,658
updates in the Edgy ActInf

336
00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:54,658
organizational.

337
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:57,688
Alex: Yeah.

338
00:15:57,683 --> 00:15:59,703
Related to education.

339
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:21,861
As we can see now, educational activities

340
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:21,861
became more and more important and

341
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:21,861
active, and we have different formats and

342
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:21,861
even outlining some creation and

343
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:21,861
organization of different educational

344
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:21,861
courses.

345
00:16:00,652 --> 00:16:35,006
And it's also a result of transformation

346
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:35,006
to institute when we consider this

347
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:35,006
educational function as specific for such

348
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:35,006
type of organizations.

349
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:53,181
And for now, we kind of believe we see

350
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:53,181
the results of implementing such

351
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:53,181
strategy, starting to think about

352
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:53,181
education and starting to make actions to

353
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:53,181
have education in place in institute.

354
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:56,210
Daniel: Thank you.

355
00:16:55,201 --> 00:17:12,317
Currently, as one of our primary

356
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:12,317
educational avenues, we are continuing

357
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:12,317
with our textbook group centered around

358
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:12,317
the Par, Pazulo and Friston 2022

359
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:12,317
textbook.

360
00:16:58,238 --> 00:17:26,450
So the first cohort has been completed

361
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:26,450
last year, and those who have completed

362
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:26,450
the cohort are encouraged to join future

363
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:26,450
cohorts and be participants again or be

364
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:26,450
learning assistants.

365
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:43,625
The second cohort, which began in the

366
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:43,625
second half of last year, is about two

367
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:43,625
weeks from finishing the whole textbook,

368
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:43,625
and the third cohort, which begun in

369
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:43,625
2023, is now closing in on finishing the

370
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:43,625
first half of the textbook.

371
00:17:26,453 --> 00:17:50,694
Cohort four will begin with the beginning

372
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:50,694
of the textbook in the coming months.

373
00:17:45,644 --> 00:17:59,787
So check out on our website, the textbook

374
00:17:59,787 --> 00:17:59,787
group page, if you want to register for

375
00:17:59,787 --> 00:17:59,787
the fourth cohort or if you have any

376
00:17:59,787 --> 00:17:59,787
other questions.

377
00:17:50,695 --> 00:18:05,789
Just to summarize, it's a really exciting

378
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:05,789
and inclusive experience to be in the

379
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:05,789
textbook group.

380
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:12,854
People have all backgrounds, different

381
00:18:12,854 --> 00:18:12,854
familiarities and angles of approach to

382
00:18:12,854 --> 00:18:12,854
active inference.

383
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:38,011
Everybody has different familiarity with

384
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:38,011
the active inference ontology and with

385
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:38,011
equations, math, statistics, philosophy,

386
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:38,011
all these threads that come together in

387
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:38,011
the textbook group, we have fun and we

388
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:38,011
work together to improve our shared

389
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:38,011
documents so that we can have a wide

390
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:38,011
variety of tools and augmented learning

391
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:38,011
approaches that we wouldn't be able to

392
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:38,011
have alone.

393
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:45,018
So if you're planning to work on this

394
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:45,018
textbook at all, or if you're curious

395
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:45,018
about it, there couldn't be a better way

396
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:45,018
to engage with it.

397
00:18:38,011 --> 00:19:00,027
Um, moving to another educational project

398
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:00,027
with a small group of participants, we

399
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:00,027
are working on a category theory group.

400
00:18:48,021 --> 00:19:12,039
This group is an extended zero

401
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:12,039
preparation session for this draft

402
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:12,039
dissertation thesis by Toby St.

403
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:17,044
Clair Smith mathematical Foundations for

404
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:17,044
a compositional account of the Bayesian

405
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:17,044
Brain.

406
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:36,063
And in this group, where we have many

407
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,063
different backgrounds and familiarity

408
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,063
with category theory ranging from none to

409
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,063
some, we are preparing the zero

410
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,063
background and context materials for

411
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,063
upcoming live streams with Toby in the

412
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,063
middle of 2023.

413
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:53,080
Where we're going to be discussing this

414
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,080
incredible work, which brings together in

415
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,080
some novel ways the compositionality of

416
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,080
category theory with the otherwise non

417
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,080
compositional Bayesian brain active

418
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,080
inference type approaches.

419
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:56,083
We're going to see how it all works

420
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
together in the coming years.

421
00:19:53,080 --> 00:20:00,081
It's not the end with this dissertation,

422
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:00,081
it's really just the beginning.

423
00:19:57,084 --> 00:20:19,100
And so it's been quite exciting to

424
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,100
develop educational materials as a small

425
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,100
group as well as some individuals within

426
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,100
the group developing personal materials

427
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,100
like blogs and syllabus to help learn at

428
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,100
the intersection of active inference and

429
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,100
category theory.

430
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:23,104
And everyone's welcome to get involved

431
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:23,104
with this group, just as with all the

432
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:23,104
others.

433
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:28,109
And this group is an example or a

434
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:28,109
template of how we operate.

435
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:32,113
Deliverable oriented learning groups at

436
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:32,113
the institute.

437
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:34,115
Doesn't mean every person is going to

438
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:34,115
have homework.

439
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:47,128
It's just the way that, for example,

440
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:47,128
shown here on the right, we structure

441
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:47,128
meetings and set a pace where we know we

442
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:47,128
could spend five years working on one

443
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:47,128
page, because that's what the PhD is

444
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:47,128
like.

445
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:54,135
But we also move quickly enough to get

446
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:54,135
things done in reasonable time frames and

447
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:54,135
have a shared niche.

448
00:20:47,128 --> 00:21:02,137
Many pages not shown where we have notes,

449
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:02,137
questions, discourse and so on, anything

450
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:02,137
blue or alex.

451
00:20:54,135 --> 00:21:03,138
On category theory.

452
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:19,154
Alex: Maybe not only here, but in general

453
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:19,154
for education and courses, I think that

454
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:19,154
we called value added services for

455
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:19,154
education, for course organization.

456
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:35,170
It's kind of unique because it's

457
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,170
evolving, but it's evolving around some

458
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,170
structure for ontological work and having

459
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,170
it in place like a ground.

460
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:51,186
We can build a lot of really valuable

461
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:51,186
services to provide additional

462
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:51,186
information, links, connections between

463
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:51,186
terms, ideas, questions and so on.

464
00:21:35,170 --> 00:22:03,192
And I believe development and that

465
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
direction and trying to apply the same

466
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
approach for different educational

467
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
activity will bring interesting results

468
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:03,192
for everyone.

469
00:21:51,186 --> 00:22:05,194
Daniel: Awesome.

470
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:06,195
Agreed.

471
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:19,208
We have recently been very happy to

472
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:19,208
announce that in May 2023, we will be

473
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:19,208
hosting a course taught by Chris Fields,

474
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:19,208
Physics as Information Processing.

475
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:23,212
You can find out more in the Education

476
00:22:23,212 --> 00:22:23,212
section on our site.

477
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:34,223
It is going to consist of six lectures

478
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:34,223
live streamed by Chris Fields and six

479
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:34,223
live streamed but also participatory

480
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:34,223
discussion sessions with Andre Aguire.

481
00:22:23,212 --> 00:22:45,234
So you'll be able to access all

482
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:45,234
materials, preparatory readings,

483
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:45,234
associated topics, recordings of live

484
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:45,234
streams and so on on this course.

485
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:51,240
Coda and look forward to learning more

486
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,240
about this.

487
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:54,243
It's going to be a great course.

488
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:57,246
Anything you want to add?

489
00:22:55,244 --> 00:23:02,245
Bleu: I'm really looking forward to it.

490
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:03,246
That's all.

491
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:04,247
Super excited.

492
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:11,254
I think it's really like awesome of Chris

493
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:11,254
to put this forward and let us host this

494
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:11,254
wonderful class.

495
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:21,264
And yeah, we're going to be having

496
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:21,264
discussions sections that are hopefully

497
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:21,264
transcribed through the Active Inference

498
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:21,264
Journal.

499
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:28,271
So getting in touch and participating in

500
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:28,271
these sections is a good chance to

501
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:28,271
interact with the journal in that kind of

502
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:28,271
way.

503
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:31,274
That's the only addition I would make,

504
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:31,274
maybe yes.

505
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:40,283
Daniel: All the lectures and discussions

506
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:40,283
and asynchronously submitted questions

507
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:40,283
and answers will be compiled and

508
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:40,283
published and citable.

509
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:48,291
So this we expect to be a multi hundred

510
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:48,291
page functionally landmark publication.

511
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:56,299
If you're interested in this area and

512
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:56,299
you're in this moment in time, do what

513
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:56,299
you can.

514
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:58,301
Alex.

515
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:26,323
Alex: I just want to add that it's great

516
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:26,323
that we see that growing connections

517
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:26,323
between quantum theory and quantum

518
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:26,323
information theory to ActInf inference

519
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:26,323
and it's starting to grow and it brings

520
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:26,323
us more and more first principles into

521
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:26,323
framework basements.

522
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:28,325
It's very cool.

523
00:24:27,324 --> 00:24:31,328
Daniel: Agreed.

524
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:38,334
We've had a very exciting 2023 for Live

525
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:38,334
Streams.

526
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:40,337
First just the ask.

527
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:51,348
With your contributions and assistance,

528
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:51,348
we can co create a special and engaging

529
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:51,348
sequence of Live Streams for the rest of

530
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:51,348
the year.

531
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:54,351
So everybody listening is welcome to

532
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:54,351
join.

533
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:58,355
You're always welcome to comment and

534
00:24:58,355 --> 00:24:58,355
continue the discussion.

535
00:24:54,351 --> 00:25:02,353
Also, you can join Live Streams while

536
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:02,353
they occur.

537
00:24:58,355 --> 00:25:03,354
You can self nominate.

538
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:07,358
If you'd like to give a presentation or

539
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:07,358
have your paper discussed, please let us

540
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:07,358
know.

541
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:13,364
Or if you have a recommendation or even a

542
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:13,364
warm introduction that could go a long

543
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:13,364
way.

544
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:36,387
If you'd like to bring some materials and

545
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:36,387
perspectives really to the forefront, you

546
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:36,387
can collaborate on a zero background and

547
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:36,387
context video and help lock in the ways

548
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:36,387
that you might want to share background

549
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:36,387
for a topic to preempt uncertainty or do

550
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:36,387
any other kind of service in the

551
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:36,387
epistemic niche.

552
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:47,397
And we meet weekly, of course, to discuss

553
00:25:47,397 --> 00:25:47,397
these issues just quickly to look at some

554
00:25:47,397 --> 00:25:47,397
of the streams that we've had in this

555
00:25:47,397 --> 00:25:47,397
year 2023.

556
00:25:36,387 --> 00:26:34,439
So far we had guest dreams from Adam

557
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
Peace alareza Moder, Shanti Avil, Gwen,

558
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
andy Clark, Jordan Hall and Matthew

559
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
Pikowski benjamin Fallon Days baba

560
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
Brinkman, Max Berg Shuji and Vanya Visa

561
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
So these guest streams ran the gamut from

562
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
consciousness to clinical psychiatric

563
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
modeling with active inference,

564
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
improvisation in rap, ecological

565
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
psychology, civics and governance,

566
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
physics of creation, technical details on

567
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
surprise definitions, integration of

568
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
large language models with neurosymbolic

569
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:34,439
approaches and formal ontologies.

570
00:25:47,397 --> 00:26:39,444
And later today there will be an.org

571
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:39,444
stream with Stray Jane on Plural

572
00:26:39,444 --> 00:26:39,444
Publics.

573
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:47,452
Those are the guest streams, and we've

574
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:47,452
also had a great set of other streams.

575
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:50,455
For paper oriented live streams.

576
00:26:48,453 --> 00:26:53,458
We've had two series in live stream.

577
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:58,463
52 geometric methods for sampling,

578
00:26:58,463 --> 00:26:58,463
optimization, inference and adaptive

579
00:26:58,463 --> 00:26:58,463
agents.

580
00:26:53,458 --> 00:27:19,478
Lance Acosta joined for both discussions

581
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:19,478
and has incredible insights into that

582
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:19,478
group's paper that brings together the

583
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:19,478
topics in the title and in the recently

584
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:19,478
concluded 53 sequence on a pair of

585
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:19,478
papers, Snakes and Ladders in

586
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:19,478
Paleoanthropology and To Copy or not to

587
00:27:19,478 --> 00:27:19,478
Copy.

588
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:31,490
In both of these live streams we had the

589
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:31,490
authors Michael Walker, Hector Enrique

590
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:31,490
and Carl Friston joining, and both were

591
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:31,490
very special and illustrative

592
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:31,490
discussions.

593
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:34,493
We've had two model streams, one on

594
00:27:34,493 --> 00:27:34,493
Pymdp.

595
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,493
A.

596
00:27:34,493 --> 00:27:40,499
Python package for generative models of

597
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:40,499
the active inference flavor.

598
00:27:34,493 --> 00:27:42,501
That was with Connor Hines and Carl

599
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:42,501
Friston.

600
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:45,504
And Tom Ringstrom joined for a

601
00:27:45,504 --> 00:27:45,504
presentation.

602
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:47,506
Reward is not necessary.

603
00:27:45,504 --> 00:27:57,516
We also enjoyed a sequence of bookstreams

604
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
and so I'll pass to Blue to say a little

605
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,516
bit more about those bookstreams.

606
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:59,518
Bleu: Sure.

607
00:27:58,517 --> 00:28:14,527
So we have been going through this text

608
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:14,527
and discussing the material presented in

609
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:14,527
the first three parts of the book, and

610
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:14,527
we're not going to do the interviews at

611
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:14,527
the end section of the book just because

612
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:14,527
it's kind of beyond the scope of what we

613
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:14,527
wanted to cover in the bookstream.

614
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:37,550
But we have been going through week by

615
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:37,550
week, chapter by chapter, examining this

616
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:37,550
material, which is really the application

617
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:37,550
of active inference to governance,

618
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:37,550
especially with our own governance of the

619
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:37,550
institute, like being forming officers

620
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:37,550
and a board of directors and how should

621
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:37,550
we factor in the concept of active

622
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:37,550
inference into our governance policy.

623
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:48,561
So this was a very interesting group of

624
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:48,561
readings and discussions that we've had

625
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:48,561
over the last few weeks, and we are going

626
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:48,561
to have a final discussion coming up in

627
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:48,561
the next three ish weeks.

628
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:53,566
Hopefully the author will join us again

629
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:53,566
to discuss the material, but also this

630
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:53,566
discussion.

631
00:28:48,561 --> 00:29:04,571
We would really love to have outside

632
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:04,571
perspectives for people that have been

633
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:04,571
engaging with this material, either

634
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:04,571
through watching the live streams or the

635
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:04,571
book streams or have read the text.

636
00:28:54,566 --> 00:29:16,583
So if you want to get in on these

637
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:16,583
discussions of active inference and its

638
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:16,583
application and governance, please get in

639
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:16,583
touch because we would really like to

640
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:16,583
have some different perspectives in our

641
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:16,583
final discussion session.

642
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:31,598
Daniel: Thank you, Blue, and also to

643
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:31,598
Tyler for this great series and to kind

644
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:31,598
of conclude on the live streams and bring

645
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:31,598
in the journal, which is actually what

646
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:31,598
happens in the work itself.

647
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:39,606
Every live stream that we do, which can

648
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:39,606
be found at the Koda link shown here and

649
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:39,606
posted in every video description.

650
00:29:32,599 --> 00:30:00,621
The slides are available where possible,

651
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:00,621
but also we are developing a utilities

652
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:00,621
pipeline that automatically downloads the

653
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:00,621
audio from YouTube, uses artificial

654
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:00,621
intelligence to do speech to text,

655
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:00,621
outputs a markdown and then uses

656
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:00,621
rendering approaches to render that

657
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:00,621
markdown.

658
00:29:40,607 --> 00:30:15,636
And so there's a Git folder where you'll

659
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:15,636
find all the transcripts and therefore be

660
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:15,636
able to do some incredible natural

661
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:15,636
language analysis, ontology driven

662
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:15,636
analysis of this corpus of several

663
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:15,636
hundred videos and growing.

664
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:37,658
And we look forward to continuing to

665
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:37,658
improve that pipeline as speech and text

666
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:37,658
processing advance quite rapidly and

667
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:37,658
techniques and methods that were outside

668
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:37,658
of our capacity even weeks to months ago,

669
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:37,658
day by day draw nearer.

670
00:30:16,637 --> 00:31:02,677
So if you'd like a really open,

671
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:02,677
decentralized science open science

672
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:02,677
project or corpus, there are many, many

673
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:02,677
ways in the journal that we can improve

674
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:02,677
the rigor, accessibility and

675
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:02,677
applicability of our live streams and

676
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:02,677
therefore continue to add value and

677
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:02,677
meaning even for live streams from the

678
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:02,677
past.

679
00:30:37,658 --> 00:31:04,679
Anything to add?

680
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:09,684
All right.

681
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:16,691
Alex: I want to support that.

682
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:36,711
It give us a lot of opportunities to

683
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:36,711
reuse in some way this transcription from

684
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:36,711
our side institute building some possibly

685
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:36,711
language tools or chats to communicate

686
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:36,711
about active inference.

687
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:55,730
And a lot of opportunities will arise

688
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:55,730
like next months Andy Clark, which is

689
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:55,730
development of language models in general

690
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:55,730
as a domain.

691
00:31:39,714 --> 00:32:09,738
So we have like a main piece of text and

692
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:09,738
how we will use this text, what services

693
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:09,738
we can create, to which cases we can

694
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:09,738
support.

695
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:35,764
It will be huge and hopefully people from

696
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:35,764
community of Institute could share some

697
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:35,764
ideas how we can improve here and

698
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:35,764
possibly participate in this project,

699
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:35,764
considering it as a technical heavy on

700
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:35,764
the frontier of current language

701
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:35,764
processing tools.

702
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:38,767
Daniel: Thank you, Alex.

703
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:46,775
Indeed, to watch all the videos may not

704
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:46,775
be possible.

705
00:32:38,767 --> 00:33:10,793
Given limited time, it may not be

706
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:10,793
preferable but to engage in discourse and

707
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:10,793
synthesize summaries with a rich and

708
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:10,793
articulate corpus where speakers are also

709
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:10,793
known and we have connections with the

710
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:10,793
speakers and the co authors and all this

711
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:10,793
other kind of information, there are just

712
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:10,793
going to be many, many opportunities.

713
00:32:47,776 --> 00:33:23,806
So hopefully in a future roundtable, we

714
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:23,806
can revisit this, go into a little bit

715
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:23,806
more depth and show the status of our

716
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:23,806
pipeline such that we can fulfill that

717
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:23,806
vision of having a live stream and then

718
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:23,806
rapidly within.

719
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:35,818
Hours after the live stream have gotten

720
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:35,818
the audio rendered into Markdown rendered

721
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:35,818
the Markdown into a variety of

722
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:35,818
accessibility oriented formats it's going

723
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:35,818
to be amazing.

724
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:41,824
In our last section we'll talk about some

725
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:41,824
research updates.

726
00:33:38,821 --> 00:33:57,840
If you're watching Live, please feel free

727
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:57,840
to write a comment or share a favorite

728
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:57,840
memory or do so in the comments after the

729
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:57,840
video but we'll go through just a few

730
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:57,840
research updates and then if anyone has

731
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:57,840
questions in the live chat, address those

732
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:57,840
and then that'll be it for the

733
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:57,840
roundtable.

734
00:33:42,824 --> 00:34:01,838
So, just a research overview.

735
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:04,841
We have a handful of ongoing research

736
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:04,841
projects.

737
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:09,846
In the active inference ontology, we are

738
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:09,846
developing the active inference

739
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:09,846
ontology.

740
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:18,855
In active blockprints, we are developing

741
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:18,855
a package that integrates and facilitates

742
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:18,855
approaches for computational modeling

743
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:18,855
with active inference.

744
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:27,864
And in robotics and embodied JF Cloudier

745
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:27,864
is leading the way on some Lego robots

746
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:27,864
that do symbolic active inference.

747
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:42,879
We have several seed research projects

748
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:42,879
for those who'd like to, for example,

749
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:42,879
explore a graphical interface for active

750
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:42,879
inference or look at the broader

751
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:42,879
mindscape of cognitive agent modeling

752
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:42,879
approaches.

753
00:34:28,865 --> 00:35:00,891
And lastly, although most ramified in

754
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:00,891
their manifestations are the individual

755
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:00,891
research projects, so not all the work

756
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:00,891
that people are engaged in is necessarily

757
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:00,891
using the documents and the deliverables

758
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:00,891
of the institute.

759
00:34:42,879 --> 00:35:12,903
We also really honor and want to support

760
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:12,903
the individual research journeys that

761
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:12,903
many are on inside or outside of formal

762
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:12,903
academic structures.

763
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:21,912
And so with our interns and others who

764
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:21,912
aren't even interns, there are so many

765
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:21,912
exciting projects that everyone is

766
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:21,912
engaged in.

767
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:36,927
They share during the open hours, they

768
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:36,927
post updates in our discord, and we do a

769
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:36,927
lot when we work on our own projects and

770
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:36,927
group projects.

771
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:58,949
Just to give two examples to highlight,

772
00:35:58,949 --> 00:35:58,949
one of our interns, Shohe Wakayama, has

773
00:35:58,949 --> 00:35:58,949
updated his paper on active inference for

774
00:35:58,949 --> 00:35:58,949
autonomous decision making with

775
00:35:58,949 --> 00:35:58,949
contextual multi armed bandits and this

776
00:35:58,949 --> 00:35:58,949
has recently been accepted to relevant

777
00:35:58,949 --> 00:35:58,949
conference.

778
00:35:36,927 --> 00:36:00,945
So congratulations Shohe.

779
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:16,961
Also a variational synthesis of

780
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:16,961
evolutionary and developmental dynamics,

781
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:16,961
a paper with both I and Blue as co

782
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:16,961
authors, and some other names that people

783
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:16,961
may find familiar from the cast of live

784
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:16,961
stream characters.

785
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:22,967
So just a few that we wanted to draw

786
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:22,967
together but a little bit more

787
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:22,967
generally.

788
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:33,978
If you have any work that you'd like to

789
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:33,978
share, please let us know and we'll make

790
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:33,978
sure to highlight it in future

791
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:33,978
newsletters and roundtables.

792
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:45,990
It would be awesome to have that kind of

793
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:45,990
an update system so that we could

794
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:45,990
highlight like a collage or a mosaic of

795
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:45,990
all the works that people are doing

796
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:45,990
around the institute.

797
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:48,993
And it's just been great to see.

798
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:54,999
There are so many others that it was just

799
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:54,999
hard to pick exactly what ones in our

800
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:54,999
limited time to put here.

801
00:36:48,993 --> 00:37:00,999
But we saw many great developments over

802
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:00,999
the past month personally and

803
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:00,999
organizationally.

804
00:36:54,999 --> 00:37:15,014
So this is just a few of what the

805
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:15,014
research side looks like and in our last

806
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:15,014
minutes we can talk about whatever you

807
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:15,014
fellows would like in terms of next steps

808
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:15,014
or reflections.

809
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:20,019
Perhaps Alex first?

810
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:44,043
Alex: Okay, yeah, I think we will

811
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:44,043
continue structuring and improving

812
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:44,043
activities related to education,

813
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:44,043
supporting interest from community and

814
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:44,043
interest for people who can produce

815
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:44,043
educational materials.

816
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:57,056
We try to support in all direction and

817
00:37:57,056 --> 00:37:57,056
provide affordances on organizational

818
00:37:57,056 --> 00:37:57,056
side and possibly on communications and

819
00:37:57,056 --> 00:37:57,056
for research.

820
00:37:44,043 --> 00:38:16,069
I believe we will work on some kind of

821
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:16,069
research strategy with our scientific

822
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:16,069
advisory board because for now we have a

823
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:16,069
few core research projects ongoing and

824
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:16,069
it's great basics.

825
00:37:58,057 --> 00:38:37,089
We support research of people who

826
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:37,089
contacted us, but having in place like a

827
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:37,089
long term strategy in research directions

828
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:37,089
will be a great achievement if we can

829
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:37,089
present something related on next

830
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:37,089
roundtable related to it.

831
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:42,095
That's all for my side.

832
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:43,096
Daniel: Thank you.

833
00:38:43,095 --> 00:39:01,108
Bleu: Alex Blue so for me, I have kind of

834
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:01,108
pulled back if you're not seeing me

835
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:01,108
around discussing active inference, it's

836
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:01,108
because I have decided to prioritize

837
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:01,108
building institutional infrastructure and

838
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:01,108
institutional capacity for the active

839
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:01,108
inference institute.

840
00:38:43,096 --> 00:39:13,120
So my focus now is on getting grants for

841
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,120
the institute and pushing on the 501

842
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,120
status, 501 three C, three C, three,

843
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,120
whatever it is, the nonprofit status.

844
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:16,123
So that's my biggest priority and focus.

845
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:34,141
And I'm looking forward to kind of

846
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:34,141
getting over a few of those hurdles and

847
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:34,141
getting back into the material because I

848
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:34,141
really do miss it and I really miss

849
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:34,141
hanging out with everyone, but I have to

850
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:34,141
focus my attention and effort so that I

851
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:34,141
can continue to focus on active inference

852
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:34,141
for many years to come.

853
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:36,143
Daniel: Awesome.

854
00:39:35,142 --> 00:39:38,145
Great notes there.

855
00:39:36,143 --> 00:39:44,151
Indeed, the organizational work is

856
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:44,151
applying active inference.

857
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:48,155
It looks a little different than reading

858
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:48,155
a paper.

859
00:39:46,153 --> 00:40:02,163
Joining a textbook group search this

860
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:02,163
quarter has been very rewarding, very

861
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:02,163
developmental from what we can see.

862
00:39:48,155 --> 00:40:24,185
It would be extremely helpful and

863
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:24,185
requested appreciated for those who

864
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:24,185
engaged a lot, all the way on down

865
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:24,185
through a little, or not at all to

866
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:24,185
provide their feedback directly or in the

867
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:24,185
comments to this video or however they

868
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:24,185
see fits, to let us know about how we can

869
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:24,185
improve.

870
00:40:03,164 --> 00:40:29,190
You are our niche and we act in first

871
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:29,190
serve for you.

872
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:42,203
Having that kind of closure with even

873
00:40:42,203 --> 00:40:42,203
your acknowledgments means a lot and it

874
00:40:42,203 --> 00:40:42,203
does help shape what we can and do offer

875
00:40:42,203 --> 00:40:42,203
on research.

876
00:40:30,191 --> 00:41:00,215
Alex, I also look forward to what you

877
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
suggested about developing more of a

878
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
research program so that we can see where

879
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
different things fit and we're kind of

880
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
engineering that from the bottom up, but

881
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
increasingly being able to take a top

882
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:00,215
down view.

883
00:40:42,203 --> 00:41:16,231
And about education, every textbook

884
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:16,231
group, every zero, every course is

885
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:16,231
rapidly becoming easier and easier to

886
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:16,231
organize as we develop templates,

887
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:16,231
expertise and so on.

888
00:41:00,215 --> 00:41:27,242
And right now the rate limiting step in

889
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:27,242
those who want to create or engage with

890
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:27,242
educational material is the material

891
00:41:27,242 --> 00:41:27,242
itself.

892
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:34,249
And so that feels like a really good step

893
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:34,249
in our active inference corner of the

894
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:34,249
world.

895
00:41:28,243 --> 00:42:00,269
Prior there was a lack of content, not

896
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
saying that there's a sufficient amount

897
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
now, but hardly any casual conversations

898
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
existed and hardly any technical

899
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
discussions existed for especially this

900
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
cutting edge active inference

901
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
developments that truly on a month by

902
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
month basis, provide at least new views

903
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:00,269
on older discussions.

904
00:41:34,249 --> 00:42:06,275
And so being able to develop that

905
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:06,275
material and increasingly support others

906
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:06,275
who want to teach.

907
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:14,283
Their own courses, like Chris Fields, as

908
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:14,283
well as others that will be announced and

909
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:14,283
upcoming in the rest of the year.

910
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:19,288
So those who want to teach or have a

911
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:19,288
hosted course, get in touch.

912
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:23,292
Those who want to learn more, we hope

913
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:23,292
you're doing so.

914
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:28,297
And again, we appreciate all of the

915
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:28,297
engagements and feedback.

916
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:32,301
It's how we actually make it happen

917
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:32,301
together.

918
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:37,305
Any closing thoughts?

919
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:52,321
Bleu: Just to express gratitude for

920
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:52,321
everybody engaging with the Institute,

921
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:52,321
keeping us alive, and for you guys,

922
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:52,321
because you're awesome to work with and

923
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:52,321
hang out with.

924
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:55,324
Daniel: It's been fun.

925
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:56,325
Alex: Thank you.

926
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:59,328
Daniel: Thank you, officers.

927
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:01,324
Thank you, participants.

928
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:02,325
Farewell.

929
00:43:01,324 --> 00:43:04,327
Bleu: Bye bye.
