7240	8388	2	B	0.99989	Hello, everyone.
8554	11252	3	B	0.89182	It's September 29, 2023.
11386	15508	4	B	0.96911	We're here in the Active Inference Institute's quarterly roundtable number three.
15594	20500	5	B	0.99925	So this is our third of the quarterly updates.
22440	23860	6	B	0.99997	We have guests.
24360	27584	7	B	0.99976	I'm Daniel, one of the officers of the institute.
27632	32220	8	A	0.6	And I'm Bleu Knight, also another officer of the institute.
33120	41292	9	B	0.97678	All right, we are a participatory online institute that is communicating, learning, and practicing applied active inference.
41356	45504	10	B	0.99966	You can find us active Inference institute or the address.
45622	49808	11	B	0.63601	We'll be moving things over more to the institute address, though.
49974	54848	12	B	0.97464	We're inference active on Twitter or X, and here's more information.
55014	61924	13	B	1	This is recorded in an archived Livestream, so please provide us with feedback so we can improve on all aspects of our work.
62122	67320	14	B	0.99986	All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome, and we'll follow video etiquette for live streams.
67900	97200	15	B	0.99779	So today, in this quarterly update, we will first cover some big developments and updates at the Institute and Ecosystem Scale, then go over some educational and research updates from our Edioactive and Reinference organizational units, respectively, and then have some fun and entertaining musings on where we're going for the last months of 2023.
97350	98928	16	B	0.99993	Where we can all go in 2024.
98934	110950	17	B	1	And if you're watching live, please feel free to add any questions in the live chat and then in the last section, we'll be able to scan over that and look at your questions.
112040	117800	18	B	0.95065	All right, first, updates from the institute at the organizational scale.
119180	138040	19	B	1	One of the big highlights of the last months and really of the year and of really all of our work together was the accomplishment of this collaborative paper that we released in August of this year, the Active Inference Institute and Active Inference Ecosystem.
138200	147984	20	B	0.99933	We had a great team of co authors and to give a visual abstract and just a teaser for those who might want to learn more about this paper.
148182	162230	21	B	0.99979	We went through a great collaborative process to document and align on various aspects of what had been, was, and will be happening.
163080	165504	22	B	1	And on the right side is figure one.
165642	172040	23	B	0.34	This is an overview of the institute's structure itself in engagement with the ecosystem.
173260	181496	24	B	0.99957	On the left side are a representation of our open source products and some of the functions that they provide in the ecosystem.
181608	186830	25	B	0.99948	There's a lot more to say, but Bleu, what do you want to comment on or what was it like for you?
188880	190460	26	A	0.99968	It was super intense.
190880	197744	27	A	0.97	I think that we applied for a phase two grant, which I think we should talk about maybe.
197862	205120	28	A	0.98	And in doing that phase two Pose grant, this was the preparation that they kind of give you in the phase one.
205190	214372	29	A	1	And it really is about becoming like a big business or a big corporation or a big organization right.
214426	223930	30	A	1	And what it takes to really get organized and anchor and manage a large community of people, which I think that was really good for us.
225580	227176	31	A	0.8	I don't know how much managing we do.
227198	233596	32	A	0.98848	We're a very distributed system, but we do already oversee or engage with a large community of people.
233698	244124	33	A	1	And what does that look like when maybe we have conflicting factions or things get dropped, like the ball gets dropped in one court or another.
244242	251890	34	A	0.99669	So I think that that really kind of brought to light a lot of the things we need to work on and also the things that we're doing a good job at.
252660	253120	35	B	0.99997	Awesome.
253190	253424	36	B	0.99997	Yeah.
253462	259344	37	B	0.99974	We'll come to the grant in a few slides, but just to verbally describe the image.
259392	270680	38	B	0.99998	On the right, we have the circle, a golden ring that alludes to the COVID of the Par Pazulo and Friston 2022 textbook.
271100	283036	39	B	0.99	And that ring symbolizes the active inference ecosystem and also the boundary between the Institute as an entity and the ecosystem as niche in the Institute itself.
283138	290140	40	B	0.99986	Starting on the top of within the ring, we have several official bodies or organs.
290640	301392	41	B	0.99988	We have the Board of Directors, who select officers, as well as scientific advisory Board, which is an informal guidance and insight group, which we'll come to later.
301526	317208	42	B	0.99	And the Institute provides institute level functionality and support for the two organizational units, which are Eduactive, which is focused on educational outcomes, and Reinforce, which is focused on research work.
317374	338060	43	B	1	The organizational units host through facilitation, other processes, different projects that are all sorts of within, on and out there in the ecosystem, and then out in the ecosystem, we have all different types of activities and products and organizations and players.
338400	342744	44	B	1	And if you're listening to this, we encourage you to get involved.
342792	351568	45	B	0.99997	If it's something that you want to learn more about, then the paper is a great place to start, best starting place that we've made so far.
351734	358260	46	B	0.99	And the next step is to take that active step and actually get involved.
358760	360710	47	B	0.99996	Anything else to say on this?
361240	372312	48	A	0.99995	We should probably highlight the fact that our research unit, which hasn't been formally we've formally renamed our research unit to Reinforce, which we haven't announced yet.
372366	379608	49	A	0.99985	So I think as we are talking about the Reinference Unit, we did that kind of in the construction of this paper.
379694	392030	50	A	1	And because we've been educated and researched, and we just decided that Reinforce was more fun, kind of shouting out to active inference the whole thing, not just the active part.
392560	393080	51	B	0.99927	Fun.
393170	393472	52	B	0.99997	Yeah.
393526	400720	53	B	0.99994	So thanks again to all the authors here and also people who contributed their insights and just didn't want to be co authors.
401780	411072	54	B	0.9997	All right, carrying on with institute level updates, on August 22 of this year, we had a really amazing applied active inference Symposium.
411136	412864	55	B	1	This was our third such symposium.
412912	419064	56	B	1	The first was in 2021, with Karl Friston as a kind of one person symposium last year.
419102	425332	57	B	0.99994	In the second symposium, we highlighted robotics and a variety of theoretical applied work in robotics.
425396	432668	58	B	1	This year, we built off of the December 2022 framing of Friston et al.
432754	437932	59	B	0.99957	Designing ecosystems of shared intelligence, and we wanted to put it into play.
438066	444444	60	B	1	And so we co organized with a really great team enacting ecosystems of shared intelligence.
444492	452000	61	B	0.84	And here are the presenters and discussants who joined and enacted the symposium.
452420	454504	62	B	1	And there's two intervals.
454572	463552	63	B	0.99971	It was an awesome symposium, super exciting to hear the breadth and the depth of the work happening in the ecosystem.
463616	470616	64	B	0.98778	So for here, all I'll say is check out the program and recordings and transcripts if you want to learn more about that.
470718	474696	65	B	0.9163	It was an epic symposium, though, and thanks again to the co organizer team.
474798	475496	66	B	0.99986	Anything you want to add?
475518	496288	67	B	0.98628	Bleu okay, as Bleu alluded to earlier, we applied for a phase two grant within the NSF program, Pathways to Enable Open Source Ecosystems.
496384	504064	68	B	0.96976	So here's just two visualizations that are provided by the NSF to describe a little bit of what they mean by an open source ecosystem.
504192	529630	69	B	0.99989	On the right side, there's an open source product, and then through a pathway to sustainability, an open source ecosystem can exist, which includes here not just scientist, open source product and external user, but governance documents, scientists onboarding support, external users, the product developer, community, distributed defect, management, development and integration, and security.
530080	535152	70	B	1	And it was super fun to think about our work in this broader sense of open source products.
535286	537984	71	B	0.99998	Open source doesn't only refer to code.
538102	545204	72	B	0.8894	So thinking about what does a really rich, multimodal open source product look like and what is it?
545402	550710	73	B	0.89	And you want to add anything there, blue or I can add more.
551880	552630	74	A	0.97568	Yeah.
555240	563130	75	A	0.98511	So the paper that we wrote was kind of the scoping document for the grant, and it's what the people do in phase one.
563820	577228	76	A	0.99	And in terms of open source, I think we have done everything open source at the Institute, like all of the things that we've done from the beginning of our formulation until now.
577394	591920	77	A	0.9971	So it was kind of good to have that acknowledged that you can have an ecosystem around education or around just live stream videos or information sharing, information management.
592500	596700	78	A	0.99986	We've really built up the active inference community.
596870	617210	79	A	0.55	I think we've been a value add because somebody has to kind of organize and give meaning to kind of the random contributions or not random, but I think it's helpful in a field that's so new and that moves so quickly in terms of research developments and everything else.
618720	619420	80	B	0.95662	Yeah.
619570	619932	81	B	0.60629	Thanks.
619986	635650	82	B	0.99983	Just to give a little more detail, the primary submitter on this grant was the University of Washington Applied Physics Lab via Copi Scott David at the IRS IRI, as well as Bleu and I.
636100	643308	83	B	0.98	And as Bleu mentioned, it was really fun to see who was ready for what.
643414	657332	84	B	0.99883	Who wanted to throw a value into the arena, who wanted to put a comment on a Google doc, who is ready to state their hourly rate and scope of work and get involved.
657396	660568	85	B	0.99998	If there's pragmatic value of that kind on the line?
660734	664212	86	B	0.56243	Who's ready to work in the meanwhile?
664276	672972	87	B	0.66	And so it was just many discussions and negotiations, and as we can smile and laugh at now.
673026	676540	88	B	0.56	A lot of curveballs and things happening.
676610	678364	89	B	0.99993	So it was great times.
678562	680590	90	B	0.99898	Okay, moving on.
682260	690076	91	B	0.99994	Just within the last weeks, we have submitted our form 1023 to the IRS.
690268	705220	92	B	1	And so we soon expect and prefer ourselves to be a 501 tax exempt organization, which means that donations that people provide to us, of which we have received none so far, will be tax exempt.
705900	716970	93	B	0.99927	Once that status and all associated infrastructure is ready, we'll begin philanthropic campaigning with Bleu especially.
717500	728940	94	B	0.99998	We are working on policies and procedures proactively so that we can have compliant ants ahead of time and just stay right and relevant.
729680	746736	95	B	0.93293	It would be extremely helpful and much appreciated if anybody was interested in contributing their experience, networks or resources to what it could be for a philanthropy or fundraising program at the Institute.
746928	750630	96	B	0.99664	We're open to how that might develop.
751000	762632	97	B	1	And so if you see a high leverage opportunity for what you know or who you know or however, then some truly amazing things could happen.
762766	766490	98	B	1	And if you know, you know, and if you know, then help.
766940	768510	99	B	0.99996	Anything you want to add on this?
769200	778252	100	A	1	I do want to add that it was really interesting in developing ecosystem infrastructure in the Pose grant and in the ecosystem paper.
778386	789436	101	A	0.99052	It was really interesting to see what it takes to be a sustainable ecosystem, to really evaluate that at the level of the Institute and the ecosystem.
789548	795680	102	A	1	And I do think that what makes organization dissolve.
796920	799332	103	A	0.99986	It's like time and people and money.
799466	801060	104	A	0.99956	It's like time and money, time and money.
801130	804292	105	A	1	As long as people have time and people have money and interest level.
804426	807284	106	A	0.55482	So we have a great interest level.
807322	816452	107	A	0.99997	As we'll talk about, I think in the coming few slides we'll demonstrate that, but how do we get people to keep having time to commit to the Institute and the organization?
816516	825096	108	A	0.99931	So I think that one of the key things that we need to do is fundraise philanthropy also, but also grant writing.
825208	834464	109	A	0.99894	So these two things will be, I think, central to keeping the Institute, like being the glue that keeps the Institute together in the coming years.
834582	843180	110	A	0.99889	So I just want to just highlight that for anybody who wants to come be some glue, come provide some adhesion in the niche, that'd be great.
843350	848416	111	B	0.99889	Yeah, it kind of goes without saying, but it's easy to skip.
848608	856220	112	B	0.99991	Everything that has happened so far has been a purely volunteer effort, including this very little, little Livestream.
856400	875740	113	B	1	And the last few months have signaled and anticipated and readied for literally the first paid people to do anything for the Institute, which is a big game changer and would scaffold our time.
875810	880030	114	B	1	And so that will be quite a transition point.
880900	887184	115	B	0.8807	Let's continue also at the Institute level, we continue with our volunteer program.
887382	895300	116	B	0.99986	As always, I can do nothing but encourage and exhort you to volunteer and get involved at the Institute.
895960	911208	117	B	0.99995	Being a volunteer supports your engagement with projects and learning groups, whichever ones you're interested, it gives you repeatedly affordances provided to get involved with active inference and your contributions will matter.
911294	915332	118	B	1	The questions you ask on a live stream will be published by the active inference journal.
915476	931152	119	B	1	The questions that you write in the textbook group coda, those do become part of a shared knowledge, niche, code, developments that you provide something that makes it more accessible or applicable, those are huge in the setting that we are and will be in.
931206	941168	120	B	0.99991	So please volunteer and encourage other people who could be looking for technical or philosophical education, community mentorship, all these different things.
941334	942748	121	B	1	This is a great way.
942934	952244	122	B	0.99	And for those who would like a little bit more structured of an approach to getting involved, we continue to have the internship program.
952362	966356	123	B	0.91733	There's about 20 active interns from around the world who are engaging with different research and education affordances, and we are up to now five successfully completed internships.
966548	972350	124	B	0.99968	So to those who completed, it's been honor and an epic time.
973920	975932	125	B	0.96248	There's so much more I could say.
975986	996948	126	B	0.99991	But it's really exciting what interns come in with, because we, ourselves, or from what we hear, people are excited to apply active inference and to improve their own education and understanding of what active inference is and how they might use it or grasp or handle it.
997114	1042144	127	B	1	And then to have this lightweight internship program that makes a connection between the Institute and the person, gives a container and a name and a timeline and an asynchronous document for people's engagement, whether they're in a traditional educational program like an undergraduate student or a graduate student or probably the majority of which are outside of a traditional educational program and just lifelong learners and lifelong cool people, and they just come to work and hone what they do.
1042262	1048016	128	B	0.55466	So it continues to be very inspiring and I encourage people to be interns.
1048048	1059370	129	B	1	And also for those who would like to facilitate or mentor, we would like to start that discussion about how that might work.
1060780	1062250	130	B	0.99993	Anything else you want to add?
1063980	1066250	131	A	1	The active inference matchmaking service.
1072720	1076940	132	B	0.997	There's so many funny ways to take that, but yeah, what do you expect and prefer?
1077520	1080740	133	A	1	I meant like matching mentors and interns.
1080920	1083090	134	A	0.88849	Yeah, that's it, of course.
1083780	1086604	135	B	0.99	And then just a little summary update.
1086732	1098896	136	B	1	Across our different platforms and public interfaces, we see continued growth and activity.
1099088	1101968	137	B	0.99746	Just one plot.
1102144	1104820	138	B	1	This is our channel, YouTube channel.
1104890	1106330	139	B	0.7255	Growth through time.
1106860	1108170	140	B	0.99971	Just kind of interesting.
1109180	1110916	141	B	0.99995	Slow and steady wins the race.
1110948	1118040	142	B	0.99993	But it's also always good to see that first and potentially second and third order derivatives increasing.
1119500	1121150	143	B	0.99985	Anything else you want to add?
1122880	1135010	144	A	0.9963	No, I think the YouTube channel has really blown up in the last quarter and I think a lot of that we just have to shout out to the Chris Fields course because the views are astronomical in those videos.
1136180	1137344	145	A	0.9421	It's really blowing up.
1137382	1139456	146	A	0.99439	So thanks Chris, if you're watching.
1139558	1143996	147	A	1	And to everybody who's viewing those videos, and taking those courses, which it's truly.
1144108	1147504	148	B	0.58728	Actually yeah, yeah, we'll return to that, but good point.
1147542	1168132	149	B	0.97	And also for people who are interested in even social media management, video production, podcast editing, discord moderation and governance, meta governance, there's a lot of things that don't require some technical fluidity with the active inference kernel.
1168276	1170024	150	B	0.99959	So there's a lot of ways that people can help.
1170062	1181996	151	B	0.99939	So don't let it provide too much friction or freeze you out if you feel like you want to be involved, but you wonder if you don't know enough about some technical area or philosophical framing, it's totally not required.
1182108	1187810	152	B	1	And there's a million ways that we can work with wherever people are.
1188740	1198544	153	A	1	And actually, that's like one of the key areas that we've identified in our ecosystem oversight is social media management.
1198592	1202832	154	A	0.98387	So it's not all about the math.
1202976	1208328	155	A	0.95037	So many people come to us like, I'm so curious, except I can't do math and it's okay.
1208414	1210680	156	A	0.97952	Actually, can you do Twitter?
1211660	1217000	157	A	0.99992	Because really there's a lot of opportunities for involvement with the Institute that aren't math heavy.
1218800	1224860	158	B	0.99986	Before we head into the organizational units, here's the big picture on which activities are happening.
1225010	1239676	159	B	0.79	This website, which you'll find heartily linked from basically anywhere, you are always summarizes the up to date representation of what activities are happening and what you can do to get involved.
1239708	1244340	160	B	0.99977	So I'll just go over this and we'll talk about a few of these projects in the coming slides.
1245000	1255580	161	B	0.99243	So in the space of publishing different medias, we have the Live Stream project where we organize and prepare for different live streams.
1255760	1268036	162	B	0.99709	Following live streams, transcripts are created and published through the Active Inference journal, which through the work of Alex, Holly, Dave Others is always improving.
1268148	1273116	163	B	1	And it's an exciting time for all of these natural language processing analyses as well.
1273218	1281660	164	B	1	This is all being pushed to the GitHub that allows you to clone off the current state of the art in all the transcripts and translations.
1282160	1305510	165	B	0.99886	In the learning groups area we have the Pardol textbook group Cohorts Four and Five continuing through the textbook group Fundamentals of Active Inference, Sanjeev Namjoshi's book in progress and two courses which we'll come to later, physics is Information Processing by Chris Fields and Constructing Cultural Landscapes active Inference for the Social Sciences by Avel et al.
1305900	1316724	166	B	0.9983	In the software Space and Activity, we continue on active Blockfrence, where we work from both ends to make cognitive modeling more accessible and applicable.
1316852	1326968	167	B	0.99982	We work from the technical capacity side to develop the active Blockfrence project itself as a package utilizing CAD CAD to apply active generative models.
1327064	1341404	168	B	0.99	And we also work from the system or domain of interest side, working with people wherever they're at in their analytical or programming abilities and just starting to get the inklings of the recipe for generative modeling.
1341452	1350550	169	B	0.99957	Together Robotics and Embodied, JF continues to develop his work with Lego robots and societies of mind.
1351240	1361620	170	B	0.99733	Active inference ontology also continues maintaining and slightly improving as well as extending the active inference ontology.
1361700	1371772	171	B	1	And we have two weekly discussion sessions, one more on the educational theme, one more on the research theme, but ultimately they're both just how it goes in the moment.
1371906	1373070	172	B	0.99998	Anything to add?
1375440	1376252	173	B	0.94304	All right.
1376386	1387376	174	B	0.99781	In Eduactive, our educational organizational unit, one of the most exciting continued activities is the active inference textbook group.
1387558	1391196	175	B	0.82286	Cohort three, just within the last weeks, finished their journey.
1391228	1394480	176	B	0.99998	So congrats to those who stuck it through cohort three.
1394630	1400228	177	B	0.9974	Cohort four is now in chapter six recipe for generative modeling, continuing on with the book.
1400314	1403668	178	B	0.82	And cohort five is starting off there in chapter one.
1403834	1421512	179	B	0.89396	Everyone's welcome to join either or both of these cohorts, which are staggered so that you can attend the same time zone and get sampling across the book, or you can stay on one trail at a time and switch time zones.
1421656	1424312	180	B	0.99866	Everything's recorded, everything is collaborative.
1424456	1429304	181	B	0.99994	In our shared workspace, it's always possible to register and get involved.
1429432	1433468	182	B	0.99993	All backgrounds are totally welcome and encouraged.
1433564	1458280	183	B	0.99916	So if you've seen this textbook and or you want to learn more about what the only active inference textbook in the play right now says, and also connect a ton of dots and bring in a ton of other resources and more then the active inference textbook group is a great place and you'll meet many people who are also interested in similar topics.
1459260	1459992	184	B	0.99987	Anything else?
1460046	1462890	185	B	0.73128	Bleu it's fine.
1464380	1465130	186	B	0.99941	Okay.
1465660	1471304	187	B	1	The course that began in May 2023 is now about five six completed.
1471352	1472136	188	B	0.99815	That's physics's.
1472168	1474024	189	B	0.99999	Information Processing by Chris Fields.
1474072	1493040	190	B	0.86459	It's been a journey and can't wait for the fifth discussion section, which is tomorrow, and then the 6th lecture and discussion and that will have locked in the completion of the first course at the institute.
1493860	1504100	191	B	0.82992	We'll be able to publish the proceedings of the lectures and discussions as well as the asynchronous question and answer, which Chris Fields is very graciously answering.
1504600	1518280	192	B	0.99979	Then we'll be able to explore cohort or individual based learning structures around this really first principles and groundbreaking content that Chris is sharing.
1519280	1521230	193	B	0.89267	Want to add anything on this one?
1523600	1524860	194	A	0.98006	Just wow.
1525010	1525950	195	A	0.91193	That's all.
1526640	1527390	196	B	0.97766	Yeah.
1528960	1531890	197	B	0.99991	Also in the courses space.
1532260	1535596	198	B	0.99958	We continue on with the constructing cultural landscapes.
1535628	1541410	199	B	0.99354	Active inference for the social sciences course with Avel, Ben, Mahault, Lorena and myself.
1541780	1554790	200	B	0.98465	So Ben Mahault, myself and Lorena have completed their sections with a lecture and a discussion, although I guess Mao's discussion is coming up.
1555580	1566452	201	B	0.99955	We look forward to also the continued activity in this course as we remarked on in our last quarterly roundtable.
1566516	1575464	202	B	1	Second one this year has and will see us go from zero courses to two completed courses.
1575512	1586348	203	B	0.99543	So both the physics and the social sciences, which under some understandings run the gamut of multiscale systems.
1586524	1608360	204	B	1	To have both of those at such high quality volunteered and catalyzed by real unique expertise and also broad and diverse participation is incredible.
1609020	1609984	205	B	0.99979	Anything you want to add?
1610042	1618448	206	A	0.81871	Bleu just that as we are starting to have courses hosted by the Institute and completed.
1618564	1623004	207	A	0.99964	Anybody interested in having a course hosted by us should reach out.
1623122	1638428	208	A	1	And anyone familiar with or interested in accreditation is also something like we've been thinking about what would certification in active inference look like, what are the key build up skills?
1638524	1643004	209	A	1	And how could we develop a program to say someone is certified in active inference?
1643052	1645608	210	A	0.99954	It's something that we've been thinking about at the Institute scale.
1645724	1648580	211	A	0.99898	So if you have ideas, we would love to hear about them.
1648730	1652272	212	A	0.61	And if you have experience, we would love to get your input.
1652416	1673368	213	B	0.99566	Yeah, it's not covered in this roundtable, but the qualification certification, something that we're thinking about and the pedagogy and developing and hosting courses, these are all things that we will work on in the education space of live streams.
1673544	1681356	214	B	0.99993	We continue to have exciting and unique live streams here's, just kind of a slice of life here's.
1681388	1684512	215	B	1	The upcoming live streams for the coming 30 days.
1684646	1689996	216	B	0.99979	We have the roundtable that we're in right now, strangely looping.
1690188	1718468	217	B	0.99998	We have Chris Fields's discussion tomorrow, we have Social sciences discussion next week, lecture six and discussion six for physics, active inference for the social sciences, Avel's lecture and discussion and a guest stream on conviction, narrative theory and a new live stream paper based series kicking off on message passing.
1718564	1735200	218	B	0.99952	So it's kind of like a flavor of sometimes the work to prepare for this live stream is just to coordinate with a guest and it doesn't require any kind of expertise in their topic, actually just a curiosity in it.
1735350	1744864	219	B	0.93594	Other times we are operationally or logistically supporting the course teachers and also just showing up.
1744902	1780510	220	B	1	And then there's also work like the zero preparation where for weeks to months ahead of the live stream, we're studying through a paper and leveraging the questions that we have by asking early and asking often and precisely or at least legibly that enables the questions that are asked before the live stream by the zero preparers to then actually realize the addressing of those questions.
1781200	1787676	221	B	0.99988	Instead of a thousand scattered notebooks after the fact, or there being no fact and just 1000 scattered notebooks.
1787788	1802230	222	B	1	The dot zero I'm very passionate about because it is a way to do the homework early and by doing so, change how things actually happen.
1803000	1834588	223	B	0.99992	So if you're interested in having any kind of impact or learning with the live stream organizing and preparation process, whether you have this or that familiarity with the video and the media and the communication side or with any topics in and of themselves, it's super fun to invite people and have broad invitations, curations and facilitations.
1834684	1839568	224	B	0.95614	There's a lot of exciting things that people can get involved with, so please do.
1839654	1847540	225	B	1	And other than that, it's been a true highlight of the quarter and the year to have all these live streams.
1850280	1882828	226	B	0.99	And as mentioned earlier, following each live stream we go on to publish the proceedings and publish them on GitHub, where they're all versioned and collaboratively edited and also publish them to Zenodo to get the DOI and the URL briefly from re Inference, we continue work on the active inference ontology active blockfriends robotics and embodied.
1883004	1893240	227	B	1	And we have several of the Institute seed projects related to graphical interfaces for active inference and cognitive agent modeling.
1893420	1900150	228	B	0.53	And then there's the plethora of individual projects that people are working on on their own.
1900680	1903460	229	B	0.99998	Anything you want to add on any of those projects?
1904200	1905456	230	A	0.99999	No, thank you.
1905578	1917720	231	B	0.99663	Okay, well, as we head into the last months of our activity in 2023 and plan to have a quiet December.
1918160	1924988	232	B	0.99972	So really only two more months of activity this year, and then we'll be in next year.
1925154	1938876	233	B	0.95646	So, as usual, while scrambling to prepare for the presentation and trying to convey what we could and should, I developed this small meme.
1939068	1944100	234	B	0.99986	So here on the bottom is the timeline, quote timeline.
1944840	1947670	235	B	0.97939	We're here in September, 2023.
1948120	1954084	236	B	0.91587	Soon it will be classical New Year's, and we'll be in 2024.
1954122	1968590	237	B	0.99999	So here's us thinking, wow, 2024 should be really exciting, but also we remember feeling that way in 2022 and feeling that way in 2021.
1968960	1974510	238	B	0.99933	But this entire concept is a nested thought from the future.
1976240	1977544	239	B	0.99997	What do you think about that blue?
1977592	1982450	240	B	0.99997	Or what are you excited about in the past, present or future?
1989600	1991096	241	A	0.99995	We don't get a treasure map.
1991128	1991660	242	A	0.99	Right?
1991810	1995768	243	A	0.55318	So that's not something that comes with the Institute.
1995944	2009284	244	A	0.99926	So it's always, I think, exciting to think about what the future holds and looking back, how we've come so far and the leaps and what has caused exponential growth and all those things.
2009322	2011190	245	A	1	I mean, it's always just exciting, right?
2011560	2023690	246	A	0.82049	So some future thought maybe we'll be thinking about how we did make those big transitions every year, and we kept making them, and kept making them, and kept making them.
2026620	2027370	247	B	0.99996	Cool.
2028140	2028890	248	B	0.88849	Yeah.
2030460	2043352	249	B	1	One more specific call to action other than the earlier communications to actual or plausible participants, volunteers, interns.
2043496	2058160	250	B	0.70123	We'd like to really make a special call for those who are interested in joining the scientific advisory board or recommending or introducing somebody who you think could be helpful on the SAB.
2058980	2061476	251	B	0.95815	SAB is an informal body.
2061578	2064724	252	B	0.99934	We have office hours with them and shared documents with them.
2064762	2066900	253	B	0.99953	It's very opt in and flexible.
2067720	2079364	254	B	0.99975	Other SAB members, like Chris Fields went on to do the course, and just recently, Sarah Hamburg started facilitating the Morphstream series.
2079412	2087340	255	B	0.92033	So it's a way to get more involved and have even more structured contribution or differently structured contribution.
2087840	2103392	256	B	0.99	And it would be amazing to have the SAB participants as liaisons and advocates and co learners and co creators in the coming year.
2103526	2109124	257	B	0.99977	Because we select the SAB on a yearly scale, it would be great.
2109162	2110790	258	B	0.7449	It's always open to apply.
2111720	2130804	259	B	0.99982	However, again, in the coming several weeks, if we could reach out to people who might have a positive synergistic relationship with being on the SAB, it would be very special and appreciated.
2130852	2131610	260	B	0.99994	For us.
2133760	2143528	261	B	0.99916	Well, that's it for this short roundtable, so let's just give any thoughts.
2143624	2149680	262	B	0.4974	Meanwhile, I will wait for anyone in the live chat who might have questions.
2149830	2155504	263	B	0.78378	If they write them in the next few minutes, then we can address them or just talk about them.
2155542	2161350	264	B	0.99999	But other than that, what's on your mind, Bleu, or what are you excited for?
2165160	2167300	265	A	0.73723	Um I don't know.
2167370	2173444	266	A	0.9998	I'm excited for what's going to come up in 2024, I think will be a big year for us.
2173642	2180984	267	A	0.985	I'm excited to see if we get funded or don't get funded, but I think, regardless, we've learned a lot about where we are and where we're going.
2181182	2188188	268	A	0.97632	We've gained a lot of certainty about our existence in the niche and about our niche also, which is great.
2188354	2203308	269	A	0.69	At any time that you reduce uncertainty, you're able to, I think, help validate or solidify your existence as an organization or a human or whatever in the active inference way.
2203394	2208030	270	A	0.99857	So I'm excited to kind of see how that plays out in our future.
2208760	2209940	271	A	0.6813	Unfolding.
2211000	2212244	272	A	0.9998	What about you?
2212442	2233872	273	B	0.96974	Yeah, that reminds me of the bookstream series that you facilitated with Tyler and on Bijean Kesri's work about kind of using active inference to highlight the organizational generative model nested generative models.
2234036	2257132	274	B	0.76	And rather than talking about uncertainty being out there in terms of the aspects that are not known about what's out there, it's kind of like a glass half full, glass half empty, starting with the certainties and uncertainties of the generative model as enacted through policy selection.
2257276	2301136	275	B	0.67	And so even from the very most informal beginnings, like the strange loop and the excitement was around applying active inference to and by and with and for active inference in the multiscale setting and through the bookstream, but also through a million other vectors, 2023 has come through hugely on that and yet it remains a fledgling and nascent volunteer work as well.
2301238	2303280	276	B	0.99748	So it's epic.
2303940	2305244	277	B	0.99989	Do you have any last thoughts?
2305292	2307920	278	B	0.99906	Or we can conclude.
2311500	2313000	279	A	0.98341	We can conclude, I think.
2313070	2313896	280	B	0.6833	All right.
2314078	2315012	281	B	0.99411	Thank you, Bleu.
2315076	2316090	282	B	0.99994	Thank you, everyone.
2316780	2320570	283	B	0.99984	Hope this was a useful roundtable and see you next time.
2327440	2330492	284	B	0.96645	Okay, nice.
2330546	2334012	285	A	0.99318	All right, we will see you later.
2334066	2336956	286	A	0.99992	Maybe tomorrow, maybe if I can make it, I'm going to try.
2337138	2338936	287	B	0.91	To the discussion.
2338968	2340624	288	A	0.69	To the yeah, to the discussion.
2340672	2340770	289	B	0.99	Oh.
