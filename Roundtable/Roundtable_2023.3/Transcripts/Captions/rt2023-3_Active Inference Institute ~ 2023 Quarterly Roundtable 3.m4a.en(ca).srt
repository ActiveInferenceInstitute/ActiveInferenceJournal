00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,952
Hello, everyone. It's September 29,

3
00:00:10,016 --> 00:00:13,024
2023. We're here in the Active Inference

4
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:15,124
Institute's quarterly roundtable number

5
00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:18,324
three. So this is our third of the

6
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:20,500
quarterly updates.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,388
We have guests. I'm Daniel, one of

8
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:29,256
the officers of the institute. And I'm

9
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:31,436
Blue Knight, also another officer of the

10
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:34,030
institute. All right,

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,656
we are a participatory online institute

12
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:39,644
that is communicating, learning, and

13
00:00:39,682 --> 00:00:41,292
practicing applied active inference.

14
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:43,292
You can find us active Inference

15
00:00:43,356 --> 00:00:46,096
institute or the address. We'll be

16
00:00:46,118 --> 00:00:48,844
moving things over more to the institute

17
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:51,244
address, though. We're inference active

18
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:54,256
on Twitter or X, and here's more

19
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:56,116
information. This is recorded in an

20
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:58,212
archived Livestream, so please provide

21
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,196
us with feedback so we can improve on

22
00:01:00,218 --> 00:01:03,008
all aspects of our work. All backgrounds

23
00:01:03,024 --> 00:01:04,736
and perspectives are welcome, and we'll

24
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,320
follow video etiquette for live streams.

25
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,744
So today, in this quarterly update, we

26
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:14,324
will first cover some big developments

27
00:01:14,372 --> 00:01:16,760
and updates at the Institute and

28
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,636
Ecosystem Scale, then go over

29
00:01:20,738 --> 00:01:22,760
some educational and research updates

30
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,416
from our Edioactive and Reinference

31
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:27,964
organizational units, respectively, and

32
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:32,504
then have some fun and entertaining

33
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:35,448
musings on where we're going for the

34
00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:38,432
last months of 2023. Where we can all go

35
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:41,696
in 2024. And if you're watching live,

36
00:01:41,798 --> 00:01:43,828
please feel free to add any questions in

37
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:45,860
the live chat and then in the last

38
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,020
section, we'll be able to scan over that

39
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,950
and look at your questions.

40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,044
All right, first, updates from the

41
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,800
institute at the organizational scale.

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,424
One of the big highlights of the

43
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:05,528
last months and really of the year and

44
00:02:05,694 --> 00:02:08,312
of really all of our work together was

45
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,568
the accomplishment of this collaborative

46
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:13,596
paper that we released in August of this

47
00:02:13,618 --> 00:02:16,204
year, the Active Inference Institute and

48
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:18,748
Active Inference Ecosystem. We had a

49
00:02:18,754 --> 00:02:21,936
great team of co authors and to give a

50
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:25,404
visual abstract and just a teaser

51
00:02:25,452 --> 00:02:26,976
for those who might want to learn more

52
00:02:26,998 --> 00:02:30,048
about this paper. We went through a

53
00:02:30,054 --> 00:02:34,656
great collaborative process to document

54
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:38,932
and align on various aspects of what had

55
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:42,230
been, was, and will be happening.

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,504
And on the right side is figure one.

57
00:02:45,642 --> 00:02:48,500
This is an overview of the institute's

58
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,096
structure itself in engagement with the

59
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:55,370
ecosystem. On the left side are

60
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,924
a representation of our open source

61
00:02:57,972 --> 00:02:59,976
products and some of the functions that

62
00:02:59,998 --> 00:03:01,948
they provide in the ecosystem. There's a

63
00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:04,108
lot more to say, but Blue, what do you

64
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:05,884
want to comment on or what was it like

65
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:09,404
for you? It was

66
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:12,716
super intense. I think that we applied

67
00:03:12,748 --> 00:03:16,192
for a phase two grant, which I think we

68
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:18,592
should talk about maybe. And in doing

69
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:22,128
that phase two Pose grant, this was the

70
00:03:22,214 --> 00:03:23,936
preparation that they kind of give you

71
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,690
in the phase one. And it really is about

72
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,636
becoming like a big business or a

73
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:33,904
big corporation or a big organization

74
00:03:34,032 --> 00:03:36,724
right. And what it takes to really get

75
00:03:36,762 --> 00:03:39,712
organized and anchor and manage a large

76
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,728
community of people, which I think that

77
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:43,930
was really good for us.

78
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,176
I don't know how much managing we do.

79
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:49,276
We're a very distributed system, but we

80
00:03:49,298 --> 00:03:52,268
do already oversee or engage with a

81
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,716
large community of people. And what does

82
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:58,604
that look like when maybe we have

83
00:03:58,642 --> 00:04:01,644
conflicting factions or things get

84
00:04:01,682 --> 00:04:03,148
dropped, like the ball gets dropped in

85
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:04,760
one court or another. So I think that

86
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,288
that really kind of brought to light a

87
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:09,456
lot of the things we need to work on and

88
00:04:09,478 --> 00:04:10,976
also the things that we're doing a good

89
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:14,308
job at. Awesome. Yeah. We'll come to the

90
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:16,836
grant in a few slides, but just to

91
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:19,716
verbally describe the image. On the

92
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:24,420
right, we have the circle,

93
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,152
a golden ring that alludes to the COVID

94
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,896
of the Par Pazulo and Friston 2022

95
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,144
textbook. And that ring symbolizes the

96
00:04:33,182 --> 00:04:35,656
active inference ecosystem and also the

97
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:38,136
boundary between the Institute as an

98
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:42,076
entity and the ecosystem as niche in the

99
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:44,284
Institute itself. Starting on the top of

100
00:04:44,322 --> 00:04:47,160
within the ring, we have several

101
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,168
official bodies or organs. We have the

102
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:54,240
Board of Directors, who select officers,

103
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,832
as well as scientific advisory Board,

104
00:04:56,886 --> 00:04:59,616
which is an informal guidance and

105
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:00,896
insight group, which we'll come to

106
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:03,384
later. And the Institute provides

107
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:05,972
institute level functionality and

108
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:09,536
support for the two organizational

109
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:12,276
units, which are Eduactive, which is

110
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:14,564
focused on educational outcomes, and

111
00:05:14,602 --> 00:05:16,424
Reinforce, which is focused on research

112
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:20,388
work. The organizational units host

113
00:05:20,484 --> 00:05:22,692
through facilitation, other processes,

114
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:26,312
different projects that are all sorts of

115
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:29,196
within, on and out there in the

116
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:30,876
ecosystem, and then out in the

117
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:33,768
ecosystem, we have all different types

118
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:36,204
of activities and products and

119
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:39,388
organizations and players. And if

120
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:40,824
you're listening to this, we encourage

121
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:43,520
you to get involved. If it's something

122
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,560
that you want to learn more about, then

123
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,370
the paper is a great place to start,

124
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,944
best starting place that we've made so

125
00:05:50,982 --> 00:05:54,196
far. And the next step is to take that

126
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:58,260
active step and actually get involved.

127
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,764
Anything else to say on this? We should

128
00:06:01,802 --> 00:06:03,972
probably highlight the fact that our

129
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:05,764
research unit, which hasn't been

130
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:09,476
formally we've formally renamed our

131
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:11,288
research unit to Reinforce, which we

132
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:13,496
haven't announced yet. So I think as we

133
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:16,116
are talking about the Reinference Unit,

134
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:18,916
we did that kind of in the construction

135
00:06:18,948 --> 00:06:21,256
of this paper. And because we've been

136
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:23,096
educated and researched, and we just

137
00:06:23,118 --> 00:06:25,550
decided that Reinforce was more fun,

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,368
kind of shouting out to active inference

139
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:31,384
the whole thing, not just the active

140
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:35,056
part. Fun. Yeah. So thanks again to

141
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:37,056
all the authors here and also people who

142
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:39,120
contributed their insights and just

143
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,304
didn't want to be co authors. All right,

144
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:43,552
carrying on with institute level

145
00:06:43,606 --> 00:06:47,492
updates, on August 22 of this year,

146
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:50,208
we had a really amazing applied active

147
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:51,972
inference Symposium. This was our third

148
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:54,660
such symposium. The first was in 2021,

149
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,792
with Karl Friston as a kind of one

150
00:06:56,846 --> 00:06:59,336
person symposium last year. In the

151
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:01,284
second symposium, we highlighted

152
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:03,540
robotics and a variety of theoretical

153
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,600
applied work in robotics. This year,

154
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,572
we built off of the December 2022

155
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:13,256
framing of Friston et al. Designing

156
00:07:13,288 --> 00:07:15,932
ecosystems of shared intelligence, and

157
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:19,324
we wanted to put it into play. And so we

158
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,080
co organized with a really great team

159
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,868
enacting ecosystems of shared

160
00:07:23,884 --> 00:07:25,952
intelligence. And here are the

161
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:29,452
presenters and discussants who joined

162
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:32,000
and enacted the symposium.

163
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,124
And there's two intervals. It was an

164
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:38,404
awesome symposium, super exciting to

165
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:41,524
hear the breadth and the depth of the

166
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:44,244
work happening in the ecosystem. So for

167
00:07:44,282 --> 00:07:45,972
here, all I'll say is check out the

168
00:07:46,026 --> 00:07:48,212
program and recordings and transcripts

169
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:50,616
if you want to learn more about that.

170
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:52,696
It was an epic symposium, though, and

171
00:07:52,718 --> 00:07:54,696
thanks again to the co organizer team.

172
00:07:54,798 --> 00:08:01,890
Anything you want to add? Blue okay,

173
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,116
as Blue alluded to earlier,

174
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:11,312
we applied for a phase two

175
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,124
grant within the NSF program, Pathways

176
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:16,596
to Enable Open Source Ecosystems. So

177
00:08:16,618 --> 00:08:18,852
here's just two visualizations that are

178
00:08:18,906 --> 00:08:21,636
provided by the NSF to describe a little

179
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:23,264
bit of what they mean by an open source

180
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:25,816
ecosystem. On the right side, there's an

181
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,464
open source product, and then through

182
00:08:29,662 --> 00:08:32,984
a pathway to sustainability, an open

183
00:08:33,022 --> 00:08:35,192
source ecosystem can exist, which

184
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:37,544
includes here not just scientist, open

185
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:40,332
source product and external user, but

186
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,040
governance documents, scientists

187
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,396
onboarding support, external users, the

188
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:45,996
product developer, community,

189
00:08:46,098 --> 00:08:47,672
distributed defect, management,

190
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,004
development and integration, and

191
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:52,016
security. And it was super fun to think

192
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:54,096
about our work in this broader sense of

193
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:55,964
open source products. Open source

194
00:08:56,012 --> 00:08:58,752
doesn't only refer to code. So thinking

195
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,800
about what does a really rich,

196
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,764
multimodal open source product look like

197
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:08,516
and what is it? And you

198
00:09:08,538 --> 00:09:09,796
want to add anything there, blue or I

199
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:12,630
can add more. Yeah.

200
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,968
So the paper that we wrote was kind of

201
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:20,136
the scoping document for the grant, and

202
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:23,130
it's what the people do in phase one.

203
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,344
And in terms of open source, I think we

204
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:29,516
have done everything open source at the

205
00:09:29,538 --> 00:09:31,676
Institute, like all of the things that

206
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:35,420
we've done from the beginning of our

207
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,444
formulation until now. So it was kind of

208
00:09:38,482 --> 00:09:40,976
good to have that acknowledged that you

209
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,520
can have an ecosystem around education

210
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,264
or around just

211
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:49,776
live stream videos or information

212
00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:52,908
sharing, information management. We've

213
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:55,520
really built up the active inference

214
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,772
community. I think we've been a value

215
00:09:58,826 --> 00:10:00,964
add because somebody has to kind of

216
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:04,244
organize and give meaning to kind of the

217
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:07,096
random contributions or not random, but

218
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:10,936
I think it's helpful in a

219
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,320
field that's so new and that moves so

220
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,240
quickly in terms of research

221
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,210
developments and everything else.

222
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,972
Yeah. Thanks. Just to give a little more

223
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:24,604
detail, the primary submitter on this

224
00:10:24,642 --> 00:10:27,224
grant was the University of Washington

225
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:30,628
Applied Physics Lab via Copi Scott

226
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:34,320
David at the IRS IRI, as well as

227
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,464
Blue and I. And as Blue mentioned,

228
00:10:38,582 --> 00:10:41,696
it was really fun to see

229
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:44,452
who was ready for what. Who wanted to

230
00:10:44,506 --> 00:10:47,252
throw a value into the arena, who wanted

231
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:50,404
to put a comment on a Google doc, who is

232
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:55,060
ready to state their hourly rate

233
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,624
and scope of work and get involved. If

234
00:10:57,662 --> 00:10:59,816
there's pragmatic value of that kind on

235
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:03,352
the line? Who's ready to work

236
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:05,480
in the meanwhile? And so it was just

237
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,280
many discussions and negotiations,

238
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,944
and as we can smile

239
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:15,176
and laugh at now. A lot of curveballs

240
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,580
and things happening. So it was great

241
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,590
times. Okay, moving on.

242
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,960
Just within the last weeks, we have

243
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,800
submitted our form 1023 to the

244
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,284
IRS. And so we soon expect and prefer

245
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:34,992
ourselves to be a 501 tax exempt

246
00:11:35,056 --> 00:11:38,384
organization, which means that donations

247
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,868
that people provide to us, of which we

248
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:44,420
have received none so far, will be tax

249
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,232
exempt. Once that status and

250
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:51,272
all associated infrastructure is ready,

251
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:54,680
we'll begin philanthropic campaigning

252
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,304
with Blue especially. We are working on

253
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:02,584
policies and procedures proactively so

254
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,924
that we can have compliant ants ahead of

255
00:12:04,962 --> 00:12:08,940
time and just stay right and relevant.

256
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,784
It would be extremely helpful and much

257
00:12:12,822 --> 00:12:15,520
appreciated if anybody was interested in

258
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,516
contributing their experience, networks

259
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:20,864
or resources to what it could

260
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:24,256
be for a philanthropy or fundraising

261
00:12:24,288 --> 00:12:27,780
program at the Institute. We're open

262
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,630
to how that might develop.

263
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,680
And so if you see a high leverage

264
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,816
opportunity for what you know or who you

265
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:40,312
know or however, then some

266
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:43,016
truly amazing things could happen. And

267
00:12:43,038 --> 00:12:44,728
if you know, you know, and if you know,

268
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:47,940
then help. Anything you want to add on

269
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,988
this? I do want to add that

270
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:53,720
it was really interesting in developing

271
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,216
ecosystem infrastructure in the Pose

272
00:12:56,248 --> 00:12:58,716
grant and in the ecosystem paper. It was

273
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:02,060
really interesting to see what it takes

274
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,864
to be a sustainable ecosystem, to really

275
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:07,696
evaluate that at the level of the

276
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:10,176
Institute and the ecosystem. And I do

277
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:14,668
think that what makes organization

278
00:13:14,764 --> 00:13:18,532
dissolve. It's like time and people

279
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:20,404
and money. It's like time and money,

280
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:22,004
time and money. As long as people have

281
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:23,700
time and people have money and interest

282
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,980
level. So we have a great interest

283
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,888
level. As we'll talk about, I think in

284
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:30,516
the coming few slides we'll demonstrate

285
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:32,904
that, but how do we get people to keep

286
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:35,748
having time to commit to the Institute

287
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:37,144
and the organization? So I think that

288
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:39,784
one of the key things that we need to do

289
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:43,652
is fundraise philanthropy also,

290
00:13:43,726 --> 00:13:46,508
but also grant writing. So these two

291
00:13:46,674 --> 00:13:48,988
things will be, I think, central to

292
00:13:49,074 --> 00:13:51,868
keeping the Institute, like being the

293
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:53,452
glue that keeps the Institute together

294
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:55,632
in the coming years. So I just want to

295
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:57,376
just highlight that for anybody who

296
00:13:57,398 --> 00:13:59,824
wants to come be some glue, come provide

297
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:02,608
some adhesion in the niche, that'd be

298
00:14:02,614 --> 00:14:04,820
great. Yeah, it kind of goes without

299
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:08,416
saying, but it's easy to skip.

300
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:10,756
Everything that has happened so far has

301
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:12,944
been a purely volunteer effort,

302
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:15,220
including this very little, little

303
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,472
Livestream. And the last

304
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:21,972
few months have signaled and anticipated

305
00:14:22,036 --> 00:14:25,976
and readied for literally the first

306
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:28,556
paid people to do anything for the

307
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:32,728
Institute, which is a big game changer

308
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:37,516
and would scaffold our time. And so that

309
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:40,030
will be quite a transition point.

310
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,284
Let's continue also at the Institute

311
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:46,444
level, we continue with our volunteer

312
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:49,568
program. As always, I can do nothing but

313
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:53,064
encourage and exhort you to volunteer

314
00:14:53,212 --> 00:14:55,300
and get involved at the Institute.

315
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,164
Being a volunteer supports your

316
00:14:58,202 --> 00:14:59,764
engagement with projects and learning

317
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:00,848
groups, whichever ones you're

318
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:04,800
interested, it gives you repeatedly

319
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,456
affordances provided to get involved

320
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:09,544
with active inference and your

321
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:11,752
contributions will matter. The questions

322
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:13,416
you ask on a live stream will be

323
00:15:13,438 --> 00:15:14,676
published by the active inference

324
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,776
journal. The questions that you write in

325
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:19,564
the textbook group coda, those do become

326
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:21,304
part of a shared knowledge, niche,

327
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:23,548
code, developments that you provide

328
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:25,032
something that makes it more accessible

329
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:29,004
or applicable, those are huge in the

330
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:31,520
setting that we are and will be in. So

331
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,936
please volunteer and encourage other

332
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,600
people who could be looking for

333
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,970
technical or philosophical education,

334
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,304
community mentorship, all these

335
00:15:40,342 --> 00:15:42,748
different things. This is a great way.

336
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:44,516
And for those who would like a little

337
00:15:44,538 --> 00:15:48,564
bit more structured of an approach to

338
00:15:48,762 --> 00:15:50,996
getting involved, we continue to have

339
00:15:51,098 --> 00:15:53,620
the internship program. There's about 20

340
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,296
active interns from around the world who

341
00:15:56,318 --> 00:15:58,824
are engaging with different research and

342
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:02,296
education affordances, and we are up to

343
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:05,012
now five successfully completed

344
00:16:05,156 --> 00:16:08,872
internships. So to those who completed,

345
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:12,350
it's been honor and an epic time.

346
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,300
There's so much more I could say. But

347
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,884
it's really exciting what interns come

348
00:16:19,922 --> 00:16:23,584
in with, because we,

349
00:16:23,622 --> 00:16:26,624
ourselves, or from what we hear, people

350
00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:29,164
are excited to apply active inference

351
00:16:29,212 --> 00:16:31,744
and to improve their own education and

352
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,376
understanding of what active inference

353
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:35,988
is and how they might use it or grasp or

354
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:39,220
handle it. And then to have

355
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,950
this lightweight internship program

356
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,320
that makes a connection between

357
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,256
the Institute and the person, gives a

358
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,088
container and a name and a timeline and

359
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,036
an asynchronous document for people's

360
00:16:54,068 --> 00:16:56,760
engagement, whether they're in a

361
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,572
traditional educational program like

362
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:02,504
an undergraduate student or a graduate

363
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:06,184
student or probably the majority

364
00:17:06,312 --> 00:17:09,592
of which are outside of a traditional

365
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:12,636
educational program and just lifelong

366
00:17:12,668 --> 00:17:15,616
learners and lifelong cool people, and

367
00:17:15,638 --> 00:17:20,320
they just come to work

368
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,328
and hone what they do. So it continues

369
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:25,152
to be very inspiring and I encourage

370
00:17:25,216 --> 00:17:28,016
people to be interns.

371
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,324
And also for those who would like to

372
00:17:30,362 --> 00:17:34,148
facilitate or mentor, we would

373
00:17:34,234 --> 00:17:38,072
like to start that discussion about how

374
00:17:38,126 --> 00:17:41,336
that might work. Anything else

375
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:44,676
you want to add? The active

376
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,250
inference matchmaking service.

377
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,796
There's so many funny ways to take that,

378
00:17:54,818 --> 00:17:56,940
but yeah, what do you expect and prefer?

379
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,628
I meant like matching mentors and

380
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:03,090
interns. Yeah, that's it, of course.

381
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,604
And then just a little summary update.

382
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:10,204
Across our different platforms

383
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:14,580
and public interfaces,

384
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,896
we see continued growth and activity.

385
00:18:19,088 --> 00:18:22,644
Just one plot. This is

386
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:25,324
our channel, YouTube channel. Growth

387
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:28,170
through time. Just kind of interesting.

388
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,316
Slow and steady wins the race. But it's

389
00:18:31,348 --> 00:18:34,424
also always good to see that first and

390
00:18:34,462 --> 00:18:36,200
potentially second and third order

391
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,040
derivatives increasing.

392
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,292
Anything else you want to add? No,

393
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:45,436
I think the YouTube channel has really

394
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,076
blown up in the last quarter and I think

395
00:18:48,098 --> 00:18:50,012
a lot of that we just have to shout out

396
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:52,128
to the Chris Fields course because the

397
00:18:52,134 --> 00:18:55,010
views are astronomical in those videos.

398
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,524
It's really blowing up. So thanks Chris,

399
00:18:58,652 --> 00:19:00,432
if you're watching. And to everybody

400
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:02,032
who's viewing those videos, and taking

401
00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:03,996
those courses, which it's truly.

402
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:06,736
Actually yeah, yeah, we'll return to

403
00:19:06,758 --> 00:19:08,576
that, but good point. And also for

404
00:19:08,598 --> 00:19:10,400
people who are interested in even social

405
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,940
media management, video production,

406
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,656
podcast editing, discord moderation and

407
00:19:15,678 --> 00:19:18,408
governance, meta governance, there's a

408
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:21,976
lot of things that don't require some

409
00:19:22,158 --> 00:19:26,036
technical fluidity with the active

410
00:19:26,068 --> 00:19:29,016
inference kernel. So there's a lot of

411
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:31,144
ways that people can help. So don't let

412
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:33,096
it provide too much friction or freeze

413
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:34,556
you out if you feel like you want to be

414
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:36,664
involved, but you wonder if you don't

415
00:19:36,712 --> 00:19:38,844
know enough about some technical area or

416
00:19:38,882 --> 00:19:41,344
philosophical framing, it's totally not

417
00:19:41,382 --> 00:19:44,080
required. And there's a million ways

418
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,152
that we can work with wherever people

419
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:49,730
are. And actually,

420
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,908
that's like one of the key areas that

421
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:56,320
we've identified in our ecosystem

422
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,544
oversight is social media management.

423
00:19:58,592 --> 00:20:01,924
So it's not all about

424
00:20:01,962 --> 00:20:04,244
the math. So many people come to us

425
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:06,344
like, I'm so curious, except I can't do

426
00:20:06,382 --> 00:20:09,864
math and it's okay. Actually, can you do

427
00:20:09,902 --> 00:20:12,936
Twitter? Because really there's a lot

428
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,408
of opportunities for involvement with

429
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:17,000
the Institute that aren't math heavy.

430
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,616
Before we head into the organizational

431
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:23,532
units, here's the big picture on which

432
00:20:23,586 --> 00:20:25,788
activities are happening. This website,

433
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:29,548
which you'll find heartily linked from

434
00:20:29,714 --> 00:20:33,468
basically anywhere, you are always

435
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:36,268
summarizes the up to date representation

436
00:20:36,364 --> 00:20:38,576
of what activities are happening and

437
00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:40,016
what you can do to get involved. So I'll

438
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,288
just go over this and we'll talk about a

439
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:43,604
few of these projects in the coming

440
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,616
slides. So in the space of publishing

441
00:20:47,808 --> 00:20:50,564
different medias, we have the Live

442
00:20:50,602 --> 00:20:53,396
Stream project where we organize and

443
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,580
prepare for different live streams.

444
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,552
Following live streams, transcripts are

445
00:20:58,606 --> 00:21:00,676
created and published through the Active

446
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,712
Inference journal, which through the

447
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:06,840
work of Alex, Holly, Dave Others is

448
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,124
always improving. And it's an exciting

449
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:11,416
time for all of these natural language

450
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:13,804
processing analyses as well. This is all

451
00:21:13,842 --> 00:21:16,456
being pushed to the GitHub that allows

452
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:19,228
you to clone off the current state of

453
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:20,908
the art in all the transcripts and

454
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:23,528
translations. In the learning groups

455
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:27,008
area we have the Pardol textbook group

456
00:21:27,094 --> 00:21:28,816
Cohorts Four and Five continuing through

457
00:21:28,838 --> 00:21:30,608
the textbook group Fundamentals of

458
00:21:30,614 --> 00:21:32,828
Active Inference, Sanjeev Namjoshi's

459
00:21:32,844 --> 00:21:36,404
book in progress and two courses which

460
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:38,276
we'll come to later, physics is

461
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,096
Information Processing by Chris Fields

462
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:41,968
and Constructing Cultural Landscapes

463
00:21:42,064 --> 00:21:43,760
active Inference for the Social Sciences

464
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,960
by Avel et al. In the software Space

465
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,868
and Activity, we continue on active

466
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:52,584
Blockfrence, where we work from both

467
00:21:52,622 --> 00:21:55,112
ends to make cognitive modeling more

468
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,528
accessible and applicable. We work from

469
00:21:57,534 --> 00:21:59,640
the technical capacity side to develop

470
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,316
the active Blockfrence project itself as

471
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:05,260
a package utilizing CAD CAD to apply

472
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,820
active generative models. And we also

473
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,156
work from the system or domain of

474
00:22:10,178 --> 00:22:12,240
interest side, working with people

475
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,540
wherever they're at in their analytical

476
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,752
or programming abilities and just

477
00:22:16,806 --> 00:22:19,984
starting to get the inklings of the

478
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:21,404
recipe for generative modeling.

479
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:24,800
Together Robotics and Embodied, JF

480
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,320
continues to develop his work with Lego

481
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,776
robots and societies of mind. Active

482
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,912
inference ontology also continues

483
00:22:34,976 --> 00:22:38,216
maintaining and slightly improving as

484
00:22:38,238 --> 00:22:41,076
well as extending the active inference

485
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:43,412
ontology. And we have two weekly

486
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:46,296
discussion sessions, one more on the

487
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:47,908
educational theme, one more on the

488
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,816
research theme, but ultimately they're

489
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:51,772
both just how it goes in the moment.

490
00:22:51,906 --> 00:22:53,070
Anything to add?

491
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,920
All right. In Eduactive,

492
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,360
our educational organizational unit,

493
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,964
one of the most exciting continued

494
00:23:04,012 --> 00:23:06,316
activities is the active inference

495
00:23:06,348 --> 00:23:08,912
textbook group. Cohort three, just

496
00:23:08,966 --> 00:23:10,864
within the last weeks, finished their

497
00:23:10,902 --> 00:23:13,116
journey. So congrats to those who stuck

498
00:23:13,148 --> 00:23:16,160
it through cohort three. Cohort four is

499
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,144
now in chapter six recipe for generative

500
00:23:18,192 --> 00:23:20,228
modeling, continuing on with the book.

501
00:23:20,314 --> 00:23:22,596
And cohort five is starting off there in

502
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:26,520
chapter one. Everyone's welcome to join

503
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,256
either or both of these cohorts, which

504
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:32,836
are staggered so that you can attend

505
00:23:32,868 --> 00:23:34,996
the same time zone and get sampling

506
00:23:35,028 --> 00:23:38,588
across the book, or you can stay on one

507
00:23:38,754 --> 00:23:41,512
trail at a time and switch time zones.

508
00:23:41,656 --> 00:23:43,484
Everything's recorded, everything is

509
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:46,168
collaborative. In our shared workspace,

510
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:48,604
it's always possible to register and get

511
00:23:48,642 --> 00:23:52,236
involved. All backgrounds are totally

512
00:23:52,268 --> 00:23:54,204
welcome and encouraged. So if you've

513
00:23:54,252 --> 00:23:57,824
seen this textbook and or

514
00:23:57,862 --> 00:23:59,696
you want to learn more about what the

515
00:23:59,718 --> 00:24:02,464
only active inference textbook in the

516
00:24:02,502 --> 00:24:05,410
play right now says,

517
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,484
and also connect a ton of dots and bring

518
00:24:08,522 --> 00:24:10,164
in a ton of other resources and more

519
00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:11,924
then the active inference textbook group

520
00:24:11,962 --> 00:24:14,390
is a great place and you'll meet many

521
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,936
people who are also interested in

522
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,992
similar topics. Anything else?

523
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:22,890
Blue it's fine.

524
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,680
Okay. The course that began in May 2023

525
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,608
is now about five six completed. That's

526
00:24:31,624 --> 00:24:33,276
physics's. Information Processing by

527
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:37,390
Chris Fields. It's been a journey and

528
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,676
can't wait for the fifth discussion

529
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:43,344
section, which is tomorrow, and then the

530
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:46,704
6th lecture and discussion and that

531
00:24:46,742 --> 00:24:50,764
will have locked in the completion

532
00:24:50,812 --> 00:24:53,040
of the first course at the institute.

533
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,576
We'll be able to publish the proceedings

534
00:24:56,768 --> 00:24:58,916
of the lectures and discussions as well

535
00:24:58,938 --> 00:25:00,820
as the asynchronous question and answer,

536
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,040
which Chris Fields is very graciously

537
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,440
answering. Then we'll be able to explore

538
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,168
cohort or individual based learning

539
00:25:10,254 --> 00:25:13,720
structures around this really

540
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,404
first principles and groundbreaking

541
00:25:16,532 --> 00:25:19,852
content that Chris is sharing. Want to

542
00:25:19,906 --> 00:25:21,230
add anything on this one?

543
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,390
Just wow. That's all. Yeah.

544
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,008
Also in the courses space. We continue

545
00:25:33,094 --> 00:25:35,036
on with the constructing cultural

546
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,496
landscapes. Active inference for the

547
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:39,404
social sciences course with Avel,

548
00:25:39,452 --> 00:25:43,000
Ben, Mahault, Lorena and myself. So Ben

549
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,956
Mahault, myself and Lorena have

550
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:49,876
completed their sections with a

551
00:25:50,058 --> 00:25:51,668
lecture and a discussion, although I

552
00:25:51,674 --> 00:25:54,790
guess Mao's discussion is coming up.

553
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,156
We look forward to also the continued

554
00:25:59,188 --> 00:26:02,436
activity in this course as we remarked

555
00:26:02,468 --> 00:26:06,452
on in our last quarterly roundtable.

556
00:26:06,516 --> 00:26:10,492
Second one this year has

557
00:26:10,546 --> 00:26:13,720
and will see us go from zero courses

558
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,004
to two completed courses. So both the

559
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,420
physics and the social sciences,

560
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,824
which under some understandings run

561
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:27,024
the gamut of multiscale systems. To have

562
00:26:27,062 --> 00:26:31,056
both of those at such high

563
00:26:31,238 --> 00:26:34,736
quality volunteered

564
00:26:34,848 --> 00:26:39,044
and catalyzed by real

565
00:26:39,162 --> 00:26:43,472
unique expertise and also broad

566
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:47,160
and diverse participation is

567
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,984
incredible. Anything you want to add?

568
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:53,560
Blue just that as we are

569
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,856
starting to have courses hosted by the

570
00:26:56,878 --> 00:26:58,988
Institute and completed. Anybody

571
00:26:59,074 --> 00:27:01,644
interested in having a course hosted by

572
00:27:01,682 --> 00:27:04,504
us should reach out. And anyone familiar

573
00:27:04,552 --> 00:27:07,404
with or interested in accreditation is

574
00:27:07,442 --> 00:27:09,260
also something like we've been thinking

575
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,216
about what

576
00:27:13,238 --> 00:27:15,484
would certification in active inference

577
00:27:15,532 --> 00:27:17,824
look like, what are the key build up

578
00:27:17,862 --> 00:27:20,208
skills? And how could we develop a

579
00:27:20,214 --> 00:27:22,256
program to say someone is certified in

580
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:23,568
active inference? It's something that

581
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:24,576
we've been thinking about at the

582
00:27:24,598 --> 00:27:26,944
Institute scale. So if you have ideas,

583
00:27:26,992 --> 00:27:29,236
we would love to hear about them. And if

584
00:27:29,258 --> 00:27:31,316
you have experience, we would love to

585
00:27:31,338 --> 00:27:34,564
get your input. Yeah, it's not

586
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:37,064
covered in this roundtable, but the

587
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:38,824
qualification certification, something

588
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:42,456
that we're thinking about and the

589
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:45,236
pedagogy and developing and hosting

590
00:27:45,268 --> 00:27:47,176
courses, these are all things that we

591
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:50,716
will work on in the education

592
00:27:50,898 --> 00:27:54,476
space of live streams. We continue to

593
00:27:54,498 --> 00:27:57,864
have exciting and unique live streams

594
00:27:57,912 --> 00:28:00,728
here's, just kind of a slice of life

595
00:28:00,914 --> 00:28:02,928
here's. The upcoming live streams for

596
00:28:02,934 --> 00:28:05,856
the coming 30 days. We have the

597
00:28:05,878 --> 00:28:08,208
roundtable that we're in right now,

598
00:28:08,374 --> 00:28:11,596
strangely looping. We have Chris

599
00:28:11,628 --> 00:28:14,900
Fields's discussion tomorrow, we have

600
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,230
Social sciences discussion next week,

601
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,444
lecture six and discussion six for

602
00:28:21,482 --> 00:28:24,084
physics, active inference for the social

603
00:28:24,122 --> 00:28:27,492
sciences, Avel's lecture and discussion

604
00:28:27,636 --> 00:28:31,156
and a guest stream on conviction,

605
00:28:31,188 --> 00:28:34,424
narrative theory and a new

606
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,996
live stream paper based series kicking

607
00:28:37,028 --> 00:28:39,276
off on message passing. So it's kind of

608
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:42,652
like a flavor of sometimes the

609
00:28:42,706 --> 00:28:45,036
work to prepare for this live stream is

610
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,516
just to coordinate with a guest and it

611
00:28:47,538 --> 00:28:50,800
doesn't require any kind of expertise in

612
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,364
their topic, actually just a curiosity

613
00:28:54,412 --> 00:28:58,210
in it. Other times we are

614
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,724
operationally or logistically supporting

615
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:04,384
the course teachers and also just

616
00:29:04,422 --> 00:29:06,880
showing up. And then there's also work

617
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,340
like the zero preparation where for

618
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,244
weeks to months ahead of the live

619
00:29:12,282 --> 00:29:15,190
stream, we're studying through a paper

620
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,640
and leveraging the questions

621
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:23,272
that we have by asking early

622
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:27,096
and asking often and precisely or at

623
00:29:27,118 --> 00:29:31,244
least legibly that enables the questions

624
00:29:31,282 --> 00:29:33,644
that are asked before the live stream by

625
00:29:33,682 --> 00:29:37,292
the zero preparers to then actually

626
00:29:37,426 --> 00:29:39,884
realize the addressing of those

627
00:29:39,922 --> 00:29:42,272
questions. Instead of a thousand

628
00:29:42,326 --> 00:29:44,224
scattered notebooks after the fact, or

629
00:29:44,262 --> 00:29:46,368
there being no fact and just 1000

630
00:29:46,454 --> 00:29:49,596
scattered notebooks. The dot zero I'm

631
00:29:49,628 --> 00:29:53,796
very passionate about because it is a

632
00:29:53,818 --> 00:29:57,430
way to do the homework early

633
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,996
and by doing so, change how things

634
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:04,884
actually happen. So if you're interested

635
00:30:05,002 --> 00:30:08,632
in having any kind of

636
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,980
impact or learning with the live stream

637
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,304
organizing and preparation process,

638
00:30:13,502 --> 00:30:15,704
whether you have this or that

639
00:30:15,742 --> 00:30:17,880
familiarity with the video and the media

640
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:21,100
and the communication side or with any

641
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:24,492
topics in and of themselves, it's super

642
00:30:24,546 --> 00:30:28,124
fun to invite people and have

643
00:30:28,322 --> 00:30:31,172
broad invitations,

644
00:30:31,336 --> 00:30:35,328
curations and facilitations. There's a

645
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,216
lot of exciting things that people can

646
00:30:37,318 --> 00:30:40,000
get involved with, so please do. And

647
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,520
other than that, it's been a true

648
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,324
highlight of the quarter and the year to

649
00:30:44,362 --> 00:30:47,540
have all these live streams.

650
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,244
And as mentioned earlier, following each

651
00:30:52,282 --> 00:30:56,488
live stream we go on to publish the

652
00:30:56,574 --> 00:31:00,388
proceedings and publish them on GitHub,

653
00:31:00,564 --> 00:31:03,160
where they're all versioned and

654
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,404
collaboratively edited and also publish

655
00:31:06,452 --> 00:31:09,164
them to Zenodo to get the DOI and the

656
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:13,800
URL briefly

657
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,372
from re Inference, we continue work

658
00:31:17,426 --> 00:31:19,848
on the active inference ontology active

659
00:31:19,864 --> 00:31:22,828
blockfriends robotics and embodied.

660
00:31:23,004 --> 00:31:25,804
And we have several of the Institute

661
00:31:25,932 --> 00:31:28,732
seed projects related to graphical

662
00:31:28,796 --> 00:31:31,200
interfaces for active inference and

663
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,956
cognitive agent modeling. And then

664
00:31:33,978 --> 00:31:36,004
there's the plethora of individual

665
00:31:36,122 --> 00:31:39,348
projects that people are working on on

666
00:31:39,354 --> 00:31:41,972
their own. Anything you want to add on

667
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:45,456
any of those projects? No, thank you.

668
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:47,850
Okay, well,

669
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,264
as we head into the last months of our

670
00:31:52,302 --> 00:31:55,992
activity in 2023 and plan

671
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:59,340
to have a quiet December. So really only

672
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,750
two more months of activity this year,

673
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,684
and then we'll be in next year. So, as

674
00:32:06,722 --> 00:32:10,076
usual, while scrambling to prepare for

675
00:32:10,098 --> 00:32:13,356
the presentation and trying to convey

676
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:17,164
what we could and should, I developed

677
00:32:17,212 --> 00:32:20,656
this small meme. So here

678
00:32:20,678 --> 00:32:23,264
on the bottom is the timeline, quote

679
00:32:23,312 --> 00:32:26,032
timeline. We're here in September,

680
00:32:26,096 --> 00:32:29,764
2023. Soon it will

681
00:32:29,802 --> 00:32:32,996
be classical New Year's, and we'll be in

682
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:36,070
2024. So here's us thinking,

683
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,816
wow, 2024 should be

684
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:42,920
really exciting, but also we remember

685
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:46,756
feeling that way in 2022 and feeling

686
00:32:46,788 --> 00:32:50,430
that way in 2021. But this entire

687
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,916
concept is a nested thought from the

688
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:57,036
future. What do you think about

689
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,388
that blue? Or what are you excited about

690
00:32:59,554 --> 00:33:02,450
in the past, present or future?

691
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,412
We don't get a treasure map. Right? So

692
00:33:12,546 --> 00:33:14,844
that's not something that comes with the

693
00:33:14,882 --> 00:33:17,888
Institute. So it's always, I think,

694
00:33:17,974 --> 00:33:19,472
exciting to think about what the future

695
00:33:19,526 --> 00:33:23,196
holds and looking back, how we've

696
00:33:23,228 --> 00:33:26,416
come so far and the leaps and what has

697
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:29,076
caused exponential growth and all those

698
00:33:29,098 --> 00:33:30,116
things. I mean, it's always just

699
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:33,670
exciting, right? So some future thought

700
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,500
maybe we'll be thinking about how we did

701
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,644
make those big transitions every year,

702
00:33:40,682 --> 00:33:42,184
and we kept making them, and kept making

703
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:43,690
them, and kept making them.

704
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,890
Cool. Yeah.

705
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,964
One more specific call

706
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:56,860
to action other than the earlier

707
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,096
communications to actual or plausible

708
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,816
participants, volunteers, interns. We'd

709
00:34:03,848 --> 00:34:07,504
like to really make a special call for

710
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:09,216
those who are interested in joining the

711
00:34:09,238 --> 00:34:11,360
scientific advisory board or

712
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:14,496
recommending or introducing somebody who

713
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:18,160
you think could be helpful on the SAB.

714
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:22,292
SAB is an informal body. We have

715
00:34:22,346 --> 00:34:23,936
office hours with them and shared

716
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:25,876
documents with them. It's very opt in

717
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:29,572
and flexible. Other SAB members,

718
00:34:29,706 --> 00:34:33,336
like Chris Fields went on to do the

719
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:37,204
course, and just recently, Sarah Hamburg

720
00:34:37,332 --> 00:34:38,964
started facilitating the Morphstream

721
00:34:39,012 --> 00:34:41,976
series. So it's a way to get more

722
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:44,504
involved and have even more structured

723
00:34:44,552 --> 00:34:46,440
contribution or differently structured

724
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,590
contribution. And it would be amazing

725
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,600
to have the SAB participants

726
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,288
as liaisons and advocates and

727
00:34:58,374 --> 00:35:02,416
co learners and co creators in

728
00:35:02,438 --> 00:35:04,864
the coming year. Because we select the

729
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:08,748
SAB on a yearly scale, it would be

730
00:35:08,854 --> 00:35:10,790
great. It's always open to apply.

731
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,224
However, again, in the coming several

732
00:35:14,272 --> 00:35:17,604
weeks, if we could reach

733
00:35:17,642 --> 00:35:22,392
out to people who might

734
00:35:22,446 --> 00:35:26,104
have a positive synergistic relationship

735
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:29,576
with being on the SAB, it would be very

736
00:35:29,678 --> 00:35:31,610
special and appreciated. For us.

737
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,150
Well, that's it for this short

738
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,204
roundtable, so let's just give

739
00:35:42,242 --> 00:35:45,644
any thoughts. Meanwhile, I will

740
00:35:45,842 --> 00:35:48,576
wait for anyone in the live chat who

741
00:35:48,678 --> 00:35:50,704
might have questions. If they write them

742
00:35:50,742 --> 00:35:53,648
in the next few minutes, then we can

743
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,504
address them or just talk about them.

744
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:58,812
But other than that, what's on your

745
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:01,350
mind, Blue, or what are you excited for?

746
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,628
Um I don't know. I'm excited for

747
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:11,412
what's going to come up in 2024, I think

748
00:36:11,546 --> 00:36:14,304
will be a big year for us. I'm excited

749
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:16,296
to see if we get funded or don't get

750
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:17,876
funded, but I think, regardless, we've

751
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:19,896
learned a lot about where we are and

752
00:36:19,918 --> 00:36:22,216
where we're going. We've gained a lot of

753
00:36:22,238 --> 00:36:24,556
certainty about our existence in the

754
00:36:24,578 --> 00:36:27,564
niche and about our niche also, which is

755
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,784
great. At any time that you reduce

756
00:36:29,832 --> 00:36:32,252
uncertainty, you're able to, I think,

757
00:36:32,386 --> 00:36:35,980
help validate or solidify your existence

758
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,892
as an organization or a human or

759
00:36:40,946 --> 00:36:43,308
whatever in the active inference way.

760
00:36:43,394 --> 00:36:46,284
So I'm excited to kind of see how that

761
00:36:46,322 --> 00:36:48,030
plays out in our future.

762
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,244
Unfolding. What about you?

763
00:36:52,442 --> 00:36:56,800
Yeah, that reminds me of the bookstream

764
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,920
series that you facilitated with Tyler

765
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,650
and on Bijean Kesri's work about

766
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,240
kind of using active inference to

767
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,316
highlight the organizational generative

768
00:37:11,348 --> 00:37:14,412
model nested generative models. And

769
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:17,128
rather than talking about uncertainty

770
00:37:17,224 --> 00:37:24,376
being out there in terms of the aspects

771
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,416
that are not known about what's out

772
00:37:26,438 --> 00:37:28,496
there, it's kind of like a glass half

773
00:37:28,518 --> 00:37:30,784
full, glass half empty, starting with

774
00:37:30,822 --> 00:37:32,528
the certainties and uncertainties of the

775
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:35,090
generative model as enacted through

776
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:40,324
policy selection. And so even

777
00:37:40,362 --> 00:37:44,000
from the very most informal beginnings,

778
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,592
like the strange loop and the excitement

779
00:37:48,656 --> 00:37:51,280
was around applying active inference to

780
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:54,520
and by and with and for active inference

781
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,896
in the multiscale setting and through

782
00:37:57,918 --> 00:37:59,416
the bookstream, but also through a

783
00:37:59,438 --> 00:38:02,120
million other vectors,

784
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:08,296
2023 has come through hugely

785
00:38:08,488 --> 00:38:12,060
on that and yet

786
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,950
it remains a fledgling and

787
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,704
nascent volunteer work as

788
00:38:20,742 --> 00:38:23,280
well. So it's epic.

789
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,104
Do you have any last thoughts? Or we can

790
00:38:27,142 --> 00:38:27,920
conclude.

791
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,896
We can conclude, I think. All right.

792
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,090
Thank you, Blue. Thank you, everyone.

793
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,952
Hope this was a useful roundtable and

794
00:38:39,006 --> 00:38:40,570
see you next time.

795
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,310
Okay, nice. All right,

796
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,664
we will see you later. Maybe tomorrow,

797
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:56,348
maybe if I can make it, I'm going to

798
00:38:56,354 --> 00:38:59,956
try. To the discussion. To the yeah,

799
00:38:59,978 --> 00:39:00,624
to the discussion.
