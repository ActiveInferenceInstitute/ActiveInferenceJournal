00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,500
foreign

2
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:12,300
it's September 29th 2023 we're here in

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,679
the active inference institute's

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,839
quarterly Roundtable number three so

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,340
this is our third

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,840
of the quarterly updates

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,420
we have guests

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,300
I'm Daniel one of the officers of the

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,920
Institute and

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,500
blue night also another officer of the

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,180
Institute

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,340
all right

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,500
we are a participatory online Institute

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,719
that is communicating learning and

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,640
practicing applied active inference you

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,800
can find us at octaveinference.institute

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,379
or the dot org address we'll be moving

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,780
things over more to the dot Institute

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,980
address though

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,399
we're inference active on Twitter or X

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,559
and here's more information this is

22
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,780
recorded in an archived live stream so

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,399
please provide us with feedback so we

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,219
can improve on all aspects of our work

25
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,080
all backgrounds and perspectives are

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,240
welcome and will follow video etiquette

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,040
for live streams

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,860
so today in this quarterly update we

29
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,580
will first cover some big developments

30
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,979
and updates at The Institute and

31
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,659
ecosystem scale

32
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,020
then go over some educational and

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,540
research updates from our edu active and

34
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,640
re-inference organizational units

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,380
respectively and then have some fun and

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,040
entertaining musings on where we're

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,740
going for the last months of 2023 where

38
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,740
we can all go in 2024 and if you're

39
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,960
watching live please feel free to add

40
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,060
any questions in the live chat and then

41
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,040
in the last section we'll be able to

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,680
scan over that and um

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,140
look at your questions

44
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,259
all right first updates from The

45
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,159
Institute at the organizational scale

46
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,579
one of the big highlights of the last

47
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,000
months and really of the year and of

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,639
really all of our work together with the

49
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,440
accomplishment of this collaborative

50
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,620
paper that we released in August of this

51
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,260
year the active inference Institute and

52
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,840
active inference ecosystem we had a

53
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,020
great team of co-authors and to give a

54
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,680
visual abstract and just a teaser for

55
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,060
those who might want to learn more about

56
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,459
this paper we

57
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:30,720
went through a great collaborative

58
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,660
process to

59
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,680
document and align on various aspects of

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,959
what had been

61
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,019
was and will be happening

62
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,840
and on the right side is figure one this

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,420
is an overview of the institute's

64
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,180
structure itself in engagement with the

65
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,220
ecosystem

66
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,800
on the left side are

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,959
a representation of our Open Source

68
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,060
Products and some of the functions that

69
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,040
they provide in the ecosystem there's a

70
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,140
lot more to say but blue what do you

71
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,879
want to comment on or what was it like

72
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,359
for you

73
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,920
it was super intense

74
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,680
um I think that we applied for a phase

75
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,980
two Grant which I think we should talk

76
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,260
about maybe and and in doing that phase

77
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,300
two pose Grant

78
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,340
um this was the preparation that they

79
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,680
kind of give you in the phase one and it

80
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,060
really is about

81
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,620
um

82
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,980
becoming like a big business or a big

83
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,379
Corporation or a big organization right

84
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,840
and like what it takes to really get

85
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,780
organized and anchor and manage a large

86
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,760
community of people

87
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,260
um which I think that was really good

88
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,900
for us so like we are already kind of I

89
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,459
don't know how much managing we do we're

90
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,560
a very distributed system but we do

91
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,620
already oversee or engage with a large

92
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,780
community of people and like what does

93
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,760
that look like when

94
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,200
um maybe we have conflicting factions or

95
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,879
um things get dropped like the ball gets

96
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,680
dropped in one court or another so so I

97
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,760
think that that really kind of brought

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,560
to light a lot of

99
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,480
uh the things we need to work on and

100
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,040
also the things that we're doing a good

101
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,540
job at

102
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,060
awesome yeah we'll come to the Grant in

103
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,579
a few slides but just to verbally

104
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,478
describe the image on the right

105
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,780
we have the circle

106
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,120
a golden ring that alludes to the cover

107
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,000
of the par pazulo and friston 2022

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,139
textbook

109
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,600
and that ring symbolizes the active

110
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,699
inference ecosystem and also the

111
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,220
boundary between the Institute as an

112
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,120
entity and the ecosystem as niche in The

113
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,280
Institute itself starting on the top of

114
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,060
within the ring we have several official

115
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,699
bodies or organs

116
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,979
we have the board of directors who

117
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:54,540
select officers

118
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,820
as well as scientific Advisory Board

119
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,860
which is an informal

120
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,660
guidance and insight Group which we'll

121
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,419
come to later and The Institute provides

122
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,060
Institute level functionality and

123
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,759
support for the two

124
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,759
organizational units which are eduactive

125
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,100
which is focused on educational outcomes

126
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,960
and reinference which is focused on

127
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,680
Research work the organizational units

128
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,780
host through facilitation other

129
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,199
processes different projects that are

130
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,100
all sorts of within on and out there in

131
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,960
the ecosystem and then out in the

132
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,440
ecosystem we have all different types of

133
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,240
activities and products and

134
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
organizations and players and if you're

135
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,639
listening to this we encourage you to

136
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,280
get involved if it's something that you

137
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,979
want to learn more about then the paper

138
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,840
is a great place to start

139
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,120
best starting place that we've made so

140
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,360
far and the next step is to take that

141
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,680
active

142
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,800
step and actually get involved

143
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,139
anything else to say on this

144
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,360
we should probably highlight the fact

145
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,820
that our Research Unit which hasn't been

146
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,300
formally like we've formally renamed our

147
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,340
Research Unit to reinference which we

148
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,380
haven't announced yet so I think like as

149
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,539
we are talking about the reinference

150
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,539
unit we did that kind of in the

151
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,220
construction of this paper and because

152
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,080
we were we've been edgy active and

153
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,759
researched and we just decided that

154
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,240
reinference was more fun kind of um you

155
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,280
know shouting out to active inference

156
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,520
the whole thing not just the active part

157
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,520
fun yeah so thanks again to all the

158
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,139
authors here and also people who

159
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,940
contributed their their insights and

160
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,880
just didn't want to be co-authors

161
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,259
all right carrying on with Institute

162
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,979
level updates on August 22nd of this

163
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,919
year we had a really amazing applied

164
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,660
active inference Symposium this was our

165
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,699
third such Symposium the first was in

166
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,819
2021 with Carl friston as a kind of one

167
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,520
person Symposium last year in the second

168
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,580
Symposium we highlighted Robotics and a

169
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,800
variety of theoretical applied work in

170
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,280
robotics this year we built off of the

171
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,539
December 2022 framing of friston at all

172
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,520
designing ecosystems of shared

173
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,220
intelligence and we wanted to put it

174
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,759
into play and so we

175
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,979
co-organized with a really great team

176
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:24,060
enacting ecosystems of shared

177
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,240
intelligence and here are the presenters

178
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,660
and discussants who joined and enacted

179
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,400
the symposium

180
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,280
and there's two intervals it was an

181
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,699
awesome Symposium super exciting to hear

182
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,880
the breadth and the depth of the work

183
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,520
happening in the ecosystem so for here

184
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,440
all I'll say is check out the program

185
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,720
and recordings and transcripts if you

186
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,360
want to learn more about that it was an

187
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,220
epic Symposium though and thanks again

188
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,380
to the co-organizer team anything you

189
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,800
want to hot blue

190
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,620
okay

191
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,000
as blue alluded to earlier we applied

192
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,199
for a phase two Grant within the NSF

193
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,360
program Pathways to enable open source

194
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,400
ecosystems so here's just two

195
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,680
visualizations that are provided by the

196
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,139
NSF to describe a little bit of what

197
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,539
they mean by an open source ecosystem on

198
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,520
the right side there's an open source

199
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,660
product

200
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,020
and then through a pathway to

201
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,520
sustainability

202
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,339
an open source ecosystem can exist which

203
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,620
includes here not just scientists open

204
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,440
source product and external user but

205
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,120
governance documents scientists

206
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,520
onboarding support external users the

207
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,680
product developer Community distributed

208
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,480
defect management development and

209
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,980
integration and security

210
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,440
and it was super fun to think about our

211
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,300
work in this broader sense of Open

212
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,640
Source Products open source doesn't only

213
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,580
refer to code so thinking about what is

214
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,220
a really rich

215
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,779
multimodal open source product look like

216
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,279
and what what is it

217
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,180
and

218
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,080
you want anything they're blue or I can

219
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,820
add more

220
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,740
yeah I just

221
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,240
that are

222
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,040
um so the paper that we wrote was kind

223
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,980
of the scoping document for the grant

224
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,500
and it's what the people do in in Phase

225
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,700
One

226
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,440
um and and in terms of Open Source I

227
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,140
think like we have done everything open

228
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,260
source uh at The Institute like all of

229
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,820
the things that we've done from from the

230
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,140
beginning of

231
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,100
um like our formulation until now so it

232
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,360
was kind of good to have that

233
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,760
acknowledged that like you can have an

234
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,300
ecosystem around education or around

235
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,959
um like just live stream videos or

236
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,700
information sharing information

237
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,240
management uh like we've really built up

238
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,920
um the active inference

239
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,680
Community I think I think we've been a

240
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,959
value-add because somebody has to kind

241
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,660
of organize and give meaning to

242
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,300
um kind of the random contributions or

243
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,880
not random but I think like it's helpful

244
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,680
in a

245
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,380
a field that's so new and then moves so

246
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,360
quickly in terms of research

247
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,600
developments and and everything else

248
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,000
yeah thanks just to give a little more

249
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,200
detail

250
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,500
the primary submitter on this grant was

251
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,600
the University of Washington Applied

252
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,040
Physics lab via co-pi Scott David at the

253
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,320
IRS iri as well as blue and I and

254
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,200
as blue mentioned it was really

255
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,860
fun to see who was ready for what who

256
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,380
wanted to throw a value into the arena

257
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,720
who wanted to put a comment on a Google

258
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,560
doc who is ready to

259
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,540
State their hourly

260
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,480
rate and scope of work and get involved

261
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,579
if there's pragmatic value of that kind

262
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:02,880
on the line who's ready to

263
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,459
work in the meanwhile and so it was just

264
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:09,779
many discussions and negotiations and as

265
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:14,279
we can smile and laugh at now a lot of

266
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,100
curveballs and things happening so it

267
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,500
was great times okay

268
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,200
moving on

269
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,079
just within the last weeks we have

270
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:30,300
submitted our form 1023 to the IRS

271
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,459
and so we soon expect and prefer

272
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,040
ourselves to be a 501c3 tax exempt

273
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,399
organization which means that donations

274
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,920
that people provide to us of which we

275
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,839
have received none so far

276
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,839
will be tax exempt

277
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,680
once that status and all Associated

278
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,459
infrastructure is ready we'll begin

279
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:55,500
philanthropic campaigning

280
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,480
with blue especially

281
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,300
we are working on policies and

282
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,120
procedures proactively so that we can

283
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,600
have comply ants ahead of time and just

284
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,600
stay right and relevant

285
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,720
it would be extremely helpful and much

286
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,540
appreciated if anybody was interested in

287
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,519
contributing their experience networks

288
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,620
or resources to what it could be for a

289
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,740
philanthropy or fundraising program at

290
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,640
the Institute we're open to how that

291
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,300
might develop and so if you see a high

292
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,339
leverage opportunity for what you know

293
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:39,779
or who you know or however then

294
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,420
some truly amazing things could happen

295
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,639
and if you know you know and if you know

296
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,720
then

297
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,920
help

298
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,139
anything you want to add on this

299
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,899
I do want to add that um it was really

300
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,480
interesting in developing like ecosystem

301
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,120
infrastructure in the pose Grant and in

302
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,980
the ecosystem paper it was really

303
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,740
interesting to see like what what it

304
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,560
takes to be a sustainable ecosystem like

305
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,200
to really evaluate that um at the level

306
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,079
of The Institute and the ecosystem and I

307
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,920
do think that uh I mean what makes uh

308
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,079
organization dissolve like people either

309
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,540
like you know it's like time and people

310
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,399
and money right it's like time and money

311
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,019
time and money as long as people have

312
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,339
time and people have money and and

313
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,279
interest levels so so we um have a great

314
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,200
like interest level as we'll talk about

315
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,120
I think in the coming few slides we'll

316
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,100
demonstrate that but but how do we get

317
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,920
people to keep having time to commit to

318
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,899
The Institute and the organization so I

319
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,360
think that one of the key things that we

320
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,120
need to do is fundraise so so like

321
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,060
philanthropy also but also grant writing

322
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,800
so these two

323
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,019
um things will be I think central to

324
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,079
keeping the Institute like being the

325
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,399
glue that keeps the Institute together

326
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,740
in the coming years so I just want to

327
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,480
just highlight that for anybody who

328
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,579
wants to come come be some glue come

329
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,740
provide some adhesion

330
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,320
um in the niche that'd be great yeah it

331
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,779
kind of goes without saying but it's

332
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,839
easy to skip everything that has

333
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,459
happened so far has been a purely

334
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:14,579
volunteer effort including this very

335
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:18,540
little little live stream and the last

336
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,959
few months have signaled and anticipated

337
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,540
and readied for

338
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,660
literally the first paid people to do

339
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,019
anything for the Institute which is a

340
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:35,279
big game changer and would scaffold our

341
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,200
time and so

342
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,920
that will be quite a transition point

343
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,660
let's continue

344
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,120
also at The Institute level we continue

345
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,540
with our volunteer program as always I

346
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,820
can do nothing but encourage and exhort

347
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,540
you to volunteer and get involved at The

348
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,920
Institute

349
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,199
being a volunteer supports your

350
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,880
engagement with projects and learning

351
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,180
groups whichever ones you're interested

352
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,699
it gives you repeatedly affordances

353
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:08,160
provided to get involved with active

354
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,860
inference and your contributions will

355
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,660
matter the questions you ask on a live

356
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,459
stream will be published by the active

357
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,380
inference Journal the questions that you

358
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,899
write in the textbook group Coda those

359
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,639
do become part of a shared knowledge

360
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,519
Niche code developments that you provide

361
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,959
something that makes it more accessible

362
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,160
or applicable those are huge in the

363
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,500
setting that we are and will be in so

364
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,959
please volunteer and encourage other

365
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,399
people who could be looking for

366
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,980
technical or philosophical education

367
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,560
Community mentorship all these different

368
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,620
things this is a great way and for those

369
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,420
who would like a little bit more

370
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,260
structured of an approach to getting

371
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,480
involved we continue to have the

372
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,699
internship program there's about 20

373
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,459
active interns from around the world who

374
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,920
are engaging with different research and

375
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,399
education affordances and we are up to

376
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,060
now five successfully completed

377
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,820
internships so to those who completed

378
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,920
it's been honor and an epic time

379
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,320
there's so much more I could say but

380
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,040
it's really exciting what interns come

381
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,220
in with because

382
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,639
we ourselves are from what we hear

383
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,740
people are excited to apply active

384
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,600
inference and to improve their own

385
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,760
education and understanding of what

386
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,740
active inference is and how they might

387
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,019
use it or grasp or handle it

388
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:41,220
and then to have this lightweight

389
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,800
internship program

390
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,480
that

391
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,060
makes a connection between the Institute

392
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,820
and the person gives a container and a

393
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,920
name and a timeline and an asynchronous

394
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,959
document for people's engagement whether

395
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,320
they're in a traditional

396
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,899
educational program like an

397
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:02,579
undergraduate student or a graduate

398
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:03,899
student

399
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,040
or probably the majority of which are

400
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,260
outside of a traditional educational

401
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,500
program and just lifelong Learners and

402
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,179
lifelong cool people and they just

403
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:19,799
come to

404
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,919
work and hone what they do so it

405
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:24,720
continues to be very inspiring and I

406
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,059
encourage people to

407
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,940
be interns and also for those who would

408
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,000
like to facilitate or mentor

409
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,240
we would like to start that discussion

410
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,559
about

411
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,799
how that might work

412
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,820
anything else you want to add

413
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,840
the active inference matchmaking service

414
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,780
there's so many funny ways to take that

415
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,480
but yeah what do you expect and prefer I

416
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,580
bet I meant like matching mentors and

417
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,960
interns and yeah that's it of course

418
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,559
um and then just a little summary update

419
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,020
across our difference

420
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,360
platforms and

421
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,799
public interfaces we see continued

422
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,940
growth and and activity just one

423
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,419
um plot this is our channel YouTube

424
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,820
channel growth Through Time

425
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,220
just kind of interesting

426
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,440
slow and steady wins the race but it's

427
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,620
also always good to see that first and

428
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,240
potentially second and third order

429
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,480
derivatives increasing

430
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,780
anything else you want to add

431
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,299
no I think like the YouTube channel has

432
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,580
really blown up like in the last quarter

433
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,380
and I think a lot of that um we just

434
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,240
have to shout out uh to the Chris Fields

435
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,679
course because the views are

436
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,440
astronomical in those videos it's like

437
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,660
really um it's really blowing up so

438
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,179
thanks Chris if you're watching and to

439
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:01,860
everybody who's viewing those videos and

440
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,419
taking those courses which the it's

441
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,100
truly awesome actually

442
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,320
yeah yeah we'll return to that but good

443
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,120
point and also um for people who are

444
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,919
interested in even social media

445
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,380
management video production podcast

446
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,660
editing Discord moderation and

447
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,660
governance meta governance there's a lot

448
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,900
of things that don't require some

449
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
technical

450
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,299
fluidity with the octave inference

451
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,460
kernel so there's a lot of ways that

452
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,440
people can help so don't don't let it

453
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,299
provide too much friction or freeze you

454
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:34,559
out if you feel like you want to be

455
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,600
involved but you wonder if you don't

456
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,820
know enough about some technical area or

457
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,400
philosophical framing it's totally not

458
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,520
required and there's a million ways that

459
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,900
we can work with wherever people are

460
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,299
um and actually that's like I was just

461
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:52,860
like that's like one of the key areas

462
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,299
that we've identified

463
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:57,720
um in our like ecosystem oversight it is

464
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,700
social media management so it's not it's

465
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,660
not

466
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,299
um you know all about the math like so

467
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,160
so many people come to us like I'm so

468
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,440
curious except I I can't do math

469
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,539
um and it's okay actually like can can

470
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,000
you do Twitter

471
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,200
uh because really there's a lot of

472
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,700
opportunities for involvement with the

473
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,740
Institute that aren't um math heavy

474
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,039
um before we head into the

475
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,320
organizational units here's the big

476
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,360
picture on which activities are

477
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,360
happening this website which you'll find

478
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,840
heartily linked from basically anywhere

479
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,940
you are

480
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,120
always summarizes the up-to-date

481
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,919
representation of what activities are

482
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,360
happening and what you can do to get

483
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,340
involved so I'll just go over this and

484
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,260
we'll talk about a few of these projects

485
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,059
in the coming slides

486
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:48,299
so in the space of publishing different

487
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:51,260
Medias we have the live stream project

488
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,360
where we organize and prepare for

489
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,940
different live streams following live

490
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,820
streams transcripts are created and

491
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,080
published through the active inference

492
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,200
Journal which through the work of Alex

493
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,980
Holly Dave others is always improving

494
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,620
and it's an exciting time for all of

495
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,940
these natural language processing

496
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,160
analyzes as well this is all being

497
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,039
pushed to the GitHub that allows you to

498
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,679
clone off the current state of the art

499
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,260
in all the transcripts translations

500
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,860
in the learning groups area we have the

501
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,080
part all textbook group cohorts four and

502
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,280
five continuing through the textbook

503
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,380
group fundamentals of active inference

504
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,500
sanjiv namjoshi's book in progress

505
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,080
and two courses which we'll come to

506
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,179
later physics is information processing

507
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,860
by Chris fields and constructing

508
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,020
cultural landscapes active inference for

509
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,960
the social sciences by avell at all

510
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,799
in the software space and activity we

511
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,020
continue on active block prints where we

512
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,240
work from both ends to make cognitive

513
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,460
modeling more accessible and applicable

514
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,039
we work from the technical capacity side

515
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,780
to develop the active block friends

516
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,080
project itself as a package utilizing

517
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,419
CAD CAD to apply active generative

518
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:09,419
models and we also work from the system

519
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,059
or domain of Interest side working with

520
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:13,860
people wherever they're at in their

521
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,679
analytical or programming abilities and

522
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,159
just starting to get the inklings of the

523
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,559
recipe for generative modeling together

524
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,980
Robotics and embodied JF continues to

525
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,280
develop his work with Plato robots and

526
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,260
societies of mind

527
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,360
active inference ontology

528
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,780
also continues maintaining and slightly

529
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,360
improving as well as

530
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,520
extending the act of inference ontology

531
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,039
and we have two weekly discussion

532
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,740
sessions one more on the educational

533
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,320
theme one more on the research theme but

534
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,240
ultimately they're both just how it goes

535
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,740
in the moment anything to add

536
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,600
all right in

537
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,539
eduactive our educational organizational

538
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:01,799
unit

539
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,020
one of the most exciting continued

540
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,360
activities is the active inference

541
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,620
textbook group

542
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,200
cohort 3 just within the last weeks

543
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,059
finished their Journey so congrats to

544
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,179
those who stuck it through cohort three

545
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:17,580
cohort 4 is now in chapter six recipe

546
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,679
for generative modeling continuing on

547
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,659
with the book and cohort five is

548
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:23,539
starting off there in chapter one

549
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:27,000
everyone's welcome to join

550
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,400
either or both of these cohorts which

551
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,039
are staggered so that

552
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,380
you can attend the same time zone and

553
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,480
get sampling across the book or you can

554
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,620
stay on one Trail at a time and switch

555
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,780
time zones everything's recorded

556
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,059
everything is collaborative in our

557
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,760
shared workspace it's always possible to

558
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,039
register and get involved all

559
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,740
backgrounds are totally welcomed

560
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,799
encouraged so if you've seen this

561
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,919
textbook and or you want to learn more

562
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:00,900
about what the only active inference

563
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,620
textbook in the play right now

564
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,120
says

565
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,640
and also connect a ton of dots and bring

566
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,200
in a ton of other resources and more

567
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,000
than the active inference textbook group

568
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,179
is a great place and you'll meet many

569
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,919
people who are also interested in

570
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:19,260
similar topics

571
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,960
anything else blue

572
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,340
it's fun

573
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,559
okay

574
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:28,980
um the course that began in May 2023 is

575
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,039
now about 5 6 completed that's physics

576
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,480
is information processing by Chris

577
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,340
Fields it's been

578
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,919
a journey and

579
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,679
can't wait for the fifth discussion

580
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,539
section which is tomorrow

581
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,240
and then the sixth lecture and

582
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,179
discussion and that will have

583
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:49,860
locked in

584
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,140
the completion of the first course at

585
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,880
The Institute

586
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,179
will be able to publish the proceedings

587
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:58,919
of the lectures and discussions as well

588
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,720
as the asynchronous question and answer

589
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,940
which Chris Fields is very graciously

590
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,559
answering

591
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,840
then we'll be able to explore

592
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,260
cohort or individual based learning

593
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,280
structures around this really first

594
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,039
principles and groundbreaking content

595
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,260
that Chris is sharing

596
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,879
wanna add anything on this one

597
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,580
just wow that's all

598
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,860
yeah

599
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,299
also in the courses space we continue on

600
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,100
with the constructing cultural

601
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,539
landscapes active inference for the

602
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:39,720
social sciences course with avell Ben

603
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,039
Mao Lorena and myself so Ben Mao myself

604
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:48,240
and Lorena have completed their sections

605
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,720
with a lecture and a discussion although

606
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,559
I guess Mao's discussion is coming up

607
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,279
we look forward to also the continued

608
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,260
activity in this course

609
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,020
as we remarked on in our

610
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,980
last quarterly Roundtable second one

611
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,840
this year

612
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,559
has and will see us go from zero courses

613
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,679
to two completed courses so both

614
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:20,340
the physics and the social sciences

615
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,020
which

616
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,480
under some understandings run the gamut

617
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,539
of multi-scale systems to have both of

618
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,520
those

619
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,679
at such high quality

620
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,220
volunteered and catalyzed by

621
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,220
real unique expertise

622
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,440
and also Broad and diverse participation

623
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,080
is incredible

624
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,900
anything you want to add blue

625
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,260
just that as we are starting to have

626
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,659
courses hosted by The Institute and

627
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,600
completed anybody interested in having a

628
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,600
course hosted by us should reach out and

629
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,000
anyone familiar with or interested in

630
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,340
accreditation is also something like

631
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,179
we've been thinking about how do you um

632
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,400
you know what what would certification

633
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,440
in active inference look like what are

634
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,440
the key like build up skills and how

635
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,000
could we develop a program to say

636
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,039
someone is certified in active inference

637
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,120
it's something that we've been thinking

638
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,340
about at the Institute scale so if you

639
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,900
have ideas we would love to hear about

640
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,860
them

641
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,840
um and if you have experience uh we

642
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,080
would love to get your input yeah

643
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,900
it's not covered in this round table but

644
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,400
the qualification certification

645
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,820
something that we're thinking about and

646
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,880
um the pedagogy and developing and

647
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,980
hosting courses these are all things

648
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,320
that we will work on

649
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,100
in the education space of live streams

650
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,559
we continue to have

651
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:58,320
exciting and unique live streams here's

652
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,799
just kind of a slice of Life here's the

653
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,840
upcoming live streams for the coming 30

654
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,840
days we have the round table that we're

655
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,200
in right now strangely looping

656
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,720
we have Chris fields's discussion

657
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,980
tomorrow

658
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,640
we have social sciences discussion next

659
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,720
week

660
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,600
lecture six and discussion six for

661
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,919
physics

662
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:24,600
active inference for the social sciences

663
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,039
avelle's

664
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,740
lecture and discussion and

665
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,299
a guest stream

666
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,760
on conviction narrative Theory

667
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,900
and

668
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,179
a new live stream paper-based series

669
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:39,000
kicking off on message passing so it's

670
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,840
kind of like a flavor of sometimes the

671
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,120
work to prepare for this live stream is

672
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,980
just to coordinate with a guest

673
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,960
and it doesn't require any kind of

674
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,220
expertise in their topic actually

675
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,419
just a curiosity in it other times we

676
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:58,980
are

677
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,500
operationally or logistically supporting

678
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,380
the course teachers and also just

679
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,840
showing up and then there's also work

680
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,440
like the dot zero preparation where for

681
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,419
weeks to months ahead of the live stream

682
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,620
we're studying through a paper

683
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,140
and leveraging the

684
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,059
questions that we have

685
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,380
by

686
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,620
asking early and asking often and

687
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,899
precisely or at least

688
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,520
legibly

689
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,620
that enables the questions that are

690
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,020
asked before the live stream by the dot

691
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,980
zero preparers to then actually realize

692
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,159
the addressing of those questions

693
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,899
instead of a thousand scattered

694
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:44,820
notebooks after the fact or there being

695
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,039
no fact in just a thousand scattered

696
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,919
notebooks the dot zero I'm very

697
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,399
passionate about because it is

698
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:58,679
a way to do the homework early and by

699
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,500
doing so change how things actually

700
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,940
happen

701
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,059
so if you're interested in

702
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:07,380
having

703
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,440
any kind of impact or learning with the

704
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,480
live stream organizing and preparation

705
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,779
process whether you have this or that

706
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:18,000
familiarity with the video and the media

707
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,059
and the communication side or with any

708
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:23,820
topics in and of themselves

709
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,960
it's super fun to invite people and have

710
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,059
Broad

711
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:32,600
invitations curations

712
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,640
and facilitations there's a lot of

713
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,679
exciting things that people can get

714
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,440
involved with so please do and other

715
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,419
than that it's been a true highlight of

716
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:46,080
the quarter and the year to have

717
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,340
all these live streams

718
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,320
and as mentioned earlier following each

719
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,580
live stream we go on to publish the

720
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,980
proceedings

721
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,799
and publish them on GitHub where they're

722
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:04,740
all versions and collaboratively edited

723
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,100
and also publish them to zenodo to get

724
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,658
the DOI and the URL

725
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,080
briefly from reinference

726
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,539
we continue work on the active inference

727
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:21,059
ontology octoblock friends

728
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:23,940
Robotics and embodied and we have

729
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,140
several of the Institute seed projects

730
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,000
related to graphical interfaces for

731
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,220
active inference and cognitive agent

732
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,539
modeling

733
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,399
and then there's the plethora of

734
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:38,580
individual projects that people are

735
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,679
working on on their own

736
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,600
anything you want to add on any of those

737
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,100
projects

738
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,980
no thank you okay

739
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,140
well

740
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,260
as we head into the last months of our

741
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,720
activity in 2020-23

742
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,200
and plan to have a quiet December

743
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,380
so really only two more months of

744
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,299
activity this year

745
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:05,159
and then we'll be in next year

746
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:06,299
so

747
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:10,140
as usual while scrambling to prepare for

748
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,960
the presentation and trying to convey

749
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,080
what we could and should

750
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,020
um I developed this small meme

751
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,220
so

752
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,340
here on the bottom is the timeline quote

753
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,840
timeline

754
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,200
we're here in September 2020 23.

755
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,520
soon it will be classical New Years and

756
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,000
will be in 2000 2024. so here's us

757
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,179
thinking wow

758
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:41,340
2020-24 should be really exciting

759
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,220
but also we remember feeling that way in

760
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,779
2022

761
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:48,960
and feeling that way in 2021

762
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,399
but this entire concept is a nested

763
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:56,178
thought from the future

764
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,899
what do you think about that blue or

765
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:00,899
what are you excited about in the

766
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:04,100
past present or future

767
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,899
I mean like we're not we don't we don't

768
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:12,240
get don't get a treasure map right so

769
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,399
like that's not something that comes

770
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,700
with The Institute um so it's always I

771
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,320
think exciting to think about what the

772
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,860
future holds and looking back like how

773
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,960
we've come so far and like the leaps and

774
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,519
what has been like you know what has

775
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,159
caused exponential growth and all those

776
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:30,539
things I mean it's always just exciting

777
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:31,799
right

778
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:35,820
um so some future thoughts uh maybe

779
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,399
we'll be thinking about you know how we

780
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,500
did make those big transitions every

781
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,120
year and we kept making them and kept

782
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,320
making them and kept making them

783
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,360
yeah

784
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,460
one more specific

785
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,720
call to action other than the earlier

786
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,960
Communications to actual or plausible

787
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,899
participants volunteers interns we'd

788
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:07,559
like to really make a special call for

789
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,300
those who are interested in joining the

790
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,399
scientific Advisory board or

791
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:14,580
recommending or introducing somebody who

792
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,540
you think

793
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,918
could be helpful on the Sab

794
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:23,040
is an informal body we have office hours

795
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,780
with them and shared documents with them

796
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,599
it's very opt-in and flexible

797
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,080
other Sab members like Chris Fields went

798
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,879
on to

799
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,359
do the course and just recently Sarah

800
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:38,760
Hamburg started facilitating the morph

801
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,000
stream Series so it's a way to get more

802
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,580
involved and have a even more structured

803
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,440
contribution or differently structured

804
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,760
contribution

805
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,599
and it would be amazing to have the Sab

806
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,720
participants as Liaisons and advocates

807
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,040
and co-learners and co-creators

808
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,920
in the coming year because we select the

809
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,680
Sab on a yearly time scale

810
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,140
it would be great it's always open to

811
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,700
apply

812
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,280
however again in the coming several

813
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,160
weeks if we could

814
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,140
reach out to people

815
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,839
who

816
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,700
might have a

817
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,520
positive synergistic relationship with

818
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,560
being on the Sab

819
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,780
it would be very special and appreciated

820
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,200
for us

821
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,460
well

822
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,619
that's it for this short

823
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:41,880
round table so let's just

824
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,839
give any thoughts meanwhile I will

825
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,540
wait for anyone in the live chat who

826
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,700
might have questions if they write them

827
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,320
in the next

828
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,720
few minutes then we can address them or

829
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,020
just talk about them but other than that

830
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,119
what's on your mind blue or what are you

831
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:03,079
excited for

832
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,599
foreign

833
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:09,180
I don't know I'm excited for what's

834
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,060
going to come up in 2024 I think will be

835
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,680
a big year for us

836
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,599
um I'm excited to see if we get funded

837
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,040
or don't get funded but I think

838
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,660
regardless we've learned a lot about

839
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,359
where we are and where we're going we've

840
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,700
gained a lot of certainty about our

841
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,619
existence in the niche and about our

842
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:29,040
Niche also which is great like at any

843
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,839
time that you reduce uncertainty you're

844
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:33,420
able to I think you know help validate

845
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,359
or solidify Your Existence

846
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:40,800
um as as a organization or a human or or

847
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,940
whatever

848
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,579
um in the active inference way so I'm

849
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,740
excited to kind of see how that plays

850
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:51,000
out in our future uh unfolding

851
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,500
what about you

852
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,040
yeah that that reminds me of the

853
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,280
bookstream series that you facilitated

854
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,780
with Tyler and on bishan khesari's work

855
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,520
about

856
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,140
kind of

857
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,260
using active inference to highlight the

858
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,359
organizational generative model nested

859
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,040
generative models

860
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,160
and rather than talking about

861
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,220
uncertainty being out there in terms of

862
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,700
the

863
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,160
aspects that are not known about what's

864
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,359
out there

865
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,740
it's kind of like a glass half full

866
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,140
glass half an empty starting with the

867
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,820
certain uncertainties of the generative

868
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,640
model as enacted through

869
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,960
policy selection and so

870
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,800
even from the very most informal

871
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,720
Beginnings like the strange Loop and the

872
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,280
excitement was around applying active

873
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,160
inference to and by and with and for

874
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,020
active inference

875
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,300
in the multi-scale setting

876
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,099
and through the bookstream but also

877
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:00,839
through a million other

878
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,820
vectors

879
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,800
2023 has

880
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,140
come through

881
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,359
hugely on that

882
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,240
and yet it remains uh fledgling

883
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,400
and

884
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,280
Mason's volunteer work

885
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,520
as well so it's epic

886
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,579
um do you have any last thoughts or

887
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:29,599
we can conclude

888
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,200
we can conclude I think all right

889
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,900
thank you blue thank you everyone

890
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,000
hope this was a useful Roundtable and

891
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,140
see you next time

892
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,960
okay

893
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,440
okay nice all right

894
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,540
we will see you later maybe tomorrow

895
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,119
maybe if I can make it I'm gonna try

896
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,320
to

897
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,240
the discussion to the yeah to the

898
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,660
discussion oh
