1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,960
hello

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,679
everyone welcome back to the active

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,799
inference lab

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,040
welcome to our second semester today

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,359
it's august 3rd

6
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:19,760
2021 so it's two

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,880
cubed i guess nice date stephen please

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,320
don't double or mute um

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,160
welcome everyone we're really happy that

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,320
you're joining us today

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,000
in the active inference lab we're a

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,079
participatory online lab that is

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:34,880
communicating

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,120
learning and practicing applied active

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,079
inference

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,000
you can find us at the links that are

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,160
here on this page

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,000
this is recorded in an archived live

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,600
stream so please provide us with

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,440
feedback so that we can be improving on

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,719
our work

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,399
all backgrounds and perspectives are

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,640
welcome here and we'll be following

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,559
video etiquette for live streams with

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,680
muting if there's noise in the

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,640
background and

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,000
raising our hand when we're ready to

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,760
speak

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,719
today in our third quarterly round table

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,760
we're going to

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,720
go over the goals and provide sort of an

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,799
overview on the lab itself

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,680
then we're going to go into updates for

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,560
each of the three

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,479
organizational units of the lab which

36
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,320
are the dot edu

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,080
dot coms and dot tools and uh

38
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,000
give some updates as well as talk about

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,680
how people can get involved with each of

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,560
those

41
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,920
sections of the lab so we'll start with

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,400
our

43
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,880
goals maybe while i do some little tweak

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,840
on the stream

45
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,920
alex do you want to go ahead on this

46
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,840
website slide

47
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,640
uh no please go ahead oh sure well this

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,880
is our website

49
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,079
activeinference.org and if you go there

50
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,119
now you'll see it

51
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,040
looking much like this as well as

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,280
providing a lot more information

53
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,840
as far as links to follow us on and

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,640
forms you can

55
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,240
fill out but the goal of active

56
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,320
inference lab is to produce cutting edge

57
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,600
research and enable

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
real-world applications of active

59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,119
inference so that's our

60
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,679
inference side and our action side we're

61
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,360
learning by doing and we're doing it

62
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,760
about

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,840
active inference so if you want to read

64
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,599
more information about that

65
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,800
check out the website to provide

66
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,080
kind of a architectural overlay for the

67
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,680
active inference lab

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,879
this figure shows oh let me

69
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,080
uh yeah this figure shows how the

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,920
different organizational units that are

71
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,440
internal to our lab

72
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,000
are related to the interfaces and to

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,280
external communities so

74
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,200
i'll give an overview and then anyone

75
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,720
can raise their hand and

76
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,120
give a thought on it the three

77
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,480
organizational units

78
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,000
within the lab that we're going to be

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,920
talking more about today are

80
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,920
dot edu dot tools and dot coms

81
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,040
and that's our internal states then

82
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,920
at the interfaces that's where we have

83
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,599
interactions with

84
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,800
external entities so for example this

85
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,360
live stream is a production of dot-coms

86
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,040
it's right on the interface between the

87
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,720
internal and the external states of our

88
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,599
lab

89
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,760
and it interfaces out with broader

90
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,640
communities

91
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,720
so those are people who are learning

92
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,560
active inference or curious about

93
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,400
applying active inference or just what

94
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,519
it is

95
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,560
as well as all kinds of communities that

96
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,000
may or may not realize that they're

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,239
adjacent to active inference

98
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,319
dot coms also reaches out to other

99
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,519
groups and

100
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,440
explores how active inference might play

101
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
a role in their work

102
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,799
and in edu the production on the

103
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,519
interface

104
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,519
is really the maintenance of the body of

105
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,280
knowledge which again we'll be

106
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,720
talking more about soon but we

107
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,560
take a sort of systems engineering

108
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,959
approach to diagramming our own

109
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,840
activities and also to working

110
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,680
internally and externally

111
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,400
any thoughts on that

112
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,080
yeah scott yeah i think the the value

113
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,360
of structuring the uh research

114
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,959
enterprise and the interaction

115
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:09,599
enterprise

116
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,560
in a way that reflects the content is

117
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,360
absolutely superb that's something that

118
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,399
um living the

119
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,238
and breathing the active inference i

120
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,759
think is really

121
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,440
going to be instrumental as the i guess

122
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,759
i'll call it the movement grows there's

123
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,680
a lot of desire for deep risking out

124
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,440
there and there's a lot of appeal

125
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,639
in different areas banking food system

126
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,240
security a lot of areas were

127
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
starting to introduce the concept and

128
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,919
having us

129
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,880
organize the lab in that way um really

130
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,000
walking the walk

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,560
i think is is really terrific and speaks

132
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,280
to the

133
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,560
um flexibility and strength of the

134
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,400
framing in a bunch of two different

135
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,160
organizational constructs so i think

136
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,280
that's something that's

137
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,919
from the start was very wise for the org

138
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,039
for you guys to do as an organization

139
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,720
nice thanks it's almost like if you

140
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,160
understand this org

141
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,639
chart or this layout then you're you're

142
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,440
half the way

143
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,880
there you understand there's internal

144
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,880
and external states and that they

145
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,759
interface

146
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,960
together so any other comments or we can

147
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,320
continue on

148
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,160
to the updates yes stephen

149
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,919
well i suppose the only challenge you

150
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,000
the the perennial challenge

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,960
is what's internal what's external

152
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,240
where's the boundary

153
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,759
um and i think that that's

154
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,120
proving to be an evolving conversation

155
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,680
um i think that i think that's never

156
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,960
answered in a way

157
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,000
in a in a complete sense but um

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,440
you know is it is is it going to be more

159
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,960
like there's multiple ways of thinking

160
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,039
about that if you're doing statistics

161
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,520
if you're doing some teleological

162
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,960
morphogenesis

163
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,800
type approach if you're doing some sort

164
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,080
of

165
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,600
top-down kind of using self-reported

166
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,240
data

167
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,840
and you're making a whole load of

168
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,639
assumptions so i think that's quite

169
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,880
quite quite useful and one thing that

170
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,240
came up and i'm not sure which paper it

171
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,120
was but

172
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,120
i saw um carl first and i think he

173
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,240
mentioned the idea of

174
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,400
something called an approximation

175
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,440
science

176
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,600
which i hadn't heard before but there's

177
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,240
almost a science of making

178
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,280
approximations seem to come into play

179
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,160
here

180
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,240
um i haven't delved into that but that

181
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,680
seems to also

182
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,280
maybe tie into that question

183
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,160
cool indeed another yeah yeah go ahead

184
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,639
scott

185
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,000
i just had another comment on stephen's

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,919
comment you know that idea the boundary

187
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,759
is really interesting because

188
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,199
now because the lab uses the structure

189
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,919
we'll be able to identify those parts of

190
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,520
the lab function that are

191
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,080
generative and the ways in which they're

192
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,199
generative

193
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,360
and so that notion stephen about the

194
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,680
boundary and where that resides gets

195
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
really interesting then

196
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,759
because the entire framing generates

197
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,880
awareness and so the boundary

198
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,599
in a way it almost is less important not

199
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,960
not that the question's not

200
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
the question super interesting but the

201
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,280
actual location of a boundary

202
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,800
is almost less important than the

203
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,560
processes that occur

204
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,599
around a given arbitrary boundary within

205
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,800
because system is going to have multiple

206
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,360
boundaries

207
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,880
and so it's a fascinating question of

208
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,160
the where the round a boundary resides

209
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,639
kind of within a complex of boundaries

210
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,759
all of which are

211
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,039
engaged in active inference

212
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,800
simultaneously in the system

213
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,960
because it's one of the things i'm

214
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,400
understanding

215
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,960
is there's no mono dimensional system

216
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,120
that's beyond a theoretical system your

217
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,440
their systems are running all sorts of

218
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,080
active inference calculations

219
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,919
simultaneously of different weightings

220
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:48,879
etc

221
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,280
and so the boundary starts to become

222
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,360
like drawing a circle with tangents in a

223
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,039
way drawing a boundary

224
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,960
with tangential active inference

225
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,440
uh dynamics in a way and and you have

226
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,160
multiple

227
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,440
active interfaces going to it so that

228
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,800
was a fascinating the question you just

229
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,560
asked got me thinking about that

230
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,960
um that could boundary construction in a

231
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,560
different way and very dynamic

232
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,240
boundaries that would occur

233
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,599
thanks nice and uh yep many ways of

234
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,840
going about active inference as we'll be

235
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,960
discovering

236
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,280
and we arbitrage that against the

237
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,599
clarity of what active inference lab is

238
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,919
itself like each of these units are

239
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:26,639
their own

240
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,039
informational blanket there's a drive

241
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,560
folder there's a weekly meeting

242
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,039
so we're sure about that those are not

243
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,479
the ambiguous boundaries but that's

244
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,159
actually how we go about investigating

245
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,760
the real world and the systems that do

246
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,399
have uncertainty that's fundamental

247
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,880
let's go on to the updates so the first

248
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,120
update which happened right at the end

249
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,399
of last semester was that actin flab

250
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,480
has a new steady state as a non-profit

251
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,440
organization

252
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,600
registered in california united states

253
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,880
of america

254
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,560
and this was part of our labs strategy

255
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,839
and medium-term plan right from the

256
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,680
beginning

257
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,720
any thoughts on this alex or we'll have

258
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,000
more to say on this in just a few

259
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,399
slides

260
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,399
um about this

261
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,680
action and these new states important

262
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,839
thing

263
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,320
important thing to think about is the

264
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,000
new affordances

265
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,040
and again we can consider it in a notion

266
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
of active inference

267
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,720
what possible opportunities we can get

268
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,160
and you use for

269
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,200
strategy realization some new

270
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,279
contacts and i think we have some

271
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,320
uh information in slides about on some

272
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,440
next slide about

273
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,560
what possible opportunities are

274
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,920
yes one of the

275
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,120
cornerstones and motivators of

276
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,680
our project and lab as well as the

277
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,760
registration as a non-profit especially

278
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,200
is this concept of research debt

279
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,839
and alex how about you maybe summarize

280
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,320
what

281
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:18,020
research debt means in this context

282
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,839
[Music]

283
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,640
in general the notion of research depth

284
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,360
uh

285
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,560
is about some needed

286
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,519
uh and special actions what need to be

287
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,120
done

288
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,760
for some new state-of-the-art research

289
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,240
uh because people who are doing uh

290
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,360
really

291
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,800
great research in their fields spending

292
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,160
very time to get to wet frontiers but

293
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,360
after that to force

294
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,279
such fresh knowledge to be accessible to

295
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,279
provide the audiences in different

296
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,399
domains

297
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,600
some additional works need to be

298
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,320
arranged and execute and there are some

299
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,279
practices what we understand uh what

300
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,399
need

301
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,600
to play their role and make

302
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,200
methodological work methodical work

303
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,079
and our work with some of our

304
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,440
disciplines

305
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,040
to make this knowledge accessible for

306
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,079
anyone with any level of expertise in

307
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,000
the field

308
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,040
yes it's a technical topic that we're

309
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,600
studying

310
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,160
and so there's a lot of work that goes

311
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,720
into

312
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,120
getting a working understanding and so

313
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,880
how are we going to scale that

314
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,360
and make that accessible stephen

315
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,240
yeah i think one other aspect is trust

316
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,800
you know

317
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,959
there's um they say in community

318
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,399
development you you can

319
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,399
well this one approach i really like is

320
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,200
that you move at the speed of trust

321
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,920
i think that's quite a nice thing and a

322
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,720
non-profit

323
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,519
shows a sort of commitment to values

324
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,000
which

325
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,240
you know implicitly is kind of there in

326
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,240
an academic organization

327
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,360
but the thing with academic

328
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,560
organizations there's certain

329
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,600
limitations

330
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,040
in that scope where a non-profit space

331
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,880
does offer a sort of a more pluralistic

332
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,639
flexible space as well

333
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,720
but again making sure that you can

334
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,399
establish that trust

335
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,480
in the values which i think the

336
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,399
commercial sector

337
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,680
um even with people like google who

338
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,160
said a lot about the values early on

339
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,720
then

340
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,360
it starts to you know so i think that is

341
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,000
an important

342
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,560
feature that you know is is part of this

343
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
process

344
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,680
cool thank you

345
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,160
how does the non-profit registration

346
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,480
update the phenotype of our lab

347
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,959
well again using active inference as a

348
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,560
framework for understanding this

349
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,639
we can break it down in terms of the

350
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,720
affordances that were provided

351
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,360
as well as the new niches which can be

352
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,480
physical

353
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,720
economic informational the new niches

354
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,560
that we're able to access

355
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,639
so we're better able to scaffold our

356
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,480
long-term partnerships

357
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,720
we're able to engage in new kinds of

358
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,839
interactions

359
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,160
like collaboration with other legally

360
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,680
recognized entities

361
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,720
or support of various kinds will be able

362
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,120
to

363
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,399
apply to new grant programs

364
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,760
as lead or as support will also be able

365
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,320
to

366
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,760
potentially support lab employees in

367
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
a sort of annualized way or in a

368
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,360
project-based way

369
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,519
and it will overall just help us serve

370
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,880
through deep time as we

371
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,399
provide improved onboarding and

372
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,399
accessibility efforts

373
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,600
so anyone who's interested in

374
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,720
this set of fields or any other field

375
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,320
that they think is going to be relevant

376
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,040
here

377
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,880
anything related to non-profit

378
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,160
management or

379
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,839
lab management research program

380
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,560
management making grant applications

381
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,399
some of the more classical areas of

382
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,240
interest for non-profits

383
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,720
that are research and technological as

384
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,440
well as

385
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,199
some of the more novel or online

386
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,959
characteristics that are important like

387
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,399
crypto economics

388
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,440
nfts uh crowdfunding token engineering

389
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
graphic design website development tool

390
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,279
development we'll talk more about some

391
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,160
of these things

392
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,440
later and a special note

393
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,839
for this second semester and then anyone

394
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,680
can provide a thought

395
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,800
is uh we're planning a lab advisory

396
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,920
board

397
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,160
we're planning to arrange this lab

398
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,199
advisory board

399
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,440
to start operations during this second

400
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,480
semester so

401
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,560
the rest of 2021 and we welcome

402
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,079
the suggestion or invitation to

403
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,399
individuals with high expertise in their

404
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,360
domain

405
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,040
people who would like to be part of our

406
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,120
advisory board

407
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,360
and some of the following areas of the

408
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,800
lab activities will be

409
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,959
supervised and catalyzed by the board

410
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,079
especially

411
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,600
legal education governance methodology

412
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,399
research strategy application slash

413
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,360
innovation

414
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,800
and really anything else so this again

415
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,680
helps us anchor out by connecting with

416
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,320
external

417
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,560
stakeholders and providing people who

418
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,160
maybe they're not going to come to the

419
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,839
dot edu meeting every week

420
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,880
but maybe once a quarter the uh the

421
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,920
planets align

422
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,440
and we're able to interface with this

423
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,040
person and so that can be hopefully

424
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,680
a win-win interaction so if you're

425
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,959
listening and

426
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,320
you think this is you or you know

427
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,720
somebody who would be cool to invite

428
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,920
onto the board just

429
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,959
let us know about that any thoughts on

430
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,079
this or we'll continue on to the

431
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,120
organizational units yep scott

432
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,360
so two thoughts just on the exempt

433
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,160
organization

434
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,560
uh status it's great congratulations on

435
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,199
that

436
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,360
one is that the advisory board can also

437
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,880
be a source of funding

438
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,639
and other resources and network

439
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,240
obviously and so constructing an

440
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,600
advisory board and looking for those

441
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,560
folks

442
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,040
i think that my impression is again from

443
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,399
the conversation i'm having with finance

444
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,079
folks etc is that there's going to be a

445
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,440
lot of interest

446
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,120
uh people are looking at the framing and

447
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,560
i think getting quite excited about it

448
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,639
so there may be a lot of

449
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,839
action there and you can have different

450
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,759
advisory boards multiple

451
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,600
boards as just as a structural matter

452
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,839
just with different functions etc

453
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,600
and you can also one of the things to

454
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,560
think about in the beginning is

455
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,000
sometimes having the advisory board

456
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,680
be a two-year stint or a three-year

457
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,000
stint or something so you can naturally

458
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,839
roll people off if people kind of linger

459
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,720
too long

460
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,639
or if you want to freshen it up so kind

461
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,320
of establishing that at the beginning

462
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,560
is something to think about keep it

463
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,240
fresh um

464
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,440
one other thing if the um if your

465
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,160
exempt organization purpose is includes

466
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,600
educational

467
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,199
then there i recall that there's

468
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,279
authority out there in private letter

469
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,600
rulings where educational institutions

470
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,959
were permitted to engage in standard

471
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,320
setting

472
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,920
which gets really interesting one of the

473
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
things i've told people involved in

474
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,120
education

475
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,839
i just spent time with some k-12 folks

476
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,040
last week

477
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,959
is that when there are standards out

478
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,799
there in the world education is about

479
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,319
teaching the standards so if i go to

480
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,919
learn french or chemistry i learn the

481
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,439
standards of french and chemistry in

482
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,319
school

483
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,760
where there are no standards then the

484
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,720
standard setting is done by curriculum

485
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,400
and so one of the things this teaching

486
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,760
that you're doing here is

487
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,280
also standard setting because you're

488
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,959
teaching framings

489
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,839
where in spaces where there may be none

490
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,840
and so it's something to think about

491
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,080
that the function of this lab may be

492
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,200
both educational

493
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,520
and standard setting and just to be

494
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,559
aware

495
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,760
that a lot of the outputs may feed into

496
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,120
standards efforts

497
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,960
as these there could be standards of

498
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,320
business operations

499
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,840
law technology and society that can come

500
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,200
out of this work

501
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,120
and so that's something to be aware of

502
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,640
and to

503
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,720
be intentional about if we start to go

504
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,039
in that route and making sure that

505
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,720
the deliverables that are intended to be

506
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,320
standards have the maturity

507
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,280
and the um exposure so that they can

508
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,799
have a chance as standards it's

509
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,160
something there's a real

510
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,480
opportunity in these new spaces these

511
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,000
new framings to pursue that

512
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
as well and under your auspices of your

513
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,840
501 exemption

514
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,439
thanks scott very nice stephen

515
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,200
yeah just further into the the

516
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,320
the finding standards and also

517
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,200
looking for processes where you've got

518
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,480
developmental

519
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,799
aspects and that's so this might be

520
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,919
where there's a kind of a couple of

521
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,760
streams going on because

522
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,919
um in a similar way to a lot of

523
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,080
non-profits that work in highly

524
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,360
innovative developmental spaces

525
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,120
you've got elements of that here

526
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,799
unusually for

527
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,000
um because it's not just the material

528
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,960
within a very standard framing the

529
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,240
vehicles

530
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,120
being developed um at the same time so

531
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,919
developmental evaluative approaches

532
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,160
principles focused evaluative approaches

533
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,520
could be

534
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,360
um which are actually very new in the

535
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,200
non-profit world which have taken

536
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,039
that have grown massively might really

537
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,880
be good for certain aspects but there

538
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,559
may be other aspects which start to get

539
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,679
locked down

540
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,880
in more ready already established

541
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,679
processes

542
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,840
and so that could be really really

543
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,320
useful

544
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,960
and we'll come back to this idea of

545
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,000
standards

546
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,799
in the next section which is the dot edu

547
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,720
so it's our first organizational

548
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,760
unit because learning is really

549
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,200
at the heart of the actin flab

550
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,760
in edu the goal is to create a

551
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,000
participatory and dynamic active

552
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,880
inference body

553
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,520
of knowledge and this is really drawing

554
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,160
on

555
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
alex and yvonne's experience with the

556
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,520
systems engineering

557
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,320
body of knowledge which isn't just a

558
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,080
reference book it's not just a wiki it's

559
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,919
not just the certifications not just the

560
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,520
standardization it's actually

561
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,840
this way of thinking about how these

562
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,120
pieces interact

563
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,880
and support everything from career

564
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,400
development to

565
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,919
people who are just curious to

566
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,600
conferences all these different

567
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,679
moving parts that play a role in that

568
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,679
living body of knowledge

569
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,039
so we'll provide an update here on the

570
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:17,520
main

571
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,559
efforts of edu which are

572
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,880
the ontology project with a working

573
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,559
group as well as a

574
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,520
uh an ontology in progress document and

575
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,039
then we'll talk a little bit about the

576
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:29,520
next

577
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,559
steps but any overall thoughts alex on

578
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,679
what body of knowledge means or how edu

579
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,480
helps us get there

580
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,480
i also want to highlight that a lot

581
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,760
educational activities in

582
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,960
priority and we understand that only

583
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,640
doing some projects with some new people

584
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,640
in the field

585
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,000
could lead us uh to have broad community

586
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,280
people who can work

587
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,039
in a project with active inference

588
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,440
that's why we are trying to approach

589
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,520
this

590
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,880
very fundamentally and go in through his

591
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,240
hard way

592
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,640
through methodological ontological works

593
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,280
and

594
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,720
always wet hard stuff

595
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,000
yep totally agreed so here's

596
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,039
uh yeah steven go ahead

597
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,200
yeah one part that i think is really

598
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,480
valuable with the

599
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,880
the body of knowledge is this idea of

600
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,320
the system of interest

601
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,679
which i know alex is you know they've

602
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,760
got a really

603
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,200
well-defined and evolving approach of

604
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,600
using systems of interest

605
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,400
and how that interfaces or with this

606
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,440
active inference

607
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,960
approach to a bounded

608
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,320
system or object and i think that has

609
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,960
proved to be sort of a consistency which

610
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,679
can bring things into the real world

611
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,440
in these participatory ways beyond say

612
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,480
purely

613
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,760
modeling in a more academic context so

614
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,039
i think that's been consistent and is

615
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,240
is a certain rigor that opens a lot of

616
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
good questions but i i'm really excited

617
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,640
by that

618
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,440
here's a figure that we've seen several

619
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,640
times it's a

620
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,919
spectrum that is describing

621
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,000
a uh sort of from the least formalized

622
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,120
forms of ontology on the left side to

623
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,720
the most formalized

624
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,880
forms the most expressive informal forms

625
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,360
of ontology on the right side

626
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,720
and knowing that ontology which is

627
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,880
how the world is studying the world and

628
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,039
how we frame it

629
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,400
for active inference we knew that was

630
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,720
gonna be a challenge but really the hill

631
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
that we had to climb

632
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,559
and we started in the first quarter of

633
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,679
2021

634
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,080
right when our lab begun with compiling

635
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,760
just a terms list

636
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,159
just what terms were relevant what were

637
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,200
we seeing come up

638
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,880
what were terms that people were

639
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,320
thinking were relevant for understanding

640
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,600
papers

641
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,000
and we're going to be working our way

642
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,320
towards the right side of this continuum

643
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,960
by introducing increasing levels of

644
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,520
annotation and formalization

645
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,919
right now what we're working on is

646
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:26,640
updating

647
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,200
our terms lists which we'll show in the

648
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,240
next slide

649
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,120
as well as introducing references and

650
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,240
definitions

651
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,600
so first just where have other people

652
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,559
defined a term in text and then

653
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,000
eventually we'll move towards creating

654
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
our own synthetic definitions

655
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,600
and then also introducing translations

656
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,360
and translations into natural human

657
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,880
languages as well as

658
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,320
translations eventually into

659
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,520
sulo sumo suo kif

660
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,880
which is if people want to check that

661
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,960
out that's really what the ontology

662
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,000
working group

663
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,799
is doing they're this train scooting to

664
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,600
the right

665
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,279
day by day uh trying to understand

666
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,799
this best-in-class way of working with

667
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,120
ontologies that adam peace and others

668
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,200
have developed and so we're working

669
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,120
through the textbook the ontology

670
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,360
textbook which everybody's welcome to

671
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,720
learn by doing as we work through this

672
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,679
textbook

673
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,240
and figure out what sumo is and we'll

674
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,960
use that

675
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,440
to start to develop computational ways

676
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,720
of thinking about the terms

677
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,120
that are relevant and along the way

678
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,760
we're going to be

679
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,840
structuring and providing all kinds of

680
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,960
interesting

681
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,440
ways of augmenting those lists and just

682
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,400
to

683
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,480
show what it looks like and then anyone

684
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,520
can

685
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,279
provide a comment and especially dave

686
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,960
who's done a ton of awesome work on

687
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,080
these

688
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,880
uh tabs in our working ontology document

689
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,360
which we'll

690
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,600
share with anyone who wants to see it

691
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,279
there's a few tabs there's

692
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,840
the core terms which are split into a

693
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,520
definitions and references

694
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,640
tab where we get up to five references

695
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,159
so published papers

696
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,840
that say you know term x is this

697
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,919
and just quote them what was it

698
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,440
described as in the text which

699
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,360
isn't always the clearest or isn't

700
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,720
always the most consistent across

701
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,320
definitions but that's the point we need

702
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,600
to know that

703
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,840
and then the second tab we have

704
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,880
translations

705
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,120
and at this point we have russian

706
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,000
portuguese

707
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,960
spanish french and italian are mostly or

708
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,000
completely

709
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,279
done but if you speak any other

710
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,520
language it'd be awesome to have your

711
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,120
translation effort

712
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,279
then we have a terms supplement where we

713
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,320
have kind of a

714
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,840
bunch of other terms that we think might

715
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,840
be relevant or might get upgraded to a

716
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,840
core term later or just are good to keep

717
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,960
on hand in

718
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,880
this broad dictionary that we're

719
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,000
building out

720
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,400
as well as in equations tab which dave

721
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,200
did some nice

722
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,679
copying over of equations because even

723
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,840
the equations the formalisms have have

724
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,039
somewhat evolved

725
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,720
or a letter will mean something in one

726
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,320
field but then it means something

727
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,400
different in another field or in a later

728
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,120
paper so we need these kinds of formal

729
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,799
ontologies because otherwise somebody

730
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,840
will say oh but g

731
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,080
meant this in this other paper and it

732
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,360
may have meant that

733
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,440
so how do we go from an internally

734
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,200
coherent like within the paper

735
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,159
coherent formalism to usages and

736
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,919
equations that are consistent across

737
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:20,720
papers

738
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,039
so that's what this work of connecting

739
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,440
the dots reading between the citations

740
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,679
that's what the ontology working group

741
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,480
is really working on

742
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,080
okay and the so again if you're

743
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,120
interested in this at all come contact

744
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,520
us and

745
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,200
join our ontology working group

746
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,159
the other dimension or project within

747
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,520
the dot edu

748
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,159
is this instructional and interaction

749
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,440
design

750
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,440
and the big question here is in the

751
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,799
medium term

752
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,320
how are we going to provide the

753
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,080
affordance for people to learn

754
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,679
active inference to update their

755
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,120
generative model through

756
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
action and inference about what active

757
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
inference is and how to apply it

758
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,240
and we're especially excited about

759
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,520
this dialectic between instructionism

760
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,400
and interactionism and how that might

761
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,760
relate to course design

762
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,000
and we talked about this in active

763
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,840
livestream 23

764
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,320
and dean and others had a lot of really

765
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,159
interesting things to say about this

766
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,880
but suffice to say that instructionism

767
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,480
is the idea that you're going to just

768
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,240
pass the telegram and it's going to be

769
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,679
received as an instruction

770
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,520
carried out like a cookbook

771
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,880
interactionism

772
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,880
is sort of where active inference takes

773
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,240
us which is

774
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,440
yes there is information passing between

775
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,720
the entities

776
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,799
however it's not simply that the

777
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,799
telegram message is being received

778
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,960
and the recipe is being carried out

779
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,520
there's something ongoing that's dynamic

780
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
that's being re-normalized at every

781
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,440
instance to for example

782
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,840
the surprise that the sensory unit is

783
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,720
experiencing

784
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,679
or the signals that the proprioceptive

785
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,600
aspects of the body are sending back

786
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,760
so what does that look like instead of

787
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,279
just making a sort of

788
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,120
list of terms or things you're going to

789
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,720
walk through and then after you've

790
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,919
gotten all these instructions you'll

791
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,200
know active inference

792
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,480
how could it be something that's

793
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,840
co-active with multi-agent sense making

794
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,440
and people working together and

795
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,399
interacting

796
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,799
to actually improve their model and then

797
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,799
just the last question and then stephen

798
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,120
is how do we provide applied active

799
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,399
inference education

800
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,960
for individuals coming from just so many

801
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,520
different

802
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,600
backgrounds that's going to be a

803
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,279
question we're always focused on

804
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,679
stephen

805
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,840
it might be as well when you look at

806
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,640
that interactionism

807
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,080
it might well be that when people use

808
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,240
or learn about how to interact with

809
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,919
active inference

810
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,960
how much of the active inference or what

811
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,039
kind of model

812
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,559
um would they maybe know about

813
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,320
so that that sort of raises that

814
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,600
question of

815
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,799
the different people's need to know

816
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,080
so to speak of what active influence

817
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,440
represents or is modelling could vary as

818
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,039
we enter into

819
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,279
some fields of systems engineering some

820
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,159
fields of psychology some fields of

821
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,039
uh so that could be quite interesting is

822
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,120
what kind of complexity or

823
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,200
scope of the model is needed to onboard

824
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,240
for a particular sort of

825
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,600
use case or discipline thanks

826
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,120
scott you know it got me thinking

827
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,880
um the last two you're coming and

828
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,640
stephen's comment

829
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,559
you know um the active inference the

830
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,760
framing

831
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,440
it allows a new matured perspective

832
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,720
on how information works and

833
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,559
one of the things we were on i was going

834
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,399
to call earlier today with a group that

835
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,320
just put together a

836
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,799
group field guide to misinformation

837
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,480
narrative campaign field guide it's

838
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,279
called

839
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,279
and one of the things we were talking

840
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,399
about was

841
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,720
that there's a sophistication we're kind

842
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,159
of wiring up the

843
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,279
collective human mind now and

844
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,760
active inference is kind of a necessary

845
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,840
prerequisite to being a good

846
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,200
neuron or a good participant

847
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,080
neurons the wrong word certainly um a

848
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,480
good participant in that system

849
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,559
and there's kind of a civic duty to kind

850
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,159
of understanding states

851
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,760
and understanding your state and other

852
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,919
states and i won't use the word

853
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,080
empathy or compassion but there's

854
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,000
definitely an intentionality and an

855
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,880
awareness that active inference lends to

856
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,679
systems

857
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,320
understanding of how communication works

858
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,159
and because

859
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,520
folks who i i s asserting these days

860
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,799
that the mind

861
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,640
doesn't exist in the brain it exists in

862
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,320
language and in culture

863
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,640
and the brain is just tuned into the

864
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,600
local mind

865
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,200
so we tune you know when you're babies

866
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,720
you that's why colonial

867
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,480
powers want to have indigenous children

868
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,240
in their schools they want to tune their

869
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,320
minds to imperialism

870
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,399
so one of the things that's kind of

871
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,679
interesting is

872
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,919
we're constantly mind tuning each other

873
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,440
and the awareness of other people's

874
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,200
internal states and the fact of these

875
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,720
processes

876
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,640
lends a new power and also new

877
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,799
responsibility

878
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,440
to shared communications and as the

879
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,720
species is getting

880
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,840
tighter packed and becoming in the world

881
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,039
is becoming smaller

882
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,360
informationally there's almost a

883
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,679
responsibility and duties associated

884
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,120
with

885
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,760
an active inference framing and it's

886
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,279
kind of a respectful

887
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,360
element to it or an awareness an

888
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,320
interdependence

889
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,840
element to it recognizing um this space

890
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,080
and what is going on in space and and

891
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,440
just to that point

892
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,360
when i first came into the space the

893
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
first thing i noticed was i said oh my

894
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,559
god my whole life

895
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,080
all i've been doing is contracts which

896
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,039
are synthetic markov blankets

897
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,559
right and it just there's awareness that

898
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,399
i had of what i was doing in the world

899
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,519
and how i could frame it

900
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,159
in the context of active inference that

901
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,519
really does

902
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,399
um lead to affordances social

903
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,399
affordances where there's a co-awareness

904
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,320
of the processes taking place

905
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,480
that can absolutely offer superior

906
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,320
pathways to governance because

907
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,720
information governance can be risk

908
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,360
governance

909
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,240
if properly approached and so this kind

910
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,200
of framing

911
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,000
can lead and carry the burdens of that

912
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,600
kind of thing because it's accessible

913
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,640
enough once the

914
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,679
basics are understood and if it's a

915
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,360
shared framing it becomes an

916
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,000
interoperable way of being

917
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,919
and that's part of what's missing in

918
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,440
information now is

919
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,440
interoperability um on cross-cultural

920
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,240
basis

921
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,440
thanks thanks scott so kind of

922
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,960
to close the section and then stephen

923
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,279
any last comments on edu

924
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,000
everyone is welcome to get involved with

925
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,679
this organizational unit through the

926
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,360
project-based learning

927
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,960
and the big umbrella that everything is

928
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,880
under is knowledge engineering

929
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,440
so whether you're translating languages

930
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,519
human languages computer languages

931
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,240
whether you're in the archive in stacks

932
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,240
looking for definitions and references

933
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,600
if you're working on curriculum

934
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,200
development and what that looks like

935
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,720
taking into account that whole

936
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,080
interesting dialectic

937
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,559
of instructionism and interactionism or

938
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,360
whether you're

939
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,440
in the ontology working group learning

940
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,440
ontology which is just such

941
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,519
a vast area but you're going to be

942
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,200
learning with other people who are also

943
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,080
learning whichever of these affordances

944
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,960
you take

945
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,720
hopefully it'll be something that you

946
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,039
can uh get a lot out of

947
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,840
by working with a group stephen

948
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,320
yeah building just one last point and

949
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,080
tied to what scott said is

950
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,760
states the idea of states um

951
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,760
and i think that's actually proved to be

952
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,240
where some of the last of the

953
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,720
uh terms list was being sort of worked

954
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,840
on as things that

955
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,799
related to states is a very much a jump

956
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,960
from what is being done

957
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,960
in most fields so you have even in

958
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,080
systems it's often

959
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,039
what's been moved around the dynamics

960
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:07,679
the

961
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,879
the type of objects but the state of the

962
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:11,599
object

963
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,000
is not normally exactly featured in the

964
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,199
same way and it's the same even in

965
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,480
psychology

966
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
someone's state might change but often

967
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,079
it says well they've been triggered it's

968
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,918
almost easier to say there's a trigger

969
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,520
and there's a thing that's triggered

970
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,560
someone

971
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,480
and talk about it in terms of objects

972
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,079
and stuff then actually

973
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,119
the state has changed so um

974
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,199
i think this is this is quite a hard

975
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,359
concept to get a head round but

976
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,480
comes up time and time again and of

977
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,879
course

978
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,159
inactive we partition states in a model

979
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,480
dependent way into internal and external

980
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,239
and then blanket states or boundary

981
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,560
states which first and then subdivided

982
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,520
into action

983
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,480
and sense but there we go we'll talk

984
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,879
more about that in the coming weeks

985
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,680
the next organizational unit is dot coms

986
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,359
which is communication

987
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,240
and dot coms has an internal and an

988
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,359
external goal

989
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,000
and function the internal goal is to

990
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,640
organize

991
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,720
all of the labs internal projects and

992
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,079
activities

993
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,079
that's kind of an organizer role and

994
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,599
then the external goal

995
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,960
is to carry out all forms of

996
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,280
communication with external entities

997
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,720
so if you email

998
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,960
activeinference.gmail.com

999
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,119
or if you contact us on twitter whatever

1000
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,160
it happens to be

1001
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,400
that interfacing externally is a

1002
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,440
dot-coms

1003
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,320
topic we're going to talk in these next

1004
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,200
few slides

1005
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,920
about some of the follow-ups from last

1006
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,800
semester

1007
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
and then we're going to look forward at

1008
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,960
a few of the papers we've selected to

1009
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,720
read in the coming weeks as well as give

1010
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,680
opportunities

1011
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,599
for places where people can make

1012
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,520
suggestions for who'd be an awesome

1013
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,000
guest

1014
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,720
or what papers would be great to read so

1015
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,680
the first

1016
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,800
follow-up and uh dave if you want to

1017
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,320
add any comments on this you'd be more

1018
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,240
than welcome on

1019
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,040
june 21st near the end of last semester

1020
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,599
we had

1021
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,680
our first applied active inference

1022
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,760
symposium with carl fristen

1023
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,880
and we had three different sessions each

1024
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,599
about an hour long

1025
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,000
carl was just such an incredible guest

1026
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,599
and really generous with his time and

1027
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,400
his answers

1028
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,040
super educational and you can check out

1029
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,920
the bitly link

1030
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,560
or you can go to our youtube page where

1031
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,640
you'll find these videos

1032
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,200
and in terms of a follow-up something

1033
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,280
that dave suggested and took the

1034
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,079
initiative on

1035
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,800
is to generate a transcript of the

1036
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,960
proceedings of this symposium

1037
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,320
and then we'll curate that add in the

1038
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,119
references

1039
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,680
clean it up and then hopefully pending

1040
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,119
everyone's approval

1041
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,040
have that transcript as a citable

1042
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,280
preprint so instead of oh there was this

1043
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,960
one video that one time where i think

1044
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,079
this person said this

1045
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,400
but maybe i'm not remembering it or how

1046
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,839
many times does somebody say that and

1047
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:52,240
then

1048
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,920
it's like a tenth of them will go to the

1049
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
timestamp and then a tenth will really

1050
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,520
listen to what it says well

1051
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,720
we're going to have a text

1052
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,800
representation that we can then

1053
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,520
translate

1054
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,040
we can connect back to the formal

1055
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,800
ontology and we can just

1056
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,560
contribute to this knowledge

1057
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,440
accumulation and especially some of his

1058
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,480
answers which are not

1059
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,880
written out anywhere else it'd be really

1060
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,320
unique and important to have the

1061
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,280
information

1062
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,320
in this way so that's the follow-up from

1063
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,839
the fristen symposium

1064
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,640
this short link here which i'll also

1065
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,920
post into the live chat

1066
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,079
is the short link where you can always

1067
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,359
go to

1068
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,280
understand what is going to be happening

1069
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,040
in the upcoming weeks with the streams

1070
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,960
in terms of the papers that we're

1071
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,079
reading

1072
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,640
so here we are um in the beginning of

1073
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,760
august

1074
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,680
and in the first two weeks of august

1075
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,359
we're going to be reading this recent

1076
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,280
paper bayesian mechanics for stationary

1077
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,240
processes

1078
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,240
that's a pretty technical mathematical

1079
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,720
paper and then in the following weeks

1080
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,680
we're gonna um have authors on

1081
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,960
discussing everything from

1082
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,040
industrial engineering to

1083
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,599
non-equilibrium thermodynamics

1084
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,720
in late october and we also haven't yet

1085
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,000
selected the papers for 28 29 and 30.

1086
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,240
so three papers that we're going to be

1087
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,119
able to

1088
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,560
choose so if anybody has a paper that

1089
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,480
they would like to read we have a list

1090
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,760
of unplaced readings

1091
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,640
in this document so you can scan through

1092
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,760
that list

1093
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,440
but if you have another paper you'd like

1094
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
to suggest we're also always open to

1095
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,160
that

1096
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,480
and especially if it's your paper or if

1097
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,400
you can contact the author and get them

1098
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,119
to join us

1099
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,480
for those weeks then that's bonus points

1100
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,440
and this first tab of the spreadsheet is

1101
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,160
our

1102
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,520
tuesday at 7 pacific or 1400

1103
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,320
gmt it's a participatory group

1104
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,040
discussion

1105
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,280
so it's best if you've at least tried to

1106
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,320
read the paper

1107
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,720
in terms of scanning through it but no

1108
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,079
need to fully understand it

1109
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,400
no need to be an expert we're all just

1110
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,280
going there and

1111
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,040
helping each other do sense making on

1112
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,320
these really interesting

1113
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,400
papers so please feel free to get

1114
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
involved if you're curious about

1115
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,440
live streaming or learning science out

1116
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,480
in the open

1117
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,800
however it presents itself to you

1118
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,160
hopefully this is an affordance for you

1119
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,520
to get involved with

1120
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,839
live streams and with actinflab so

1121
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,280
that's our usual

1122
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,599
tuesday live stream series so at this

1123
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,960
same exact time that we're doing

1124
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,839
this live stream except other than the

1125
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:22,240
four

1126
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,320
round table meetings in the year every

1127
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,839
other week we do a journal discussion

1128
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:31,200
dave yeah have we ever looked at a paper

1129
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
by martin butz

1130
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,320
uh in germany uh toward a sub-symbolic

1131
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,119
theory of computation

1132
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,520
i'm really enjoying that i don't think

1133
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,560
so

1134
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,760
let's send you the link yeah great cool

1135
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,760
so as far as what are the affordances

1136
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
when we want to discuss a cool paper

1137
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,960
so some papers we bring on to this

1138
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,040
tuesday live stream we're going to

1139
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,119
unpack it for two weeks in a group

1140
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,880
hopefully with the authors and we're

1141
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,800
also going to do a zero video

1142
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,440
as a lab where we unpack the paper and

1143
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,079
kind of

1144
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,960
give this uh summary and also background

1145
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,480
and context on the paper

1146
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,400
but we also have the affordances of

1147
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,720
these other series of streams

1148
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,560
and just to kind of give a flavor and

1149
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,480
also get people excited for

1150
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,119
what is upcoming let's talk about a few

1151
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,040
guest streams and model streams that we

1152
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,280
have coming up

1153
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,480
so this is on august 9th just next

1154
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,359
monday

1155
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,520
we're going to have mark miller is the

1156
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,640
primary presenter

1157
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,720
along with julian kiverstein ines

1158
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,000
hippolyto and lars

1159
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,800
sanfed smith the guest stream is going

1160
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,440
to be called

1161
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,280
exploring the predictive dynamics of

1162
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,960
happiness and well-being

1163
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,680
and just to read the first sentence of

1164
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,359
their abstract

1165
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,200
in this talk i will present some of our

1166
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,880
recent work on mental health

1167
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,400
and well-being using the active

1168
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
inference framework

1169
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,160
i i want to read more but you're going

1170
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,760
to have to go listen to this

1171
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,960
guest stream because i know it's going

1172
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,119
to be a great one so that's

1173
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,440
an example of a guest stream is some

1174
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,880
authors want to present on

1175
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,359
ongoing or recent work or they want to

1176
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,000
just raise

1177
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,079
up some perspective and we can just

1178
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,359
schedule any time

1179
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,280
that works for them you know 48 hours

1180
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,280
later or three months later

1181
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,119
the guest stream is kind of our wild

1182
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,040
card where any

1183
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,400
thing that somebody wants to present

1184
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,960
that's related to active inference we're

1185
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,160
always happy to give the venue for

1186
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,400
and another upcoming event this is going

1187
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,599
to be on august

1188
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,520
19th so just in two weeks is going to

1189
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,640
be model stream number 4.1 with

1190
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,079
bert devrie this von der lar and dimitri

1191
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,200
bagaiv

1192
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,000
and it's going to be implementing active

1193
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
inference by message passing in a factor

1194
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,359
graph

1195
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,280
and this is related to the work of the

1196
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,960
bias lab

1197
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,240
which is producing this forney lab julia

1198
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,400
toolbox for factor graft

1199
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,760
based probabilistic programming so this

1200
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,880
diagram on the upper right is related to

1201
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,480
what they're going to be talking about

1202
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,480
so if you see that you think that looks

1203
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,760
so cool or

1204
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,400
how is that related to active inference

1205
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,280
this is a really

1206
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,640
powerful tool that these fellows are

1207
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,960
working on so we're all excited to learn

1208
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,200
more about that and maybe implement it

1209
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,000
in some

1210
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,160
cases so that'll be a great model stream

1211
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,200
that's just

1212
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,640
some of the kinds of papers as well as

1213
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,280
the

1214
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,599
guest appearances that we get to feature

1215
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,599
here

1216
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,200
if you want to give a guest stream on

1217
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,720
your research or

1218
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,480
if you have a suggestion for somebody

1219
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,839
who would be great for

1220
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,000
a guest stream or math stream or model

1221
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,200
stream

1222
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,920
we're always open to that and bonus

1223
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,280
points if you can reach out to the

1224
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,119
author or if you are the author

1225
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,839
so that we can know that it's going to

1226
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:48,400
actually

1227
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,160
happen and right now we're planning

1228
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,400
any kind of event and presentation for

1229
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,000
the rest of 2021

1230
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,560
you know if it is a date in 2022 that

1231
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,800
you need to set aside let's do that too

1232
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,440
but we want to make the rest of 2021

1233
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,160
really

1234
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,200
powerful and really accessible to a lot

1235
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,079
of different backgrounds

1236
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,520
so if you're interested in doing

1237
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,160
a guest stream or suggesting just get in

1238
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,359
contact with us anytime

1239
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,520
we'll also in this dot coms section give

1240
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,880
a shout out to cognitio 2021

1241
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,200
the website is here this is going to be

1242
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,800
an online conference

1243
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,800
in the middle of october so only about

1244
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,640
a couple of weeks away and there's great

1245
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,560
co-organizers they just updated the

1246
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,160
website to reflect

1247
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,200
some of the speakers and also several of

1248
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,200
our lab participants are going to be

1249
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,240
presenting research at this conference

1250
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,400
so if you're curious about active

1251
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,920
inference and collective intelligence

1252
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,160
and also a lot of social topics this is

1253
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,359
going to be an exciting

1254
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:59,280
conference so just to close out

1255
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,760
in dot coms and then anyone can provide

1256
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,200
any thoughts

1257
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,599
there are many affordances for

1258
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,319
participating in dot coms we

1259
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,720
welcome people who have been involved in

1260
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,319
the lab already or who want to get

1261
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,119
involved

1262
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,160
with leading and growing the actin flap

1263
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,480
accounts on social media

1264
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,400
people who want to contribute or improve

1265
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,680
the state of our current

1266
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,040
series which are the podcast which is

1267
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,240
primarily blue's work as well as the

1268
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,119
live streams anyone who's interested in

1269
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,000
introducing new series and formats

1270
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
in compiling and curating the research

1271
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,319
products of the active lab participants

1272
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,920
we've already had multiple conference

1273
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,280
presentations

1274
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,599
papers where actinflab was written as an

1275
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,480
affiliation

1276
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,520
for an author people who want to help

1277
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,680
onboard new participants in live streams

1278
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,720
so they understand

1279
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,160
how to set up everything from their

1280
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,240
audio and visual to conceptually what

1281
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,480
should one do to prepare

1282
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,520
designing events blog short writing

1283
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,880
tutorials

1284
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,079
anything else that strikes your fancy so

1285
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,079
hopefully if you're excited about

1286
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,079
communication and or active inference

1287
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:08,720
one of these

1288
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,480
opportunities is right for you any

1289
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,400
last comments on comms before we go to

1290
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,839
dot tools

1291
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,680
all right our third organizational unit

1292
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,598
of three is dot tools

1293
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,119
the goals of dot tools are to uh

1294
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,960
again kind of like how dot coms had an

1295
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,520
internal and external facing side

1296
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,480
dot tools has sort of a a current and a

1297
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,720
future facing side

1298
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,560
our current facing side is to enable

1299
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,920
effective tool use

1300
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,240
and instrument use for all active

1301
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,040
inference lab

1302
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,920
processes so whether it's the video chat

1303
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,839
platform we're using or live streaming

1304
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,280
those are tools that we're using so we

1305
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,200
want to use them skillfully

1306
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,440
but also a little bit more broadly dot

1307
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,640
tools is interested

1308
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,040
in exploring and designing affordances

1309
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,160
for our niche

1310
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,240
resulting in effective action as well as

1311
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,640
innovations in tool development

1312
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,680
and dot tools last semester had

1313
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,560
many weekly meetings where resources

1314
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,520
were shared

1315
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,240
and a lot of needs and ideas related to

1316
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,400
the systems engineering of tools

1317
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,160
were discussed to kind of give the

1318
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,480
overview this is a figure from our 2020

1319
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,640
paper active inference and behavior

1320
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,319
engineering for teams

1321
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:33,200
where we framed the operations of a

1322
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,640
remote team

1323
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,119
in terms of the structure of active

1324
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,160
inference models

1325
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,800
which is these multi-scale nested markov

1326
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,680
blankets

1327
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,880
with sense coming into the agent and

1328
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,200
action going out to an agent and

1329
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,079
communication

1330
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,920
is kind of this special case whether

1331
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,920
it's human communication or

1332
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,720
two apis communicating or a human in a

1333
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,520
server

1334
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,319
because one's action is the other one's

1335
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,520
sensory state

1336
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,359
and so that kind of focus

1337
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,680
allows us to take a function driven

1338
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,480
approach

1339
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,400
for how we think about communication and

1340
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,520
tool development

1341
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,160
using active inference so i know that in

1342
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:12,960
the

1343
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,520
tools brainstorming group people were

1344
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,640
coming up with just

1345
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,119
many different avenues and getting a lay

1346
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:19,760
of the land

1347
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,240
in terms of like what does an active

1348
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,400
inference tool look like does it

1349
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,240
look like a news feed but the ranking

1350
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,920
algorithm is different or does it look

1351
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,839
like a physical object does it look like

1352
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,920
a new way of interacting with an object

1353
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,440
we already have

1354
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,800
a lot of pieces there

1355
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,760
any other thoughts on this before um

1356
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,280
alex why don't you then give a overview

1357
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,559
of the net hack challenge

1358
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,960
uh scott you had a comment oh

1359
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:55,839
hey i just wanted to mention briefly on

1360
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,280
the tools one of the things that's

1361
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,400
really interesting to me

1362
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,559
and new to the active inference world

1363
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,000
here is that

1364
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,119
um the notion of how the tools reveal

1365
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,880
differentials

1366
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,520
and my work i was an attorney for three

1367
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,160
decades

1368
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,400
and worked in risk basically that's what

1369
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,400
attorneys do we try to de-risk things

1370
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,680
and it usually has to do with

1371
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,079
differentials information differentials

1372
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,440
understanding differentials

1373
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,559
and i think one of the things is going

1374
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,720
to be really interesting is as the tools

1375
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,720
develop

1376
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,000
how might they be used in risk analyses

1377
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,800
in different

1378
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,960
areas i think that there's the the

1379
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,160
ability to

1380
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,359
navigate and close differentials that's

1381
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,160
implicit

1382
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,319
in the active inference framing i think

1383
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,359
is going to prove to be

1384
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,559
exceptionally valuable in industries

1385
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,480
that deal with risk finance and

1386
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,079
other institutional construction so it's

1387
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,280
just something i wanted to raise about

1388
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,319
the tools that

1389
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,640
right now they're used it seems like

1390
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,160
their analysis of active inference

1391
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,119
itself

1392
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,960
but i think they're incidental benefits

1393
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,400
of these tools they'll find

1394
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,359
application in myriad domains outside of

1395
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,200
academic interest in academia

1396
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,359
where the academic interest in active

1397
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:04,800
inference where there's interest in

1398
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,680
de-risking

1399
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,920
and the tools will be used directly to

1400
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,599
facilitate the closing

1401
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,040
of gaps of information that are

1402
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,680
associated with risk thanks

1403
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,839
yep very cool

1404
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,000
one of the applied projects oh yeah

1405
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,920
stephen go ahead

1406
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,079
well i was just going to say in in terms

1407
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,000
of the developmental nature as well i

1408
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,559
think

1409
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,040
you know the um in

1410
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,599
instructionalism and um interactionalism

1411
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,400
which has

1412
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,240
been the developing theme i think you

1413
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,839
could say in the lab over the last few

1414
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,040
months

1415
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,559
starts to now maybe revisit some of

1416
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,000
those earlier papers you might say

1417
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,480
okay so we've got action so we've got

1418
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,400
the idea of information being

1419
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,520
passed through or imprinted into

1420
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,079
a blanket as kind of blanket states

1421
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,480
which goes into become

1422
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,119
internal states and you've got the

1423
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,880
blanket somehow

1424
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,640
you know impression in itself on the

1425
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,960
environment so you've got this

1426
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,480
this this question about um

1427
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,400
okay so you traditionally we may have

1428
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,359
just been looking more instructionally

1429
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,599
as in information comes in information

1430
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,440
goes out well now we're looking at this

1431
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,559
more interactionist dynamic with the

1432
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,880
system boundary

1433
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,920
you've both got an information flow and

1434
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,000
some sort of

1435
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,040
action the actors doing it and that

1436
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,200
that then also becomes interesting maybe

1437
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,079
as we

1438
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,920
look at tools this sort of question

1439
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,079
comes up um

1440
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,119
and even how to diagram that

1441
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,839
is up for grabs a little bit at the

1442
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,400
moment

1443
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,319
but uh i just thought that really made

1444
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,079
me think of that

1445
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,440
cool scott yeah just one other point and

1446
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,599
i think there's a lot of movement now

1447
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,599
where from a graph theory perspective

1448
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,599
the difference of nodes and edges

1449
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,599
we spent a lot of human history

1450
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:00,960
concentrating on nodes

1451
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,319
and that's really associated with

1452
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,640
physical space it feels like

1453
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,240
the edges the interactions the

1454
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,079
relationships and the ability for us to

1455
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:08,640
describe

1456
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,280
attributes of edges and relationships i

1457
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,559
think is increasing

1458
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,520
and it's increasingly part of how we do

1459
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,240
identity

1460
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,800
and other things that we rely upon in

1461
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,920
moving through space

1462
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,079
and de-risking and leveraging our

1463
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,119
behaviors

1464
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,079
so that stephen's coming and that notion

1465
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,359
of tools

1466
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,960
really um highlighting the space between

1467
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,000
nodes

1468
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,800
and really allowing us to start to parse

1469
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,960
relationships and parse the nature of

1470
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,720
interactions and the

1471
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,480
nature of state changes and things like

1472
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,319
that what's really going on dynamically

1473
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,319
and the bottom line is i think it gives

1474
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:46,000
us a lot more solution space

1475
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,079
with within which to think together

1476
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,280
um and so that parsing of interactions

1477
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,119
allows us to alight in that solution in

1478
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:57,680
that

1479
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,880
middle space between nodes and to

1480
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,880
explore together with other people

1481
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,720
especially when there's awareness of

1482
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,040
that

1483
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,720
and so it's very similar to what's

1484
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,079
happening now i think in the

1485
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,640
word misinformation is beginning to

1486
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,680
attenuate

1487
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,119
and people are starting to realize that

1488
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,640
we just have a lot of information out

1489
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,160
there and there's all sorts of context

1490
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:16,480
and

1491
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,359
and content and intention and all sorts

1492
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:20,319
of things

1493
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,960
so we can't just say misinformation or

1494
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,319
information

1495
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,720
and similarly the relationships need

1496
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,520
parsing

1497
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,240
the subtlety and nature of the

1498
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,240
interactions of different nodes

1499
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,240
in systems i think is going to be

1500
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,920
revealed increasingly

1501
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,680
by awareness of the attributes of the

1502
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,599
relationships that are going to be re

1503
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,520
helped to be revealed through active

1504
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,800
inference analysis thanks

1505
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:47,760
cool all right um alex

1506
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,680
on to the net hack challenge so

1507
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,000
all well and good but then how do we

1508
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,040
really apply

1509
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,839
these techniques and how will we give a

1510
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:58,559
example

1511
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,440
that amazes people what do you think

1512
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,800
about this alex and what's the

1513
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,359
vision here

1514
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,920
yeah thanks this

1515
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,000
challenge is looks really interesting

1516
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,960
just because of its nature about that

1517
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,400
legendary game

1518
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,760
and uh a lot of people with

1519
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,880
different ages backgrounds know

1520
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,520
something or maybe even play from one

1521
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,960
side from another side

1522
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,040
it's really one of the difficulties

1523
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,210
most difficult

1524
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,480
[Music]

1525
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,319
games in terms of solved by computers

1526
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,040
and

1527
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,640
by machine learning techniques so

1528
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,440
and also for now it's interesting that

1529
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,079
challenge

1530
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,839
is hosted on the

1531
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,960
on research conference and so

1532
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,400
there are some connections between

1533
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,319
possibly smart agents in this game

1534
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:08,839
and connections with neuroscience

1535
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:11,920
and in terms of complexity

1536
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,640
and the visibility and we just have to

1537
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,599
try

1538
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,119
to show up some real life examples

1539
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:21,680
of applying active inference agents to

1540
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,359
some tasks

1541
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:27,280
because even in our streams we saw some

1542
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,079
examples

1543
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,480
of real life agents which operates in

1544
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,079
complex environment

1545
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,800
so we know we have proofs that it could

1546
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,440
be

1547
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,040
possible on that technical examples

1548
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,839
so we are trying to invite everyone from

1549
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:42,640
the community

1550
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,119
who are interested in machine learning

1551
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,000
techniques and

1552
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,640
active inference approach trying to

1553
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,240
solve this task i don't know how

1554
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,040
really hard it will be but at least it

1555
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,920
should be fun

1556
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,079
and could be first real life

1557
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,040
applications

1558
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,640
for with programming code of

1559
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,920
active inference models

1560
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,839
scott i have a question

1561
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:15,920
um when the when active inference was

1562
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,440
first kind of being explored and

1563
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,480
proposed

1564
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,079
my understanding was and tell me if this

1565
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,319
is accurate that it was being abs

1566
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,960
proposed as a model for modeling

1567
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,040
biological and cognitive systems things

1568
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,079
that were extent

1569
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,960
in the environment and see if that's the

1570
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,680
case

1571
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,440
one of the things i'm wondering about is

1572
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,359
what are the differences

1573
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,400
when we intentionally invoke and

1574
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,440
apply the model in a system versus when

1575
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,680
we observe it in an existing system are

1576
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,760
there differences can we

1577
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,119
mimic is it biomimicry for us to pick up

1578
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:50,400
this framing

1579
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,240
and use it and what are the challenges

1580
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,240
we and alex question to you in your

1581
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,760
experience so far in kind of designing

1582
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,280
this where we're

1583
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,520
desiring to create and and this goes

1584
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,119
back to my comment about

1585
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,720
contracts being synthetic markov

1586
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,559
blankets we are creating

1587
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:08,160
i never thought of them as that but it

1588
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,640
was if i were thinking of him is that it

1589
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,520
might have made me do better contracts

1590
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,000
so what are some of the differences if

1591
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,040
there are any

1592
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,160
between observing an active inference

1593
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,920
framing and creating an active inference

1594
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,880
framing in a system

1595
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,440
you want to give a thought alex

1596
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,799
um yeah i have

1597
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:38,079
a lot of questions around this too but

1598
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,280
uh watching latest model streams

1599
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,640
on our channel uh brings

1600
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,680
more perspectives and understanding what

1601
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,640
need to be touched

1602
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,920
uh to do it

1603
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,000
it's it's almost like when we're talking

1604
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,359
about a system that we're making

1605
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:56,160
measurements

1606
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,200
from we're doing inference on the

1607
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,480
dynamics of

1608
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,359
a system in the world and then when we

1609
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,640
design

1610
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,359
it does rely on eventually measurements

1611
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:08,880
and inference to make sure everything is

1612
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,240
going down the way that we want it to

1613
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:10,880
but actually

1614
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,559
it's a creative action that we're

1615
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,319
undertaking to truly

1616
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:18,160
design something and so it's a

1617
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,839
interesting question especially in the

1618
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,400
purely software realm

1619
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,319
do we just port over the same exact um

1620
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:28,640
sort of spatial biological or sensory

1621
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,920
affordances

1622
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,040
or are there new ways that

1623
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,280
a biological system wouldn't have access

1624
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,920
to like long-range communication or

1625
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,920
some type of internal model tweak that

1626
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,520
just doesn't really exist in biological

1627
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,240
systems

1628
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,040
so great question and uh we'll have the

1629
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,480
nethack challenge team

1630
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,920
come back to give you some thoughts

1631
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:54,160
later dave

1632
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,040
oh you're muted dave on the other side

1633
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,160
okay i still can't hear you but when you

1634
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,079
figure it out we'll come back to you but

1635
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:08,960
yeah

1636
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,000
um that's the net hack so

1637
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,280
it's happening from uh

1638
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,400
right now until october 15th so if you

1639
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,319
want to get involved in nethack

1640
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:21,760
challenge this would be the right time

1641
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,440
to do it

1642
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,920
and the skills as laid out in our

1643
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,440
discord and also

1644
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,760
on that previous slide especially if

1645
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,799
you're interested

1646
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,599
in learning and applying machine

1647
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,079
learning

1648
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,240
hacking gaming all these skills are

1649
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,079
important this is not like tetris or

1650
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,119
pac-man

1651
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,319
the game itself is actually uh something

1652
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:43,760
that has to be played through

1653
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,799
because there's it's a challenging game

1654
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,640
and um it should tell people something

1655
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,880
that go

1656
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,960
chess starcraft these games have been

1657
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,319
played to extremely high level by

1658
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,559
just off-the-shelf neural network

1659
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:01,680
algorithms

1660
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,520
and nethack hasn't and so that's

1661
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,760
sort of the barking dog you know the dog

1662
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,960
that didn't bark

1663
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,119
it should let people know that it's the

1664
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:12,480
type of problem

1665
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,240
maybe that integrates multi-level

1666
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,599
planning or

1667
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,559
symbolic or discrete elements those are

1668
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,400
the types of problems that

1669
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,480
yes we can recognize the dog in the

1670
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,480
image but can we play nethack and the

1671
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,920
answer is no

1672
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,760
also there's a special prize category

1673
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,520
for people who are using a non-neural

1674
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,839
network

1675
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:34,640
so all things to think about um also

1676
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,799
other affordances in dot tools

1677
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,599
uh people who are interested in applying

1678
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,119
active inference through

1679
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,880
product research and engineering and

1680
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,559
development that's

1681
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:48,079
an availability alex will also

1682
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,200
be uh helping us through a systems

1683
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,240
engineering

1684
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,440
project based learning process and of

1685
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,960
course anyone who wants to help us

1686
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,400
develop and improve our

1687
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,799
tool usage any thoughts on the systems

1688
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:01,760
engineering

1689
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,880
uh side alex

1690
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,559
okay um um

1691
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,000
okay now dave now dave yeah can you hear

1692
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,280
me now yep

1693
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,400
yep oh good okay uh yeah my actually my

1694
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,760
my major question is whether anything is

1695
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,720
going on

1696
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,839
with rosetta hub have you heard from tim

1697
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:29,040
at all it seemed like he vanished he's

1698
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:29,680
in the game

1699
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,680
he's in the game you got your commute

1700
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,440
because you're on a serious feedback

1701
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,400
on a serious feedback loop

1702
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,160
say that again i had to mute dave just

1703
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,839
because he was on a serious feedback

1704
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:42,400
loop

1705
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,839
um with rosetta and whatever else we use

1706
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:46,559
for cloud

1707
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,079
architecture for the ontology working

1708
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,240
group will keep people informed on those

1709
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,440
channels

1710
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,119
scott one of the things i think is kind

1711
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,960
of interesting here is the

1712
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,599
if and to the extent that um active

1713
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:01,040
inference is something that's

1714
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,559
naturally occurs and we can observe

1715
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,079
in systems whether they know they're

1716
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,839
doing it or not

1717
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:10,720
which i i assert to people i say that

1718
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,000
you're doing active inference whether

1719
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,520
you know it or not and there's articles

1720
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,720
on how humans

1721
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,640
use a beijing knowledge construction so

1722
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,400
those beijing notions are

1723
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,119
kind of embedded in a lot of human and

1724
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:22,960
other activities

1725
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,640
to that extent it's kind of interesting

1726
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,000
because we

1727
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,680
i always thought about this as bringing

1728
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,760
the active inference framing to

1729
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,880
the stakeholders

1730
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,319
if and to the extent they're already

1731
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,079
doing active inference

1732
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,040
it's kind of becomes a coaching element

1733
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,079
also

1734
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,720
of revealing the skills that are already

1735
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,160
there the things that are already being

1736
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,599
done by the system

1737
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,960
and then um tweaking them

1738
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,040
to maximize the throughput of

1739
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,280
whatever is desired by that organization

1740
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,280
so it's a i hadn't thought of before is

1741
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:57,599
the

1742
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:58,960
active inference as a naturally

1743
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,880
occurring phenomenon as an end as a

1744
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,559
synthetic phenomenon and we use the word

1745
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:03,359
artificial

1746
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:06,960
but it's something we synthesize and how

1747
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,079
what we're doing may be discovering an

1748
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,480
improvement of an existing human

1749
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,079
affordance

1750
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,400
and and and not just human but living

1751
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,359
affordance

1752
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,039
and that puts a really different tweak

1753
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:20,640
on it it's it's like um

1754
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,440
you know you are here in a map you know

1755
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,960
telling someone they're already doing

1756
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:25,440
this

1757
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,760
and let us show you how to improve it

1758
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,480
it's like a capacity mining in a way

1759
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,880
and and something we might think about

1760
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,160
in the tools because i

1761
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,760
hadn't thought about it that way before

1762
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,079
but again the people doing it and

1763
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,920
observing it where it occurs

1764
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,960
among insects and cells which don't vote

1765
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,440
and you know don't send out memos and

1766
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,160
then

1767
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,319
advocating i'm advocating at least for

1768
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,599
among humans

1769
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,240
who do vote and trip over their own feet

1770
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,319
emotionally and politically all the time

1771
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:55,839
and so it's kind of interesting if

1772
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,920
active inference is a

1773
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,960
um can be dem shown to be

1774
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,480
an efficient and or resource useful

1775
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,000
or some other positive qualities because

1776
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,319
of

1777
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:10,720
nature engaging in it and that's a

1778
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,160
demonstration of it

1779
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,440
it offers an interesting rhetoric

1780
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,480
to its instantiation in synthetic

1781
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,079
context as well

1782
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:21,520
that hey you're already half you're

1783
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,359
already doing it why not do it well

1784
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:26,000
kind of idea something to think about

1785
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,799
cool scott thanks

1786
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:31,039
steven

1787
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:32,880
just to let you know i've i have heard

1788
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,880
from tim in the sense that he is going

1789
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:35,359
to be

1790
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:38,079
sharing something on a session uh soon

1791
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:39,359
he's just had a few

1792
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:42,480
uh there's a few delays but um we've got

1793
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,440
the support

1794
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,119
from uh karen and latifah

1795
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:49,200
and uh so i think progress will be

1796
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,440
shared shortly

1797
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,760
cool great um all right let's

1798
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,920
look towards the future in our last

1799
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,000
little section

1800
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,559
the next steps for the lab which are

1801
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,240
participatory so it's not going to

1802
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,240
happen without people who want to step

1803
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,039
up and step in and make it happen people

1804
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:10,559
who want to act

1805
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:13,200
the next steps are described within each

1806
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:13,839
unit

1807
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:17,039
so for edu comms and tools we talked

1808
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:17,680
about

1809
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,920
what kinds of projects we're going to be

1810
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,680
doing this semester

1811
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,359
and hopefully some of the affordances if

1812
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,960
you want to help contribute or get

1813
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,400
involved there

1814
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,720
we're always looking to onboard new

1815
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,839
participants

1816
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:32,400
so if you're just hearing about this and

1817
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,760
it's always the right time to get

1818
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,480
involved

1819
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,599
so contact us and then as we head into

1820
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:40,000
our second semester of activity we

1821
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,960
really want to focus

1822
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,799
more on defining our governance

1823
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:44,079
structures and on

1824
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:45,680
exploring these new affordances that are

1825
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,760
available to the non-profit

1826
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,000
when we were working with the terms list

1827
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,760
and then there were these interesting

1828
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,720
discussions like

1829
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,799
how will we decide what is a core term

1830
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:56,559
and yes there's the conceptual question

1831
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,240
of what constitutes a core term

1832
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,920
but then there's the social question

1833
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,160
about not everyone's going to have the

1834
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:02,559
same

1835
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,039
exact perspective on which terms should

1836
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,720
or shouldn't be in the core terms

1837
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,319
and maybe nine out of 10 people just

1838
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:10,240
don't care and one person decides to say

1839
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,280
yes or no on it

1840
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,319
but that's not a governance structure so

1841
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:17,359
how are we going to be able to work

1842
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:20,160
truly as a collective in a participatory

1843
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,119
lab

1844
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,839
in terms of the products that we make

1845
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:25,200
and the process

1846
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,599
how we get there along the way so those

1847
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:29,119
will be exciting

1848
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,480
steps for our second semester

1849
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,960
and we'll kind of just close out with

1850
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,880
some of the questions that we always ask

1851
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,920
about papers but our system of interest

1852
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:40,880
is the lab

1853
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,000
as organizers and as participants so we

1854
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,119
want to know the same

1855
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,039
exact things that we would ask about a

1856
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:49,039
paper like

1857
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:50,480
what do we want to learn how do we want

1858
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,640
to apply it what would we

1859
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,480
gain or what would be different if we

1860
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,160
had a good understanding

1861
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,839
what are the unique predictions and

1862
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,680
implications how are we going to check

1863
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,559
up along the way

1864
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:02,160
what are the next steps what is our

1865
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,760
policy selection

1866
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,680
how are we going to reduce uncertainty

1867
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,280
about the ways that we achieve our

1868
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,720
preferences

1869
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,799
what are the goals of the research and

1870
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:12,400
then that remainder

1871
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,359
the modulo which is our curiosity and

1872
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:16,799
how are we going to be driven

1873
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:18,559
by that differential to keep on

1874
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,319
minimizing our free energy so that we

1875
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:21,200
can continue

1876
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,559
developing the lab scott

1877
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:27,119
one of the things for us to be aware of

1878
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:28,400
is we're

1879
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,680
the lab is a machine to build machines

1880
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,880
in a way right we're teaching the the

1881
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:35,920
lab is

1882
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,079
by doing the thing you're teaching or

1883
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:39,839
learning or exploring

1884
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:41,520
one thing to be really careful of is

1885
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,960
when people come in that they don't get

1886
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,240
confused by that

1887
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,480
layering this is it happens a lot i'm

1888
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,160
building a lot right now

1889
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,680
of governance systems to build

1890
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,520
governance systems

1891
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,039
and so it's just something to be aware

1892
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,960
of that when we're describing the

1893
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,400
functions of the lab

1894
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,920
that we're really explicit about the it

1895
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,400
being

1896
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,039
an instance of the thing it's developing

1897
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,119
as well because that can get confusing

1898
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,319
even though it's kind of there's a

1899
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:08,000
naturalness to it you're living it's

1900
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,319
like

1901
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,760
gandhi you know be the future you want

1902
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,839
to see kind of thing but or whatever the

1903
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:13,039
quote was

1904
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:14,480
but it's something to be aware of in

1905
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,640
terms of the description

1906
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,680
of the undertaking that we have this

1907
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,000
yes we're doing active inference and yes

1908
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
we're living active inference

1909
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,680
so when sometimes when we're talking

1910
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,039
about active inference stuff we're

1911
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:28,079
talking about the organization

1912
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,319
itself and sometimes we're talking about

1913
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:31,440
active infant stuff we're talking about

1914
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,119
the generalized concept of active

1915
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,000
inference and

1916
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,480
for us to they're not they don't need to

1917
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,839
be separated

1918
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:41,599
heavily but they do need to be juggled

1919
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,559
because there is a layering that's a

1920
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:44,960
that's

1921
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,559
natural to us because we're working in

1922
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,160
it now but a new entrant will get

1923
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,760
confused by that

1924
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,760
because they'll be confused on what lev

1925
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,359
at what level they're engaging at

1926
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:54,640
certain times so we need to be very

1927
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:55,359
explicit

1928
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:57,760
about the which level of recursivity

1929
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,599
we're existing in when we're dealing

1930
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:00,960
with something

1931
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,000
in those multiple levels cool

1932
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,359
very true so people can

1933
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:09,280
give any last thoughts just raise their

1934
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,640
hand but

1935
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,880
otherwise we'll just say thanks so much

1936
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,960
for participating this was a

1937
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,439
great start to our second semester of

1938
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:19,198
activities in the lab

1939
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:21,759
any feedback or suggestions or questions

1940
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:24,158
that people have we're always open and

1941
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:25,120
the links here

1942
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,198
contain how people can stay

1943
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:28,560
informationally updated

1944
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,920
stephen and then anyone else

1945
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,238
that might be a nice linking to the next

1946
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:36,560
uh live stream because i think that will

1947
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,158
talk about

1948
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:41,359
um what it means to segregate something

1949
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,439
as an object

1950
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:46,560
and when it means to maybe do more

1951
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,359
you know predictive processing or and

1952
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:51,359
then when you segregate things into

1953
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:52,000
active

1954
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,479
and sensory states so i think i think

1955
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:55,600
that is a

1956
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,920
an interesting question that as we get

1957
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,439
more immersed

1958
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,439
will be quite interesting is at what

1959
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,520
point does someone

1960
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,920
mostly need to know that there's

1961
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,799
something happening at a very

1962
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:12,158
embodied action sensory

1963
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:15,040
process or where is it like the starting

1964
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:15,839
point is

1965
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,679
just that there's predictive processing

1966
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:19,520
going on of some sort and that it's not

1967
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,640
all

1968
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,679
purely information coming in and then we

1969
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:25,040
have the whole question about system of

1970
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,640
interest again which

1971
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,839
is always fun so thanks oh thank you

1972
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:31,198
steven

1973
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:34,960
any other last comments

1974
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,080
uh yeah scott i just wanted to thank all

1975
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:38,719
of you

1976
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:41,120
for being so generous with your time and

1977
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,479
your knowledge

1978
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,359
and your ability and willingness to

1979
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:47,520
engage to spread this this to me is a

1980
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,279
very valuable

1981
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:53,439
and um type of set of insights and it

1982
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:54,320
allows for

1983
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:57,440
a great deal of new innovation in a lot

1984
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,400
of different areas

1985
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,120
it goes to fundamentally to how we think

1986
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,000
and so

1987
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,320
i want to thank you for being beautiful

1988
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,760
people

1989
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,360
and beautiful in terms of your

1990
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,360
generosity and your wisdom

1991
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,000
so it really is a pleasure to be able to

1992
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,440
associate with you and learn from all of

1993
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,960
you so that's something i

1994
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,880
look forward to in the next semester

1995
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,560
thank you thank you scott

1996
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,640
been great times so onto the paper

1997
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,400
let's get on that bayesian mechanics

1998
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,159
paper and start reading it and

1999
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,600
highlighting every word we don't

2000
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,159
understand yet aka all the words all the

2001
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:31,440
equations but

2002
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,920
um thanks everybody for participating

2003
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:34,480
live and

2004
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,520
for watching we'll see you in the coming

2005
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,920
weeks with the guest stream with mark

2006
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,360
miller at all on monday

2007
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,199
and then following we'll just be back in

2008
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,199
the rhythm of the papers

2009
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:48,799
alright see you later
