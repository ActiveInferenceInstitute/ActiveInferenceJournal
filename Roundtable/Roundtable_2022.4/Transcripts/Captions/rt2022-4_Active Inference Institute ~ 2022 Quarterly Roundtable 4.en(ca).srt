00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,846
>>>DANIEL FRIEDMAN: Hello and welcome, everyone, to active

2
00:00:04,868 --> 00:00:07,342
inference lab institute. This is our

3
00:00:07,396 --> 00:00:09,806
quarterly roundtable update number four

4
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:13,338
in 2022. It's December 14,

5
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:16,942
2022, and we're recording and then

6
00:00:16,996 --> 00:00:19,086
instantly premiering this video due to

7
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:22,910
some tech difficulties. Welcome to

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,318
the active inference institute. We're a

9
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:27,526
participatory online institute that is

10
00:00:27,548 --> 00:00:29,490
communicating, learning, and practicing

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,246
applied active inference. This is a

12
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:34,822
recorded and an archived Livestream, so

13
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:36,646
please provide us with feedback so we

14
00:00:36,668 --> 00:00:39,206
can improve our work. All backgrounds

15
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:41,078
and perspectives are welcome, and we'll

16
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:42,346
follow a video etiquette for

17
00:00:42,368 --> 00:00:45,834
livestreams. All right, today in

18
00:00:45,872 --> 00:00:48,346
the quarterly roundtable, we're going to

19
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:50,286
have three gain sections. We're going to

20
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:52,042
give some updates, ant the institute

21
00:00:52,106 --> 00:00:55,630
scale, then talk about developments in

22
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,686
education and research, and finally

23
00:00:58,788 --> 00:01:00,986
discuss a little bit active Inference

24
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:04,450
Institute in 2023. However, first,

25
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,890
those who are here, let's go around and

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,994
say hello. And if you would like one

27
00:01:11,192 --> 00:01:14,034
memory or special part of this year or

28
00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:15,446
just something you'll kind of take with

29
00:01:15,468 --> 00:01:17,880
you going forward in 2023,

30
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,046
whoever wants to go first, just go for it.

31
00:01:21,068 --> 00:01:24,706
>>>DAVID DOUGLASS: I'm Dave Douglass.

32
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:28,140
I was really pleased to get

33
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,190
praise from Professor Mark Souls,

34
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,460
a creator of a couple of different major

35
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,738
waves in contemporary psychoanalysis

36
00:01:40,774 --> 00:01:44,174
and neuroscience, telling us it's going

37
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:46,606
to be a massive contribution, that we

38
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:49,722
are not only recording our in depth

39
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:52,078
discussion and presentation with him,

40
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:55,038
but publishing the transcript,

41
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:59,090
which is what I was hoping to hear every

42
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,290
time we inconvenienced ourselves and

43
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,770
stayed up late to get things out there

44
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,246
that we're perceived as having an

45
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:11,574
impact. Awesome.

46
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:13,080
That's great to hear.

47
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,832
>>>IVAN METELKIN: This quarter we finished one

48
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:31,256
another intensifying system, thinking it

49
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:34,596
is not quite related to the active

50
00:02:34,628 --> 00:02:37,584
coherence theory activity,

51
00:02:37,652 --> 00:02:40,860
but in a way it helps our

52
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,516
participants to communicate with each

53
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:47,292
other and move forward our

54
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:50,992
internal projects and their own

55
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,000
projects.

56
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,236
>>>BLEU KNIGHT: Cool. So I think for

57
00:03:01,258 --> 00:03:04,564
me this year was probably the funnest

58
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:08,228
part, was the quantum stream.

59
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:11,736
I really enjoyed that a lot, and I

60
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,560
think that releasing the video

61
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,176
transcript for that will be great and

62
00:03:15,198 --> 00:03:17,084
hopefully impactful. And I'm looking

63
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:18,840
forward to doing more quantum

64
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,316
information related type of work in

65
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:25,516
the future. And I think that was

66
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,670
probably the funnest memory for me.

67
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,914
>>>ALEX VYATKIN: I think interested was on organizational

68
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:43,430
aspects and transformation and

69
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,754
possibly related to it in

70
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:52,090
other aspects written that institute

71
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,432
structure. It's a good opportunity

72
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:19,010
for next year.

73
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,696
All right, thank you. Let's jump

74
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:28,296
right in and just raise your hands

75
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,064
whenever you want to address something.

76
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:34,170
And on we go.

77
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,304
Well, there's so many ways to COVID what

78
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:40,292
happened in the previous years, but this

79
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,780
image meme partially suffices.

80
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,976
So on the left side, we have the active

81
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:48,844
inference lab. AIL. And on the right

82
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:51,036
side we have us today, which is the

83
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,928
Active Inference Institute AI heading

84
00:04:53,944 --> 00:04:57,036
into 2023. And we were active coherence

85
00:04:57,068 --> 00:05:00,704
Lab lab from the first days of 2021

86
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:04,264
till the middle of 2022 for about 18

87
00:05:04,332 --> 00:05:07,732
months. And since the middle of 2022,

88
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:10,480
we've been transforming on multiple

89
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,416
levels into the Active Inference

90
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:15,236
Institute. So, some baseball card

91
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:18,868
statistics ActInf Lab born 2020

92
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:22,536
AI born in the middle of 22 by

93
00:05:22,558 --> 00:05:26,276
the end of 2021 we had 133 live streams.

94
00:05:26,388 --> 00:05:29,576
We added about 85 or 84 more in

95
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:33,116
2022. Back in 2021,

96
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:35,356
the Active Inference ontology was just a

97
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:37,752
terms list. Today it includes

98
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:40,524
definitions, translations into many

99
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:44,448
languages and examples. In 2021,

100
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:46,416
the Active Inference textbook did not

101
00:05:46,438 --> 00:05:49,484
exist. Yet today we're continuously

102
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:51,532
delivering interactive learning groups

103
00:05:51,596 --> 00:05:54,656
and building an epistemic niche. In

104
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:56,784
2021, the Active Inference Journal

105
00:05:56,832 --> 00:05:59,876
existed only for special events as a

106
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:02,084
proof of principle. And today, which

107
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:04,304
we'll discuss later, we're rapidly

108
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:06,724
transcribing, translating augmenting and

109
00:06:06,762 --> 00:06:10,004
versioning transcripts and

110
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:11,224
in the active block, for instance

111
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:14,068
project in 2021 it was just a dream

112
00:06:14,084 --> 00:06:16,392
within a dream. And today we're actually

113
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:18,884
implementing active inference in Cadcad

114
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:20,668
and there's other rows that could have

115
00:06:20,674 --> 00:06:22,700
been added, but just a little summary

116
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,408
that brings us into our opening section

117
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:29,500
on updates at the organizational scale.

118
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,136
So, first related to the formal changes

119
00:06:33,238 --> 00:06:35,936
and updates at the Institute, we would

120
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,384
like to welcome and appreciate our

121
00:06:38,422 --> 00:06:40,256
inaugural cohort of the Board of

122
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:43,200
Directors, which began their work in

123
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,520
November 2022 that's John Klippenger,

124
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,456
Raphael Kaufman, Daniel Friedman, Dean

125
00:06:49,488 --> 00:06:52,500
Tickles, Bleu Knight and Mike Smith.

126
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,804
The Board of Directors has had their

127
00:06:54,842 --> 00:06:57,572
first meeting and over the about next

128
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,816
month or so, the Board of Directors will

129
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:02,504
be selecting officers. So we are

130
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,744
actively seeking self inclination and

131
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:07,064
suggestions for those who would like to

132
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:09,836
serve in an officer position president,

133
00:07:09,938 --> 00:07:12,700
vice president, secretary, Treasurer,

134
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,924
especially with experience in

135
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:17,084
governance, financial, nonprofit and

136
00:07:17,122 --> 00:07:20,796
education. So just signal interest in a

137
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:23,004
position or more generally and we will

138
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,928
be able to find a way for you to

139
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:28,672
contribute as soon as you're ready to

140
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:31,888
in the right way. And we're going to be

141
00:07:31,894 --> 00:07:34,756
taking some steps as a nonprofit and as

142
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:37,188
an organization, for example, towards

143
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:40,016
tax exempt 501 status,

144
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,532
developing partnerships with other

145
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:45,360
distinctions and building our grants

146
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,800
program. Anyone ant to add anything

147
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,490
here.

148
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,826
The installment of the Board of

149
00:07:55,848 --> 00:07:59,554
Directors also allows us to take

150
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:02,586
a look back on our Scientific Advisory

151
00:08:02,638 --> 00:08:06,326
Board and those who served in 2022. So

152
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:09,014

158
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:28,554
appreciations to all of those who served

159
00:08:28,602 --> 00:08:31,054
in the Scientific Advisory Board this

160
00:08:31,092 --> 00:08:35,070
year, and Beren actively soliciting self

161
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,282
and aloe nominations for the Scientific

162
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:42,322
Advisory Board in 2023 and just

163
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:44,286
connect to us via email if you're

164
00:08:44,318 --> 00:08:46,354
interested and we can provide you the

165
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,806
forms. And now we can more clearly

166
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:52,694
delineate the formal roles of the board

167
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,882
of directors, which are to implement

168
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:57,286
institute scale, formal strategy and

169
00:08:57,308 --> 00:08:59,714
governance, specification and oversight

170
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:02,066
of officers, and to apply active

171
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:04,222
inference at the organizational scale

172
00:09:04,386 --> 00:09:07,786
from the insight and guidance based work

173
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:10,314
of the Scientific Advisory Board and

174
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:12,378
their roles and functions include the

175
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:14,710
stewardship of organizational units,

176
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,406
education and research, assisting with

177
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:19,470
project development at different stages,

178
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,250
periodic meetings as a scientific

179
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,846
Advisory board quarterly as well as

180
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:28,606
subset meetings with a special interest,

181
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,874
focus and other areas of insight and

182
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:34,130
engagement. Any comments?

183
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,730
All right,

184
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,156
another helpful view is that of the

185
00:09:48,178 --> 00:09:51,504
chains of creation of the Institute. So

186
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:54,800
these edges reflect defined types of

187
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,264
relationships that are not merely part

188
00:09:57,302 --> 00:10:00,384
whole or compositional, but enabling or

189
00:10:00,422 --> 00:10:04,484
Constructor. Heins and the Institute is

190
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:07,764
on the far left here, which enables and

191
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:11,284
creates organizational unit niches the

192
00:10:11,322 --> 00:10:13,376
educational and research organizational

193
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:16,244
units that ensemble and facilitate

194
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:20,152
projects which then have attention on

195
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:23,096
project specific system of interest and

196
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:25,416
their accompanying foraging products and

197
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:28,344
so on. Anyone want to add any comments

198
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:30,636
on this systems engineering diagram as

199
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:32,300
it relates to the Institute?

200
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,600
So, yeah, basically this schema is

201
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,600
helping us to manage attention on

202
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,090
specific works of someone is doing.

203
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,992
And I believe next

204
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:55,480
year we will bring more systems concepts

205
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,140
in place in different types of modeling

206
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,852
and modeling force definitions of

207
00:11:01,906 --> 00:11:05,680
these different parts of encoding chain.

208
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,968
And so we will have opportunity in case

209
00:11:10,054 --> 00:11:13,600
we have some developments in terms of

210
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,404
number of participants. We can

211
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:21,764
manage all organizational work with

212
00:11:21,802 --> 00:11:23,984
support of such attention management

213
00:11:24,112 --> 00:11:25,670
system, let's say.

214
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,070
All right, carrying on,

215
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,744
we're continuing to work and revise on

216
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,176
the logo and brand redesign for the

217
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:44,976
Institute. So for now we'll just leave

218
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:46,976
it as a gray box, but there's some

219
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:50,020
really exciting and artistic designs

220
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,328
that we're working with and we're

221
00:11:53,344 --> 00:11:55,204
looking forward to sharing more about

222
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:57,748
those designs and the designer when the

223
00:11:57,754 --> 00:11:59,888
time is right in the beginning of the

224
00:11:59,914 --> 00:12:03,240
year. Okay, on to talking

225
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,904
about different modalities of

226
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:09,272
participation. So what previously was

227
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:10,872
referenced by just saying come

228
00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:13,612
participate in the Institute is now more

229
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,024
clearly annotated as a volunteer

230
00:12:16,072 --> 00:12:19,340
program. So of course everyone is always

231
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,536
welcome to engage with synchrony active

232
00:12:22,568 --> 00:12:25,056
coherence Institute materials like live

233
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,936
streams and publications and everyone is

234
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,144
welcome to join synchronous drop in

235
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,164
meetings and the discord. The volunteer

236
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:35,312
program keeps you in the loop about

237
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,500
specific affordances for contribution

238
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,600
and facilitates your participation

239
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,196
across projects and learning groups. So

240
00:12:42,218 --> 00:12:44,116
a volunteer is somebody who wants to

241
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,660
take an active step in their learning

242
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,012
and applying of active inference and

243
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:52,136
maybe focus in on one or more project

244
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:54,328
and also just make sure that they're in

245
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:57,012
the loop with high quality communication

246
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,064
about different affordances to

247
00:12:59,102 --> 00:13:02,708
participate. And excitingly

248
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:06,140
that informal lane for participation

249
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,824
separated out from the internship

250
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:11,432
program gives us a lot of expressivity

251
00:13:11,496 --> 00:13:13,148
to work with those who want to have a

252
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:14,824
more accountability and a higher

253
00:13:14,882 --> 00:13:17,804
intensity engagement. So the internship

254
00:13:17,852 --> 00:13:19,788
program was mentioned in the previous

255
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:23,296
roundtable and after initializing the

256
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:25,580
official internship program in October

257
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,092
of 2022 sorry to typo there. We have

258
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:30,916
twelve registered interns who are

259
00:13:30,938 --> 00:13:32,916
currently active and several more will

260
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:36,532
be beginning in early 2023. So this was

261
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:40,144
really awesome to be meeting

262
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:43,516
and connecting with some institute

263
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:45,304
participants who have been around a long

264
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:47,496
time and who were looking to take the

265
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:50,168
next step in their work, as well as a

266
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:53,144
lot of others who came in, because this

267
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:56,692
idea of and internship, which can be

268
00:13:56,846 --> 00:14:00,044
real formal recognized contribution was

269
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:03,128
very salient. So the internship consists

270
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:06,032
of several main parts. The first main

271
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:09,552
part is education and that

272
00:14:09,606 --> 00:14:13,024
active education looks like joining one

273
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:15,296
or more learning group, specifically the

274
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:17,324
textbook group and the systems thinking

275
00:14:17,382 --> 00:14:20,512
intensives as well as some self driven

276
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:23,140
education around reading and listening.

277
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,376
The second component of the internship

278
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,636
is the project based Learning, a

279
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,910
contribution to and institute project

280
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,136
which we're going to go through in the

281
00:14:32,158 --> 00:14:34,404
coming slides. And there's a mentorship

282
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:37,880
and inclination component such that the

283
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,064
interns and the institute's visions and

284
00:14:41,102 --> 00:14:43,676
goals and preferences are all aligned in

285
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:46,060
their inaction. So this is a great

286
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,428
program that we look forward to really

287
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:50,604
bolstering and carrying forward year

288
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:53,404
after year. Any comments on these

289
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:54,030
points.

290
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,716
All right. And so just to close out the

291
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:07,216
institute level section, we've continued

292
00:15:07,248 --> 00:15:10,740
to grow across our social media

293
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,216
platforms and look forward to anyone who

294
00:15:14,238 --> 00:15:16,216
wants to contribute to help develop

295
00:15:16,318 --> 00:15:21,236
these platforms as well onto

296
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:24,644
the education organizational unit.

297
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:29,528
Active one of the keystone educational

298
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:32,620
aspects of our year for many of us was

299
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,036
the active inference textbook group.

300
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:37,452
The active inference textbook of Par,

301
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:40,476
Pazulo and Friston was released as an

302
00:15:40,498 --> 00:15:43,164
open source textbook at the end of March

303
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:46,832
2022 and we were ready to

304
00:15:46,886 --> 00:15:49,004
spin up the first cohort of the textbook

305
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:50,416
group in May 2022.

306
00:15:50,438 --> 00:15:53,572
And now about

307
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:55,764
six months later, the first cohort has

308
00:15:55,802 --> 00:15:58,484
completed their study of the text and

309
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:01,300
they are invited to serve in a learning

310
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,200
assistant role for future cohorts.

311
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,060
In about September through December,

312
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,960
we had the second cohort begin the first

313
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,772
half of the textbook. And so in January

314
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:18,668
2023, cohort two is going to complexity

315
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:20,924
chapters six through ten and the third

316
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:24,588
cohort is going to begin. What we do

317
00:16:24,674 --> 00:16:27,320
in the textbook group is continual

318
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,880
deployment of value added services and

319
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,692
scaffolding of a shared epistemic niche.

320
00:16:33,836 --> 00:16:36,032
Of course, if somebody wants to read and

321
00:16:36,086 --> 00:16:37,916
work on the textbook alone, they're

322
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:40,676
welcome to. And we also hope to

323
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:43,264
cultivate a space in the textbook groups

324
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:46,116
that's engaging and allows people to

325
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:49,440
increase their familiarity and fluency

326
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,016
and rigor of understanding of active

327
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:55,368
inference through using questions

328
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:58,344
and developing discourse through using

329
00:16:58,382 --> 00:17:00,136
the active. Inference ontology and

330
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:02,616
weaving the ontology through their

331
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:05,396
thinking and also to develop their

332
00:17:05,438 --> 00:17:08,568
mathematical bases, whether that's

333
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:10,844
thinking about the fundamentals of

334
00:17:10,882 --> 00:17:13,452
statistics and linear algebra and

335
00:17:13,506 --> 00:17:15,564
Bayesian theorem, or whether people are

336
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:19,088
interested in a more advanced work like

337
00:17:19,174 --> 00:17:20,864
connecting the dots between different

338
00:17:20,902 --> 00:17:24,128
formalisms. So it was an awesome year.

339
00:17:24,214 --> 00:17:27,600
We had probably 50 around

340
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,624
there participants who were active in

341
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:33,364
different ways and who also got

342
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:36,516
activated into some other projects. So

343
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:38,384
we just encourage you whether you're

344
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,096
listening to this early enough to join

345
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:44,032
Cohort Three in January 2023 or whether

346
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,024
you're listening later, we'll still be

347
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:49,124
offering this and other textbook groups.

348
00:17:49,252 --> 00:17:51,992
So if you want to learn and learn well

349
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:54,824
together, then the textbook group is

350
00:17:54,862 --> 00:17:57,036
going to be a unique and special

351
00:17:57,138 --> 00:17:59,196
opportunity. Anything that people want

352
00:17:59,218 --> 00:18:00,030
to add.

353
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,520
All right, let me add something.

354
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,420
It was very nice how it

355
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:18,450
was rolled from Ontology for using

356
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,500
for these value added services.

357
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,190
So the work that was done with ontology

358
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,414
and I think it's mostly because of the

359
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:30,280
tool, the code, but anyway,

360
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,102
force augmenting this work

361
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:37,030
with the textbook in a group and having

362
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,618
such affordances in terms of meta data

363
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:43,990
or quick access for some additional

364
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,714
information, it really brings more

365
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,366
value. For educational process, visit

366
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,950
textbook, make it generative.

367
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,294
Agreed, there can be a lot to look at

368
00:18:59,332 --> 00:19:01,678
and go through, which is only what we

369
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:05,746
should expect. But the structure of the

370
00:19:05,768 --> 00:19:09,234
learning environment, asynchronously and

371
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:12,946
synchronously is simply not possible

372
00:19:13,048 --> 00:19:16,694
to offer or derive alone. So again,

373
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:18,646
we hope it's something like a center of

374
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:21,174
gravity for people who want to be

375
00:19:21,212 --> 00:19:24,530
proactive and in this type of scientific

376
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,030
and educational space, really catalyze

377
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,386
their learning onto the

378
00:19:31,408 --> 00:19:33,958
live streams and the educational

379
00:19:34,054 --> 00:19:37,094
function of them. In the fourth quarter

380
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:41,342
of 2022, we had just and amazing set

381
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:44,426
of guests and focal paper discussions.

382
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:47,866
We had guests in the math stream related

383
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:50,378
to category theory, in the organization

384
00:19:50,474 --> 00:19:52,866
stream relating to strategy and

385
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:55,854
governance in the model streams related

386
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:57,986
to branching time, active coherence and

387
00:19:58,008 --> 00:20:01,394
the Pi MDP package, and guests in

388
00:20:01,432 --> 00:20:03,666
the guest streams related to radical and

389
00:20:03,688 --> 00:20:06,674
activism, math, artificial intelligence

390
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:09,494
and biological intelligence. And we

391
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:12,822
featured three papers in the

392
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:16,006
discussions around the paper streams and

393
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:17,818
that was a worked example of the

394
00:20:17,824 --> 00:20:20,022
Bayesian mechanics of classical objects

395
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:23,226
in Livestream 49, exteroception as

396
00:20:23,248 --> 00:20:25,546
modeling allostasis as control in

397
00:20:25,568 --> 00:20:28,006
Livestream 50 and Canonical Neural

398
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:31,470
Networks Perform Active inference in 51.

399
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,774
And each of these series were

400
00:20:33,892 --> 00:20:37,774
exceptional. The authors joined and we

401
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:40,974
had a Dot Zero Zero crew each time who

402
00:20:41,012 --> 00:20:43,566
was really committed to understanding

403
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:47,186
and communicating the material. So there

404
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,178
are many ways you can help us co create

405
00:20:50,344 --> 00:20:52,546
special and engaging live streams in

406
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:55,862
2023. You are always welcome to

407
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,562
participate in preparing and enacting

408
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:00,626
live streams. Whether you do or don't

409
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:03,110
want to actually join a live stream,

410
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,134
it's also great to self nominate or

411
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:08,982
suggest or introduce somebody to join

412
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:11,562
Forestream. It's also a great

413
00:21:11,616 --> 00:21:13,658
opportunity to collaborate on a Dot Zero

414
00:21:13,664 --> 00:21:16,298
Zero background and context video.

415
00:21:16,464 --> 00:21:19,510
That's a great way to have your studying

416
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,346
leveraged and amplified by thousands of

417
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,526
fold. Your notes will not just live on

418
00:21:24,548 --> 00:21:26,798
your own computer, they'll exist in a

419
00:21:26,804 --> 00:21:28,446
space where others can benefit from

420
00:21:28,468 --> 00:21:31,262
them. And feel free to just join those

421
00:21:31,316 --> 00:21:33,234
regular Livestream meetings to learn

422
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:35,170
more. Any more comments?

423
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,486
One ongoing series that is capturing the

424
00:21:43,508 --> 00:21:47,130
last few slots and is ongoing

425
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,054
is the governing Continuous

426
00:21:49,102 --> 00:21:51,074
Transformation Bookstream Bleu. Want to

427
00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:54,226
add any words on that? Sure.

428
00:21:54,328 --> 00:21:57,826
So I think I was inspired by the

429
00:21:57,848 --> 00:21:59,986
transformation of the lab to the

430
00:22:00,008 --> 00:22:02,934
Institute and by joining the board of

431
00:22:02,972 --> 00:22:06,502
Directors to study governance in a more

432
00:22:06,556 --> 00:22:09,622
formal way. So we have this

433
00:22:09,676 --> 00:22:14,070
book that is a recent text that reframes

434
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,886
governance in the light active coherence

435
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,882
lab. So we undertook study.

436
00:22:20,016 --> 00:22:22,534
Tyler Sullenberg and myself and Daniel

437
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:25,770
have been participating in the Dot zero

438
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,526
versions of the bookstream and we're

439
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:30,158
doing one video per chapter of the text

440
00:22:30,324 --> 00:22:32,542
and we will get together for some

441
00:22:32,596 --> 00:22:34,558
discussions at the end of each book

442
00:22:34,724 --> 00:22:36,522
section. So if you ant to participate

443
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:39,746
either in joining the Dot zero or in a

444
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:41,858
discussion of the material presented in

445
00:22:41,864 --> 00:22:43,906
the text, get in touch because we would

446
00:22:43,928 --> 00:22:46,210
love to have other perspectives and

447
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,540
additional feedback. Thanks.

448
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,570
Well, as alluded to earlier by Dave,

449
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,218
these live streams are not just a dead

450
00:22:57,234 --> 00:23:00,438
end. At the Active Inference Journal we

451
00:23:00,524 --> 00:23:04,234
pick up where the live stream ends and

452
00:23:04,272 --> 00:23:05,626
our goal is to increase the

453
00:23:05,648 --> 00:23:08,794
accessibility and index ability of live

454
00:23:08,832 --> 00:23:11,530
streams and audio visual material.

455
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,854
So to give a summary of just an

456
00:23:15,892 --> 00:23:18,430
instance, like a case of the journal,

457
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,930
we took the transcript of guest stream

458
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,894
16 with Mark Solmes on consciousness as

459
00:23:24,932 --> 00:23:27,374
precision optimization. Here's a

460
00:23:27,412 --> 00:23:29,802
screenshot with Mark, myself, Esteves

461
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:33,394
and Dave having those live streams and

462
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:35,874
then through the development of a

463
00:23:35,912 --> 00:23:38,946
journal, utilities, GitHub repo and a

464
00:23:38,968 --> 00:23:41,062
tremendous amount of scripts and

465
00:23:41,116 --> 00:23:44,934
expertise from Dave. The outcome with

466
00:23:44,972 --> 00:23:47,074
some automated and some manual

467
00:23:47,122 --> 00:23:50,466
components is an augmented transcript

468
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:54,822
that contains different features.

469
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:58,154
It can be as plain as what comes off of

470
00:23:58,192 --> 00:23:59,654
the transcription artificial

471
00:23:59,702 --> 00:24:02,860
intelligence, it can be as rich as

472
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,254
hyperlinked and interactive with

473
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:09,534
embedded images, translations and so

474
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:13,120
on. And as of today,

475
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,374
December 14, we have Dois for

476
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:19,682
all of the paper live streams that

477
00:24:19,736 --> 00:24:23,074
occurred during 2022 and

478
00:24:23,112 --> 00:24:26,418
now we're working through the backlog of

479
00:24:26,584 --> 00:24:28,754
previous streams. And so what that looks

480
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:32,226
like on the live stream Coda page is

481
00:24:32,328 --> 00:24:34,946
you'll find the event name, the date it

482
00:24:34,968 --> 00:24:37,318
was live streamed, the video watch link,

483
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:39,654
the title and link to the paper and

484
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:41,878
information on the guests. You'll also

485
00:24:41,964 --> 00:24:44,746
find that there are a link to the

486
00:24:44,768 --> 00:24:48,010
slides, a link to the transcript,

487
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,826
a DOI provided if you want to cite it,

488
00:24:50,848 --> 00:24:53,722
and also a link to the GitHub where that

489
00:24:53,776 --> 00:24:56,462
series can be versioned so people can

490
00:24:56,516 --> 00:24:59,786
fix typos in a decentralized way that's

491
00:24:59,818 --> 00:25:02,382
incremented and trackable. They can also

492
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:05,134
add simulations and all kinds of other

493
00:25:05,252 --> 00:25:07,646
contributions that people might want to

494
00:25:07,668 --> 00:25:09,490
do so that the thread of these

495
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,834
discussions stays alive. Dave, it was

496
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:15,618
great work and a fun time this year.

497
00:25:15,704 --> 00:25:18,900
What would you like to add or provide?

498
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,402
Well, we're just getting

499
00:25:26,456 --> 00:25:30,930
going in a few very

500
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,746
technical and very high impact Fields,

501
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,790
notably biology and public

502
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,522
health. There has been a huge push

503
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,774
internationally across disciplines to

504
00:25:44,812 --> 00:25:48,140
get word level, phrase level,

505
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,442
conceptual, graph level, access to all

506
00:25:52,496 --> 00:25:55,430
researchers. It's a lot of material,

507
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,978
but it is a small fraction of all of the

508
00:25:57,984 --> 00:26:01,102
scholarly activity. I think even in that

509
00:26:01,156 --> 00:26:05,930
field, the presentation,

510
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,902
the reuse of spoken material is

511
00:26:09,956 --> 00:26:14,594
still pretty minor. And between

512
00:26:14,712 --> 00:26:17,266
the various text repositories, the

513
00:26:17,288 --> 00:26:20,690
different open science initiatives and

514
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,500
active inference Institute, I think just

515
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:29,298
continuing to push to make particularly

516
00:26:29,394 --> 00:26:31,910
interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary

517
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:36,022
ongoing realtime scholarship, the norm

518
00:26:36,156 --> 00:26:40,442
over the next few years will

519
00:26:40,496 --> 00:26:43,546
really pay off tremendously. There's a

520
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:45,258
lot of legal battles that are going to

521
00:26:45,264 --> 00:26:48,380
be getting worse. Folks that want to

522
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,886
take possession, take ownership of the

523
00:26:51,908 --> 00:26:54,622
entire genome of every organism and

524
00:26:54,676 --> 00:26:57,120
charge you to know anything.

525
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,630
In my opinion,

526
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,850
criminally evil activity is being run

527
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:11,490
through legal systems and common

528
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,714
law. One hope that simply overwhelming

529
00:27:14,782 --> 00:27:17,366
this with virtuous activity is going to

530
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:21,126
help to make that much less of

531
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:25,494
a pathology that's afflicting the

532
00:27:25,532 --> 00:27:27,590
species and other species.

533
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,258
Wow. From transcription

534
00:27:32,354 --> 00:27:35,340
to the metacrisis and back.

535
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:39,510
It's really been educational though and

536
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,674
we all know just in the unrecorded

537
00:27:41,722 --> 00:27:43,598
private conversations we have and in the

538
00:27:43,604 --> 00:27:46,186
seminars and in the meetings that we've

539
00:27:46,218 --> 00:27:49,214
had over the previous years enabled by

540
00:27:49,412 --> 00:27:52,906
video conversation, amazing things are

541
00:27:52,948 --> 00:27:55,006
said and amazing perspectives are shared

542
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:57,970
by experts, beginners, all kinds of

543
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,286
experts and people with their own lived

544
00:28:00,318 --> 00:28:03,522
experience. And yet the best we can do

545
00:28:03,576 --> 00:28:05,830
in many situations is link to a video

546
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,030
and sometimes not even that. So to have

547
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,714
all of the transcripts and an increasing

548
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:13,334
number of captions and their

549
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:16,054
translations in a searchable and

550
00:28:16,092 --> 00:28:20,938
trainable and accessible form is

551
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:24,186
again, as Dave mentioned, we hope that

552
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:28,410
this can become a continuous development

553
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,274
leaving a huge amount of functional

554
00:28:31,322 --> 00:28:34,206
products in the niche and the costs are

555
00:28:34,228 --> 00:28:37,422
not high and it is more possible than

556
00:28:37,476 --> 00:28:39,386
ever. Truly. Within the last several

557
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:42,474
months there were developments in speech

558
00:28:42,522 --> 00:28:45,114
and text processing that changed our

559
00:28:45,172 --> 00:28:46,754
ways of working. So that was just quite

560
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,262
exciting to have set out on this path

561
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:52,606
years ago and see so much of it evolve

562
00:28:52,638 --> 00:28:55,334
in the last few months. Alex or anyone

563
00:28:55,372 --> 00:28:55,960
else?

564
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:03,926
Yeah, it's actually a

565
00:29:03,948 --> 00:29:07,314
transformational project for Institute

566
00:29:07,442 --> 00:29:09,418
because it's in the beginning of the

567
00:29:09,424 --> 00:29:13,020
year. It was like a dream to have all

568
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,650
videos in transcripts.

569
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,700
And this project,

570
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,482
I believe, heavily technology driving

571
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:27,454
with Dave's expertise, give us these

572
00:29:27,492 --> 00:29:29,520
pictures when we actually have

573
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,810
transcripts and have backlog when we can

574
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,730
improve and having this text corpus.

575
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,458
As and Institute we are on frontier in

576
00:29:43,464 --> 00:29:46,822
terms of using tools that we have

577
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:50,360
from AI developments and all of these

578
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:56,134
text force concept will

579
00:29:56,172 --> 00:29:59,034
be developed in different ways with all

580
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:01,690
different kinds of new technologies.

581
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,460
Awesome. All right,

582
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,210
carrying on. Yvonne, want to describe

583
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,386
the work in the systems engineering

584
00:30:13,418 --> 00:30:16,142
intensive? Yes,

585
00:30:16,196 --> 00:30:19,614
sure. So next year we

586
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:23,540
start new intensive for four weeks

587
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:27,310
for beginning and this type of intensive

588
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:31,140
will mostly for our

589
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,462
internals, but we are

590
00:30:35,516 --> 00:30:39,238
open to welcoming all

591
00:30:39,324 --> 00:30:41,586
others who are interested in systems

592
00:30:41,618 --> 00:30:43,030
engineering approach.

593
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:47,770
We will go through

594
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,162
the concepts and mostly on

595
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:54,700
role concepts like they are

596
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,726
the cornerstone in the systems

597
00:30:58,758 --> 00:31:02,160
engineering, it's very helpful to

598
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,910
negotiating within the projects.

599
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:12,010
So besides

600
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,200
all of the theory Parr, we have

601
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:20,782
practical parts, and we also

602
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:23,970
have some cases like you can see here

603
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,434
with the concepts and examples

604
00:31:28,482 --> 00:31:31,574
from the real life. It will

605
00:31:31,612 --> 00:31:36,760
help to understand the

606
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,610
systems engineering approach more

607
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,650
precisely.

608
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,576
Awesome. So it's going to be four weeks

609
00:31:47,678 --> 00:31:51,144
synchronous with also asynchronous work

610
00:31:51,182 --> 00:31:53,628
and learning. I want to add a few more

611
00:31:53,714 --> 00:31:54,830
details. Here.

612
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:06,784
We'Ll provide the RSVP form for

613
00:32:06,822 --> 00:32:11,312
your conversation, and here

614
00:32:11,366 --> 00:32:15,184
we provide some specific DAGs. And if

615
00:32:15,222 --> 00:32:19,360
you are available for specific dates,

616
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,236
and if you have Jorge questions,

617
00:32:23,338 --> 00:32:27,220
you can easily reach us out via

618
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,670
email.

619
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,116
Awesome. This like active inference.

620
00:32:36,228 --> 00:32:40,264
It's a framework that helps us think,

621
00:32:40,382 --> 00:32:42,548
shapes, and scaffolds our attention and

622
00:32:42,574 --> 00:32:46,988
affordance, and also marries well

623
00:32:47,074 --> 00:32:50,028
with active inference as we continue to

624
00:32:50,194 --> 00:32:53,756
think about the Institute and all of its

625
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:57,488
attendant systems as something like a

626
00:32:57,494 --> 00:32:59,536
synthesis of active inference with

627
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:03,388
systems engineering. Want to summarize

628
00:33:03,484 --> 00:33:07,264
this slide? Yeah, just one thought

629
00:33:07,302 --> 00:33:08,050
for free.

630
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,150
This time we will provide the

631
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,076
linkage between active and force

632
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:21,930
instance system thinking, and we can

633
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:26,520
publish some

634
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,296
small review on what the

635
00:33:30,318 --> 00:33:33,932
entire linkage is now and

636
00:33:33,986 --> 00:33:37,630
how we consider it now.

637
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,916
Yes, this type

638
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:45,712
of activity is part of the

639
00:33:45,846 --> 00:33:48,592
educational program of Institute for

640
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:54,016
Augmented Intelligence. And you

641
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:57,180
can see here the link of the Institute

642
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,484
and Parr of the courses that are

643
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:05,728
available in English. It's partly

644
00:34:05,824 --> 00:34:11,380
translated by anonymous translation,

645
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:16,570
so it could be somehow not so

646
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,150
play in English. But anyway, it's very

647
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,572
useful content to moving

648
00:34:28,706 --> 00:34:32,430
any projects forward to

649
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,936
their purposes, whatever research

650
00:34:35,058 --> 00:34:38,450
projects is or industrial or

651
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:43,872
whatever projects you

652
00:34:43,926 --> 00:34:45,520
are launching.

653
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,942
Excellent. All right. Any final concepts

654
00:34:53,006 --> 00:34:54,100
on education?

655
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,714
It's been quite an educational year.

656
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:06,218
Those who are in the game and listened

657
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:08,638
to some conversations, joined a few,

658
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:11,710
read some papers, scanned the social

659
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,382
medias, stayed abreast of what was

660
00:35:14,436 --> 00:35:16,494
happening and changing in our field. It

661
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:20,114
was incredible, actually. When people

662
00:35:20,232 --> 00:35:23,774
look back on 2022 and plus or minus

663
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:26,226
several years from now, there's so much

664
00:35:26,328 --> 00:35:29,074
happening and so much to learn that

665
00:35:29,192 --> 00:35:32,502
those who choose to act first and step

666
00:35:32,556 --> 00:35:35,000
into the fray are already learning,

667
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,806
at least for myself, more than we

668
00:35:38,828 --> 00:35:41,894
thought was possible onto the

669
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:44,246
research projects. So here we're just

670
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:46,954
going to more cursorily overview some

671
00:35:46,992 --> 00:35:49,114
research projects because they're all in

672
00:35:49,152 --> 00:35:50,634
progress with a lot of different

673
00:35:50,752 --> 00:35:54,614
outcomes, and just join the meetings for

674
00:35:54,672 --> 00:35:57,294
these projects when we pick back up in

675
00:35:57,332 --> 00:36:00,666
2023. So in the Active

676
00:36:00,698 --> 00:36:03,150
Inference ontology, we are continuing to

677
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,714
develop the ontology, fleshing out the

678
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:11,022
terms list as well as associated

679
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:14,206
definitions, examples, counter examples,

680
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:17,022
and so on, as well as the translations

681
00:36:17,086 --> 00:36:18,898
into different languages and with the

682
00:36:18,904 --> 00:36:21,894
mathematics. This is what facilitates an

683
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:25,346
engineering grade approach to the active

684
00:36:25,378 --> 00:36:27,510
inference knowledge ecosystem.

685
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,080
In the Active blockfronts project,

686
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,914
primarily with the development work of

687
00:36:33,952 --> 00:36:36,774
Yakup, we've continued to explore

688
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:39,686
computational implementations of active

689
00:36:39,718 --> 00:36:42,026
inference, primarily in Python and

690
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:45,902
Pymdp. But also in a few other ways and

691
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:49,738
this will be a continued active

692
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:53,406
locus in 2023. We had a paper

693
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:55,966
and a poster and maybe some other

694
00:36:55,988 --> 00:36:59,426
outcomes from this project in 2022 and

695
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:01,634
we're going to make it even more this

696
00:37:01,672 --> 00:37:05,906
year. In robotics and embodied we

697
00:37:05,928 --> 00:37:09,610
have JF facilitating a really unique

698
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:13,334
project and dimension. It's been great

699
00:37:13,372 --> 00:37:16,886
to have JF's experience with the

700
00:37:16,988 --> 00:37:19,334
physical and the metaphysical, one might

701
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:21,014
say, and the way that they come together

702
00:37:21,132 --> 00:37:25,110
in these society of Lego

703
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:28,570
entities. But also a great project and

704
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,514
offering where those who want to learn

705
00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:34,282
more about symbolic active inference and

706
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:38,206
robotics can connect with JF and

707
00:37:38,308 --> 00:37:40,926
work on this really unique project. And

708
00:37:40,948 --> 00:37:43,002
then there's a few other project seeds

709
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:45,582
that we're looking to activate as

710
00:37:45,636 --> 00:37:48,510
needed, which is the graphical interface

711
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,666
project asking what is it like

712
00:37:51,848 --> 00:37:54,194
to learn and apply active inference from

713
00:37:54,232 --> 00:37:57,090
a visual and intermodal perspective

714
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,890
highlighting accessibility and rigor.

715
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,978
And in the Cognitive Agent Modeling

716
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:05,782
Project, where we're doing research,

717
00:38:05,836 --> 00:38:07,794
analysis to understand the similarities

718
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:09,798
and differences amongst different

719
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:12,006
cognitive modeling frameworks, such as

720
00:38:12,028 --> 00:38:14,666
active inference and others. So that in

721
00:38:14,688 --> 00:38:18,106
the future, when we say, well, we study

722
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:21,638
attention this way, we can also flesh

723
00:38:21,654 --> 00:38:23,642
that out by saying and these other

724
00:38:23,696 --> 00:38:25,642
common frameworks that are used in field

725
00:38:25,696 --> 00:38:27,706
one, two, three, study attention this

726
00:38:27,728 --> 00:38:29,726
way, and this framework doesn't use

727
00:38:29,748 --> 00:38:31,614
attention. And so this is why we think

728
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:33,454
that active inference could do better

729
00:38:33,492 --> 00:38:35,550
than this framework in this place and

730
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,146
help this framework in this way. And

731
00:38:38,168 --> 00:38:40,498
then we have the individual research

732
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:43,410
projects which just reflect the research

733
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,202
projects that driven individuals are the

734
00:38:47,256 --> 00:38:50,946
champions of and they're

735
00:38:50,978 --> 00:38:54,022
not always going to be carried out using

736
00:38:54,076 --> 00:38:57,266
the onFt ontologies narratives, formal

737
00:38:57,298 --> 00:38:59,938
documents and tools of the institute.

738
00:39:00,114 --> 00:39:02,906
Which is to say, it's not necessarily DA

739
00:39:02,928 --> 00:39:05,318
Costa document owned by the active

740
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:07,734
inference institute with an open source

741
00:39:07,782 --> 00:39:11,210
dedication, but it could be. And these

742
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,306
research projects have been very

743
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:16,046
fruitful and engaging and it's been an

744
00:39:16,068 --> 00:39:18,506
Conor to connect with so many diverse

745
00:39:18,538 --> 00:39:21,726
individuals who are making it happen in

746
00:39:21,748 --> 00:39:24,720
their own way and sometimes working

747
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,770
amidst the traditional research

748
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,094
structures. But needing an outlet.

749
00:39:30,142 --> 00:39:32,594
That's not what they have. And other

750
00:39:32,632 --> 00:39:34,862
times coming from outside of traditional

751
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:37,586
research structures. And that's just

752
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:39,810
really special to see at the institute.

753
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:44,438
Just to give a little one more detail

754
00:39:44,524 --> 00:39:46,790
on active block force instance with some

755
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:50,482
memes and roadmaps. Our gain conceptual

756
00:39:50,546 --> 00:39:53,366
focus this year was understanding the

757
00:39:53,388 --> 00:39:56,886
multi agent case, active coherence lab

758
00:39:56,918 --> 00:39:59,546
simulations, understanding the

759
00:39:59,568 --> 00:40:01,274
dimensionality and some of the

760
00:40:01,312 --> 00:40:03,926
constraints and processes associated

761
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:06,766
with multiagent simulations will then

762
00:40:06,868 --> 00:40:10,330
let us revisit exafferent POMDP,

763
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,202
partially observable Markov decision

764
00:40:12,266 --> 00:40:15,470
process modeling schemes and heuristics

765
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,986
and we think of active block, for

766
00:40:18,008 --> 00:40:20,158
instance, having two primary

767
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:23,410
departments. On the theoretical side,

768
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,866
there's a host of questions related to

769
00:40:26,968 --> 00:40:30,310
different functionalities of models and

770
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,542
computational implementations as well as

771
00:40:33,596 --> 00:40:35,746
exciting areas like quantum active

772
00:40:35,778 --> 00:40:38,614
inference. And on the applied side there

773
00:40:38,652 --> 00:40:42,490
are various settings and use cases where

774
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,730
we can really start to make that last

775
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,990
mile between a general purpose package

776
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,940
and a domain specific use case.

777
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:56,320
Any final comments on research?

778
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:03,440
All right, well,

779
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,614
there are so many ways to talk about

780
00:41:05,652 --> 00:41:07,966
what comes next. And I'm hoping that in

781
00:41:07,988 --> 00:41:11,218
early 2023 we'll be communicating those

782
00:41:11,304 --> 00:41:15,326
to all of you. Here's just one synthesis

783
00:41:15,438 --> 00:41:17,954
visualization to help those who might

784
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:22,050
want to see we are niche bound

785
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,822
on all sides, and we wouldn't want it

786
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:28,546
any other way. At the Institute scale,

787
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:31,686
we have a renewed understanding and

788
00:41:31,788 --> 00:41:35,066
structural enablements with the board of

789
00:41:35,088 --> 00:41:36,886
directors in a formal governance role

790
00:41:36,918 --> 00:41:39,306
and the Scientific Advisory Board as a

791
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:42,534
broader Global cohort of individuals

792
00:41:42,582 --> 00:41:45,414
who want to be scientific informal

793
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:48,494
advisors. And we're continuing to

794
00:41:48,612 --> 00:41:50,714
develop our grants and partnership

795
00:41:50,762 --> 00:41:54,122
programs as well as make advancements

796
00:41:54,186 --> 00:41:56,686
on the bolts domains business,

797
00:41:56,788 --> 00:41:58,926
operational, legal, technical and

798
00:41:58,948 --> 00:42:02,666
social. Within the institute,

799
00:42:02,778 --> 00:42:05,774
we have two organizational units the

800
00:42:05,812 --> 00:42:08,178
active educational unit and the research

801
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:12,322
unit. At the Research and Education Unit

802
00:42:12,386 --> 00:42:15,142
level, we're interested to have

803
00:42:15,276 --> 00:42:18,214
stewarded development by those who have

804
00:42:18,252 --> 00:42:20,166
that kind of vision and capacity to

805
00:42:20,188 --> 00:42:22,434
share and generally to increase

806
00:42:22,482 --> 00:42:26,698
participation, quality and quantity and

807
00:42:26,864 --> 00:42:30,214
increase our capacity to model projects.

808
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:33,754
For example, in 2022, we were able to

809
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:36,630
develop an improved metamodel or a

810
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,674
template for live streams which enabled

811
00:42:39,722 --> 00:42:42,462
us to increase the quantity and quality

812
00:42:42,596 --> 00:42:44,894
of the live streams. And we look forward

813
00:42:44,932 --> 00:42:47,050
to doing those kinds of metamodeling

814
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,906
approaches across other working product

815
00:42:50,008 --> 00:42:53,346
and system of interest types. And the

816
00:42:53,368 --> 00:42:55,650
last mile where the work is actually

817
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,038
done, where the epistemic rubber hits

818
00:42:59,054 --> 00:43:02,090
the Pragmatic road, is in the projects,

819
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,042
where we hope and expect Arnold Pfeffer

820
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:07,638
to see sustained participation from

821
00:43:07,724 --> 00:43:10,454
Global participants, volunteers and

822
00:43:10,492 --> 00:43:13,346
interns. And it's through the projects

823
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:16,042
and the services that they project back.

824
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:18,922
Hinton the niche by which we actually

825
00:43:18,976 --> 00:43:21,702
close the loop through continual active

826
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,426
inference and service. So here's the

827
00:43:24,448 --> 00:43:26,474
live streams going out through a data

828
00:43:26,512 --> 00:43:29,034
channel. Here's the transcripts leaking

829
00:43:29,082 --> 00:43:31,518
out of a GitHub repo. Here's somebody

830
00:43:31,604 --> 00:43:33,774
translating the biology into a new

831
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:35,402
language so that all the previous

832
00:43:35,466 --> 00:43:37,358
projects can be empowered. Here's a

833
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,394
script coming out. Here's some other

834
00:43:39,432 --> 00:43:42,114
ambassadorship. And so this is just one

835
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:45,954
way. We are representing to you

836
00:43:45,992 --> 00:43:48,802
and to ourselves what the Institute is

837
00:43:48,856 --> 00:43:51,518
and what it does in a complex and

838
00:43:51,544 --> 00:43:55,186
changing niche. Any multi

839
00:43:55,218 --> 00:43:56,918
level thoughts that you fellows would

840
00:43:56,924 --> 00:43:57,800
like to share?

841
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,260
Last two ones, like thinking assistance.

842
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,112
Okay. 2022 was a year

843
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:18,964
of artificial intelligence

844
00:44:19,012 --> 00:44:22,044
generated images and text for many.

845
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:25,660
So thought we'd throw out a few computer

846
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,984
generated, not designer generated

847
00:44:29,112 --> 00:44:31,036
logos, but they're pretty cool. We made

848
00:44:31,058 --> 00:44:34,176
many more and had fun times, I think all

849
00:44:34,198 --> 00:44:37,456
of us dialoguing. And next year in

850
00:44:37,478 --> 00:44:39,376
the active diffusion project. We'll have

851
00:44:39,398 --> 00:44:40,930
a lot more to say about this.

852
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:46,156
Well, what would a good understanding

853
00:44:46,188 --> 00:44:49,460
enable of the Institute and our niche?

854
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,092
What are some unique predictions and

855
00:44:53,146 --> 00:44:55,396
implications of our work? What are the

856
00:44:55,418 --> 00:44:57,504
next steps for free energy principle.

857
00:44:57,552 --> 00:45:00,120
And active inference and the Institute.

858
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,776
What are the goals of this research or

859
00:45:02,798 --> 00:45:04,484
work? And what are you still curious

860
00:45:04,532 --> 00:45:07,736
about? A closing round from everyone.

861
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:11,760
As we have our final Livestream

862
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,990
of the year.

863
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,536
I want to know more about this active

864
00:45:18,568 --> 00:45:20,284
diffusion project and where can I sign

865
00:45:20,322 --> 00:45:23,456
up? Sounds way fun. That's my

866
00:45:23,478 --> 00:45:26,640
closing thought. Catechism incoming.

867
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:35,082
So it's like closing roundtable

868
00:45:35,146 --> 00:45:37,639
for this year, I believe. I can say that

869
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:42,514
it was quite a journey and we

870
00:45:42,712 --> 00:45:46,002
redefining a lot of stuff in terms of

871
00:45:46,056 --> 00:45:47,650
our own understanding about

872
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,770
understanding of niche and adaptive,

873
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:54,600
our structure to be able to

874
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,550
be more and more valuable

875
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,602
for different communities, for different

876
00:46:04,656 --> 00:46:08,170
possible intersonse stakeholders.

877
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:13,050
Force. Next year's lips look bright.

878
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,380
Thank you, Yvonne and Dave.

879
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,732
Yeah. For me, the most encoding thing

880
00:46:23,786 --> 00:46:27,172
is our internship, and I'm really

881
00:46:27,226 --> 00:46:31,256
looking forward to how people from

882
00:46:31,438 --> 00:46:36,680
different domain will learn

883
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:41,092
more about active coherence and bring

884
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:45,470
their perspective, Hinton this area

885
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,492
and get it back our

886
00:46:50,546 --> 00:46:54,032
perspective. This is

887
00:46:54,086 --> 00:46:56,050
really awesome, I think.

888
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,116
Thank you, Dave. That's extraordinary,

889
00:47:01,228 --> 00:47:04,316
the range of interests and expertise

890
00:47:04,428 --> 00:47:07,872
that have come through some folks.

891
00:47:08,016 --> 00:47:10,260
You see their faces every week. Some

892
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,996
folks are working hard, but behind the

893
00:47:13,018 --> 00:47:16,150
scenes there have been folks that

894
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,088
dropped in a lot a year or

895
00:47:20,094 --> 00:47:22,552
two ago we haven't seen for a while. I

896
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:25,450
suspect they are greatly enriched and by

897
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,536
this collaboration and that some of them

898
00:47:28,558 --> 00:47:32,236
will come back. And whether we see them

899
00:47:32,258 --> 00:47:34,696
or not, they're using what they've

900
00:47:34,728 --> 00:47:37,356
learned, both the soft and the hard

901
00:47:37,538 --> 00:47:41,980
skills in enriching other areas.

902
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:47,344
Wow. Totally agree with all of that. I

903
00:47:47,382 --> 00:47:51,164
may have to sneak in a final separate

904
00:47:51,212 --> 00:47:54,688
stream to review one slide per

905
00:47:54,774 --> 00:47:58,112
guest stream or paper because we truly

906
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:01,456
had such a range of guests.

907
00:48:01,648 --> 00:48:04,816
And for those who tune

908
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:08,244
in asynchronously or those who

909
00:48:08,282 --> 00:48:09,700
join the meetings,

910
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,956
it's been incredible. The bravery and

911
00:48:15,978 --> 00:48:20,100
the honesty and the authenticity

912
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,500
that learners and researchers all around

913
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:27,500
the world brought to this little corner

914
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,560
of the Internet in its truly earliest

915
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,540
days will always be remembered.

916
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,390
Okay, till next time.

917
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:40,890
Thank you.
