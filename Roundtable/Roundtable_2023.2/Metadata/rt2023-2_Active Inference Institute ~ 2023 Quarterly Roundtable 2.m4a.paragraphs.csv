4980	28756	1	A	0.56	00:04	49	You. Hello everyone. Welcome to the Active inference Institute quarterly roundtable number two in 2023. It's June 30, 2023, and this is going to be our quarterly updates and ways that you can participate at the institute and in the active ecosystem. So welcome to the active inference institute.
28868	75836	2	B	0.90913	00:28	112	We're a participant battori online institute that is communicating, learning, and practicing applied active inference. You can find us at the links on this page and note that we'll be transitioning our emails over from activeinference@gmail.com towards Atactiveinference institute domains. This is recorded in an archive Livestream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome, and we'll be following video etiquette for live streams today in the quarterly meeting number two of the year. We'll start at the institute scale, give some updates at the institute level, and then we'll look a little bit deeper into primarily education, but also research.
76018	91650	3	B	1.0	01:16	42	And then I'll have some closing thoughts by way of a presidential address about where we're at with active inference. And if you're watching live, please write comments and questions in the live chat and we will look to address those during.
94120	102580	4	B	0.9782	01:34	13	Okay, so starting with the institute scale, some updates coming from the institute.
105000	123630	5	B	0.98142	01:45	40	Here's one way that we can visualize the active inference institute in June 2023. We are within the active inference ecosystem as well as within other ecosystems, and we have a nested structure. Alex, would you like to describe this?
127820	180248	6	A	0.81961	02:07	100	Yeah, I think for these moments, it's great to see this structure and understand what is actually in place and working and acting and adapting. And from very beginning we consider it from perspective of systems thinking and from perspective of active inference. We always think about some kind of nested and hierarchical structure which can be builded and structured accordingly. So having it right now embodied, it's great to see it totally agree. At the institute scale where these first updates are going to come from, we have the officers, the board of directors, and the scientific advisory board.
180414	208480	7	B	0.99998	03:00	65	We have two organizational units which steward the development and support participation in projects. And projects and learning groups are really where it happens on the ground. And so we're going to talk a lot more about these. But this is the nesting and our own relationship with the ecosystem. Another way to see this is in terms of people and positions at the institute.
208640	229028	8	B	0.99959	03:28	60	So starting from the left, we have casual engagement with our products and services into the niche. So this might be the very video that you're listening to or watching right now. It could be the transcript of this video that you're reading. It might be the active inference ontology. It might be the active block, for instance, software package.
229124	279364	9	B	0.92384	03:49	122	There's all these different open source products and services that we provide to the niche. And one moment you will decide to participate in a project or a learning group, and that can be more towards the learning, more towards the doing and leveraging your contributions at the institute. And some participants will choose to solidify their participation through volunteering or engaging with the internship program, both of which are new and really excitingly. Developing well and then we haven't listed any names of the many of you who are in all of these different stages. And you may want to play another role or another position in the Institute, such as the Scientific Advisory Board, board of Directors or the officers.
279412	298450	10	B	0.85063	04:39	37	So a lot of appreciation and thanks to everybody who's shown and not shown on this slide. We are really appreciative of how you all show up for the institute. Alex, want to add anything on that?
303940	337340	11	A	0.9877	05:03	65	Yeah, even from this slide, we can see that a lot of people already involved in activity and provide great insights and different perspective and backgrounds and experience. And yes, a lot of people not shown here, but we know them through our community platforms and so on. So you can see this progress in terms of participation in activities and that's also great progress.
339840	377960	12	B	0.96	05:39	92	All right, moving on. We are excited that for our third applied active inference symposium to be held in August, we will have the theme of enacting ecosystems of shared intelligence, active inference as a cognitive kernel. We have a really broad and global co organizer team, which is very exciting. So thanks to everybody who's in the co organizing team for this symposium, we're just getting started on the organization. So in the coming days and weeks, we'll be providing more information on participating in a more formal call for presenters.
379100	393950	13	B	0.99991	06:19	44	However, if you're listening to this message now and you are really excited to do a presentation or a workshop or mentorship and be a part of the active inference ecosystem, then please reach out to us. Alex, anything you want to add here?
398680	424940	14	A	0.93456	06:38	49	But actually, yes, I think I can remember that there will be a third symposium and it's cool that we have that yearly written for this type of activity and hopefully this event bring us and for people who will participate, new insights, connections, and ground for future developments.
427200	459320	15	A	0.67186	07:07	78	Cool. All right, just to summarize and update a few of the institute level programs. So volunteering at the institute, it's a way to engage. It is just making it that much easier to get involved with one or more projects and to start to get that recognition from the institute, understanding your contributions and also on your own resume or your own work history or your portfolio. Volunteering is really an incredible way to learn by doing.
459470	505530	16	B	0.99994	07:39	133	If you want to apply or learn about organizational active inference or if you want to think about communication as active inference education in the context of active inference gripper and the gripped if you want a perspective swap and see it multiple ways. Learning by doing on a project through volunteering, we hope, is a really unique opportunity. And what you do will and does really matter. So if you're taking notes on the margin of some paper or if you're developing lists that you felt like help your onboarding into active inference, you can make a leveraged contribution by sharing that kind of information. Or if you're not quite sure what type of contribution or the impact it would have, we can help find that kind of a niche for you.
506940	563240	17	B	1.0	08:26	141	The internship program is being a volunteer but wanting a little bit more structure around that. We have about 20 currently active interns from all around the world, different backgrounds, levels of technical familiarity with the active inference, ranging from truly some of the people who I believe are experts, to people who just found out about active inference and wanted to use this program to accelerate their learning a lot. Also in the last weeks and months I would like to commend the two individuals who know who they are who have completed their internship. This has really been a great honor to work with you, both of you, and to those who are still active, I look forward to seeing those updates and continuing to work with you. The internship consists of learning, doing and also mentorship and facilitation.
563400	598920	18	B	0.99986	09:23	91	So interns tend to participate in one or more course or textbook group or maybe help out with some live streams. Interns engage on projects and that is usually a minimum of two projects. One is hosted at the Institute. So some of the projects that we'll look at later in this roundtable but then also most of the interns have a personal or background research agenda. So sometimes they make very small contributions to an institute project but they're working really diligently on their dissertation or on their hobby project.
599070	611980	19	B	0.99981	09:59	35	Other times it's most of the contribution to the Institute project and then a little bit of self guided research and we try to provide our interns with support over multiple spatial and temporal scales.
614480	641030	20	B	0.99986	10:14	51	In terms of our engagement in the broader digital cyberphysical niche, we continue to grow on our different platforms and channels, though these are just proxy measures in our discord podcast, Twitter and YouTube as well as mailing lists. So we continue to communicate out to those who want to hear.
644360	696592	21	B	0.9958	10:44	122	Here's the big picture on Institute activities and you can find this information at the activities page that's listed here. At the top we have type of project publication live streams such as the one happening right now and the active inference journal which picks up when the live stream hits stop and transcribes and curates publishes that transcript which we'll talk more about. So live streams and journal are a great pair in the active block for instance project we continue to build the soft and hard skills associated with generative modeling in the active inference tradition. And so we use the complex Adaptive systems modeling framework Cadcad to implement different active inference generative models. This is a really great place.
696666	747620	22	B	0.66	11:36	119	A lot of discussions about modeling, robotics and embodied. JF Kotcher continues to offer his expertise and updates from this really incredible project where real Lego robots are implementing symbolic active inference. So thanks, JF, for hosting this project the way you do in the active inference ontology. We continue to refine and update the active inference ontology, which is the real language that we speak, whether it happens to be deployed in English or visually or in a programming language or however, the active inference ontology is how we're communicating and we develop that and offer it as a service to the niche. In this project, we have multiple ongoing learning groups which we'll talk more about soon.
747690	773020	23	B	0.99999	12:27	67	But we have a textbook group with Par et al. The 2022 active inference textbook. We have Sanjeev Namjoshi, who's writing a really incredible work that will be a textbook published as Fundamentals of Active Inference. And we're alpha testing along with Sanjiv and right there alongside him. So thanks, Sanjiv, for bringing this work in progress to the institute and to really sticking with the trouble.
773380	806200	24	B	0.99984	12:53	97	This is going to be an incredible product. And we have two courses, one on physics as information processing and one on active inference for the social sciences, which we'll address soon. And also multiple times per week in our discord, we have open discussions for education and research. So if this is all a lot or you're not sure about anything, probably the best way to just drop in and find out would be to check out when and how we're meeting and come to the open discussions. If you just want to see what's up.
806350	808520	25	B	0.99999	13:26	7	Anything you want to add there, Alex?
816660	861532	26	A	0.90289	13:36	85	Good to see that projects are active and mostly maybe for last period of time. It's having that new courses which we'll describe later, but having and feeling is growing. It provides great opportunities for second half of the year. So true, in the first quarterly roundtable, we had no courses, but as of now, we can say that there are two courses that are really pushing the frontier of education and even research in quantum information sciences and in social sciences. So thanks again.
861586	876100	27	B	0.99993	14:21	36	We'll get to those soon. All right, let's dive into a little more detail on active. So, Alex, would you like to first introduce and give a little thoughts on the active inference qualification system draft?
880430	967830	28	A	0.75146	14:40	143	Yeah, we put it here, like for now at education adjective scale, but future it will be applied for all institute structure and activities. We should have some cornerstone in terms of how we can measure effectiveness of our educational activities and educational services in the beginning, to understand courses and our materials, how we change actually someone's mind and how deep this mind need to be changed in some formal sense. And we not started from Greenfield. We just take one of stable system of qualifications level from European and adopt it for how we can see it in application to active inference and participations in projects and so on. And for now, we have a basic draft and we'll have discussions around with interested parties, different scales of institute, and finally have some stable form which will apply to different direction.
968730	993470	29	B	0.99954	16:08	60	Thanks. I'll just add a few notes on this first, just echoing your last point. If you're interested in active inference, professionalization education, qualification systems, even as a critic, we would really love to have you in the game. So please participate early, participate often. And I'll just highlight a few pieces of this system draft that are really exciting.
993890	1039440	30	B	0.99	16:33	95	First, it begins at level zero, which everybody de facto can have, perhaps even upon or before birth. Then, as the levels proceed, active inference is always being connected with domains and systems of interest. So it's about yes, and with active inference about connecting active inference to other fields and topics, understanding a different domain's ontology robotics or neuroscience or pure mathematics, whatever it may be. And working with active inference as you gain knowledge of the ontology and of the details of active inference. But it's not just a knowledge based qualification system.
1039890	1079686	31	B	1.0	17:19	100	We also are looking to integrate skills and even project responsibility and autonomy. So just to give kind of an example of this, levels one and two, again, currently very tentative drafts, so for your engagement. But in levels one and two, people are able to act as basic learners and collaborators and begin to get a grasp on what terms we're using in active inference and how do those concepts relate to their field of interest. And we see this every single day in the textbook group. And in discussions, someone says, oh, I'm working as a physical therapist.
1079798	1116520	32	B	1.0	17:59	75	And so in action, that's like the person moving their arm. That is where these levels are targeted. Level three begins to get into describing and understanding some of the technical details of what we do. Level four begins to approach the evaluation and recapitulation of technical models in active inference. Level five is related to comprehensive development and implementation, as well as in the projects and autonomy, exerting more supervision for self and others.
1117690	1153298	33	B	0.99999	18:37	78	Level six, developing advanced skills. Level seven, engaging with very specialized problem solving skills. And level eight, engaging in synthesis, evaluation and critical problem solving. So again, can't emphasize enough it's just a draft, and we are calling for your participation if this is something that you would be interested in using or engaging with. But we think this is going to be a really important direction for the active inference ecosystem carrying on to the textbook group.
1153464	1193040	34	B	0.84972	19:13	83	So in the active inference textbook group, we are working on and through the Par, Pazulo and Friston 2022 textbook. Currently we have cohort three working on the second half of the book and cohort four on the first half of the book. Together, these two cohorts compromise about 150 people. Not every person joins every meeting. Some people engage with the recordings asynchronously other people are in our shared epistemic niche, just gleaning and contributing to this kind of collaborative stigmaergic process.
1194450	1243326	35	B	0.99962	19:54	117	As educators, we're focused on the continual delivery and deployment of questions and enrichment and discourse in just some ways that this plays out. Here are, for example, questions that people have asked live or before or after a synchronous meeting where we can connect the specific figures and the ontology terms to people's uncertainties. And on the right is an example of an equation. Here's the variational free energy equation 2.5, and the way that we can use the ontology to unpack and connect some of the dots with these equations. And in the last few weeks, we've actually taken that even further and explored how to use language models through Coda AI in this process.
1243508	1295710	36	B	0.99853	20:43	118	So here we have Equations 2.1 and Equations 2.2. They are being rendered in Coda via typing in LaTech. And then we are using language models within Coda to provide explanations, contextualizations for different backgrounds and expertises, and also translation into different languages, describing the variables and the notation and the who, what and why. So this has been a pretty fun avenue and a really cool example of how language models and education can be hand in hand and empower our own learning by using all kinds of models to help us, where frankly, it can be quite challenging, which is in understanding some of the analytical details of the framework. Anything you want to add, Alex?
1298610	1327110	37	A	0.99997	21:38	40	This is that type of technology which looks like magic, but having in place ontology, which is nicely integrated for Coda again to all projects. It's really like an engine for this car which is getting more and more speed.
1329310	1391582	38	A	0.98977	22:09	115	Cool. Okay, in May 2023, we began our first course at the Institute, and that was Physics as Information Processing, being taught by one of the leading researchers in the area, Chris Fields, and with a Math PhD course assistant, Andre Agira. So Chris, thank you for stepping up again from the Scientific Advisory Board to offer this truly incredible and unique educational experience. We've had massive response, dozens of registrants who want to engage in the participatory discussions that happen in between your lectures, the second discussion being tomorrow for those who want to join, and 1500 views of the first lecture in a month. There's many people who are following along the course.
1391636	1420040	39	B	0.7172	23:11	65	Syllabus is explicit and innovative. We have a question and answer system so that people can ask questions asynchronously Chris then answers them. And we have them posted again through this interactive Coda interface. And that's really supporting an incredible level of discourse and participation. All transcripts are going to be curated and published along with the questions and answers and some other supplemental information.
1420650	1437660	40	B	0.99913	23:40	43	So this has been a really great experience and something new over the last few months. Anything you want to add, I'm tempted to just talk about how cool the quantum information free energy principle is. But perhaps now is not the moment.
1440750	1522086	41	A	0.99	24:00	123	For me historically, for my fault, the ground starting from beginning on this century, starting from It technology technologies and computer science and this notion of information processing. It always was like in engineering sense, like working field and working domain. But I always had that need and feeling for first principles and for physics in place. And for now, seeing that latest development on quantum information theory and how it nicely connects to free energy and active inference, it's really great to have these frontier curves in place in our activities. And really great thanks to Chris and ander and I believe that it's kind of starting point maybe ten years after we'll come back altogether and discuss how this course started.
1522268	1553220	42	A	0.99823	25:22	58	Great changes for different ecosystems. Thank you, Alex. Totally agree. And also we are fresh off the presses, happy to announce the second course that we'll be offering at the institute, which is Constructing Cultural Landscapes Active Inference for the Social Sciences. And this is going to be a multi teacher massively participatory course avel of Cairos Research.
1553670	1580358	43	B	0.99986	25:53	54	Thank you for taking the initiative to suggest even this possibility. And Ben and Mahault Lorena, thanks a lot for joining on for the journey. On July 7, we will begin and it will have some lecture sessions as well as participatory discussion sections. All sessions are free. They'll be live streamed and rewatchable.
1580454	1618230	44	B	0.88	26:20	95	The transcripts will be curated and published into a book at the end of the year. And this is going to be a really great on ramp and space for people with a humanities or social sciences background. So we've heard people waiting for such a thing. It was Avel's insight that such a course could be hosted at Cairos Research and at the Active Inference Institute. So thanks to all the teachers here and just really looking forward to how you tackle and engage with this question of active inference in the social sciences.
1619130	1620520	45	B	0.99991	26:59	5	Anything you want to add?
1623720	1674870	46	A	0.99661	27:03	91	Yeah, like these two different courses, like from different two distinct scales, like from quantum scale and social scale. And possibly it's like two different ends of spectrum in which we can work on with our research and education. It's great that this step to social sciences because it brings active inference and it's formal and first principles principled framework into the domain which haven't got it before and now it's a great begin also. And our scales between quantum and social will be on us to work on next years.
1677560	1719408	47	B	0.61354	27:57	82	Yes, and the kind of oroborous or horseshoe theory with quantum social sciences onto the live streams. So, lot to say, of course, a little bit meta since we're on a live stream right now. But I'll just note a few things. First, across our different series, we now have 336 completed or planned live streams. So most of those have already happened, but there are several that are planned, but we're over 300 completed and 336 as of now being planned.
1719584	1771190	48	B	0.97	28:39	107	And even just specifically looking at the next 30 days, we have just such a breadth and depth it's quite exciting to watch, let alone to enact. We'll have the Chris Fields course, a discussion section, a lecture and then another discussion section. We'll begin the active inference for the social sciences course with Avel Ben having contributions. We'll have a guest stream with professors from around the world, researchers, all these different topics being able to be slotted in with a really great way to platform and give visibility and catalyze discussion around these incredible researchers work. So it's really exciting and it would be great.
1771640	1819808	49	B	0.9998	29:31	129	Not going to say it's specifically a personal request, but if you choose to read it as such then great. It would be awesome to have more assistance with participating and preparing and enacting live streams. We have role based ways of planning and preparing and enacting live streams. So whether you want to play a more technical or operational or logistical role, if you want to be a conversational facilitator, if you want to do it in a different language, if you want to do a series, there's so many ways that you can get involved. But it would just be awesome to have more voices on the live stream and just be able to continue offering these kinds of resources at even faster rate with increased professionalization.
1819984	1865052	50	B	1.0	30:19	114	And I know that there's many people out there who would be incredible contributors to broadcast and or facilitate. Everyone is also welcome to self nominate or suggest or introduce somebody who you think would fit well on a stream. If it's like a perspective that we haven't heard from, that would be really important. There's a lot of background technical and educational work on the zero videos when we do a paper discussion. So if there's a paper that you want to have a million X leveraged contribution on your preparation around, if we discuss that in a live stream and you're able to help before with the zero, you'll be a co.
1865126	1900696	51	B	0.52634	31:05	93	Author on a research publication of the transcript and you'll have made an absolutely unique, irreplaceable contribution to active inference knowledge with what you did in your diligence in the zero. So for people who hear that calling, that's incredibly important. We invite people to share the live streams on social media or with their colleagues, however they find it relevant. Like if there's a topic or a person that has come up on our streams, sharing it where relevant will help bring people in. And also we have weekly live stream meetings.
1900728	1918580	52	B	0.99965	31:40	64	So if you just want to find out what we do and how we do it in the live streams, then I would recommend that you join the regular meetings. And if you really want to join but that time never works for you, then email and let us know that you're specifically interested. We'll find a different time. Any other comments there Alex?
1925280	1967130	53	A	0.77	32:05	74	For this moment, we can see that a lot of Livestream activity is happening with participation of people, not only with our own preparations, but with people who just want to share this and so on. And if we can keep this written to having different people with their interests and sharing ideas, and yes, if people will join to help us to do it more and more often, maybe it will be great.
1969200	2020988	54	B	0.99981	32:49	114	Thank you. The active inference journal picks up where live stream stops. The Active Inference Journal is engaged in continuous deployment and development of speech to text transcription, automated and manual editing, curation and finally publication. So just to give an example, a live stream will occur and then we use speech to text onto a public GitHub repository. Everybody can edit the markdown file and then we're able to publish those transcripts so that they can be citable, so that a conversation someone has can go onto their resume as a true citable publication and we can just facilitate the accessibility and the findability of these incredible conversations and moments that we have.
2021154	2081692	55	B	1.0	33:41	130	And also in the active inference journal. We're always developing the process from setup for those of all technical backgrounds. How to get things working on your own local setup or on a cloud setup using free and open source software where possible. The speech to text, the text processing the editing, translating into languages, rendering into a diversity of formats, publishing through different channels and then engaging in further analysis related to natural language processing and the active inference ontology all these fun things we can do. So if you in an alternate multiverse, we're a librarian or an editor or a reviewer or an advocate of the Active Inference corpus, bring it into this reality and make a huge contribution by cultivating our epistemic garden and our offerings.
2081836	2107610	56	B	1.0	34:41	55	Because there's so much enrichment that can happen with past streams and with proactively, letting the live stream project know and letting courses know how we can help them at the Journal to develop these kinds of publications that in new ways are expanding definitions of scholarship and research and service. Anything else to add?
2111420	2190480	57	A	0.85134	35:11	152	Yeah, as for this project, I believe it's like most technical heavy in the institute and maybe we can call it more broadly like language Processing project and maybe it is a good starting point for people who have good technical skills, some programming skills which are related to language processing in general or some specific part of it. Maybe it will be of interest for them to start from this project and later get better grasp on what is active influence is awesome. Totally agree. It's like seeing the range of live streams is really one of the best ways to just jump into understanding the ways and the topics that people speak. Okay, we'll just briefly mention the research work happening, but this last several month period has been extremely focused and extremely productive on education with the two new courses, the qualification system, all of these other curricular developments.
2191860	2258740	58	B	0.99993	36:31	150	So there's several ongoing research projects. We have the active inference ontology as a research and development initiative, active blockference as a software package for complex systems modeling using active inference robotics and embodied with JF's symbolic active inference robots. And then there's some project seeds that we always love to offer up to interns or to volunteers as something that they can restart and take a lot of initiative, something that's just planted but barely there. And that right now is the graphical interface with thinking really expansively about what it looks like to learn and apply active inference from an embodied perspective. And cognitive agent modeling, doing metaanalysis and synthesis across different cognitive modeling frameworks so that we can really have a place to point when we describe how different cognitive phenomena speaking to a cognitive pattern language are implemented or addressed by active inference and other frameworks.
2259080	2293940	59	B	1.0	37:39	79	And then there's the so many of you who engage in individual research. So there's a lot of research happening in the space, and we see education as a fundamental enablement for research as part of the institute's mission for education and research development. So it's been good times with research, and I'm really excited to see all the projects that people share during sessions start to develop and flourish. Anything else you want to add about research, Alex?
2298920	2357210	60	A	0.5925	38:18	104	Yeah, maybe this direction was not so active last time, but as we discussed for future directions, that we will bring more attention and more efforts to maybe formalize a bit how we as institute can survive people around from ecosystems, how we can support them on their ways and so on. So it will be good times here, too. Yeah, agreed. We want to provide a lot of research services, so for people who want to be on any side of that table, reach out. All right, well, the last section here is going to be a short active inference based presidential address.
2358220	2411988	61	B	0.83	39:18	139	I will be just speaking to some recent developments as well as past developments in the active inference space and just give a few thoughts on how they relate to the active inference institute and what we're all doing here. If you're watching live, please write some questions or comments into the live chat. And at the end of this short address, we will review any other comments or questions from those who are here live, give some last thoughts, and then we'll be back into the work. So I wanted to begin this address with a reference to the work that was before active inference institute, which was active inference lab. But even before active inference lab, there was the collaboration with Alex, Ivan, Alexandra, RJ, and myself around active inference and behavior engineering for teams and organizations.
2412164	2477468	62	B	1.0	40:12	132	And this was in. September 2020, only a few years ago, now more than two, but less than three years ago. And it's amazing how far things have come and at the same time how many of the topics that we were able to bring into this context of remote teams and organizations still ring as relevant and they're just gestured to here. We've gone far towards enacting and implementing and improving, but still we can think about cognitive entities engaged in the cyberphysical niche with narrative and rhetoric structuring their understanding of how sensory data translate into action. So for people who are interested in this topic, we invite you one way or another to engage with us on this journey because we are only going to do it all together.
2477554	2561930	63	B	0.99983	41:17	206	So I just wanted to begin with that kind of callback to several years ago, though so much has changed, certainly for all of us in the times between that when we really find first principles approaches like active inference and when we really care about systems of interest and communities, then the actions that we take, we don't regret. But I think we can go into a little bit more detail and reference some recent developments in the active inference ecosystem that speak to how day after day, week after week, our system of interest, active inference, learning and application really gifts or blesses us with new ways of thinking and new ways of acting. So for example, just within the last months, the inner screen model of consciousness was released as a preprint by Maxwell Ramstead et al. Dealing with all these topics that we know and love and building upon the quantum free energy principle formalism, which again, it's easy to forget, was not even in place two years ago. Discussed in Live stream number 40 and weeks after publication, we're able to enact a conversation hearing from voices all over the world, bringing experts and those with different backgrounds onto the screen.
2562540	2619704	64	B	0.55177	42:42	128	Here, the screen that you see is the classical information depository that enables us as quantum cognitive agents to engage with each other. And so all of these beautiful people on the stream who with their regime of attention and their quantum cognitive rotation brought to bear their attention and their language contribution through action, we are able to inscribe that on classical digital artifacts like live streams and transcripts and then provide it to the niche for all of you to rotate that into your own space and context. So again, the spatial, temporal and conceptual linkages are happening at a speed that is boggling. And on the right is a paper from just this month officially by Thomas Parr et al. Cognitive effort and active inference.
2619832	2689356	65	B	1.0	43:39	150	And I have the image small because there's more details to go into in the paper. However, they used a well known model of cognitive burden called a Stroop model, which shows a color written out as a word and that word is shown in some color. So the color red written in red, the color red written in blue, and the timing dynamics of people's reading behavior and recognition behavior is a proxy for cognitive effort. And so this is just one more, not even brick in the wall, not even just one tool in the toolkit, but like another lens or layer or ability or capacity for active inference framework which adds these features affect, memory, anticipation. All these different features are layered in like a symphony without developing Bloat, because the first principles kernel, the cognitive firmware, is not getting Bloated, it is staying at first principles.
2689388	2736130	66	B	1.0	44:49	102	And sometimes it feels like even diving down to zero with principles. While advanced research in the space is able to help us understand really sophisticated cognitive phenomena like cognitive effort, now one can look back through the previous stream and what we discussed and how could cognitive effort help us support the accessibility, rigor and applicability of active inference? It's such a natural question and again, week after week, our niche provides us with new ways of thinking and doing. So it's so fun to be gripping and gripped within active inference. I'd like to recognize and commend jacob's, excellent work.
2736820	2783360	67	B	0.9999	45:36	89	Just in April, we published Generalized Notation notation for active inference models. GNN generalized notation notation is a plain text format for conveying active inference generative models. It's something like a dialect of markdown and it brings us closer and closer to the triple play. The triple play is the idea that we should have integrity amongst multiple representations of active inference models. That is, what we see visualized graphically or tangibly what we hear and say in terms of the natural language use and with executable cognitive simulations.
2783780	2846710	68	B	0.58075	46:23	139	So if someone looks at an organizational flowchart and there's three A's connected to two B's, that is something that we can visualize, describe and execute so that there isn't a front and a back room conversation. Rather, there's an integrated conversation that allows for everybody to make contributions in the modalities and in the ways that they want. And the interlingua, not the only interlingua, and by no means its final version is the plain text generalized notation notation. We're having a lot of fun working with language models and visualizing this, transforming it into executable simulations. And so thanks again, Yakup, for the really creative and dedicated work because this method is going to be a real core functionality for translating across visual elements, our natural languages and the kinds of simulations that we want to run.
2847320	2890060	69	B	0.79	47:27	100	And I'll close with a recent publication with Karl Friston at all, including myself and Blue. So two out of three officers on the paper, not terrible. And in this paper we used free energy principle and active inference to provide something like a measuring or an observability framework for ecology, evolution and development or ecoevo devo. And the way that this was done is through the Renormalization group of physics. And so in this image on the left, we can see it as like maybe a bunch of cells which each contain organelles and those cells make a tissue.
2890220	2959092	70	B	0.99999	48:10	139	Or the big circle might be the population of organisms or the ecosystem community. Again, recognizing the nested niche engagement within and across levels of spatial and temporal modeling and looking at just two layers and how they're connected, we can think of that as a nested action perception cycle. So here's, like the sensory and the behavior of a worm, in this case, happening at whatever timescale it's being modeled at, and then at the slower or the deeper level of the hierarchical model, we have the Bayesian learning like process of the extended genotype happening in a slower adaptive layer. And so this should clearly connect to what we said at the very beginning of the stream about the institute as part of a nested system. Here we have the ecosystem, the space around here's, the institute.
2959156	3036804	71	B	0.99999	49:19	157	This is what it really means to enter and to join, not just to look into, but to be on or in the institute. And then the kinds of dynamic partitions that we're able to embody within the institute through our communications and through our actions. And so it's just so exciting to see everyone's incredible research contributions, the kinds of questions and developments that even if I were not an author, even if I were not in the active inference field, I would believe are at least the right things to be trying in terms of bringing theoretical integration in ecology, evolution and development. At least these are the right research avenues. But then again, to be able to act infer and serve through the institute as a multiscale evolutionary entity in and of itself, this kind of real time enactment of multiple scales and quantum reference frames is something that is only arising through cocreation.
3036952	3065770	72	B	0.99898	50:36	54	So in closing, I send my deepest appreciation to all those who support and care and engage. To those who are not sure, I welcome you to the past, the present and the future we respect and that's why we do what we do. So Alex, where do we go or what is next?
3069920	3112230	73	A	0.85437	51:09	62	Yeah, thank you very much for the talk and really providing that vision from the beginning and how it's going now and congratulations on that publication on evolutionary work. And it's a great opening direction and I believe this direction will make a next step into technical evolution also. And we will use this technique, evolution approach to develop institute candidacy system.
3114780	3145670	74	B	0.92226	51:54	85	Yes, I'll just wait a few more seconds. If anyone writes a question that we can address in the live chat, let's look at some of these questions that we look at at the end of every live stream. What would a good understanding enable? Well, if we were able to really understand our own generative model as the institute and as the active inference ecosystem, it would support our sense making and decision making. We'd be able to act and infer and serve better.
3146280	3171004	75	B	1.0	52:26	55	What are the unique predictions and implications? That's a very interesting question. I'm sure there are many ways to address this and we did have many future oriented expressions during this discussion, even today. What are the next steps for free energy principle and active inference? Again, do you have any thoughts on this one?
3171042	3173500	76	B	0.71	52:51	8	The middle question or the second question? Alex.
3177840	3221310	77	A	0.29277	52:57	68	Delivered and unique predictions and next steps depends on some specific field or domain for ourselves. We understand that active inference is a scale free approach and it can be applied to any scale of research. Any domain which any researcher or engineer is working on can be described with active inference language starting from where using accordances to computational modeling or types of modeling and so on.
3224230	3241960	78	A	0.9879	53:44	37	Yeah. What are the goals of the research? To embody our mission to support the active inference ecosystem, to be the best institute we can be, be the best nest mates within it. What do you think?
3245070	3266030	79	A	0.99061	54:05	34	Maybe we should remove goals. Let's change it to preferences. Yeah, at least. And considering it in open endedness way. Again, we can speak about goals, but looks like it's not so useful concept.
3266770	3315006	80	B	0.99999	54:26	100	Yes, sometimes when we're talking about the specific research papers, we talk about the goal of that paper, but goal is not to be found in the active inference ontology and we find ways of making do and thriving without needing to rest upon goals and reward. And that's really exciting. And that's something that a lot of people don't even realize that they're steeped in reward maximization and goal implementation until the open endedness and the vitality of active inference becomes understood. What are you still curious about? I'll let you go first, then I'll give a last thought.
3315028	3315920	81	B	0.99998	55:15	3	As we close.
3319750	3326690	82	A	0.99	55:19	14	I always remember our discussions about sense of the word curious in the beginning.
3329030	3365214	83	A	0.90974	55:29	52	It's like I believe more and more curious with week each day, each month. What our field, our frontier are showing us so much, a lot of different perspectives, different connections, real people in communications and projects and so on. So it's happiness. Very beautiful. I'm curious about many things like that.
3365252	3399610	84	B	1.0	56:05	88	You said that we develop and hone that curiosity every day and we seek to spark and be sparked when people come in from different backgrounds with their curiosities. It's inspiring, to say the least. And I'm really curious about who will have listened or read this far in the stream and choose that moment to take an action to get involved with the institute. So there's only one way that my uncertainty is going to be reduced about that. And I think if you know, you know.
3399760	3408140	85	B	0.96521	56:39	21	So. Thank you, Alex. Thank you, Blue. Thank you to the officers and to all of the institute. See you around.
3409230	3411020	86	A	0.9968	56:49	4	Thank you. Thank you.
