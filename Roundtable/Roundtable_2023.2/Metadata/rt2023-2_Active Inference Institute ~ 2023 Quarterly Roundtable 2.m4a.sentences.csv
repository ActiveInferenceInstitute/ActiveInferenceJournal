7500	8408	2	Daniel Friedman	0.98641	Hello everyone.
8494	14696	3	Daniel	0.99989	Welcome to the Active inference Institute quarterly roundtable number two in 2023.
14798	25480	4	Daniel	0.97349	It's June 30, 2023, and this is going to be our quarterly updates and ways that you can participate at the institute and in the active ecosystem.
25900	28756	5	Daniel	0.99759	So welcome to the active inference institute.
28868	34732	6	Daniel	0.90913	We're a participant battori online institute that is communicating, learning, and practicing applied active inference.
34796	47280	7	Daniel	1	You can find us at the links on this page and note that we'll be transitioning our emails over from activeinference@gmail.com towards Atactiveinference institute domains.
47640	53684	8	Daniel	0.99216	This is recorded in an archive Livestream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work.
53882	65096	9	Daniel	1	All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome, and we'll be following video etiquette for live streams today in the quarterly meeting number two of the year.
65278	75836	10	Daniel	0.86265	We'll start at the institute scale, give some updates at the institute level, and then we'll look a little bit deeper into primarily education, but also research.
76018	83276	11	Daniel	1	And then I'll have some closing thoughts by way of a presidential address about where we're at with active inference.
83388	91650	12	Daniel	1	And if you're watching live, please write comments and questions in the live chat and we will look to address those during.
94120	102580	13	Daniel	0.9782	Okay, so starting with the institute scale, some updates coming from the institute.
105000	111256	14	Daniel	0.98142	Here's one way that we can visualize the active inference institute in June 2023.
111438	121256	15	Daniel	0.99995	We are within the active inference ecosystem as well as within other ecosystems, and we have a nested structure.
121368	123630	16	Daniel	0.65197	Alex, would you like to describe this?
127820	139980	17	Alex Vyatkin	0.81961	Yeah, I think for these moments, it's great to see this structure and understand what is actually in place and working and acting and adapting.
140480	151036	18	Alex	0.6	And from very beginning we consider it from perspective of systems thinking and from perspective of active inference.
151068	162128	19	Alex	0.87631	We always think about some kind of nested and hierarchical structure which can be builded and structured accordingly.
162304	170536	20	Alex	0.83816	So having it right now embodied, it's great to see it totally agree.
170638	180248	21	Daniel	1	At the institute scale where these first updates are going to come from, we have the officers, the board of directors, and the scientific advisory board.
180414	187016	22	Daniel	0.99998	We have two organizational units which steward the development and support participation in projects.
187208	193464	23	Daniel	1	And projects and learning groups are really where it happens on the ground.
193512	195424	24	Daniel	0.99	And so we're going to talk a lot more about these.
195462	200960	25	Daniel	1	But this is the nesting and our own relationship with the ecosystem.
202180	208480	26	Daniel	0.99998	Another way to see this is in terms of people and positions at the institute.
208640	216272	27	Daniel	0.99959	So starting from the left, we have casual engagement with our products and services into the niche.
216336	220724	28	Daniel	0.99991	So this might be the very video that you're listening to or watching right now.
220762	223876	29	Daniel	0.99922	It could be the transcript of this video that you're reading.
223988	226340	30	Daniel	0.9994	It might be the active inference ontology.
226420	229028	31	Daniel	0.99958	It might be the active block, for instance, software package.
229124	233992	32	Daniel	0.92384	There's all these different open source products and services that we provide to the niche.
234136	246316	33	Daniel	0.98	And one moment you will decide to participate in a project or a learning group, and that can be more towards the learning, more towards the doing and leveraging your contributions at the institute.
246508	259440	34	Daniel	1	And some participants will choose to solidify their participation through volunteering or engaging with the internship program, both of which are new and really excitingly.
259520	268580	35	Daniel	0.79758	Developing well and then we haven't listed any names of the many of you who are in all of these different stages.
269340	279364	36	Daniel	1	And you may want to play another role or another position in the Institute, such as the Scientific Advisory Board, board of Directors or the officers.
279412	287900	37	Daniel	0.85063	So a lot of appreciation and thanks to everybody who's shown and not shown on this slide.
289280	295680	38	Daniel	0.6019	We are really appreciative of how you all show up for the institute.
296340	298450	39	Daniel	0.99782	Alex, want to add anything on that?
303940	318150	40	Alex	0.9877	Yeah, even from this slide, we can see that a lot of people already involved in activity and provide great insights and different perspective and backgrounds and experience.
319800	327450	41	Alex	0.99	And yes, a lot of people not shown here, but we know them through our community platforms and so on.
328300	337340	42	Alex	0.93812	So you can see this progress in terms of participation in activities and that's also great progress.
339840	341548	43	Daniel	0.96	All right, moving on.
341634	355372	44	Daniel	0.81128	We are excited that for our third applied active inference symposium to be held in August, we will have the theme of enacting ecosystems of shared intelligence, active inference as a cognitive kernel.
355516	361232	45	Daniel	0.99999	We have a really broad and global co organizer team, which is very exciting.
361296	368908	46	Daniel	0.98425	So thanks to everybody who's in the co organizing team for this symposium, we're just getting started on the organization.
369104	377960	47	Daniel	0.99966	So in the coming days and weeks, we'll be providing more information on participating in a more formal call for presenters.
379100	391710	48	Daniel	0.99991	However, if you're listening to this message now and you are really excited to do a presentation or a workshop or mentorship and be a part of the active inference ecosystem, then please reach out to us.
392080	393950	49	Daniel	0.99987	Alex, anything you want to add here?
398680	424940	50	Alex	0.93456	But actually, yes, I think I can remember that there will be a third symposium and it's cool that we have that yearly written for this type of activity and hopefully this event bring us and for people who will participate, new insights, connections, and ground for future developments.
427200	427950	51	Alex	0.67186	Cool.
428420	433772	52	Daniel	0.94	All right, just to summarize and update a few of the institute level programs.
433916	439152	53	Daniel	0.99137	So volunteering at the institute, it's a way to engage.
439296	454520	54	Daniel	0.99302	It is just making it that much easier to get involved with one or more projects and to start to get that recognition from the institute, understanding your contributions and also on your own resume or your own work history or your portfolio.
455180	459320	55	Daniel	0.85434	Volunteering is really an incredible way to learn by doing.
459470	474384	56	Daniel	0.99994	If you want to apply or learn about organizational active inference or if you want to think about communication as active inference education in the context of active inference gripper and the gripped if you want a perspective swap and see it multiple ways.
474582	479904	57	Daniel	0.99993	Learning by doing on a project through volunteering, we hope, is a really unique opportunity.
480102	484064	58	Daniel	0.63	And what you do will and does really matter.
484182	497430	59	Daniel	0.99996	So if you're taking notes on the margin of some paper or if you're developing lists that you felt like help your onboarding into active inference, you can make a leveraged contribution by sharing that kind of information.
497740	505530	60	Daniel	0.99992	Or if you're not quite sure what type of contribution or the impact it would have, we can help find that kind of a niche for you.
506940	514412	61	Daniel	1	The internship program is being a volunteer but wanting a little bit more structure around that.
514546	536150	62	Daniel	0.94796	We have about 20 currently active interns from all around the world, different backgrounds, levels of technical familiarity with the active inference, ranging from truly some of the people who I believe are experts, to people who just found out about active inference and wanted to use this program to accelerate their learning a lot.
537000	545984	63	Daniel	0.99997	Also in the last weeks and months I would like to commend the two individuals who know who they are who have completed their internship.
546112	557496	64	Daniel	0.99939	This has really been a great honor to work with you, both of you, and to those who are still active, I look forward to seeing those updates and continuing to work with you.
557598	563240	65	Daniel	1	The internship consists of learning, doing and also mentorship and facilitation.
563400	571580	66	Daniel	0.99986	So interns tend to participate in one or more course or textbook group or maybe help out with some live streams.
571920	578364	67	Daniel	0.86602	Interns engage on projects and that is usually a minimum of two projects.
578492	580332	68	Daniel	1	One is hosted at the Institute.
580396	589040	69	Daniel	0.99996	So some of the projects that we'll look at later in this roundtable but then also most of the interns have a personal or background research agenda.
589120	598920	70	Daniel	0.99992	So sometimes they make very small contributions to an institute project but they're working really diligently on their dissertation or on their hobby project.
599070	611980	71	Daniel	0.99981	Other times it's most of the contribution to the Institute project and then a little bit of self guided research and we try to provide our interns with support over multiple spatial and temporal scales.
614480	635984	72	Daniel	0.99986	In terms of our engagement in the broader digital cyberphysical niche, we continue to grow on our different platforms and channels, though these are just proxy measures in our discord podcast, Twitter and YouTube as well as mailing lists.
636112	641030	73	Daniel	0.99983	So we continue to communicate out to those who want to hear.
644360	654650	74	Daniel	0.9958	Here's the big picture on Institute activities and you can find this information at the activities page that's listed here.
655420	672416	75	Daniel	1	At the top we have type of project publication live streams such as the one happening right now and the active inference journal which picks up when the live stream hits stop and transcribes and curates publishes that transcript which we'll talk more about.
672598	686432	76	Daniel	0.99986	So live streams and journal are a great pair in the active block for instance project we continue to build the soft and hard skills associated with generative modeling in the active inference tradition.
686576	694736	77	Daniel	0.78	And so we use the complex Adaptive systems modeling framework Cadcad to implement different active inference generative models.
694848	696592	78	Daniel	0.99998	This is a really great place.
696666	701620	79	Daniel	0.66	A lot of discussions about modeling, robotics and embodied.
701780	714072	80	Daniel	0.93372	JF Kotcher continues to offer his expertise and updates from this really incredible project where real Lego robots are implementing symbolic active inference.
714136	720808	81	Daniel	0.99965	So thanks, JF, for hosting this project the way you do in the active inference ontology.
720984	741680	82	Daniel	0.99996	We continue to refine and update the active inference ontology, which is the real language that we speak, whether it happens to be deployed in English or visually or in a programming language or however, the active inference ontology is how we're communicating and we develop that and offer it as a service to the niche.
741760	747620	83	Daniel	0.99998	In this project, we have multiple ongoing learning groups which we'll talk more about soon.
747690	750008	84	Daniel	0.99999	But we have a textbook group with Par et al.
750094	752660	85	Daniel	1	The 2022 active inference textbook.
752820	761556	86	Daniel	1	We have Sanjeev Namjoshi, who's writing a really incredible work that will be a textbook published as Fundamentals of Active Inference.
761668	766444	87	Daniel	1	And we're alpha testing along with Sanjiv and right there alongside him.
766482	773020	88	Daniel	0.99935	So thanks, Sanjiv, for bringing this work in progress to the institute and to really sticking with the trouble.
773380	775570	89	Daniel	0.99984	This is going to be an incredible product.
776340	784832	90	Daniel	1	And we have two courses, one on physics as information processing and one on active inference for the social sciences, which we'll address soon.
784966	791700	91	Daniel	0.56	And also multiple times per week in our discord, we have open discussions for education and research.
791850	803364	92	Daniel	0.99964	So if this is all a lot or you're not sure about anything, probably the best way to just drop in and find out would be to check out when and how we're meeting and come to the open discussions.
803412	806200	93	Daniel	0.99999	If you just want to see what's up.
806350	808520	94	Daniel	0.99999	Anything you want to add there, Alex?
816660	825060	95	Alex	0.90289	Good to see that projects are active and mostly maybe for last period of time.
825130	833860	96	Alex	0.67432	It's having that new courses which we'll describe later, but having and feeling is growing.
834600	841050	97	Alex	0.6542	It provides great opportunities for second half of the year.
841900	859448	98	Daniel	0.99987	So true, in the first quarterly roundtable, we had no courses, but as of now, we can say that there are two courses that are really pushing the frontier of education and even research in quantum information sciences and in social sciences.
859624	861532	99	Daniel	0.99881	So thanks again.
861586	863170	100	Daniel	0.99993	We'll get to those soon.
863700	867644	101	Daniel	0.95	All right, let's dive into a little more detail on active.
867772	876100	102	Daniel	0.99974	So, Alex, would you like to first introduce and give a little thoughts on the active inference qualification system draft?
880430	895322	103	Alex	0.75146	Yeah, we put it here, like for now at education adjective scale, but future it will be applied for all institute structure and activities.
895466	927420	104	Alex	0.99992	We should have some cornerstone in terms of how we can measure effectiveness of our educational activities and educational services in the beginning, to understand courses and our materials, how we change actually someone's mind and how deep this mind need to be changed in some formal sense.
928030	933094	105	Alex	1	And we not started from Greenfield.
933222	950480	106	Alex	0.70717	We just take one of stable system of qualifications level from European and adopt it for how we can see it in application to active inference and participations in projects and so on.
950930	967830	107	Alex	1	And for now, we have a basic draft and we'll have discussions around with interested parties, different scales of institute, and finally have some stable form which will apply to different direction.
968730	969480	108	Daniel	0.99954	Thanks.
970090	973862	109	Daniel	0.59373	I'll just add a few notes on this first, just echoing your last point.
973916	984026	110	Daniel	1	If you're interested in active inference, professionalization education, qualification systems, even as a critic, we would really love to have you in the game.
984128	987130	111	Daniel	0.99999	So please participate early, participate often.
987280	993470	112	Daniel	1	And I'll just highlight a few pieces of this system draft that are really exciting.
993890	1002530	113	Daniel	0.99	First, it begins at level zero, which everybody de facto can have, perhaps even upon or before birth.
1003270	1010978	114	Daniel	0.99999	Then, as the levels proceed, active inference is always being connected with domains and systems of interest.
1011144	1026658	115	Daniel	0.99998	So it's about yes, and with active inference about connecting active inference to other fields and topics, understanding a different domain's ontology robotics or neuroscience or pure mathematics, whatever it may be.
1026844	1035590	116	Daniel	1	And working with active inference as you gain knowledge of the ontology and of the details of active inference.
1035670	1039440	117	Daniel	1	But it's not just a knowledge based qualification system.
1039890	1047770	118	Daniel	1	We also are looking to integrate skills and even project responsibility and autonomy.
1047930	1057614	119	Daniel	0.99962	So just to give kind of an example of this, levels one and two, again, currently very tentative drafts, so for your engagement.
1057662	1071990	120	Daniel	1	But in levels one and two, people are able to act as basic learners and collaborators and begin to get a grasp on what terms we're using in active inference and how do those concepts relate to their field of interest.
1072060	1075414	121	Daniel	1	And we see this every single day in the textbook group.
1075452	1079686	122	Daniel	1	And in discussions, someone says, oh, I'm working as a physical therapist.
1079798	1082822	123	Daniel	1	And so in action, that's like the person moving their arm.
1082966	1086570	124	Daniel	1	That is where these levels are targeted.
1086910	1093520	125	Daniel	1	Level three begins to get into describing and understanding some of the technical details of what we do.
1094130	1102930	126	Daniel	0.99998	Level four begins to approach the evaluation and recapitulation of technical models in active inference.
1103910	1116520	127	Daniel	1	Level five is related to comprehensive development and implementation, as well as in the projects and autonomy, exerting more supervision for self and others.
1117690	1121510	128	Daniel	0.99999	Level six, developing advanced skills.
1121850	1126702	129	Daniel	0.99997	Level seven, engaging with very specialized problem solving skills.
1126866	1133238	130	Daniel	0.81	And level eight, engaging in synthesis, evaluation and critical problem solving.
1133334	1144254	131	Daniel	0.99985	So again, can't emphasize enough it's just a draft, and we are calling for your participation if this is something that you would be interested in using or engaging with.
1144372	1153298	132	Daniel	0.68811	But we think this is going to be a really important direction for the active inference ecosystem carrying on to the textbook group.
1153464	1163326	133	Daniel	0.84972	So in the active inference textbook group, we are working on and through the Par, Pazulo and Friston 2022 textbook.
1163518	1172360	134	Daniel	0.99998	Currently we have cohort three working on the second half of the book and cohort four on the first half of the book.
1172730	1177100	135	Daniel	1	Together, these two cohorts compromise about 150 people.
1177630	1179910	136	Daniel	0.99936	Not every person joins every meeting.
1180070	1193040	137	Daniel	0.99999	Some people engage with the recordings asynchronously other people are in our shared epistemic niche, just gleaning and contributing to this kind of collaborative stigmaergic process.
1194450	1205298	138	Daniel	0.99962	As educators, we're focused on the continual delivery and deployment of questions and enrichment and discourse in just some ways that this plays out.
1205464	1217990	139	Daniel	0.99999	Here are, for example, questions that people have asked live or before or after a synchronous meeting where we can connect the specific figures and the ontology terms to people's uncertainties.
1218490	1223586	140	Daniel	1	And on the right is an example of an equation.
1223698	1234406	141	Daniel	0.99977	Here's the variational free energy equation 2.5, and the way that we can use the ontology to unpack and connect some of the dots with these equations.
1234518	1243326	142	Daniel	1	And in the last few weeks, we've actually taken that even further and explored how to use language models through Coda AI in this process.
1243508	1248160	143	Daniel	0.99853	So here we have Equations 2.1 and Equations 2.2.
1248530	1254798	144	Daniel	0.99999	They are being rendered in Coda via typing in LaTech.
1254974	1273094	145	Daniel	1	And then we are using language models within Coda to provide explanations, contextualizations for different backgrounds and expertises, and also translation into different languages, describing the variables and the notation and the who, what and why.
1273212	1293962	146	Daniel	0.99998	So this has been a pretty fun avenue and a really cool example of how language models and education can be hand in hand and empower our own learning by using all kinds of models to help us, where frankly, it can be quite challenging, which is in understanding some of the analytical details of the framework.
1294106	1295710	147	Daniel	0.99999	Anything you want to add, Alex?
1298610	1316814	148	Alex	0.99997	This is that type of technology which looks like magic, but having in place ontology, which is nicely integrated for Coda again to all projects.
1316942	1327110	149	Alex	0.97232	It's really like an engine for this car which is getting more and more speed.
1329310	1330060	150	Alex	0.98977	Cool.
1331630	1354878	151	Daniel	0.99077	Okay, in May 2023, we began our first course at the Institute, and that was Physics as Information Processing, being taught by one of the leading researchers in the area, Chris Fields, and with a Math PhD course assistant, Andre Agira.
1354974	1366440	152	Daniel	0.99794	So Chris, thank you for stepping up again from the Scientific Advisory Board to offer this truly incredible and unique educational experience.
1367130	1388474	153	Daniel	0.99924	We've had massive response, dozens of registrants who want to engage in the participatory discussions that happen in between your lectures, the second discussion being tomorrow for those who want to join, and 1500 views of the first lecture in a month.
1388512	1391582	154	Daniel	0.99264	There's many people who are following along the course.
1391636	1394830	155	Daniel	0.7172	Syllabus is explicit and innovative.
1395330	1402834	156	Daniel	0.99998	We have a question and answer system so that people can ask questions asynchronously Chris then answers them.
1402872	1406926	157	Daniel	1	And we have them posted again through this interactive Coda interface.
1407038	1411726	158	Daniel	1	And that's really supporting an incredible level of discourse and participation.
1411918	1420040	159	Daniel	0.75	All transcripts are going to be curated and published along with the questions and answers and some other supplemental information.
1420650	1425960	160	Daniel	0.99913	So this has been a really great experience and something new over the last few months.
1427390	1435306	161	Daniel	0.99884	Anything you want to add, I'm tempted to just talk about how cool the quantum information free energy principle is.
1435408	1437660	162	Daniel	0.98852	But perhaps now is not the moment.
1440750	1459890	163	Alex	0.99	For me historically, for my fault, the ground starting from beginning on this century, starting from It technology technologies and computer science and this notion of information processing.
1461830	1470870	164	Alex	0.99888	It always was like in engineering sense, like working field and working domain.
1472490	1480700	165	Alex	0.99998	But I always had that need and feeling for first principles and for physics in place.
1481070	1502798	166	Alex	1	And for now, seeing that latest development on quantum information theory and how it nicely connects to free energy and active inference, it's really great to have these frontier curves in place in our activities.
1502894	1522086	167	Alex	0.8	And really great thanks to Chris and ander and I believe that it's kind of starting point maybe ten years after we'll come back altogether and discuss how this course started.
1522268	1526070	168	Alex	0.99823	Great changes for different ecosystems.
1527470	1528294	169	Daniel	0.9992	Thank you, Alex.
1528342	1529260	170	Daniel	0.99697	Totally agree.
1529950	1544170	171	Daniel	1	And also we are fresh off the presses, happy to announce the second course that we'll be offering at the institute, which is Constructing Cultural Landscapes Active Inference for the Social Sciences.
1544330	1553220	172	Daniel	0.99	And this is going to be a multi teacher massively participatory course avel of Cairos Research.
1553670	1559250	173	Daniel	0.99986	Thank you for taking the initiative to suggest even this possibility.
1559670	1565058	174	Daniel	0.5	And Ben and Mahault Lorena, thanks a lot for joining on for the journey.
1565234	1574642	175	Daniel	1	On July 7, we will begin and it will have some lecture sessions as well as participatory discussion sections.
1574786	1578006	176	Daniel	1	All sessions are free.
1578188	1580358	177	Daniel	0.87831	They'll be live streamed and rewatchable.
1580454	1585146	178	Daniel	0.88	The transcripts will be curated and published into a book at the end of the year.
1585328	1593354	179	Daniel	1	And this is going to be a really great on ramp and space for people with a humanities or social sciences background.
1593482	1597918	180	Daniel	0.99851	So we've heard people waiting for such a thing.
1598084	1607150	181	Daniel	0.99971	It was Avel's insight that such a course could be hosted at Cairos Research and at the Active Inference Institute.
1607230	1618230	182	Daniel	0.99922	So thanks to all the teachers here and just really looking forward to how you tackle and engage with this question of active inference in the social sciences.
1619130	1620520	183	Daniel	0.99991	Anything you want to add?
1623720	1634612	184	Alex	0.99661	Yeah, like these two different courses, like from different two distinct scales, like from quantum scale and social scale.
1634756	1642590	185	Alex	1	And possibly it's like two different ends of spectrum in which we can work on with our research and education.
1643840	1665732	186	Alex	0.76873	It's great that this step to social sciences because it brings active inference and it's formal and first principles principled framework into the domain which haven't got it before and now it's a great begin also.
1665866	1674870	187	Alex	1	And our scales between quantum and social will be on us to work on next years.
1677560	1689396	188	Daniel	0.61354	Yes, and the kind of oroborous or horseshoe theory with quantum social sciences onto the live streams.
1689508	1694332	189	Daniel	0.51719	So, lot to say, of course, a little bit meta since we're on a live stream right now.
1694466	1696830	190	Daniel	0.99996	But I'll just note a few things.
1697680	1708828	191	Daniel	1	First, across our different series, we now have 336 completed or planned live streams.
1709004	1719408	192	Daniel	0.99895	So most of those have already happened, but there are several that are planned, but we're over 300 completed and 336 as of now being planned.
1719584	1732180	193	Daniel	0.97	And even just specifically looking at the next 30 days, we have just such a breadth and depth it's quite exciting to watch, let alone to enact.
1732340	1739044	194	Daniel	0.89324	We'll have the Chris Fields course, a discussion section, a lecture and then another discussion section.
1739172	1747112	195	Daniel	0.9947	We'll begin the active inference for the social sciences course with Avel Ben having contributions.
1747256	1766820	196	Daniel	0.9827	We'll have a guest stream with professors from around the world, researchers, all these different topics being able to be slotted in with a really great way to platform and give visibility and catalyze discussion around these incredible researchers work.
1766970	1771190	197	Daniel	0.99986	So it's really exciting and it would be great.
1771640	1777830	198	Daniel	0.9998	Not going to say it's specifically a personal request, but if you choose to read it as such then great.
1778140	1785588	199	Daniel	0.52401	It would be awesome to have more assistance with participating and preparing and enacting live streams.
1785764	1791556	200	Daniel	0.99993	We have role based ways of planning and preparing and enacting live streams.
1791668	1804284	201	Daniel	0.99995	So whether you want to play a more technical or operational or logistical role, if you want to be a conversational facilitator, if you want to do it in a different language, if you want to do a series, there's so many ways that you can get involved.
1804412	1819808	202	Daniel	0.99997	But it would just be awesome to have more voices on the live stream and just be able to continue offering these kinds of resources at even faster rate with increased professionalization.
1819984	1828500	203	Daniel	1	And I know that there's many people out there who would be incredible contributors to broadcast and or facilitate.
1828840	1835556	204	Daniel	0.99999	Everyone is also welcome to self nominate or suggest or introduce somebody who you think would fit well on a stream.
1835588	1839770	205	Daniel	0.76032	If it's like a perspective that we haven't heard from, that would be really important.
1840300	1848744	206	Daniel	0.99995	There's a lot of background technical and educational work on the zero videos when we do a paper discussion.
1848872	1865052	207	Daniel	0.98814	So if there's a paper that you want to have a million X leveraged contribution on your preparation around, if we discuss that in a live stream and you're able to help before with the zero, you'll be a co.
1865126	1878340	208	Daniel	0.52634	Author on a research publication of the transcript and you'll have made an absolutely unique, irreplaceable contribution to active inference knowledge with what you did in your diligence in the zero.
1878490	1881850	209	Daniel	0.99998	So for people who hear that calling, that's incredibly important.
1882460	1889076	210	Daniel	0.54361	We invite people to share the live streams on social media or with their colleagues, however they find it relevant.
1889108	1897708	211	Daniel	0.99966	Like if there's a topic or a person that has come up on our streams, sharing it where relevant will help bring people in.
1897874	1900696	212	Daniel	1	And also we have weekly live stream meetings.
1900728	1908204	213	Daniel	0.99965	So if you just want to find out what we do and how we do it in the live streams, then I would recommend that you join the regular meetings.
1908332	1914832	214	Daniel	1	And if you really want to join but that time never works for you, then email and let us know that you're specifically interested.
1914966	1916516	215	Daniel	0.99176	We'll find a different time.
1916698	1918580	216	Daniel	0.72745	Any other comments there Alex?
1925280	1946470	217	Alex	0.77	For this moment, we can see that a lot of Livestream activity is happening with participation of people, not only with our own preparations, but with people who just want to share this and so on.
1946840	1967130	218	Alex	0.93	And if we can keep this written to having different people with their interests and sharing ideas, and yes, if people will join to help us to do it more and more often, maybe it will be great.
1969200	1970190	219	Daniel	0.99981	Thank you.
1972080	1977260	220	Daniel	1	The active inference journal picks up where live stream stops.
1977600	1990124	221	Daniel	1	The Active Inference Journal is engaged in continuous deployment and development of speech to text transcription, automated and manual editing, curation and finally publication.
1990252	1998848	222	Daniel	0.99995	So just to give an example, a live stream will occur and then we use speech to text onto a public GitHub repository.
1998944	2020988	223	Daniel	0.99987	Everybody can edit the markdown file and then we're able to publish those transcripts so that they can be citable, so that a conversation someone has can go onto their resume as a true citable publication and we can just facilitate the accessibility and the findability of these incredible conversations and moments that we have.
2021154	2023336	224	Daniel	1	And also in the active inference journal.
2023368	2029304	225	Daniel	0.99145	We're always developing the process from setup for those of all technical backgrounds.
2029432	2037890	226	Daniel	0.99999	How to get things working on your own local setup or on a cloud setup using free and open source software where possible.
2038660	2059480	227	Daniel	1	The speech to text, the text processing the editing, translating into languages, rendering into a diversity of formats, publishing through different channels and then engaging in further analysis related to natural language processing and the active inference ontology all these fun things we can do.
2059550	2081692	228	Daniel	0.99949	So if you in an alternate multiverse, we're a librarian or an editor or a reviewer or an advocate of the Active Inference corpus, bring it into this reality and make a huge contribution by cultivating our epistemic garden and our offerings.
2081836	2104550	229	Daniel	1	Because there's so much enrichment that can happen with past streams and with proactively, letting the live stream project know and letting courses know how we can help them at the Journal to develop these kinds of publications that in new ways are expanding definitions of scholarship and research and service.
2106220	2107610	230	Daniel	0.99981	Anything else to add?
2111420	2144230	231	Alex	0.85134	Yeah, as for this project, I believe it's like most technical heavy in the institute and maybe we can call it more broadly like language Processing project and maybe it is a good starting point for people who have good technical skills, some programming skills which are related to language processing in general or some specific part of it.
2145960	2157688	232	Alex	0.99997	Maybe it will be of interest for them to start from this project and later get better grasp on what is active influence is awesome.
2157774	2158712	233	Daniel	0.98259	Totally agree.
2158846	2170430	234	Daniel	0.99478	It's like seeing the range of live streams is really one of the best ways to just jump into understanding the ways and the topics that people speak.
2171120	2190480	235	Daniel	0.99707	Okay, we'll just briefly mention the research work happening, but this last several month period has been extremely focused and extremely productive on education with the two new courses, the qualification system, all of these other curricular developments.
2191860	2194880	236	Daniel	0.99993	So there's several ongoing research projects.
2195040	2212132	237	Daniel	0.99982	We have the active inference ontology as a research and development initiative, active blockference as a software package for complex systems modeling using active inference robotics and embodied with JF's symbolic active inference robots.
2212276	2226188	238	Daniel	0.77	And then there's some project seeds that we always love to offer up to interns or to volunteers as something that they can restart and take a lot of initiative, something that's just planted but barely there.
2226354	2236960	239	Daniel	0.99	And that right now is the graphical interface with thinking really expansively about what it looks like to learn and apply active inference from an embodied perspective.
2237300	2258740	240	Daniel	1	And cognitive agent modeling, doing metaanalysis and synthesis across different cognitive modeling frameworks so that we can really have a place to point when we describe how different cognitive phenomena speaking to a cognitive pattern language are implemented or addressed by active inference and other frameworks.
2259080	2264248	241	Daniel	1	And then there's the so many of you who engage in individual research.
2264414	2277256	242	Daniel	0.99993	So there's a lot of research happening in the space, and we see education as a fundamental enablement for research as part of the institute's mission for education and research development.
2277368	2291040	243	Daniel	0.99987	So it's been good times with research, and I'm really excited to see all the projects that people share during sessions start to develop and flourish.
2291380	2293940	244	Daniel	1	Anything else you want to add about research, Alex?
2298920	2330492	245	Alex	0.5925	Yeah, maybe this direction was not so active last time, but as we discussed for future directions, that we will bring more attention and more efforts to maybe formalize a bit how we as institute can survive people around from ecosystems, how we can support them on their ways and so on.
2330546	2335470	246	Alex	0.57784	So it will be good times here, too.
2335940	2337356	247	Daniel	0.99814	Yeah, agreed.
2337468	2346310	248	Daniel	0.82372	We want to provide a lot of research services, so for people who want to be on any side of that table, reach out.
2347160	2357210	249	Daniel	0.89	All right, well, the last section here is going to be a short active inference based presidential address.
2358220	2370830	250	Daniel	0.83	I will be just speaking to some recent developments as well as past developments in the active inference space and just give a few thoughts on how they relate to the active inference institute and what we're all doing here.
2371760	2377016	251	Daniel	0.99927	If you're watching live, please write some questions or comments into the live chat.
2377048	2389088	252	Daniel	1	And at the end of this short address, we will review any other comments or questions from those who are here live, give some last thoughts, and then we'll be back into the work.
2389254	2400100	253	Daniel	0.99722	So I wanted to begin this address with a reference to the work that was before active inference institute, which was active inference lab.
2400170	2411988	254	Daniel	0.99999	But even before active inference lab, there was the collaboration with Alex, Ivan, Alexandra, RJ, and myself around active inference and behavior engineering for teams and organizations.
2412164	2413576	255	Daniel	1	And this was in.
2413598	2421230	256	Daniel	0.98	September 2020, only a few years ago, now more than two, but less than three years ago.
2421760	2444516	257	Daniel	1	And it's amazing how far things have come and at the same time how many of the topics that we were able to bring into this context of remote teams and organizations still ring as relevant and they're just gestured to here.
2444698	2465540	258	Daniel	0.97725	We've gone far towards enacting and implementing and improving, but still we can think about cognitive entities engaged in the cyberphysical niche with narrative and rhetoric structuring their understanding of how sensory data translate into action.
2465700	2477468	259	Daniel	0.99957	So for people who are interested in this topic, we invite you one way or another to engage with us on this journey because we are only going to do it all together.
2477554	2499220	260	Daniel	0.99983	So I just wanted to begin with that kind of callback to several years ago, though so much has changed, certainly for all of us in the times between that when we really find first principles approaches like active inference and when we really care about systems of interest and communities, then the actions that we take, we don't regret.
2500040	2522088	261	Daniel	0.99998	But I think we can go into a little bit more detail and reference some recent developments in the active inference ecosystem that speak to how day after day, week after week, our system of interest, active inference, learning and application really gifts or blesses us with new ways of thinking and new ways of acting.
2522184	2532110	262	Daniel	0.99994	So for example, just within the last months, the inner screen model of consciousness was released as a preprint by Maxwell Ramstead et al.
2532500	2544628	263	Daniel	0.99966	Dealing with all these topics that we know and love and building upon the quantum free energy principle formalism, which again, it's easy to forget, was not even in place two years ago.
2544794	2561930	264	Daniel	0.9996	Discussed in Live stream number 40 and weeks after publication, we're able to enact a conversation hearing from voices all over the world, bringing experts and those with different backgrounds onto the screen.
2562540	2573052	265	Daniel	0.55177	Here, the screen that you see is the classical information depository that enables us as quantum cognitive agents to engage with each other.
2573186	2602448	266	Daniel	1	And so all of these beautiful people on the stream who with their regime of attention and their quantum cognitive rotation brought to bear their attention and their language contribution through action, we are able to inscribe that on classical digital artifacts like live streams and transcripts and then provide it to the niche for all of you to rotate that into your own space and context.
2602624	2610520	267	Daniel	0.99996	So again, the spatial, temporal and conceptual linkages are happening at a speed that is boggling.
2610940	2617540	268	Daniel	1	And on the right is a paper from just this month officially by Thomas Parr et al.
2617630	2619704	269	Daniel	0.71959	Cognitive effort and active inference.
2619832	2624604	270	Daniel	1	And I have the image small because there's more details to go into in the paper.
2624802	2639680	271	Daniel	1	However, they used a well known model of cognitive burden called a Stroop model, which shows a color written out as a word and that word is shown in some color.
2639750	2652000	272	Daniel	0.99999	So the color red written in red, the color red written in blue, and the timing dynamics of people's reading behavior and recognition behavior is a proxy for cognitive effort.
2652160	2673384	273	Daniel	1	And so this is just one more, not even brick in the wall, not even just one tool in the toolkit, but like another lens or layer or ability or capacity for active inference framework which adds these features affect, memory, anticipation.
2673512	2689356	274	Daniel	1	All these different features are layered in like a symphony without developing Bloat, because the first principles kernel, the cognitive firmware, is not getting Bloated, it is staying at first principles.
2689388	2692960	275	Daniel	1	And sometimes it feels like even diving down to zero with principles.
2693560	2715844	276	Daniel	0.99989	While advanced research in the space is able to help us understand really sophisticated cognitive phenomena like cognitive effort, now one can look back through the previous stream and what we discussed and how could cognitive effort help us support the accessibility, rigor and applicability of active inference?
2715972	2723516	277	Daniel	0.94771	It's such a natural question and again, week after week, our niche provides us with new ways of thinking and doing.
2723618	2729500	278	Daniel	0.99981	So it's so fun to be gripping and gripped within active inference.
2731460	2736130	279	Daniel	0.99882	I'd like to recognize and commend jacob's, excellent work.
2736820	2743380	280	Daniel	0.9999	Just in April, we published Generalized Notation notation for active inference models.
2744040	2751648	281	Daniel	0.45016	GNN generalized notation notation is a plain text format for conveying active inference generative models.
2751744	2758920	282	Daniel	0.93987	It's something like a dialect of markdown and it brings us closer and closer to the triple play.
2759070	2768080	283	Daniel	1	The triple play is the idea that we should have integrity amongst multiple representations of active inference models.
2768260	2783360	284	Daniel	0.67747	That is, what we see visualized graphically or tangibly what we hear and say in terms of the natural language use and with executable cognitive simulations.
2783780	2799120	285	Daniel	0.58075	So if someone looks at an organizational flowchart and there's three A's connected to two B's, that is something that we can visualize, describe and execute so that there isn't a front and a back room conversation.
2799280	2807464	286	Daniel	0.99993	Rather, there's an integrated conversation that allows for everybody to make contributions in the modalities and in the ways that they want.
2807582	2817492	287	Daniel	0.75	And the interlingua, not the only interlingua, and by no means its final version is the plain text generalized notation notation.
2817636	2824424	288	Daniel	0.96312	We're having a lot of fun working with language models and visualizing this, transforming it into executable simulations.
2824552	2846710	289	Daniel	0.61	And so thanks again, Yakup, for the really creative and dedicated work because this method is going to be a real core functionality for translating across visual elements, our natural languages and the kinds of simulations that we want to run.
2847320	2855860	290	Daniel	0.79	And I'll close with a recent publication with Karl Friston et al., including myself and Bleu.
2855940	2859320	291	Daniel	0.99622	So two out of three officers on the paper, not terrible.
2859900	2875464	292	Daniel	1	And in this paper we used free energy principle and active inference to provide something like a measuring or an observability framework for ecology, evolution and development or ecoevo devo.
2875592	2880552	293	Daniel	0.51	And the way that this was done is through the Renormalization group of physics.
2880616	2890060	294	Daniel	0.93	And so in this image on the left, we can see it as like maybe a bunch of cells which each contain organelles and those cells make a tissue.
2890220	2897476	295	Daniel	0.99999	Or the big circle might be the population of organisms or the ecosystem community.
2897658	2918048	296	Daniel	0.99995	Again, recognizing the nested niche engagement within and across levels of spatial and temporal modeling and looking at just two layers and how they're connected, we can think of that as a nested action perception cycle.
2918244	2940444	297	Daniel	0.9989	So here's, like the sensory and the behavior of a worm, in this case, happening at whatever timescale it's being modeled at, and then at the slower or the deeper level of the hierarchical model, we have the Bayesian learning like process of the extended genotype happening in a slower adaptive layer.
2940572	2953030	298	Daniel	0.86	And so this should clearly connect to what we said at the very beginning of the stream about the institute as part of a nested system.
2953800	2959092	299	Daniel	1	Here we have the ecosystem, the space around here's, the institute.
2959156	2968700	300	Daniel	0.99999	This is what it really means to enter and to join, not just to look into, but to be on or in the institute.
2969200	2980068	301	Daniel	1	And then the kinds of dynamic partitions that we're able to embody within the institute through our communications and through our actions.
2980264	3008980	302	Daniel	1	And so it's just so exciting to see everyone's incredible research contributions, the kinds of questions and developments that even if I were not an author, even if I were not in the active inference field, I would believe are at least the right things to be trying in terms of bringing theoretical integration in ecology, evolution and development.
3009140	3011860	303	Daniel	1	At least these are the right research avenues.
3012020	3036804	304	Daniel	1	But then again, to be able to act infer and serve through the institute as a multiscale evolutionary entity in and of itself, this kind of real time enactment of multiple scales and quantum reference frames is something that is only arising through cocreation.
3036952	3045860	305	Daniel	0.99898	So in closing, I send my deepest appreciation to all those who support and care and engage.
3046360	3058170	306	Daniel	1	To those who are not sure, I welcome you to the past, the present and the future we respect and that's why we do what we do.
3059740	3065770	307	Daniel	0.99894	So Alex, where do we go or what is next?
3069920	3091088	308	Alex	0.85437	Yeah, thank you very much for the talk and really providing that vision from the beginning and how it's going now and congratulations on that publication on evolutionary work.
3091254	3104230	309	Alex	0.99	And it's a great opening direction and I believe this direction will make a next step into technical evolution also.
3104760	3112230	310	Alex	0.82	And we will use this technique, evolution approach to develop institute candidacy system.
3114780	3117364	311	Daniel	0.92226	Yes, I'll just wait a few more seconds.
3117412	3128008	312	Daniel	1	If anyone writes a question that we can address in the live chat, let's look at some of these questions that we look at at the end of every live stream.
3128184	3130244	313	Daniel	0.99997	What would a good understanding enable?
3130392	3142364	314	Daniel	0.93913	Well, if we were able to really understand our own generative model as the institute and as the active inference ecosystem, it would support our sense making and decision making.
3142502	3145670	315	Daniel	0.92543	We'd be able to act and infer and serve better.
3146280	3149300	316	Daniel	1	What are the unique predictions and implications?
3150600	3152710	317	Daniel	0.99974	That's a very interesting question.
3154280	3162810	318	Daniel	0.63066	I'm sure there are many ways to address this and we did have many future oriented expressions during this discussion, even today.
3164620	3168540	319	Daniel	1	What are the next steps for free energy principle and active inference?
3169360	3171004	320	Daniel	0.99998	Again, do you have any thoughts on this one?
3171042	3172732	321	Daniel	0.71	The middle question or the second question?
3172786	3173500	322	Daniel	0.9214	Alex.
3177840	3189740	323	Alex	0.29277	Delivered and unique predictions and next steps depends on some specific field or domain for ourselves.
3189820	3200580	324	Alex	0.53009	We understand that active inference is a scale free approach and it can be applied to any scale of research.
3200730	3221310	325	Alex	0.56446	Any domain which any researcher or engineer is working on can be described with active inference language starting from where using accordances to computational modeling or types of modeling and so on.
3224230	3224980	326	Alex	0.9879	Yeah.
3226470	3228580	327	Daniel	0.96536	What are the goals of the research?
3230550	3240742	328	Daniel	1	To embody our mission to support the active inference ecosystem, to be the best institute we can be, be the best nest mates within it.
3240876	3241960	329	Daniel	0.99998	What do you think?
3245070	3247130	330	Alex	0.99061	Maybe we should remove goals.
3248750	3250410	331	Daniel	0.92357	Let's change it to preferences.
3251470	3252620	332	Alex	0.97642	Yeah, at least.
3253310	3259294	333	Alex	0.81	And considering it in open endedness way.
3259492	3266030	334	Alex	0.98167	Again, we can speak about goals, but looks like it's not so useful concept.
3266770	3289026	335	Daniel	0.99999	Yes, sometimes when we're talking about the specific research papers, we talk about the goal of that paper, but goal is not to be found in the active inference ontology and we find ways of making do and thriving without needing to rest upon goals and reward.
3289218	3290530	336	Daniel	1	And that's really exciting.
3290610	3308970	337	Daniel	1	And that's something that a lot of people don't even realize that they're steeped in reward maximization and goal implementation until the open endedness and the vitality of active inference becomes understood.
3309950	3311740	338	Daniel	0.99998	What are you still curious about?
3312910	3315006	339	Daniel	0.55081	I'll let you go first, then I'll give a last thought.
3315028	3315920	340	Daniel	0.99998	As we close.
3319750	3326690	341	Alex	0.99	I always remember our discussions about sense of the word curious in the beginning.
3329030	3341094	342	Alex	0.90974	It's like I believe more and more curious with week each day, each month.
3341292	3355674	343	Alex	0.98376	What our field, our frontier are showing us so much, a lot of different perspectives, different connections, real people in communications and projects and so on.
3355712	3357610	344	Alex	0.97063	So it's happiness.
3359570	3360800	345	Daniel	0.99841	Very beautiful.
3361730	3365214	346	Daniel	0.85565	I'm curious about many things like that.
3365252	3377886	347	Daniel	1	You said that we develop and hone that curiosity every day and we seek to spark and be sparked when people come in from different backgrounds with their curiosities.
3378078	3381058	348	Daniel	0.5487	It's inspiring, to say the least.
3381144	3393622	349	Daniel	0.76	And I'm really curious about who will have listened or read this far in the stream and choose that moment to take an action to get involved with the institute.
3393806	3397658	350	Daniel	0.99981	So there's only one way that my uncertainty is going to be reduced about that.
3397744	3399610	351	Daniel	0.7	And I think if you know, you know.
3399760	3400122	352	Daniel	0.96521	So.
3400176	3401206	353	Daniel	0.99962	Thank you, Alex.
3401318	3402570	354	Daniel	0.70253	Thank you, .
3403150	3406650	355	Daniel	0.99981	Thank you to the officers and to all of the institute.
3407070	3408140	356	Daniel	0.99974	See you around.
3409230	3410074	357	Alex	0.9968	Thank you.
3410192	3411020	358	Alex	0.57277	Thank you.
