00:00:07,493 --> 00:00:08,400
Daniel Friedman: Hello everyone.

2
00:00:08,486 --> 00:00:11,217
Welcome to the Active inference

3
00:00:11,217 --> 00:00:11,217
Institute quarterly roundtable number two

4
00:00:11,217 --> 00:00:14,568
in 2023.

5
00:00:14,578 --> 00:00:17,872
It's June 30, 2023, and this is going to

6
00:00:17,872 --> 00:00:17,872
be our quarterly updates and ways that

7
00:00:17,872 --> 00:00:17,872
you can participate at the institute and

8
00:00:17,872 --> 00:00:25,645
in the active ecosystem.

9
00:00:25,687 --> 00:00:28,902
So welcome to the active inference

10
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:28,972
institute.

11
00:00:28,984 --> 00:00:30,152
We're a participant battori online

12
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:30,152
institute that is communicating, learning

13
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:30,152
, and practicing applied active inference.

14
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:34,569

15
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,876
You can find us at the links on this page

16
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:37,876
and note that we'll be transitioning our

17
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:37,876
emails over from activeinference@gmail.com

18
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:37,876
towards Active Inference Institute

19
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:47,823
domains.

20
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:49,089
This is recorded in an archive Livestream,

21
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:49,089
, so please provide us with feedback so

22
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:53,463
that we can improve our work.

23
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:56,741
All backgrounds and perspectives are

24
00:00:56,741 --> 00:00:56,741
welcome, and we'll be following video

25
00:00:56,741 --> 00:00:56,741
etiquette for live streams today in the

26
00:00:56,741 --> 00:00:56,741
quarterly meeting number two of the year.

27
00:00:56,741 --> 00:01:05,009
.

28
00:01:05,027 --> 00:01:07,287
We'll start at the institute scale, give

29
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:07,287
some updates at the institute level, and

30
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:07,287
then we'll look a little bit deeper into

31
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:15,082
primarily education, but also research.

32
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,348
And then I'll have some closing thoughts

33
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:18,348
by way of a presidential address about

34
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:23,825
where we're at with active inference.

35
00:01:23,836 --> 00:01:26,111
And if you're watching live, please write

36
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:26,111
comments and questions in the live chat

37
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:26,111
and we will look to address those during.

38
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:31,661
.

39
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:37,275
Okay, so starting with the institute

40
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:37,275
scale, some updates coming from the

41
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:42,753
institute.

42
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:48,030
Here's one way that we can visualize the

43
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,062
active inference institute in June 2023.

44
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:54,093
We are within the active inference

45
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:54,093
ecosystem as well as within other

46
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:54,093
ecosystems, and we have a nested

47
00:01:54,093 --> 00:02:01,102
structure.

48
00:02:01,103 --> 00:02:03,126
Alex, would you like to describe this?

49
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,196
Alex Vyatkin: Yeah, I think for these

50
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:10,196
moments, it's great to see this structure

51
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:10,196
and understand what is actually in place

52
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:19,289
and working and acting and adapting.

53
00:02:20,294 --> 00:02:23,329
Alex: And from very beginning we consider

54
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:23,329
it from perspective of systems thinking

55
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:23,329
and from perspective of active inference.

56
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:31,400

57
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,439
We always think about some kind of nested

58
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:34,439
and hierarchical structure which can be

59
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:42,510
builded and structured accordingly.

60
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:46,557
So having it right now embodied, it's

61
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:50,594
great to see it totally agree.

62
00:02:50,595 --> 00:02:52,617
Daniel: At the institute scale where

63
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:52,617
these first updates are going to come

64
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:52,617
from, we have the officers, the board of

65
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:52,617
directors, and the scientific advisory

66
00:02:52,617 --> 00:03:00,632
board.

67
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:02,658
We have two organizational units which

68
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:02,658
steward the development and support

69
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:07,700
participation in projects.

70
00:03:07,702 --> 00:03:10,732
And projects and learning groups are

71
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,764
really where it happens on the ground.

72
00:03:13,764 --> 00:03:14,779
And so we're going to talk a lot more

73
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:15,784
about these.

74
00:03:15,784 --> 00:03:18,812
But this is the nesting and our own

75
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:20,839
relationship with the ecosystem.

76
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:25,882
Another way to see this is in terms of

77
00:03:25,882 --> 00:03:28,914
people and positions at the institute.

78
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,947
So starting from the left, we have casual

79
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:31,947
engagement with our products and services

80
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:36,992
into the niche.

81
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:38,015
So this might be the very video that you'

82
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:40,036
're listening to or watching right now.

83
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:42,057
It could be the transcript of this video

84
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:43,068
that you're reading.

85
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:46,092
It might be the active inference ontology.

86
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:46,092
.

87
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,107
It might be the active block, for

88
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:49,119
instance, software package.

89
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,141
There's all these different open source

90
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:51,141
products and services that we provide to

91
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:53,169
the niche.

92
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,191
And one moment you will decide to

93
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:56,191
participate in a project or a learning

94
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:56,191
group, and that can be more towards the

95
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:56,191
learning, more towards the doing and

96
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:56,191
leveraging your contributions at the

97
00:03:56,191 --> 00:04:06,233
institute.

98
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:09,262
And some participants will choose to

99
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:09,262
solidify their participation through

100
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:09,262
volunteering or engaging with the

101
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:09,262
internship program, both of which are new

102
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:19,364
and really excitingly.

103
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:22,393
Developing well and then we haven't

104
00:04:22,393 --> 00:04:22,393
listed any names of the many of you who

105
00:04:22,393 --> 00:04:28,455
are in all of these different stages.

106
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:32,489
And you may want to play another role or

107
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:32,489
another position in the Institute, such

108
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:32,489
as the Scientific Advisory Board, board

109
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:39,563
of Directors or the officers.

110
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:43,599
So a lot of appreciation and thanks to

111
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:43,599
everybody who's shown and not shown on

112
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:47,648
this slide.

113
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:53,700
We are really appreciative of how you all

114
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,726
show up for the institute.

115
00:04:56,732 --> 00:04:58,753
Alex, want to add anything on that?

116
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:07,781
Alex: Yeah, even from this slide, we can

117
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:07,781
see that a lot of people already involved

118
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:07,781
in activity and provide great insights

119
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:07,781
and different perspective and backgrounds

120
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:18,891
and experience.

121
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:22,938
And yes, a lot of people not shown here,

122
00:05:22,938 --> 00:05:22,938
but we know them through our community

123
00:05:22,938 --> 00:05:27,984
platforms and so on.

124
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:31,028
So you can see this progress in terms of

125
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:31,028
participation in activities and that's

126
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:37,083
also great progress.

127
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:41,125
Daniel: All right, moving on.

128
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,154
We are excited that for our third applied

129
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:44,154
active inference symposium to be held in

130
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:44,154
August, we will have the theme of

131
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:44,154
enacting ecosystems of shared

132
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:44,154
intelligence, active inference as a

133
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:55,263
cognitive kernel.

134
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:58,291
We have a really broad and global co

135
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,262
organizer team, which is very exciting.

136
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:03,286
So thanks to everybody who's in the co

137
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:03,286
organizing team for this symposium, we're

138
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:03,286
just getting started on the organization.

139
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:08,339
.

140
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,370
So in the coming days and weeks, we'll be

141
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:12,370
providing more information on

142
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:12,370
participating in a more formal call for

143
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,429
presenters.

144
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,463
However, if you're listening to this

145
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:21,463
message now and you are really excited to

146
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:21,463
do a presentation or a workshop or

147
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:21,463
mentorship and be a part of the active

148
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:21,463
inference ecosystem, then please reach

149
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:31,566
out to us.

150
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,589
Alex, anything you want to add here?

151
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:42,670
Alex: But actually, yes, I think I can

152
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:42,670
remember that there will be a third

153
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:42,670
symposium and it's cool that we have that

154
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:42,670
yearly written for this type of activity

155
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:42,670
and hopefully this event bring us and for

156
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:42,670
people who will participate, new insights,

157
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:42,670
, connections, and ground for future

158
00:06:42,670 --> 00:07:04,839
developments.

159
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:07,869
Cool.

160
00:07:08,874 --> 00:07:10,898
Daniel: All right, just to summarize and

161
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:10,898
update a few of the institute level

162
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,927
programs.

163
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:17,967
So volunteering at the institute, it's a

164
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:19,981
way to engage.

165
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,008
It is just making it that much easier to

166
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:21,008
get involved with one or more projects

167
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:21,008
and to start to get that recognition from

168
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:21,008
the institute, understanding your

169
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:21,008
contributions and also on your own resume

170
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:21,008
or your own work history or your

171
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:34,134
portfolio.

172
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:37,169
Volunteering is really an incredible way

173
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:39,182
to learn by doing.

174
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:41,204
If you want to apply or learn about

175
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:41,204
organizational active inference or if you

176
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:41,204
want to think about communication as

177
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:41,204
active inference education in the context

178
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:41,204
of active inference gripper and the

179
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:41,204
gripped if you want a perspective swap

180
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:54,333
and see it multiple ways.

181
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:56,357
Learning by doing on a project through

182
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:56,357
volunteering, we hope, is a really unique

183
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:59,388
opportunity.

184
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:03,363
And what you do will and does really

185
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:04,370
matter.

186
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:06,395
So if you're taking notes on the margin

187
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:06,395
of some paper or if you're developing

188
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:06,395
lists that you felt like help your

189
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:06,395
onboarding into active inference, you can

190
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:06,395
make a leveraged contribution by sharing

191
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:17,504
that kind of information.

192
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:20,531
Or if you're not quite sure what type of

193
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:20,531
contribution or the impact it would have,

194
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:20,531
we can help find that kind of a niche for

195
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:25,585
you.

196
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:29,624
The internship program is being a

197
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:29,624
volunteer but wanting a little bit more

198
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:34,673
structure around that.

199
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:37,701
We have about 20 currently active interns

200
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:37,701
from all around the world, different

201
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:37,701
backgrounds, levels of technical

202
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:37,701
familiarity with the active inference,

203
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:37,701
ranging from truly some of the people who

204
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:37,701
I believe are experts, to people who just

205
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:37,701
found out about active inference and

206
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:37,701
wanted to use this program to accelerate

207
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:56,890
their learning a lot.

208
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,926
Also in the last weeks and months I would

209
00:08:59,926 --> 00:08:59,926
like to commend the two individuals who

210
00:08:59,926 --> 00:08:59,926
know who they are who have completed

211
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:05,929
their internship.

212
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:08,955
This has really been a great honor to

213
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:08,955
work with you, both of you, and to those

214
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:08,955
who are still active, I look forward to

215
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:08,955
seeing those updates and continuing to

216
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:17,044
work with you.

217
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:20,071
The internship consists of learning,

218
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:20,071
doing and also mentorship and

219
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:23,102
facilitation.

220
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:26,132
So interns tend to participate in one or

221
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:26,132
more course or textbook group or maybe

222
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:31,185
help out with some live streams.

223
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:35,222
Interns engage on projects and that is

224
00:09:35,222 --> 00:09:38,253
usually a minimum of two projects.

225
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:40,272
One is hosted at the Institute.

226
00:09:40,273 --> 00:09:42,296
So some of the projects that we'll look

227
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:42,296
at later in this roundtable but then also

228
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:42,296
most of the interns have a personal or

229
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:49,359
background research agenda.

230
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,381
So sometimes they make very small

231
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:51,381
contributions to an institute project but

232
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:51,381
they're working really diligently on

233
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:51,381
their dissertation or on their hobby

234
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:58,458
project.

235
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,426
Other times it's most of the contribution

236
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:01,426
to the Institute project and then a

237
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:01,426
little bit of self guided research and we

238
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:01,426
try to provide our interns with support

239
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:01,426
over multiple spatial and temporal scales.

240
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:11,529
.

241
00:10:14,554 --> 00:10:18,591
In terms of our engagement in the broader

242
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:18,591
digital cyberphysical niche, we continue

243
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:18,591
to grow on our different platforms and

244
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:18,591
channels, though these are just proxy

245
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:18,591
measures in our discord podcast, Twitter

246
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:35,769
and YouTube as well as mailing lists.

247
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,800
So we continue to communicate out to

248
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,819
those who want to hear.

249
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,882
Here's the big picture on Institute

250
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:47,882
activities and you can find this

251
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:47,882
information at the activities page that's

252
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:54,955
listed here.

253
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:57,986
At the top we have type of project

254
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:57,986
publication live streams such as the one

255
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:57,986
happening right now and the active

256
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:57,986
inference journal which picks up when the

257
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:57,986
live stream hits stop and transcribes and

258
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:57,986
curates publishes that transcript which

259
00:10:57,986 --> 00:11:12,074
we'll talk more about.

260
00:11:12,075 --> 00:11:15,102
So live streams and journal are a great

261
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:15,102
pair in the active block for instance

262
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:15,102
project we continue to build the soft and

263
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:15,102
hard skills associated with generative

264
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:15,102
modeling in the active inference

265
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:26,214
tradition.

266
00:11:26,215 --> 00:11:28,237
And so we use the complex Adaptive

267
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:28,237
systems modeling framework Cadcad to

268
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:28,237
implement different active inference

269
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:34,297
generative models.

270
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:36,315
This is a really great place.

271
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:39,346
A lot of discussions about modeling,

272
00:11:39,346 --> 00:11:41,365
robotics and embodied.

273
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,393
JF Kotcher continues to offer his

274
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:44,393
expertise and updates from this really

275
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:44,393
incredible project where real Lego robots

276
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:44,393
are implementing symbolic active

277
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:54,490
inference.

278
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,520
So thanks, JF, for hosting this project

279
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:57,520
the way you do in the active inference

280
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,498
ontology.

281
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:03,523
We continue to refine and update the

282
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:03,523
active inference ontology, which is the

283
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:03,523
real language that we speak, whether it

284
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:03,523
happens to be deployed in English or

285
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:03,523
visually or in a programming language or

286
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:03,523
however, the active inference ontology is

287
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:03,523
how we're communicating and we develop

288
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:03,523
that and offer it as a service to the

289
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:21,706
niche.

290
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,733
In this project, we have multiple ongoing

291
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:24,733
learning groups which we'll talk more

292
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:27,765
about soon.

293
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:29,787
But we have a textbook group with Par et

294
00:12:29,787 --> 00:12:30,789
al.

295
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,816
The 2022 active inference textbook.

296
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:35,844
We have Sanjeev Namjoshi, who's writing a

297
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:35,844
really incredible work that will be a

298
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:35,844
textbook published as Fundamentals of

299
00:12:35,844 --> 00:12:41,905
Active Inference.

300
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:44,933
And we're alpha testing along with Sanjiv

301
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:46,953
and right there alongside him.

302
00:12:46,954 --> 00:12:48,978
So thanks, Sanjiv, for bringing this work

303
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:48,978
in progress to the institute and to

304
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:53,019
really sticking with the trouble.

305
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,045
This is going to be an incredible product.

306
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:55,045
.

307
00:12:56,052 --> 00:12:58,075
And we have two courses, one on physics

308
00:12:58,075 --> 00:12:58,075
as information processing and one on

309
00:12:58,075 --> 00:12:58,075
active inference for the social sciences,

310
00:12:58,075 --> 00:13:04,078
which we'll address soon.

311
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,105
And also multiple times per week in our

312
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:07,105
discord, we have open discussions for

313
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:11,146
education and research.

314
00:13:11,148 --> 00:13:14,170
So if this is all a lot or you're not

315
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:14,170
sure about anything, probably the best

316
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:14,170
way to just drop in and find out would be

317
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:14,170
to check out when and how we're meeting

318
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:23,263
and come to the open discussions.

319
00:13:23,263 --> 00:13:26,291
If you just want to see what's up.

320
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:28,314
Anything you want to add there, Alex?

321
00:13:36,396 --> 00:13:40,431
Alex: Good to see that projects are

322
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:40,431
active and mostly maybe for last period

323
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:45,480
of time.

324
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,519
It's having that new courses which we'll

325
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:48,519
describe later, but having and feeling is

326
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:53,568
growing.

327
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:58,613
It provides great opportunities for

328
00:13:58,613 --> 00:14:01,580
second half of the year.

329
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:04,616
Daniel: So true, in the first quarterly

330
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:04,616
roundtable, we had no courses, but as of

331
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:04,616
now, we can say that there are two

332
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:04,616
courses that are really pushing the

333
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:04,616
frontier of education and even research

334
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:04,616
in quantum information sciences and in

335
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:19,764
social sciences.

336
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:21,785
So thanks again.

337
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:23,801
We'll get to those soon.

338
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:26,833
All right, let's dive into a little more

339
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:27,846
detail on active.

340
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:30,869
So, Alex, would you like to first

341
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:30,869
introduce and give a little thoughts on

342
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:30,869
the active inference qualification system

343
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:36,930
draft?

344
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:44,015
Alex: Yeah, we put it here, like for now

345
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:44,015
at education adjective scale, but future

346
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:44,015
it will be applied for all institute

347
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:55,122
structure and activities.

348
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:59,167
We should have some cornerstone in terms

349
00:14:59,167 --> 00:14:59,167
of how we can measure effectiveness of

350
00:14:59,167 --> 00:14:59,167
our educational activities and

351
00:14:59,167 --> 00:14:59,167
educational services in the beginning, to

352
00:14:59,167 --> 00:14:59,167
understand courses and our materials, how

353
00:14:59,167 --> 00:14:59,167
we change actually someone's mind and how

354
00:14:59,167 --> 00:14:59,167
deep this mind need to be changed in some

355
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:27,383
formal sense.

356
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:33,440
And we not started from Greenfield.

357
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:36,475
We just take one of stable system of

358
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:36,475
qualifications level from European and

359
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:36,475
adopt it for how we can see it in

360
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:36,475
application to active inference and

361
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:50,614
participations in projects and so on.

362
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:54,654
And for now, we have a basic draft and we'

363
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:54,654
'll have discussions around with

364
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:54,654
interested parties, different scales of

365
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:54,654
institute, and finally have some stable

366
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:54,654
form which will apply to different

367
00:15:54,654 --> 00:16:07,728
direction.

368
00:16:08,737 --> 00:16:09,744
Daniel: Thanks.

369
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,772
I'll just add a few notes on this first,

370
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:13,788
just echoing your last point.

371
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:16,815
If you're interested in active inference,

372
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:16,815
professionalization education,

373
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:16,815
qualification systems, even as a critic,

374
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:16,815
we would really love to have you in the

375
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:24,890
game.

376
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:26,916
So please participate early, participate

377
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:27,921
often.

378
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:30,951
And I'll just highlight a few pieces of

379
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:30,951
this system draft that are really

380
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:33,984
exciting.

381
00:16:33,988 --> 00:16:37,020
First, it begins at level zero, which

382
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,020
everybody de facto can have, perhaps even

383
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:42,074
upon or before birth.

384
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:45,107
Then, as the levels proceed, active

385
00:16:45,107 --> 00:16:45,107
inference is always being connected with

386
00:16:45,107 --> 00:16:50,159
domains and systems of interest.

387
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,185
So it's about yes, and with active

388
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:53,185
inference about connecting active

389
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:53,185
inference to other fields and topics,

390
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:53,185
understanding a different domain's

391
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:53,185
ontology robotics or neuroscience or pure

392
00:16:53,185 --> 00:17:06,256
mathematics, whatever it may be.

393
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,289
And working with active inference as you

394
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:09,289
gain knowledge of the ontology and of the

395
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:15,345
details of active inference.

396
00:17:15,346 --> 00:17:17,369
But it's not just a knowledge based

397
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,384
qualification system.

398
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:23,424
We also are looking to integrate skills

399
00:17:23,424 --> 00:17:23,424
and even project responsibility and

400
00:17:23,424 --> 00:17:27,467
autonomy.

401
00:17:27,469 --> 00:17:30,497
So just to give kind of an example of

402
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:30,497
this, levels one and two, again,

403
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:30,497
currently very tentative drafts, so for

404
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:37,565
your engagement.

405
00:17:37,566 --> 00:17:40,590
But in levels one and two, people are

406
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:40,590
able to act as basic learners and

407
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:40,590
collaborators and begin to get a grasp on

408
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:40,590
what terms we're using in active

409
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:40,590
inference and how do those concepts

410
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:51,709
relate to their field of interest.

411
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,733
And we see this every single day in the

412
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:55,743
textbook group.

413
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:57,767
And in discussions, someone says, oh, I'm

414
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,786
working as a physical therapist.

415
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,748
And so in action, that's like the person

416
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,758
moving their arm.

417
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:06,795
That is where these levels are targeted.

418
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,825
Level three begins to get into describing

419
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:09,825
and understanding some of the technical

420
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:13,865
details of what we do.

421
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:16,899
Level four begins to approach the

422
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:16,899
evaluation and recapitulation of

423
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:22,959
technical models in active inference.

424
00:18:23,968 --> 00:18:26,999
Level five is related to comprehensive

425
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:26,999
development and implementation, as well

426
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:26,999
as in the projects and autonomy, exerting

427
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:36,009
more supervision for self and others.

428
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,014
Level six, developing advanced skills.

429
00:18:41,014 --> 00:18:44,017
Level seven, engaging with very

430
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:46,019
specialized problem solving skills.

431
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:49,022
And level eight, engaging in synthesis,

432
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:53,026
evaluation and critical problem solving.

433
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:55,028
So again, can't emphasize enough it's

434
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:55,028
just a draft, and we are calling for your

435
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:55,028
participation if this is something that

436
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:55,028
you would be interested in using or

437
00:18:55,028 --> 00:19:04,031
engaging with.

438
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:07,034
But we think this is going to be a really

439
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:07,034
important direction for the active

440
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:07,034
inference ecosystem carrying on to the

441
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:13,040
textbook group.

442
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,044
So in the active inference textbook group,

443
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:17,044
, we are working on and through the Par,

444
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:23,050
Pazulo and Friston 2022 textbook.

445
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,053
Currently we have cohort three working on

446
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:26,053
the second half of the book and cohort

447
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:32,059
four on the first half of the book.

448
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:35,062
Together, these two cohorts compromise

449
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:37,064
about 150 people.

450
00:19:37,064 --> 00:19:39,066
Not every person joins every meeting.

451
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:42,069
Some people engage with the recordings

452
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:42,069
asynchronously other people are in our

453
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:42,069
shared epistemic niche, just gleaning and

454
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:42,069
contributing to this kind of

455
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:53,079
collaborative stigmaergic process.

456
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:56,083
As educators, we're focused on the

457
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
continual delivery and deployment of

458
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,083
questions and enrichment and discourse in

459
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:05,086
just some ways that this plays out.

460
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:07,088
Here are, for example, questions that

461
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:07,088
people have asked live or before or after

462
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:07,088
a synchronous meeting where we can

463
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:07,088
connect the specific figures and the

464
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:07,088
ontology terms to people's uncertainties.

465
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:17,098
.

466
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:22,103
And on the right is an example of an

467
00:20:22,103 --> 00:20:23,104
equation.

468
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:26,107
Here's the variational free energy

469
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:26,107
equation 2.5, and the way that we can use

470
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:26,107
the ontology to unpack and connect some

471
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:34,115
of the dots with these equations.

472
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:37,118
And in the last few weeks, we've actually

473
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:37,118
taken that even further and explored how

474
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:37,118
to use language models through Coda AI in

475
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:43,124
this process.

476
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:46,127
So here we have Equations 2.1 and

477
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:48,129
Equations 2.2.

478
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:52,133
They are being rendered in Coda via

479
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:54,135
typing in LaTech.

480
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:57,138
And then we are using language models

481
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
within Coda to provide explanations,

482
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
contextualizations for different

483
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
backgrounds and expertises, and also

484
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
translation into different languages,

485
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:57,138
describing the variables and the notation

486
00:20:57,138 --> 00:21:13,148
and the who, what and why.

487
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,150
So this has been a pretty fun avenue and

488
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
a really cool example of how language

489
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
models and education can be hand in hand

490
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
and empower our own learning by using all

491
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
kinds of models to help us, where frankly,

492
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
, it can be quite challenging, which is

493
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,150
in understanding some of the analytical

494
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:33,168
details of the framework.

495
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,170
Anything you want to add, Alex?

496
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:43,178
Alex: This is that type of technology

497
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:43,178
which looks like magic, but having in

498
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:43,178
place ontology, which is nicely

499
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:43,178
integrated for Coda again to all projects.

500
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:56,191
.

501
00:21:56,191 --> 00:22:02,191
It's really like an engine for this car

502
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:07,196
which is getting more and more speed.

503
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:10,199
Cool.

504
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,204
Daniel: Okay, in May 2023, we began our

505
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:15,204
first course at the Institute, and that

506
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:15,204
was Physics as Information Processing,

507
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:15,204
being taught by one of the leading

508
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:15,204
researchers in the area, Chris Fields,

509
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:15,204
and with a Math PhD course assistant,

510
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:34,223
Andre Agira.

511
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:38,227
So Chris, thank you for stepping up again

512
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:38,227
from the Scientific Advisory Board to

513
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:38,227
offer this truly incredible and unique

514
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:46,235
educational experience.

515
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:50,239
We've had massive response, dozens of

516
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:50,239
registrants who want to engage in the

517
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:50,239
participatory discussions that happen in

518
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:50,239
between your lectures, the second

519
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:50,239
discussion being tomorrow for those who

520
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:50,239
want to join, and 1500 views of the first

521
00:22:50,239 --> 00:23:08,251
lecture in a month.

522
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:10,253
There's many people who are following

523
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:11,254
along the course.

524
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:14,257
Syllabus is explicit and innovative.

525
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:18,260
We have a question and answer system so

526
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:18,260
that people can ask questions

527
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,265
asynchronously Chris then answers them.

528
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:25,267
And we have them posted again through

529
00:23:25,267 --> 00:23:26,269
this interactive Coda interface.

530
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,271
And that's really supporting an

531
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:28,271
incredible level of discourse and

532
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:31,274
participation.

533
00:23:31,274 --> 00:23:34,277
All transcripts are going to be curated

534
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:34,277
and published along with the questions

535
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:34,277
and answers and some other supplemental

536
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:40,283
information.

537
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:42,285
So this has been a really great

538
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:42,285
experience and something new over the

539
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:45,288
last few months.

540
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,293
Anything you want to add, I'm tempted to

541
00:23:50,293 --> 00:23:50,293
just talk about how cool the quantum

542
00:23:50,293 --> 00:23:55,298
information free energy principle is.

543
00:23:55,298 --> 00:23:57,300
But perhaps now is not the moment.

544
00:24:00,297 --> 00:24:04,301
Alex: For me historically, for my fault,

545
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:04,301
the ground starting from beginning on

546
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:04,301
this century, starting from It technology

547
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:04,301
technologies and computer science and

548
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:19,316
this notion of information processing.

549
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:26,323
It always was like in engineering sense,

550
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:30,327
like working field and working domain.

551
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:36,333
But I always had that need and feeling

552
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:36,333
for first principles and for physics in

553
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:40,337
place.

554
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:44,341
And for now, seeing that latest

555
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:44,341
development on quantum information theory

556
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:44,341
and how it nicely connects to free energy

557
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:44,341
and active inference, it's really great

558
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:44,341
to have these frontier curves in place in

559
00:24:44,341 --> 00:25:02,353
our activities.

560
00:25:02,353 --> 00:25:06,357
And really great thanks to Chris and

561
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:06,357
ander and I believe that it's kind of

562
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:06,357
starting point maybe ten years after we'

563
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:06,357
'll come back altogether and discuss how

564
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:22,373
this course started.

565
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:26,377
Great changes for different ecosystems.

566
00:25:27,378 --> 00:25:28,379
Daniel: Thank you, Alex.

567
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:29,380
Totally agree.

568
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,383
And also we are fresh off the presses,

569
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:32,383
happy to announce the second course that

570
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:32,383
we'll be offering at the institute, which

571
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:32,383
is Constructing Cultural Landscapes

572
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:32,383
Active Inference for the Social Sciences.

573
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:44,395
.

574
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:47,398
And this is going to be a multi teacher

575
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:47,398
massively participatory course avel of

576
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:53,404
Cairos Research.

577
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:56,407
Thank you for taking the initiative to

578
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:59,410
suggest even this possibility.

579
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,407
And Ben and Mahault Lorena, thanks a lot

580
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:05,410
for joining on for the journey.

581
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,413
On July 7, we will begin and it will have

582
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:08,413
some lecture sessions as well as

583
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:14,419
participatory discussion sections.

584
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:18,422
All sessions are free.

585
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:20,425
They'll be live streamed and rewatchable.

586
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:20,425
.

587
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:22,427
The transcripts will be curated and

588
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:22,427
published into a book at the end of the

589
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:25,430
year.

590
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,433
And this is going to be a really great on

591
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:28,433
ramp and space for people with a

592
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:28,433
humanities or social sciences background.

593
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:33,438
.

594
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:37,442
So we've heard people waiting for such a

595
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:37,442
thing.

596
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:41,446
It was Avel's insight that such a course

597
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:41,446
could be hosted at Cairos Research and at

598
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:47,452
the Active Inference Institute.

599
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,454
So thanks to all the teachers here and

600
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:49,454
just really looking forward to how you

601
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:49,454
tackle and engage with this question of

602
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:58,463
active inference in the social sciences.

603
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:00,459
Anything you want to add?

604
00:27:03,462 --> 00:27:06,465
Alex: Yeah, like these two different

605
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:06,465
courses, like from different two distinct

606
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:06,465
scales, like from quantum scale and

607
00:27:06,465 --> 00:27:14,473
social scale.

608
00:27:14,473 --> 00:27:17,476
And possibly it's like two different ends

609
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:17,476
of spectrum in which we can work on with

610
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:22,481
our research and education.

611
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:27,486
It's great that this step to social

612
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:27,486
sciences because it brings active

613
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:27,486
inference and it's formal and first

614
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:27,486
principles principled framework into the

615
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:27,486
domain which haven't got it before and

616
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:45,504
now it's a great begin also.

617
00:27:45,504 --> 00:27:50,509
And our scales between quantum and social

618
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:54,513
will be on us to work on next years.

619
00:27:57,516 --> 00:28:01,514
Daniel: Yes, and the kind of oroborous or

620
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:01,514
horseshoe theory with quantum social

621
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:09,522
sciences onto the live streams.

622
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,524
So, lot to say, of course, a little bit

623
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:11,524
meta since we're on a live stream right

624
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,527
now.

625
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,529
But I'll just note a few things.

626
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:22,535
First, across our different series, we

627
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:22,535
now have 336 completed or planned live

628
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:28,541
streams.

629
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,544
So most of those have already happened,

630
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:31,544
but there are several that are planned,

631
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:31,544
but we're over 300 completed and 336 as

632
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:39,552
of now being planned.

633
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,556
And even just specifically looking at the

634
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:43,556
next 30 days, we have just such a breadth

635
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:43,556
and depth it's quite exciting to watch,

636
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:52,565
let alone to enact.

637
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:54,567
We'll have the Chris Fields course, a

638
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:54,567
discussion section, a lecture and then

639
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:59,571
another discussion section.

640
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:02,569
We'll begin the active inference for the

641
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:02,569
social sciences course with Avel Ben

642
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:07,574
having contributions.

643
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:10,577
We'll have a guest stream with professors

644
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:10,577
from around the world, researchers, all

645
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:10,577
these different topics being able to be

646
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:10,577
slotted in with a really great way to

647
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:10,577
platform and give visibility and catalyze

648
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:10,577
discussion around these incredible

649
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:26,593
researchers work.

650
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:30,597
So it's really exciting and it would be

651
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:31,598
great.

652
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:33,600
Not going to say it's specifically a

653
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:33,600
personal request, but if you choose to

654
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,604
read it as such then great.

655
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:40,607
It would be awesome to have more

656
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:40,607
assistance with participating and

657
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:45,612
preparing and enacting live streams.

658
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:48,615
We have role based ways of planning and

659
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:51,618
preparing and enacting live streams.

660
00:29:51,618 --> 00:29:53,620
So whether you want to play a more

661
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:53,620
technical or operational or logistical

662
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:53,620
role, if you want to be a conversational

663
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:53,620
facilitator, if you want to do it in a

664
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:53,620
different language, if you want to do a

665
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:53,620
series, there's so many ways that you can

666
00:29:53,620 --> 00:30:04,625
get involved.

667
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:07,628
But it would just be awesome to have more

668
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:07,628
voices on the live stream and just be

669
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:07,628
able to continue offering these kinds of

670
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:07,628
resources at even faster rate with

671
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:19,640
increased professionalization.

672
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,643
And I know that there's many people out

673
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:22,643
there who would be incredible

674
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:22,643
contributors to broadcast and or

675
00:30:22,643 --> 00:30:28,649
facilitate.

676
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:31,652
Everyone is also welcome to self nominate

677
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:31,652
or suggest or introduce somebody who you

678
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:35,656
think would fit well on a stream.

679
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:37,658
If it's like a perspective that we haven'

680
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:37,658
't heard from, that would be really

681
00:30:37,658 --> 00:30:39,660
important.

682
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:43,664
There's a lot of background technical and

683
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:43,664
educational work on the zero videos when

684
00:30:43,664 --> 00:30:48,669
we do a paper discussion.

685
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:51,672
So if there's a paper that you want to

686
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
have a million X leveraged contribution

687
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
on your preparation around, if we discuss

688
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
that in a live stream and you're able to

689
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:51,672
help before with the zero, you'll be a co.

690
00:30:51,672 --> 00:31:05,680
.

691
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,682
Author on a research publication of the

692
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:07,682
transcript and you'll have made an

693
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:07,682
absolutely unique, irreplaceable

694
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:07,682
contribution to active inference

695
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:07,682
knowledge with what you did in your

696
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:18,693
diligence in the zero.

697
00:31:18,693 --> 00:31:20,695
So for people who hear that calling, that'

698
00:31:20,695 --> 00:31:21,696
's incredibly important.

699
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:24,699
We invite people to share the live

700
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:24,699
streams on social media or with their

701
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:24,699
colleagues, however they find it relevant.

702
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:29,704
.

703
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:31,706
Like if there's a topic or a person that

704
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:31,706
has come up on our streams, sharing it

705
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:31,706
where relevant will help bring people in.

706
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:37,712
.

707
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:40,715
And also we have weekly live stream

708
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:40,715
meetings.

709
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:42,717
So if you just want to find out what we

710
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:42,717
do and how we do it in the live streams,

711
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:42,717
then I would recommend that you join the

712
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:48,723
regular meetings.

713
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:50,725
And if you really want to join but that

714
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:50,725
time never works for you, then email and

715
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:50,725
let us know that you're specifically

716
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:54,729
interested.

717
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:56,731
We'll find a different time.

718
00:31:56,731 --> 00:31:58,733
Any other comments there Alex?

719
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:09,738
Alex: For this moment, we can see that a

720
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:09,738
lot of Livestream activity is happening

721
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:09,738
with participation of people, not only

722
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:09,738
with our own preparations, but with

723
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:09,738
people who just want to share this and so

724
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:26,755
on.

725
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:31,760
And if we can keep this written to having

726
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:31,760
different people with their interests and

727
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:31,760
sharing ideas, and yes, if people will

728
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:31,760
join to help us to do it more and more

729
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:47,776
often, maybe it will be great.

730
00:32:49,778 --> 00:32:50,779
Daniel: Thank you.

731
00:32:52,781 --> 00:32:55,784
The active inference journal picks up

732
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:57,786
where live stream stops.

733
00:32:57,786 --> 00:33:00,783
The Active Inference Journal is engaged

734
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:00,783
in continuous deployment and development

735
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:00,783
of speech to text transcription,

736
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:00,783
automated and manual editing, curation

737
00:33:00,783 --> 00:33:10,793
and finally publication.

738
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:13,796
So just to give an example, a live stream

739
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:13,796
will occur and then we use speech to text

740
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:18,801
onto a public GitHub repository.

741
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:21,804
Everybody can edit the markdown file and

742
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:21,804
then we're able to publish those

743
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:21,804
transcripts so that they can be citable,

744
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:21,804
so that a conversation someone has can go

745
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:21,804
onto their resume as a true citable

746
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:21,804
publication and we can just facilitate

747
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:21,804
the accessibility and the findability of

748
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:21,804
these incredible conversations and

749
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:40,823
moments that we have.

750
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:43,826
And also in the active inference journal.

751
00:33:43,826 --> 00:33:43,826
.

752
00:33:43,826 --> 00:33:46,829
We're always developing the process from

753
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:46,829
setup for those of all technical

754
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:49,832
backgrounds.

755
00:33:49,832 --> 00:33:52,834
How to get things working on your own

756
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:52,834
local setup or on a cloud setup using

757
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:52,834
free and open source software where

758
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:57,840
possible.

759
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:01,838
The speech to text, the text processing

760
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:01,838
the editing, translating into languages,

761
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:01,838
rendering into a diversity of formats,

762
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:01,838
publishing through different channels and

763
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:01,838
then engaging in further analysis related

764
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:01,838
to natural language processing and the

765
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:01,838
active inference ontology all these fun

766
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:19,856
things we can do.

767
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:23,860
So if you in an alternate multiverse, we'

768
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:23,860
're a librarian or an editor or a

769
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:23,860
reviewer or an advocate of the Active

770
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:23,860
Inference corpus, bring it into this

771
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:23,860
reality and make a huge contribution by

772
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:23,860
cultivating our epistemic garden and our

773
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:41,878
offerings.

774
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:44,881
Because there's so much enrichment that

775
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:44,881
can happen with past streams and with

776
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:44,881
proactively, letting the live stream

777
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:44,881
project know and letting courses know how

778
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:44,881
we can help them at the Journal to

779
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:44,881
develop these kinds of publications that

780
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:44,881
in new ways are expanding definitions of

781
00:34:44,881 --> 00:35:04,895
scholarship and research and service.

782
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:07,898
Anything else to add?

783
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:14,905
Alex: Yeah, as for this project, I

784
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:14,905
believe it's like most technical heavy in

785
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:14,905
the institute and maybe we can call it

786
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:14,905
more broadly like language Processing

787
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:14,905
project and maybe it is a good starting

788
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:14,905
point for people who have good technical

789
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:14,905
skills, some programming skills which are

790
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:14,905
related to language processing in general

791
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:44,935
or some specific part of it.

792
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:49,940
Maybe it will be of interest for them to

793
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:49,940
start from this project and later get

794
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:49,940
better grasp on what is active influence

795
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:57,948
is awesome.

796
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:58,949
Daniel: Totally agree.

797
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:01,946
It's like seeing the range of live

798
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:01,946
streams is really one of the best ways to

799
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:01,946
just jump into understanding the ways and

800
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:10,955
the topics that people speak.

801
00:36:11,956 --> 00:36:13,958
Okay, we'll just briefly mention the

802
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:13,958
research work happening, but this last

803
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:13,958
several month period has been extremely

804
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:13,958
focused and extremely productive on

805
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:13,958
education with the two new courses, the

806
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:13,958
qualification system, all of these other

807
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:30,975
curricular developments.

808
00:36:31,976 --> 00:36:34,979
So there's several ongoing research

809
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:34,979
projects.

810
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,982
We have the active inference ontology as

811
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:37,982
a research and development initiative,

812
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:37,982
active blockference as a software package

813
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:37,982
for complex systems modeling using active

814
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:37,982
inference robotics and embodied with JF's

815
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:52,997
symbolic active inference robots.

816
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:54,999
And then there's some project seeds that

817
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:54,999
we always love to offer up to interns or

818
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:54,999
to volunteers as something that they can

819
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:54,999
restart and take a lot of initiative,

820
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:54,999
something that's just planted but barely

821
00:36:54,999 --> 00:37:06,005
there.

822
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:08,007
And that right now is the graphical

823
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:08,007
interface with thinking really

824
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:08,007
expansively about what it looks like to

825
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:08,007
learn and apply active inference from an

826
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:16,015
embodied perspective.

827
00:37:17,016 --> 00:37:19,018
And cognitive agent modeling, doing

828
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:19,018
metaanalysis and synthesis across

829
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:19,018
different cognitive modeling frameworks

830
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:19,018
so that we can really have a place to

831
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:19,018
point when we describe how different

832
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:19,018
cognitive phenomena speaking to a

833
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:19,018
cognitive pattern language are

834
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:19,018
implemented or addressed by active

835
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:38,037
inference and other frameworks.

836
00:37:39,038 --> 00:37:41,040
And then there's the so many of you who

837
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,043
engage in individual research.

838
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:47,046
So there's a lot of research happening in

839
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
the space, and we see education as a

840
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
fundamental enablement for research as

841
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,046
part of the institute's mission for

842
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:57,056
education and research development.

843
00:37:57,056 --> 00:38:00,053
So it's been good times with research,

844
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
and I'm really excited to see all the

845
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:00,053
projects that people share during

846
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:11,064
sessions start to develop and flourish.

847
00:38:11,064 --> 00:38:13,066
Anything else you want to add about

848
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:13,066
research, Alex?

849
00:38:18,071 --> 00:38:23,076
Alex: Yeah, maybe this direction was not

850
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:23,076
so active last time, but as we discussed

851
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:23,076
for future directions, that we will bring

852
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:23,076
more attention and more efforts to maybe

853
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:23,076
formalize a bit how we as institute can

854
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:23,076
survive people around from ecosystems,

855
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:23,076
how we can support them on their ways and

856
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:50,103
so on.

857
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:55,108
So it will be good times here, too.

858
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:57,110
Daniel: Yeah, agreed.

859
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,107
We want to provide a lot of research

860
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:00,107
services, so for people who want to be on

861
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:06,113
any side of that table, reach out.

862
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:11,118
All right, well, the last section here is

863
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:11,118
going to be a short active inference

864
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:17,124
based presidential address.

865
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:20,127
I will be just speaking to some recent

866
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:20,127
developments as well as past developments

867
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:20,127
in the active inference space and just

868
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:20,127
give a few thoughts on how they relate to

869
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:20,127
the active inference institute and what

870
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:30,137
we're all doing here.

871
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:34,141
If you're watching live, please write

872
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:34,141
some questions or comments into the live

873
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:37,143
chat.

874
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:39,146
And at the end of this short address, we

875
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:39,146
will review any other comments or

876
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:39,146
questions from those who are here live,

877
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:39,146
give some last thoughts, and then we'll

878
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:49,156
be back into the work.

879
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:52,159
So I wanted to begin this address with a

880
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:52,159
reference to the work that was before

881
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:52,159
active inference institute, which was

882
00:39:52,159 --> 00:40:00,161
active inference lab.

883
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:02,163
But even before active inference lab,

884
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:02,163
there was the collaboration with Alex,

885
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:02,163
Ivan, Alexandra, RJ, and myself around

886
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:02,163
active inference and behavior engineering

887
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:11,172
for teams and organizations.

888
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:13,174
And this was in.

889
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:17,178
September 2020, only a few years ago, now

890
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:17,178
more than two, but less than three years

891
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:21,182
ago.

892
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:25,186
And it's amazing how far things have come

893
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:25,186
and at the same time how many of the

894
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:25,186
topics that we were able to bring into

895
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:25,186
this context of remote teams and

896
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:25,186
organizations still ring as relevant and

897
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:44,205
they're just gestured to here.

898
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:47,208
We've gone far towards enacting and

899
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:47,208
implementing and improving, but still we

900
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:47,208
can think about cognitive entities

901
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:47,208
engaged in the cyberphysical niche with

902
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:47,208
narrative and rhetoric structuring their

903
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:47,208
understanding of how sensory data

904
00:40:47,208 --> 00:41:05,220
translate into action.

905
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,223
So for people who are interested in this

906
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:08,223
topic, we invite you one way or another

907
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:08,223
to engage with us on this journey because

908
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:17,232
we are only going to do it all together.

909
00:41:17,232 --> 00:41:20,235
So I just wanted to begin with that kind

910
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:20,235
of callback to several years ago, though

911
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:20,235
so much has changed, certainly for all of

912
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:20,235
us in the times between that when we

913
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:20,235
really find first principles approaches

914
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:20,235
like active inference and when we really

915
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:20,235
care about systems of interest and

916
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:20,235
communities, then the actions that we

917
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:39,254
take, we don't regret.

918
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:42,257
But I think we can go into a little bit

919
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:42,257
more detail and reference some recent

920
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:42,257
developments in the active inference

921
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:42,257
ecosystem that speak to how day after day,

922
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:42,257
, week after week, our system of interest,

923
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:42,257
, active inference, learning and

924
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:42,257
application really gifts or blesses us

925
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:42,257
with new ways of thinking and new ways of

926
00:41:42,257 --> 00:42:02,271
acting.

927
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:04,273
So for example, just within the last

928
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:04,273
months, the inner screen model of

929
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:04,273
consciousness was released as a preprint

930
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:12,281
by Maxwell Ramstead et al.

931
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:14,283
Dealing with all these topics that we

932
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:14,283
know and love and building upon the

933
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:14,283
quantum free energy principle formalism,

934
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:14,283
which again, it's easy to forget, was not

935
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:24,293
even in place two years ago.

936
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:27,296
Discussed in Live stream number 40 and

937
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:27,296
weeks after publication, we're able to

938
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:27,296
enact a conversation hearing from voices

939
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:27,296
all over the world, bringing experts and

940
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:27,296
those with different backgrounds onto the

941
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:41,310
screen.

942
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:45,314
Here, the screen that you see is the

943
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:45,314
classical information depository that

944
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:45,314
enables us as quantum cognitive agents to

945
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:53,321
engage with each other.

946
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:56,325
And so all of these beautiful people on

947
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:56,325
the stream who with their regime of

948
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:56,325
attention and their quantum cognitive

949
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:56,325
rotation brought to bear their attention

950
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:56,325
and their language contribution through

951
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:56,325
action, we are able to inscribe that on

952
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:56,325
classical digital artifacts like live

953
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:56,325
streams and transcripts and then provide

954
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:56,325
it to the niche for all of you to rotate

955
00:42:56,325 --> 00:43:22,345
that into your own space and context.

956
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:25,348
So again, the spatial, temporal and

957
00:43:25,348 --> 00:43:25,348
conceptual linkages are happening at a

958
00:43:25,348 --> 00:43:30,353
speed that is boggling.

959
00:43:30,353 --> 00:43:33,356
And on the right is a paper from just

960
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:33,356
this month officially by Thomas Parr et

961
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:37,360
al.

962
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,362
Cognitive effort and active inference.

963
00:43:39,362 --> 00:43:42,365
And I have the image small because there'

964
00:43:42,365 --> 00:43:44,367
's more details to go into in the paper.

965
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:48,371
However, they used a well known model of

966
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:48,371
cognitive burden called a Stroop model,

967
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:48,371
which shows a color written out as a word

968
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:59,382
and that word is shown in some color.

969
00:43:59,382 --> 00:44:02,379
So the color red written in red, the

970
00:44:02,379 --> 00:44:02,379
color red written in blue, and the timing

971
00:44:02,379 --> 00:44:02,379
dynamics of people's reading behavior and

972
00:44:02,379 --> 00:44:02,379
recognition behavior is a proxy for

973
00:44:02,379 --> 00:44:12,388
cognitive effort.

974
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:15,392
And so this is just one more, not even

975
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:15,392
brick in the wall, not even just one tool

976
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:15,392
in the toolkit, but like another lens or

977
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:15,392
layer or ability or capacity for active

978
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:15,392
inference framework which adds these

979
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:33,410
features affect, memory, anticipation.

980
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:36,413
All these different features are layered

981
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:36,413
in like a symphony without developing

982
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:36,413
Bloat, because the first principles

983
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:36,413
kernel, the cognitive firmware, is not

984
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:36,413
getting Bloated, it is staying at first

985
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:49,426
principles.

986
00:44:49,426 --> 00:44:51,428
And sometimes it feels like even diving

987
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:52,429
down to zero with principles.

988
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:56,433
While advanced research in the space is

989
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:56,433
able to help us understand really

990
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:56,433
sophisticated cognitive phenomena like

991
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:56,433
cognitive effort, now one can look back

992
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:56,433
through the previous stream and what we

993
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:56,433
discussed and how could cognitive effort

994
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:56,433
help us support the accessibility, rigor

995
00:44:56,433 --> 00:45:15,446
and applicability of active inference?

996
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:18,449
It's such a natural question and again,

997
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:18,449
week after week, our niche provides us

998
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:23,454
with new ways of thinking and doing.

999
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:27,458
So it's so fun to be gripping and gripped

1000
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,460
within active inference.

1001
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,465
I'd like to recognize and commend jacob's,

1002
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:36,467
, excellent work.

1003
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:39,470
Just in April, we published Generalized

1004
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:39,470
Notation notation for active inference

1005
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:43,474
models.

1006
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:46,477
GNN generalized notation notation is a

1007
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:46,477
plain text format for conveying active

1008
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:51,482
inference generative models.

1009
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:54,485
It's something like a dialect of markdown

1010
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:54,485
and it brings us closer and closer to the

1011
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:58,489
triple play.

1012
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,486
The triple play is the idea that we

1013
00:46:01,486 --> 00:46:01,486
should have integrity amongst multiple

1014
00:46:01,486 --> 00:46:01,486
representations of active inference

1015
00:46:01,486 --> 00:46:08,493
models.

1016
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:11,496
That is, what we see visualized

1017
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:11,496
graphically or tangibly what we hear and

1018
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:11,496
say in terms of the natural language use

1019
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:11,496
and with executable cognitive simulations.

1020
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:23,508
.

1021
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:26,511
So if someone looks at an organizational

1022
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:26,511
flowchart and there's three A's connected

1023
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:26,511
to two B's, that is something that we can

1024
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:26,511
visualize, describe and execute so that

1025
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:26,511
there isn't a front and a back room

1026
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:39,524
conversation.

1027
00:46:39,524 --> 00:46:40,525
Rather, there's an integrated

1028
00:46:40,525 --> 00:46:40,525
conversation that allows for everybody to

1029
00:46:40,525 --> 00:46:40,525
make contributions in the modalities and

1030
00:46:40,525 --> 00:46:47,532
in the ways that they want.

1031
00:46:47,532 --> 00:46:50,535
And the interlingua, not the only

1032
00:46:50,535 --> 00:46:50,535
interlingua, and by no means its final

1033
00:46:50,535 --> 00:46:50,535
version is the plain text generalized

1034
00:46:50,535 --> 00:46:57,542
notation notation.

1035
00:46:57,542 --> 00:46:59,544
We're having a lot of fun working with

1036
00:46:59,544 --> 00:46:59,544
language models and visualizing this,

1037
00:46:59,544 --> 00:46:59,544
transforming it into executable

1038
00:46:59,544 --> 00:47:04,543
simulations.

1039
00:47:04,543 --> 00:47:07,546
And so thanks again, Yakup, for the

1040
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:07,546
really creative and dedicated work

1041
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:07,546
because this method is going to be a real

1042
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:07,546
core functionality for translating across

1043
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:07,546
visual elements, our natural languages

1044
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:07,546
and the kinds of simulations that we want

1045
00:47:07,546 --> 00:47:26,565
to run.

1046
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:30,569
And I'll close with a recent publication

1047
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:30,569
with Karl Friston et al., including

1048
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:35,574
myself and Bleu.

1049
00:47:35,574 --> 00:47:38,577
So two out of three officers on the paper,

1050
00:47:38,577 --> 00:47:39,578
, not terrible.

1051
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:42,581
And in this paper we used free energy

1052
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:42,581
principle and active inference to provide

1053
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:42,581
something like a measuring or an

1054
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:42,581
observability framework for ecology,

1055
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:42,581
evolution and development or ecoevo devo.

1056
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:55,594
.

1057
00:47:55,594 --> 00:47:58,597
And the way that this was done is through

1058
00:47:58,597 --> 00:48:00,593
the Renormalization group of physics.

1059
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:03,596
And so in this image on the left, we can

1060
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:03,596
see it as like maybe a bunch of cells

1061
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:03,596
which each contain organelles and those

1062
00:48:03,596 --> 00:48:10,603
cells make a tissue.

1063
00:48:10,603 --> 00:48:13,606
Or the big circle might be the population

1064
00:48:13,606 --> 00:48:17,610
of organisms or the ecosystem community.

1065
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:20,613
Again, recognizing the nested niche

1066
00:48:20,613 --> 00:48:20,613
engagement within and across levels of

1067
00:48:20,613 --> 00:48:20,613
spatial and temporal modeling and looking

1068
00:48:20,613 --> 00:48:20,613
at just two layers and how they're

1069
00:48:20,613 --> 00:48:20,613
connected, we can think of that as a

1070
00:48:20,613 --> 00:48:38,631
nested action perception cycle.

1071
00:48:38,631 --> 00:48:40,633
So here's, like the sensory and the

1072
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:40,633
behavior of a worm, in this case,

1073
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:40,633
happening at whatever timescale it's

1074
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:40,633
being modeled at, and then at the slower

1075
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:40,633
or the deeper level of the hierarchical

1076
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:40,633
model, we have the Bayesian learning like

1077
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:40,633
process of the extended genotype

1078
00:48:40,633 --> 00:49:00,647
happening in a slower adaptive layer.

1079
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:04,651
And so this should clearly connect to

1080
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:04,651
what we said at the very beginning of the

1081
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:04,651
stream about the institute as part of a

1082
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:13,660
nested system.

1083
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,663
Here we have the ecosystem, the space

1084
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:19,666
around here's, the institute.

1085
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:22,669
This is what it really means to enter and

1086
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:22,669
to join, not just to look into, but to be

1087
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:28,675
on or in the institute.

1088
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:32,679
And then the kinds of dynamic partitions

1089
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:32,679
that we're able to embody within the

1090
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:32,679
institute through our communications and

1091
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:40,687
through our actions.

1092
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:43,690
And so it's just so exciting to see

1093
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:43,690
everyone's incredible research

1094
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:43,690
contributions, the kinds of questions and

1095
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:43,690
developments that even if I were not an

1096
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:43,690
author, even if I were not in the active

1097
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:43,690
inference field, I would believe are at

1098
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:43,690
least the right things to be trying in

1099
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:43,690
terms of bringing theoretical integration

1100
00:49:43,690 --> 00:50:08,709
in ecology, evolution and development.

1101
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,712
At least these are the right research

1102
00:50:11,712 --> 00:50:11,712
avenues.

1103
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:15,716
But then again, to be able to act infer

1104
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:15,716
and serve through the institute as a

1105
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:15,716
multiscale evolutionary entity in and of

1106
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:15,716
itself, this kind of real time enactment

1107
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:15,716
of multiple scales and quantum reference

1108
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:15,716
frames is something that is only arising

1109
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:36,737
through cocreation.

1110
00:50:36,737 --> 00:50:40,741
So in closing, I send my deepest

1111
00:50:40,741 --> 00:50:40,741
appreciation to all those who support and

1112
00:50:40,741 --> 00:50:45,746
care and engage.

1113
00:50:46,747 --> 00:50:50,751
To those who are not sure, I welcome you

1114
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:50,751
to the past, the present and the future

1115
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:50,751
we respect and that's why we do what we

1116
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:58,759
do.

1117
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:05,760
So Alex, where do we go or what is next?

1118
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:14,769
Alex: Yeah, thank you very much for the

1119
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:14,769
talk and really providing that vision

1120
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:14,769
from the beginning and how it's going now

1121
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:14,769
and congratulations on that publication

1122
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:31,786
on evolutionary work.

1123
00:51:31,786 --> 00:51:35,790
And it's a great opening direction and I

1124
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:35,790
believe this direction will make a next

1125
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:44,799
step into technical evolution also.

1126
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:48,803
And we will use this technique, evolution

1127
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:48,803
approach to develop institute candidacy

1128
00:51:48,803 --> 00:51:52,807
system.

1129
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:56,811
Daniel: Yes, I'll just wait a few more

1130
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:57,812
seconds.

1131
00:51:57,812 --> 00:52:00,809
If anyone writes a question that we can

1132
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:00,809
address in the live chat, let's look at

1133
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:00,809
some of these questions that we look at

1134
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:08,817
at the end of every live stream.

1135
00:52:08,817 --> 00:52:10,819
What would a good understanding enable?

1136
00:52:10,819 --> 00:52:12,821
Well, if we were able to really

1137
00:52:12,821 --> 00:52:12,821
understand our own generative model as

1138
00:52:12,821 --> 00:52:12,821
the institute and as the active inference

1139
00:52:12,821 --> 00:52:12,821
ecosystem, it would support our sense

1140
00:52:12,821 --> 00:52:22,831
making and decision making.

1141
00:52:22,831 --> 00:52:25,834
We'd be able to act and infer and serve

1142
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:25,834
better.

1143
00:52:26,835 --> 00:52:28,837
What are the unique predictions and

1144
00:52:28,837 --> 00:52:29,838
implications?

1145
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:32,841
That's a very interesting question.

1146
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:36,845
I'm sure there are many ways to address

1147
00:52:36,845 --> 00:52:36,845
this and we did have many future oriented

1148
00:52:36,845 --> 00:52:36,845
expressions during this discussion, even

1149
00:52:36,845 --> 00:52:42,851
today.

1150
00:52:44,853 --> 00:52:46,855
What are the next steps for free energy

1151
00:52:46,855 --> 00:52:48,857
principle and active inference?

1152
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:50,859
Again, do you have any thoughts on this

1153
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:51,859
one?

1154
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:52,861
The middle question or the second

1155
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:52,861
question?

1156
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:53,862
Alex.

1157
00:52:57,866 --> 00:53:01,864
Alex: Delivered and unique predictions

1158
00:53:01,864 --> 00:53:01,864
and next steps depends on some specific

1159
00:53:01,864 --> 00:53:09,872
field or domain for ourselves.

1160
00:53:09,872 --> 00:53:13,876
We understand that active inference is a

1161
00:53:13,876 --> 00:53:13,876
scale free approach and it can be applied

1162
00:53:13,876 --> 00:53:20,883
to any scale of research.

1163
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:24,887
Any domain which any researcher or

1164
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:24,887
engineer is working on can be described

1165
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:24,887
with active inference language starting

1166
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:24,887
from where using accordances to

1167
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:24,887
computational modeling or types of

1168
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:41,904
modeling and so on.

1169
00:53:44,907 --> 00:53:44,907
Yeah.

1170
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:48,911
Daniel: What are the goals of the

1171
00:53:48,911 --> 00:53:48,911
research?

1172
00:53:50,913 --> 00:53:53,916
To embody our mission to support the

1173
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:53,916
active inference ecosystem, to be the

1174
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:53,916
best institute we can be, be the best

1175
00:53:53,916 --> 00:54:00,917
nest mates within it.

1176
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:01,918
What do you think?

1177
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:07,924
Alex: Maybe we should remove goals.

1178
00:54:08,925 --> 00:54:10,927
Daniel: Let's change it to preferences.

1179
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:12,929
Alex: Yeah, at least.

1180
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:19,936
And considering it in open endedness way.

1181
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:19,936
.

1182
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:22,939
Again, we can speak about goals, but

1183
00:54:22,939 --> 00:54:26,943
looks like it's not so useful concept.

1184
00:54:26,943 --> 00:54:30,947
Daniel: Yes, sometimes when we're talking

1185
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
about the specific research papers, we

1186
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
talk about the goal of that paper, but

1187
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
goal is not to be found in the active

1188
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
inference ontology and we find ways of

1189
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:30,947
making do and thriving without needing to

1190
00:54:30,947 --> 00:54:49,965
rest upon goals and reward.

1191
00:54:49,966 --> 00:54:50,967
And that's really exciting.

1192
00:54:50,967 --> 00:54:54,971
And that's something that a lot of people

1193
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:54,971
don't even realize that they're steeped

1194
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:54,971
in reward maximization and goal

1195
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:54,971
implementation until the open endedness

1196
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:54,971
and the vitality of active inference

1197
00:54:54,971 --> 00:55:08,979
becomes understood.

1198
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,982
What are you still curious about?

1199
00:55:12,983 --> 00:55:14,985
I'll let you go first, then I'll give a

1200
00:55:14,985 --> 00:55:15,985
last thought.

1201
00:55:15,986 --> 00:55:15,986
As we close.

1202
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:22,993
Alex: I always remember our discussions

1203
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:22,993
about sense of the word curious in the

1204
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:26,997
beginning.

1205
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,006
It's like I believe more and more curious

1206
00:55:35,006 --> 00:55:41,012
with week each day, each month.

1207
00:55:41,012 --> 00:55:44,015
What our field, our frontier are showing

1208
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
us so much, a lot of different

1209
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
perspectives, different connections, real

1210
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:44,015
people in communications and projects and

1211
00:55:44,015 --> 00:55:55,026
so on.

1212
00:55:55,026 --> 00:55:57,028
So it's happiness.

1213
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:00,025
Daniel: Very beautiful.

1214
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:05,030
I'm curious about many things like that.

1215
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:08,033
You said that we develop and hone that

1216
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:08,033
curiosity every day and we seek to spark

1217
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:08,033
and be sparked when people come in from

1218
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:08,033
different backgrounds with their

1219
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:17,042
curiosities.

1220
00:56:18,043 --> 00:56:21,046
It's inspiring, to say the least.

1221
00:56:21,046 --> 00:56:24,049
And I'm really curious about who will

1222
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,049
have listened or read this far in the

1223
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,049
stream and choose that moment to take an

1224
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:24,049
action to get involved with the institute.

1225
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:33,058
.

1226
00:56:33,058 --> 00:56:35,060
So there's only one way that my

1227
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:35,060
uncertainty is going to be reduced about

1228
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:37,062
that.

1229
00:56:37,062 --> 00:56:39,064
And I think if you know, you know.

1230
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:40,065
So.

1231
00:56:40,065 --> 00:56:41,066
Thank you, Alex.

1232
00:56:41,066 --> 00:56:42,067
Thank you, .

1233
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:45,070
Thank you to the officers and to all of

1234
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,071
the institute.

1235
00:56:47,072 --> 00:56:48,073
See you around.

1236
00:56:49,074 --> 00:56:50,075
Alex: Thank you.

1237
00:56:50,075 --> 00:56:51,075
Thank you.
