00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,540
hello everyone welcome

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,980
to the active inference Institute

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,700
quarterly Roundtable number two in 2023.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,960
it's June 30th 2023 and this is going to

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,779
be our quarterly updates and ways that

6
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,760
you can participate at The Institute and

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,920
in the active ecosystem

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,199
so welcome to the octave inference

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,779
Institute we're a participatory online

10
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,700
Institute that is communicating learning

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,620
and practicing applied active inference

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,719
you can find us at the links on this

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,239
page and note that we'll be

14
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,340
transitioning our emails over from

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,379
activeinference gmail.com towards

16
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,640
activeinference.institute domains

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,620
this is recorded in an archive live

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,420
stream so please provide us with

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,879
feedback so that we can improve our work

20
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,800
all backgrounds and perspectives are

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,320
welcome and we'll be following video

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,660
etiquette for live streams

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,840
today in the quarterly meeting number

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,780
two of the year we'll start at The

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,659
Institute scale give some updates at The

26
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,880
Institute level and then we'll look a

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,860
little bit deeper into primarily

28
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,680
education but also research and then

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,080
I'll have some closing Thoughts by way

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,720
of a presidential address about where

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,939
we're at with active inference and if

32
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,979
you're watching live please write

33
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,100
comments and questions in the live chat

34
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,320
and we will look to address those during

35
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,939
okay so starting with the uh Institute

36
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,820
scale some updates coming from The

37
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,179
Institute

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,759
here's one way that we can visualize

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,799
the octave inference Institute in June

40
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,420
2023

41
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,060
we are within the active inference

42
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,280
ecosystem as well as within other

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,840
ecosystems

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,680
and we have a nested structure Alex

45
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,180
would you like to describe this

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,400
oh yeah I think for these moments it's

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,560
great to see this structure and

48
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,140
understand what that is actually in

49
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,200
place and working and acting and

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,520
adapting

51
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,599
and from very beginning we considered

52
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,560
From perspective of systems thinking and

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,660
From perspective of act different

54
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,180
currents we always think about some kind

55
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,860
of Mass state and hierarchical structure

56
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,099
which can be builded and structured

57
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,420
accordingly

58
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,700
so having it right now

59
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,920
like embodied

60
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,500
it's great to see it

61
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,019
totally agree at The Institute scale

62
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,640
where these first updates are going to

63
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,300
come from we have the officers the board

64
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,700
of directors and the scientific Advisory

65
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,480
Board

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,640
we have two organizational units which

67
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,980
Steward the development and support

68
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,000
participation in projects and projects

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,819
and learning groups are really where it

70
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,340
happens on the ground and so we're going

71
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,900
to talk a lot more about these but this

72
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,319
is the nesting and our own relationship

73
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,140
with the ecosystem

74
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,860
another way to to see this is in terms

75
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,280
of people and positions at The Institute

76
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,640
so starting from the left we have casual

77
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,920
engagement with our products and

78
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,200
services into the niche so this might be

79
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,480
the very video that you're listening to

80
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,340
or watching right now it could be the

81
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,319
transcript of this video that you're

82
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,720
reading it might be the active inference

83
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,519
ontology it might be the active block

84
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,920
for a software package there's all these

85
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,959
different open source products and

86
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,760
services that we provide to the niche

87
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,239
and one moment you will decide to

88
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,040
participate in a project or a learning

89
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,680
group and that can be more towards

90
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,420
learning more towards the doing and

91
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,519
leveraging your contributions at The

92
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,760
Institute and some participants will

93
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,220
choose to solidify their participation

94
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,400
through volunteering or engaging with

95
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,399
the internship program both of which are

96
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,160
new and really excitingly developing

97
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,478
well

98
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:22,800
and then

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,320
we haven't listed any names of the the

100
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,360
many of you who are in all of these

101
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,340
different stages

102
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,560
and you may want to

103
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,020
play another role or another position in

104
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,180
the Institute such as the scientific

105
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,759
Advisory board board of directors or the

106
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,800
officers so

107
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,900
a lot of appreciation and thanks to

108
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,380
everybody who's shown and not shown on

109
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,840
this slide

110
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,580
um we are really appreciative of how you

111
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,400
all show up for the Institute

112
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,020
Alex want to add anything on that

113
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,800
um yeah even from this slide we can say

114
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,840
that a lot of people are already

115
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,740
involved in activity and provide great

116
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,259
insights and different perspective and

117
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,280
backgrounds and experience

118
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,740
and yes a lot of people not showing here

119
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,580
but we know when through our community

120
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,320
platforms and so on

121
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,479
so you can see this progress in terms of

122
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,880
participation in activities and it's

123
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,199
also great progress

124
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,500
all right moving on we are excited that

125
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,960
for our third applied active inference

126
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,380
Symposium to be held in August we will

127
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,660
have the theme of enacting ecosystems of

128
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,060
shared intelligence active inference as

129
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,340
a cognitive kernel we have a really

130
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,360
Broad and Global co-organizer team which

131
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,639
is very exciting so thanks to everybody

132
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,800
who's in the co-organizing team for this

133
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,919
Symposium we're just getting started on

134
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,800
the organization so in the coming days

135
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,840
and weeks we'll be providing more

136
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,780
information on participating in a more

137
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,080
formal call for presenters

138
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,880
however if you're listening to this

139
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,979
message now and you are really excited

140
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:26,039
to do a presentation or a workshop or

141
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,380
mentorship and be a part of the active

142
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,840
inference ecosystem then please reach

143
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,160
out to us

144
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,479
Alex anything you want to add here

145
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,000
but actually yes I think

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,400
we can remember but it will be a third

147
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,319
symposium

148
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,380
and it's cool but we have but here

149
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,419
earlier written

150
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,300
for this type of activity and hopefully

151
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,740
this event

152
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,560
bring us and for people who will

153
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,180
participate

154
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,000
you know insights connections and

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,520
ground for future developments in the

156
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,880
research

157
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,080
all right just uh

158
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,000
summarize and update a few of the

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,360
Institute level programs so volunteering

160
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,460
at the Institute

161
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,180
it's a way to engage it is just making

162
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,639
it that much easier to get involved with

163
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,860
one or more projects and to start to get

164
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,500
that recognition from The Institute

165
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,360
understanding your contributions and

166
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,880
also on your own resume your own work

167
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,180
history your portfolio

168
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,220
volunteering is really an incredible way

169
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,620
to learn by doing if you want to apply

170
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,720
or learn about organizational active

171
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,099
inference or if you want to think about

172
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,259
communication as active inference

173
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,419
education in the context of active

174
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,720
inference gripper and the gripped if you

175
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,340
want a perspective Swap and see it

176
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,979
multiple ways learning by doing on a

177
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:58,620
project through volunteering we hope is

178
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,319
a really unique opportunity and what you

179
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,620
do will and does really matter so if

180
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,240
you're taking notes on the margin of

181
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,180
some paper or if you're developing lists

182
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,220
that you felt like help your onboarding

183
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,560
into active inference you can make a

184
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,620
leveraged contribution by sharing that

185
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,900
kind of information or if you're not

186
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,180
quite sure what type of contribution or

187
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,280
the impact you would have we can help

188
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,000
find that kind of a niche for you

189
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,180
the internship program is

190
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,339
being a volunteer but wanting a little

191
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:35,039
bit more structure around that we have

192
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,799
about 20 currently active interns from

193
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,500
all around the world different

194
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,719
backgrounds levels of technical

195
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,159
familiarity with the active inference

196
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,560
ranging from truly some of the people

197
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,800
who I believe are experts to people who

198
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,660
just found out about active inference

199
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,360
and wanted to use this program to

200
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,940
accelerate their learning a lot

201
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,300
also in the last weeks and months I

202
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,980
would like to commend the two

203
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,080
individuals who know who they are who

204
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,660
have completed their internship this has

205
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,760
really been a great honor to work with

206
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,060
you both of you and to those who are

207
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,000
still active I look forward to seeing

208
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,920
those updates and continuing to work

209
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,140
with you the internship consists of

210
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,260
learning doing and also mentorship and

211
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,140
facilitation so interns tend to

212
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,140
participate in one or more course or

213
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,480
textbook group or maybe help out with

214
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,820
some live streams

215
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,519
interns engage on projects and that is

216
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,480
usually

217
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,660
a minimum of two projects one is hosted

218
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,279
at The Institute so some of the projects

219
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,080
that we'll look at later in this round

220
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,720
table but then also most of the interns

221
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,420
have a personal or background research

222
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,820
agenda so sometimes they make very small

223
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,640
contributions to an Institute project

224
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,800
but they're working really diligently on

225
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,260
their dissertation or on their hobby

226
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,779
project other times it's most of the

227
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,640
contribution to the Institute project

228
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,740
and then a little bit of self-guided

229
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,680
research and we try to provide our

230
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,660
interns with Support over multiple

231
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,440
spatial and temporal scales

232
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,620
foreign

233
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,620
engagement in the broader digital cyber

234
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,339
physical Niche we continue to grow on

235
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:25,620
our different platforms and channels

236
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,180
though these are just proxy measures in

237
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,779
our Discord podcast Twitter and YouTube

238
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,959
as well as mailing lists so we continue

239
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,440
to communicate out to those who want to

240
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,620
hear

241
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,980
here's a big picture on Institute

242
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,100
activities and you can find this

243
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,800
information at the activities page

244
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,019
that's uh listed here

245
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,260
at the top we have type of project

246
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,000
publication

247
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,220
live streams such as the one happening

248
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,779
right now and the active inference

249
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,880
Journal which picks up when the live

250
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,459
stream hits stop and transcribes and

251
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,220
curates publishes that transcript which

252
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,600
we'll talk more about

253
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,760
so live streams in journal are a great

254
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,839
pair

255
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,779
in the active block prints project we

256
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,180
continue to build the soft and hard

257
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,740
skills

258
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,079
associated with generative modeling in

259
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,720
the active inference tradition and so we

260
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,899
use the complex adaptive systems

261
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:32,519
modeling framework cadcad to implement

262
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,019
different active inference generative

263
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,779
models this is a really great place a

264
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,839
lot of discussions about modeling

265
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,320
Robotics and embodied JF claudger

266
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,680
continues to offer his expertise and

267
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,600
updates from this really incredible

268
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,899
project where real Lego robots are

269
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,940
implementing symbolic active inference

270
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,980
so thanks Jeff for

271
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,800
hosting this project the way you do

272
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,440
in the active inference ontology we

273
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,980
continue to refine and update the octave

274
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,920
inference ontology which is the real

275
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,959
language that we speak whether it

276
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,940
happens to be deployed in English or

277
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,980
visually or in a programming language or

278
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,680
however the active inference ontology is

279
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,540
how we're communicating and we develop

280
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,300
that and offer it as a service to the

281
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,760
niche in this project

282
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,399
we have multiple ongoing learning groups

283
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,140
which we'll talk more about soon but we

284
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,880
have a textbook group with par at all

285
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,240
the 2022 active inference textbook we

286
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,880
have sanjiv namjoshi who's writing a

287
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,279
really incredible work that will be a

288
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,560
textbook published as fundamentals of

289
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,200
active inference and we're Alpha Testing

290
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,540
along with Sanjeev and right there

291
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,639
alongside him so thanks Sanji for

292
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,980
bringing this work in progress to The

293
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,200
Institute and to to really sticking with

294
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,399
the trouble

295
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,839
this is going to be an incredible

296
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,399
product

297
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,339
and we have two courses one on physics

298
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,740
as information processing and one on

299
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,480
active inference for the social sciences

300
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,820
which we'll address soon and also

301
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,339
multiple times per week in our Discord

302
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,860
we have open discussions for Education

303
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,680
and Research so if this is all a lot or

304
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,019
you're not sure about anything probably

305
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,600
the best way to just drop in and find

306
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,760
out would be to check out when and how

307
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,860
we're meeting and come to the open

308
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,959
discussions if you just want to like

309
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,360
see what's up anything you want to add

310
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,079
there Alex

311
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,480
yeah

312
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,920
good to see that projects are active and

313
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,120
the mostly maybe for last period of time

314
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,959
it's uh having that new courses which

315
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,779
will describe later but

316
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,540
heaven and feeling me it's growing

317
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,260
it's provide great

318
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,600
opportunities for second half of the

319
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,800
year

320
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,420
so true

321
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,820
in the first quarterly Round Table we

322
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,720
had no courses but as of now we can say

323
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,760
that there are two courses that are

324
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,740
really pushing the frontier of education

325
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,860
and even research in Quantum information

326
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,820
sciences and in social sciences so

327
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,760
thanks again we'll get to those soon

328
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,680
all right let's dive into a little more

329
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,740
detail on eduactive so

330
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,200
Alex would you like to first introduce

331
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,779
and give a little thoughts on the active

332
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,639
inference qualification system draft

333
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,740
yeah we put it here like for now it's

334
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,220
education iterative scale but future

335
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,060
it's uh will be

336
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,699
applied for all

337
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:56,160
Institute structure and activities we

338
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,360
should have some Cornerstone in terms of

339
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,380
how we can measure

340
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,760
effectiveness of our educational

341
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,560
activities and Educational Services

342
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,199
in the beginning to understand courses

343
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,320
and our materials how

344
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,740
we change actually someone's mind and

345
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,199
how deep this might need to be changed

346
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,899
in some formal sense

347
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:31,940
and we take we not started from

348
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,240
Greenfield we just take one of a stable

349
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,899
system of qualifications level

350
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:41,880
from European

351
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,380
and adapted for how we can see it in

352
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,240
application to active inference and

353
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,880
participations and projects and so on

354
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,120
and for now we have a basic draft and

355
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,880
we'll have discussions around these

356
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,279
interested parties and different skills

357
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,380
of Institute and finally have some

358
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,600
some stable form location will apply to

359
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,639
a different direction

360
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,199
thanks

361
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,660
I'll just add a few notes on this first

362
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,339
just echoing your last point if you're

363
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,399
interested in active inference

364
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,040
professionalization education

365
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,600
qualification systems even as a Critic

366
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,760
we would really love to have you in the

367
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,860
game so please participate early

368
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,959
participate often and I'll just

369
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,060
highlight a few pieces of this system

370
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,860
draft

371
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,839
that are really exciting

372
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,899
first it begins at level zero which

373
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,560
everybody de facto can have perhaps even

374
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,139
upon or before birth

375
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,259
then as the levels proceed

376
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,120
active inference is always being

377
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,459
connected with domains and systems of

378
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:54,240
Interest so it's about yes and with

379
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,399
active inference about connecting active

380
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,180
inference to other fields and topics

381
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,139
understanding a different domain's

382
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,319
ontology robotics or Neuroscience or

383
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,900
pure mathematics whatever it may be

384
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,660
and working with active inference as you

385
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,679
gain knowledge of the ontology and of

386
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,140
the details of active inference but it's

387
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,480
not just a knowledge-based qualification

388
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,859
system

389
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,939
we also are looking to integrate skills

390
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:26,880
and even project responsibility and

391
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,940
autonomy so just to give kind of an

392
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,260
example of this

393
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,740
levels one and two again currently very

394
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,500
tentative drafts so for your engagement

395
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,539
but in levels one and two

396
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,360
people are able to act as basic Learners

397
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,980
and collaborators

398
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,460
and begin to get a grasp on what terms

399
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,559
we're using in active inference and how

400
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,539
do those Concepts relate to their field

401
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,400
of interest and we see this every single

402
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,799
day in the textbook group and in

403
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,960
discussions someone says oh I'm working

404
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,780
as a physical therapist and so in action

405
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,480
that's like the person moving their arm

406
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,900
that is where these levels are targeted

407
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,539
level three begins to get into

408
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,700
describing and understanding some of the

409
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,039
technical details of what we do

410
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,799
level four begins to approach the

411
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,160
evaluation and recapitulation

412
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,820
of technical models in active inference

413
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,000
level five is related to comprehensive

414
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,940
development and implementation as well

415
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,059
as in the projects and autonomy

416
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,120
exerting more supervision for self and

417
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,679
others

418
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,760
level six developing Advanced skills

419
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,400
level seven engaging with very

420
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,860
specialized problem-solving skills

421
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,640
and level eight engaging in synthesis

422
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,160
evaluation and critical problem solving

423
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,419
so

424
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:56,880
again can't emphasize enough it's just a

425
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,820
draft and we are calling for your

426
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,320
participation if this is something that

427
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,299
you would be interested in using or

428
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,700
engaging with but we think this is going

429
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,740
to be a really important direction for

430
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,440
the active inference ecosystem

431
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,820
carry on

432
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,500
to the textbook group

433
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,780
so in the active inference textbook

434
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,679
group

435
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,620
we are working on and through the par

436
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,520
pazulo and friston 2022 textbook

437
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,760
currently we have cohort three

438
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,500
working on the second half of the book

439
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,740
and cohort four on the first half of the

440
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,640
book

441
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,400
together these two cohorts compromise

442
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,620
about 150 people

443
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,559
not every person joins every meeting

444
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,000
some people engage with the recordings

445
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,400
asynchronously other people are in our

446
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,820
shared epistemic niche just gleaning and

447
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,960
contributing

448
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,480
to this kind of collaborative

449
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,419
stigmergic process

450
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,160
as educators

451
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,860
were focused on the continual delivery

452
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,679
and deployment of questions and

453
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,840
enrichment and discourse and just some

454
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,539
ways that this plays out here are for

455
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,880
example questions that people have asked

456
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,820
live or before or after a synchronous

457
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,400
meeting where we can connect the

458
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,440
specific figures and the ontology terms

459
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,419
to people's uncertainties

460
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,100
and

461
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,780
on the right

462
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,299
is an example of an equation here's the

463
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,660
variational free energy equation 2.5 and

464
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,600
the way that we can use the ontology to

465
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,660
unpack and connect some of the dots with

466
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,400
these equations and in the last few

467
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,299
weeks

468
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,220
we've actually taken that even further

469
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,100
and explored how to use language models

470
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,100
through code AI in this process so here

471
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,539
we have equations 2.1 and equations 2.2

472
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,960
they are being rendered in coda

473
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,900
via typing in latex

474
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,120
and then we are using language models

475
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,520
within Coda to provide explanations

476
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,419
contextualizations for different

477
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:06,059
backgrounds and expertises and also

478
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,360
translation into different languages

479
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,500
describing the variables and the

480
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,620
notation and the who what and why so

481
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,980
this has been a pretty fun Avenue and a

482
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,020
really cool example of how language

483
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,360
models and education can be hand in hand

484
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,380
and Empower our own learning by using

485
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,140
all kinds of models to help us where

486
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,120
frankly it can be quite challenging

487
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,100
which is in understanding some of the

488
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,720
analytical details of the framework

489
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,220
anything you want to add Alex

490
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,159
this is that type of technology which

491
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:43,799
looks like magic

492
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:47,720
and but and then but

493
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,299
heaven in place ontology

494
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:54,659
which is nicely integrated for Coda

495
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:59,520
again to all projects it's really

496
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,080
like imagine

497
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,260
for this car

498
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:08,780
which which is getting more and more big

499
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:11,520
cool

500
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,020
okay

501
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,960
in May 2023 we began our first course at

502
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,600
The Institute and that was physics as

503
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,179
information processing being taught by

504
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,520
one of the leading researchers in the

505
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,260
area Chris fields

506
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,960
and with a math PhD course assistant

507
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,500
Andre Aguirre so Chris thank you for

508
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,659
stepping up again from a scientific

509
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,659
Advisory Board to offer this truly

510
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,600
incredible and unique educational

511
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,220
experience

512
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,539
we've had

513
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:50,880
massive response

514
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,720
dozens of registrants who want to engage

515
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,260
in the participatory discussions that

516
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,380
happen in between your lectures

517
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,120
the second discussion being tomorrow for

518
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,200
those who want to join and 1500 views of

519
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,760
the first lecture in a month there's

520
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,460
many people who are following along the

521
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,980
course syllabus is explicit and

522
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,360
innovative

523
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,480
we have a question and answer system so

524
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,940
that people can ask questions

525
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,860
asynchronously Chris then answers them

526
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,020
and we have them posted again through

527
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,419
this interactive Coda interface and

528
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:28,980
that's really supporting an incredible

529
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,460
level of discourse and participation all

530
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,220
transcripts are going to be curated and

531
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,799
published along with the questions and

532
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,480
answers and some other supplemental

533
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,620
information

534
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,780
so this has been a really great

535
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,820
experience and something new over the

536
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,400
last few months

537
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,200
anything you want to add I'm tempted to

538
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,960
just talk about how cool the

539
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,240
Quantum information free energy

540
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,940
principle is but but perhaps now is not

541
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,360
the moment

542
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,960
um for me it's uh

543
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,840
uh like historically for my all the

544
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,179
ground stop change from beginning on

545
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:13,140
this uh Century starting from I.T

546
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,460
technology

547
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,340
technologist and computer science and

548
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,440
this notion of information processing

549
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,980
it always was like in Engineering in

550
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,039
engineering stands like a work in field

551
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,919
and working domain

552
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,580
and but I always had that need and

553
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,480
feeling for first principles for physics

554
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,039
in place

555
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,120
and for now seeing with that latest

556
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,400
developments on Quantum Quantum

557
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,640
information Theory and how it's nicely

558
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,340
connects to free energy and active

559
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,559
inference it's really really great to

560
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:58,799
have this Frontier curves

561
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:04,440
uh in place in our activities and

562
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,580
really really great thanks to police and

563
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,020
Hunter

564
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,380
and I believe that it's a kind of

565
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,539
starting point

566
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:19,020
maybe 10 years after we'll come back all

567
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,360
together and discuss how this course

568
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,600
started so great changes for different

569
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,480
ecosystems

570
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,059
thank you Alex totally agree

571
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,860
and also

572
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,400
we are fresh off the presses happy to

573
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,320
announce the second course that we'll be

574
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,779
offering at The Institute which is

575
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:42,240
constructing cultural landscapes active

576
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,700
inference for the social sciences and

577
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,700
this is going to be a

578
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,440
multi-teacher massively participatory

579
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,520
course

580
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,840
Avail of Kairos research thank you for

581
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,020
taking the initiative to suggest even

582
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,820
this possibility

583
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,940
and Ben and Mal Lorena thanks a lot for

584
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,279
joining on for the journey

585
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,059
on July 7th we will begin and it will

586
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:12,539
have some lecture sessions as well as

587
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:15,179
participatory discussion sections all

588
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:16,919
sessions sessions

589
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,299
are free

590
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,279
they'll be live streamed and rewatchable

591
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,320
the transcripts will be curated and

592
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,600
published into a book at the end of the

593
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,140
year and this is going to be a really

594
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,840
great on-ramp and space for people with

595
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,520
the humanities or social sciences

596
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,760
background so we've heard

597
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,580
people waiting for such a thing it was

598
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,000
aval's Insight that such a course could

599
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,500
be hosted

600
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,320
at Kairos research and at the Active

601
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,240
inference Institute so

602
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,580
thanks to all the teachers here and just

603
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,120
really looking forward to how you tackle

604
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,580
and engage with this question of active

605
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,100
inference in the social sciences

606
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,120
anything you want to add

607
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,840
uh yeah like this two different courses

608
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,200
like from

609
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,179
different to distant scales like from

610
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:15,240
Quantum scale and social scale and

611
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,179
possibly it's like two different ends of

612
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,059
spectrum in which we can work on with

613
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:23,340
our research and education

614
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,880
but it's great that this step to social

615
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,299
sciences because it brings active

616
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:32,700
influence and it's formal and first

617
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,279
place principled framework

618
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,419
into the domain which

619
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:42,900
haven't got it before and

620
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,220
now it's a great beginning also and our

621
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,460
scales between Quantum and social

622
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:56,539
will be on us to work on next years

623
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,620
yes and uh the kind of Aura Boris or

624
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,659
horseshoe Theory with Quantum social

625
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:06,260
sciences

626
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,520
onto the live streams so a lot to say of

627
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,900
course a little bit meta since we're on

628
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,419
a live stream right now but I'll just

629
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:17,760
note a few things

630
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,419
um first across our different series

631
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:24,260
we now have

632
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:29,520
336 completed or planned live streams so

633
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,260
most of those have already happened but

634
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,240
there are several that are planned but

635
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,799
we're over 300 completed and 336 as of

636
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,539
now being planned

637
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:42,539
and even just specifically looking at

638
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:45,720
the next 30 days we have just such a

639
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,299
breadth and depth

640
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:51,120
it's quite exciting to to watch let

641
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,640
alone to enact we'll have the Chris

642
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,020
Fields course

643
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,659
a discussion section a lecture and then

644
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,700
another discussion section we'll begin

645
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,380
the active inference for the social

646
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,000
sciences course with avell Ben having

647
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,320
contributions

648
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,679
we'll have a guest stream with

649
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,500
professors from around the world

650
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,059
researchers all these different topics

651
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:18,059
being able to be slotted in with a

652
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,460
really great way to platform and give

653
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,679
visibility and catalyze discussion

654
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,100
around these incredible researchers

655
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,120
work so it's really exciting and it

656
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,700
would be great not going to say it's

657
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,860
specifically a personal request but if

658
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,340
you choose to read it as such then great

659
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,140
it would be awesome to have more

660
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,960
assistance with participating and

661
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,260
preparing and enacting live streams we

662
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,380
have a role-based ways of planning and

663
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,020
preparing and enacting live streams so

664
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,399
whether you want to play a more

665
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:55,980
technical or operational or logistical

666
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,480
role if you want to be a conversational

667
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,000
facilitator if you want to do it in a

668
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,620
different language if you want to do a

669
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,360
series there's so many ways that you can

670
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,279
get involved but it would just be

671
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,059
awesome to have more voices on the live

672
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,340
stream and just be able to continue

673
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:16,500
offering these kinds of resources at

674
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,840
even faster rate with increased

675
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,179
professionalization and I know that

676
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,000
there's many people out there who

677
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,279
would be incredible contributors to

678
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,799
broadcast and or facilitate

679
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,740
everyone is also welcome to

680
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,299
self-nominate or suggest or introduce

681
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:35,279
somebody who you think would fit well on

682
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,020
a stream if it's like a perspective that

683
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,000
we haven't heard from that would be

684
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,380
really important

685
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,600
there's a lot of background Technical

686
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,840
and educational work on the dot zero

687
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,260
videos when we do a paper discussion so

688
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,299
if there's a paper that you want to have

689
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:54,779
a a million x leveraged contribution on

690
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:57,539
your preparation around

691
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:00,779
if we discuss that in a live stream and

692
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:03,299
you're able to help before with the dot

693
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:06,600
zero you'll be a co-author on a research

694
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,640
publication of the transcript

695
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,500
and you'll have made an absolutely

696
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,320
unique Irreplaceable contribution to

697
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,299
active inference knowledge

698
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,520
with what you did in your diligence in

699
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,100
the dot zero so for people who hear that

700
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,620
calling that's incredibly important

701
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,299
we invite people to share the live

702
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,700
streams on social media or with their

703
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,159
colleagues however they find it relevant

704
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:31,860
like if there's a topic or a person that

705
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,039
has come up on our streams sharing it

706
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,380
where relevant will help bring people in

707
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,260
and also we have weekly live stream

708
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,700
meetings so if you just want to find out

709
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,740
like what we do and how we do it in the

710
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,620
live streams then I would recommend that

711
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,960
you join the regular meetings and if you

712
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,580
really want to join but that time never

713
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,399
works for you then email and let us know

714
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:54,840
that you're specifically interested

715
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,760
we'll find a different time

716
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,140
any other comments there Alex

717
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:11,120
oh this moments we can see that

718
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:12,659
oh

719
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:16,080
but a lot of live stream activity is

720
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,440
happening this participation of people

721
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,640
not only with our own preparations about

722
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,440
these people who just want to share this

723
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,760
and so on

724
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,399
and if we can keep this Rhythm to having

725
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,919
different people with their interests

726
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,740
and sharing ideas

727
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:42,480
and yes if people will join to help us

728
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,899
to do it more and more often Maybe

729
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,860
it will be great

730
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,860
thank you

731
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,960
the active inference Journal picks up

732
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,659
where live stream stops

733
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,640
the active inference Journal is engaged

734
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,299
in continuous deployment and development

735
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:05,520
of speech to text transcription

736
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,100
automated and manual editing curation

737
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,159
and finally publication so just to give

738
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:13,919
an example a live stream will occur and

739
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,220
then we use speech to text onto a public

740
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,039
GitHub repository everybody can edit the

741
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,559
markdown file and then we're able to

742
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,539
publish those transcripts so that they

743
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:27,000
can be citable so that a conversation

744
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,519
someone has can go onto their resume as

745
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,679
a true citable publication

746
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,320
and we can just facilitate the

747
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,960
accessibility and the findability of

748
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,580
these incredible

749
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,159
conversations and moments that we have

750
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:43,320
and also in the active inference Journal

751
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,960
we're always developing the process from

752
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,240
setup for those of all technical

753
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,600
backgrounds how to get things working on

754
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,179
your own local setup or on a cloud setup

755
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:56,880
using free and open source software

756
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,679
where possible

757
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,899
the speech to text

758
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:02,880
the text processing

759
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,120
the editing translating into languages

760
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,179
rendering into a diversity of formats

761
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,260
publishing through different channels

762
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,800
and then engaging in further analysis

763
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,480
related to natural language processing

764
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,239
and the active inference ontology all

765
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,540
these fun things we can do so if you

766
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,839
in an alternate Multiverse we're a

767
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:28,980
librarian or an editor or a viewer or an

768
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,440
advocate of the active inference Corpus

769
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,159
bring it into this reality and make a

770
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,780
huge contribution

771
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,800
by cultivating our epistemic garden and

772
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,839
our offerings because there's so much

773
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,659
enrichment that can happen with past

774
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,540
streams and with proactively letting the

775
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,820
live stream project know and letting

776
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,139
courses know

777
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:55,980
how we can help them at the journal to

778
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,380
develop these kinds of Publications that

779
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,160
in new ways are expanding definitions of

780
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,200
scholarship and research and service

781
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,200
anything else to add

782
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,619
yeah

783
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:16,200
as for this project I I believe it's

784
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,040
like most technical

785
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,820
in The Institute and maybe we can call

786
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,579
it more probably like language

787
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:28,740
processing project

788
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,280
and maybe it is a good starting point

789
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,480
for people who got who have good

790
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,700
technical skills some programming skills

791
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,800
which are related to language processing

792
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,880
in general or some specific part of it

793
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,240
and maybe it will be of interest for

794
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,400
them to start from this project and

795
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,180
later I get a better grasp on what is

796
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,880
active influence is

797
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,900
awesome totally agree it's like

798
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,680
seeing the range of live streams is

799
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,240
really one of the best ways to just jump

800
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,060
into understanding the the waste and the

801
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,040
topics that people speak

802
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,660
okay

803
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,540
we'll just briefly mention the research

804
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,260
work happening but this last several

805
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,560
month period has been extremely focused

806
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,380
and extremely productive on education we

807
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,820
have the two new courses the

808
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,920
qualification system all of these other

809
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,980
curricular developments

810
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,839
um so there's several ongoing research

811
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,480
projects we have the active inference

812
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,820
ontology as a research and development

813
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,240
initiative active block prints as a

814
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,220
software package for complex systems

815
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,680
modeling using active inference

816
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,640
Robotics and embodied with jf's symbolic

817
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,099
active inference robots and then there's

818
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:55,680
some project seeds that we always love

819
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,619
to offer up to interns or to volunteers

820
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:01,200
as something that they can like restart

821
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,420
and take a lot of initiative something

822
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,960
that's just planted but but barely there

823
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,400
and that right now is the graphical

824
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,560
interface with thinking really

825
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,540
expansively about what it looks like to

826
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,000
learn an apply active inference

827
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,460
from a embodied perspective

828
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,800
and cognitive agent modeling

829
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,920
doing meta-analysis and synthesis across

830
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,839
different cognitive modeling Frameworks

831
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:27,599
so that we can really have a place to

832
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,579
point when we describe how different

833
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:31,619
cognitive phenomena

834
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,560
speaking to a cognitive pattern language

835
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,020
are implemented or addressed by active

836
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,119
inference and other Frameworks

837
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,180
and then there's the so many of you who

838
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,940
engage in individual research so there's

839
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,300
a lot of research happening in the space

840
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,339
and we see education as a fundamental

841
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:52,560
enablement for research

842
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,320
as part of the institute's mission for

843
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,839
Education and Research development so

844
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,480
it's been good times with research and

845
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,040
uh

846
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,560
I'm really excited to see all the all

847
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,839
the projects that people share during

848
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:10,079
sessions start to develop and and

849
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,339
flourish

850
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:12,599
anything else you want to add about

851
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:15,440
research Alex

852
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,680
uh yeah maybe uh this direction was not

853
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,579
so active last times but as we discussed

854
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:30,560
for future directions that we will

855
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,440
bring more attention and to more efforts

856
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,380
to maybe

857
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,640
formalize a bit per week as Institute

858
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,260
service

859
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:46,980
people around from ecosystems uh how we

860
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,619
can support them on their ways

861
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,040
and so on so

862
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,859
it will be good times here too

863
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,980
yeah agreed we want to provide a lot of

864
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:03,420
research services so for people who who

865
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,980
want to be on any side of that table

866
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,140
Reach Out

867
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,520
all right

868
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,280
well the last section here

869
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,119
is going to be a short active inference

870
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,300
based presidential address

871
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,119
I will be just speaking to some recent

872
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,320
developments as well as past

873
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,119
developments in the active inference

874
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:27,119
space and just give a few thoughts on

875
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,619
how they relate to the active inference

876
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:31,859
Institute and what we're all doing here

877
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:34,380
if you're watching live please write

878
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,780
some questions or comments into the live

879
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,880
chat and at the end of this short

880
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,200
address

881
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,660
we will review any other comments or

882
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,660
questions from those who are here live

883
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,460
give some last thoughts and then we'll

884
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,940
be back into the work so I wanted to

885
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,240
begin this address with a reference to

886
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,640
the work that was before active

887
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,400
inference Institute which was active

888
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,260
inference lab but even before active

889
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,880
inference lab there was the

890
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,820
collaboration with Alex Yvonne Alexandra

891
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,880
RJ and myself around active inference

892
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,800
and behavior engineering for teams and

893
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,180
organizations

894
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,260
and this was in September 2020 only a

895
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,180
few years ago now

896
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,520
more than two but less than three years

897
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,660
ago

898
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:25,680
and uh it's amazing how far things have

899
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,119
come and at the same time how many of

900
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:33,780
the topics that we were able to bring

901
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,599
into this context of remote teams and

902
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,359
organizations

903
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:41,579
still ring as relevance

904
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:44,760
and they're just gestured to here

905
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,099
we've gone far towards enacting and

906
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:50,760
implementing and improving but still we

907
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,720
can think about cognitive entities

908
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,760
engaged in the Cyber physical niche

909
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,180
with narrative and rhetoric structuring

910
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,460
their understanding

911
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,740
of how sensory data translate into

912
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,740
action so for people who are interested

913
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,760
in this topic we invite you one way or

914
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,920
another to engage with us on this

915
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,000
journey

916
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,040
because we are only going to do it all

917
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,500
together so just wanted to begin with

918
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,780
that kind of callback to several years

919
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,480
ago though so much has changed certainly

920
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,420
for all of us in the times between that

921
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,460
when we really find first principles

922
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,040
approaches like active inference and

923
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,540
when we really care about systems of

924
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,780
interest and communities then

925
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,140
the actions that we take we don't regret

926
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,760
but I think we can go into a little bit

927
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,619
more detail and reference some recent

928
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:45,240
developments in the active inference

929
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,780
ecosystem that speak to how day after

930
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,320
day week after week our system of

931
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,839
Interest active inference learning and

932
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:56,220
application

933
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,359
really gifts or blesses us with new ways

934
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:02,579
of thinking and new ways of acting so

935
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:05,400
for example just within the last months

936
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,920
the inner screen model of Consciousness

937
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,560
was released as a preprint by Maxwell

938
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,300
ramstead at all

939
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,579
dealing with all these topics that we

940
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:17,160
know and love and building upon the

941
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,920
quantum free energy principle formalism

942
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,260
which again it's easy to forget was not

943
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,560
even in place two years ago discussed in

944
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,240
live stream number 40.

945
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,780
and weeks after publication we're able

946
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,940
to enact

947
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,940
a conversation hearing from voices all

948
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,320
over the world

949
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,000
bringing experts and those with

950
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,599
different backgrounds onto the screen

951
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:45,780
here the screen that you see is the

952
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,119
classical information

953
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,460
depository that enables us as Quantum

954
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,560
cognitive agents to engage with each

955
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,099
other and so all of these beautiful

956
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:58,440
people on the Stream

957
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,140
who with their regime of attention and

958
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,780
their Quantum cognitive rotation brought

959
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,460
to bear

960
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,680
their attention and their language

961
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,079
contribution through action

962
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,060
we are able to inscribe that on

963
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,980
classical digital artifacts like live

964
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,680
streams and transcripts and then provide

965
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,920
it to the niche for all of you to rotate

966
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,040
that into your own space and context so

967
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,319
again the spatial temporal and

968
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:27,960
conceptual linkages are happening at a

969
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,020
speed that is boggling

970
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,720
and on the right is a paper from just

971
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,260
this month officially by Thomas Parr at

972
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,060
all cognitive effort and active

973
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,520
inference and I have the image small

974
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,440
because there's more details to go into

975
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,819
in the paper

976
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:46,619
however

977
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:49,140
they used a well-known model of

978
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,960
cognitive burden called a Stroop model

979
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,020
which shows a color

980
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,500
written out as a word and that word is

981
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,660
shown in some color so the color red

982
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,819
written in red the color red written in

983
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:03,599
blue

984
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,240
and the timing dynamics of people's

985
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,740
reading behavior and recognition

986
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:12,180
behavior is a proxy for cognitive effort

987
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,500
and so

988
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,099
this is just one more not even Brick in

989
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:19,920
the Wall not even just one tool in the

990
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,060
tool kit but like another lens or layer

991
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,240
or ability or capacity for active

992
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,880
inference framework which adds these

993
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,900
features affect memory anticipation all

994
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,240
these different features are layered in

995
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,300
like a symphony without developing bloat

996
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,240
because the first principles kernel the

997
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,300
cognitive firmware is not getting

998
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,500
bloated

999
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,680
it is staying at first principles and

1000
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,180
sometimes it feels like even diving down

1001
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,339
to zero with principles

1002
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:57,119
while Advanced research in the space is

1003
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,700
able to help us understand

1004
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,099
really sophisticated cognitive phenomena

1005
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:05,400
like cognitive effort now one can look

1006
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,859
back through the previous stream and

1007
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:09,720
what we discussed and how could

1008
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,300
cognitive effort help us support the

1009
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,819
accessibility rigor and applicability of

1010
00:45:14,819 --> 00:45:16,920
active inference it's such a natural

1011
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,520
question and again week after week our

1012
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,440
Niche provides us with new ways of

1013
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,160
thinking and doing so it's so fun to be

1014
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,680
gripping and gripped within active

1015
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,098
inference

1016
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,020
I'd like to recognize and commend

1017
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,780
Jacob's excellent work

1018
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,200
just in April we published generalized

1019
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,420
notation notation for active inference

1020
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,980
models

1021
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,040
GNN generalized notation notation is a

1022
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,220
plain text format for conveying active

1023
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,079
inference generative models it's

1024
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,780
something like a dialect of markdown

1025
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,960
and it brings us closer and closer to

1026
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,260
the Triple Play The Triple Play is the

1027
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,740
idea that we should have integrity

1028
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,540
amongst multiple representations of

1029
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,280
active inference models

1030
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,780
that is

1031
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,900
what we see visualized graphically or

1032
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,400
tangibly

1033
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,400
what we hear and say in terms of the

1034
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,040
natural language use

1035
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,440
and with executable cognitive

1036
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,880
simulations

1037
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,740
so if someone looks at an organizational

1038
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,800
flowchart and there's three A's

1039
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,660
connected to two B's

1040
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,380
that is something that we can visualize

1041
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:36,900
describe and execute so that there isn't

1042
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,880
a front and a back room conversation

1043
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,619
rather there's an integrated

1044
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:43,440
conversation that allows for everybody

1045
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,900
to make contributions in the modalities

1046
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,180
and in the ways that they want and the

1047
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,740
interlingua

1048
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,140
not the only interlingua and by no means

1049
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,240
its final version

1050
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,760
is the plain text generalized notation

1051
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,980
notation we're having a lot of fun

1052
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,079
working with language models and

1053
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:03,000
visualizing this transforming it into

1054
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,280
executable simulations and so thanks

1055
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,619
again jaka for the really creative and

1056
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:11,220
dedicated work because this

1057
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,480
method

1058
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,740
is going to be a real core functionality

1059
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:21,599
for translating across visual elements

1060
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,760
our natural languages

1061
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,920
and the kinds of simulations that we

1062
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,480
want to run

1063
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,680
and I'll close with a recent publication

1064
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,560
with Carl friston at all including

1065
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,020
myself and blue so two out of three

1066
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,839
officers on the paper not terrible

1067
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,319
and in this paper we used free energy

1068
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:46,680
principle and active inference to

1069
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,619
provide something like a measuring or an

1070
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:52,380
observability framework for Ecology

1071
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,900
Evolution and development or eco-evo

1072
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,200
Devo and the way that this was done is

1073
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,240
through the renormalization group of

1074
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,400
physics and so in this image on the left

1075
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,460
we can see it as like maybe a bunch of

1076
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,579
cells which each contain organelles and

1077
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:11,280
those cells make a tissue or the big

1078
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,400
circle might be the population of

1079
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,180
organisms or the ecosystem Community

1080
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:22,380
again recognizing the nested niche

1081
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:26,400
engagement within and across levels of

1082
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,859
spatial and temporal modeling

1083
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:30,180
and

1084
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,099
looking at just two layers and how

1085
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:33,420
they're connected

1086
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,240
we can think of that as a nested action

1087
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,220
perception cycle

1088
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:41,220
so here's like the behavior sensory

1089
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:44,460
um and the behavior of of a worm in this

1090
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,359
case

1091
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,220
happening at whatever time scale it's

1092
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,619
being modeled at and then at the slower

1093
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:51,480
or the deeper level of the hierarchical

1094
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,500
model

1095
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,079
we have the Bayesian learning like

1096
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:57,839
process of the extended genotype

1097
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,020
happening in a slower adaptive layer and

1098
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:04,140
so this should

1099
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,579
clearly

1100
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:06,960
connect

1101
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,880
to what we said at the very beginning of

1102
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,700
the stream about the Institute as part

1103
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,859
of a nested system

1104
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:16,260
here we have the ecosystem

1105
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,000
the space around

1106
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,800
here's the Institute this is what it

1107
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,260
really means to enter and to join not

1108
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,780
just to look into

1109
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:29,220
but to be on or in the Institute

1110
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,359
and then the kinds of dynamic partitions

1111
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:35,640
that were able to embody within the

1112
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,520
Institute through our Communications and

1113
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,260
and through our actions

1114
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,460
and so

1115
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:46,380
it's just so exciting to see

1116
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,540
everyone's incredible research

1117
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,339
contributions

1118
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:52,619
the kinds of questions and developments

1119
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:55,859
that even if I were not an author even

1120
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,900
if I were not in the active inference

1121
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,420
field I would believe are at least the

1122
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,300
right things to be trying in terms of

1123
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,060
bringing theoretical integration in

1124
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,599
ecology Evolution and development at

1125
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,040
least these are the right research

1126
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:16,020
Avenues but then again to be able to act

1127
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,880
infer and serve

1128
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,579
through the Institute as a multi-scale

1129
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:24,599
evolutionary entity in and of itself

1130
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:27,720
this kind of real-time enactment of

1131
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,940
multiple scales and Quantum reference

1132
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:34,579
frames is something that is only arising

1133
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:39,780
through co-creation so in closing I send

1134
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:43,560
my deepest appreciation to all those who

1135
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,380
support and care and engage

1136
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,720
to those who are not sure

1137
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,119
I welcome you

1138
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,480
to the past the present and the future

1139
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,540
we respect and that's why we do what we

1140
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,700
do

1141
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,020
so

1142
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:03,059
Alex

1143
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:07,460
where where do we go or what is next

1144
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,280
thank you very much for the talk

1145
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,700
and I'm really providing that so you

1146
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,619
know

1147
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:21,599
the reasons well from the beginning and

1148
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,640
about going now

1149
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,319
and congratulations on that

1150
00:51:27,319 --> 00:51:31,859
publication on evolutionary work and

1151
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:34,740
it's a great opening Direction

1152
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,260
and

1153
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,079
the least

1154
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:41,880
these direction will make a next step

1155
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,819
into techno Revolution also

1156
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:47,160
and we will use this Tech Revolution

1157
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,800
customer approach

1158
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:54,200
the develop Institute Canada consistent

1159
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,660
yes I'll just wait a few more seconds if

1160
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,700
anyone writes a

1161
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,099
question that we can address in the live

1162
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:03,780
chat

1163
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,339
let's look at some of these questions

1164
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:07,319
that we look at at the end of every live

1165
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:08,220
stream

1166
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,960
what would a good understanding enable

1167
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,240
well if we were able to really

1168
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,140
understand our own generative model as

1169
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,640
The Institute and as the active

1170
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,579
inference ecosystem it would support our

1171
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:22,980
sense making and decision making we'd be

1172
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:26,280
able to act and infer and serve better

1173
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,559
what are the unique predictions and

1174
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,660
implications

1175
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:34,380
that's a very interesting question

1176
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,119
I'm sure there are many ways to to

1177
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,920
address this and we we did have many

1178
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,920
future oriented Expressions during this

1179
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,420
discussion even today

1180
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,500
what are the next steps for free energy

1181
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,380
principle and active inference

1182
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,819
again do you have any thoughts on this

1183
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:52,440
one the middle question or the second

1184
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,980
question Alex

1185
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:01,200
and the unique predictions and next

1186
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,819
steps depends on some specific field or

1187
00:53:05,819 --> 00:53:10,200
domain or or all for ourselves we

1188
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,319
understand whether to conferences scale

1189
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:14,579
free approach

1190
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:17,160
and it just

1191
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,640
can be applied to any scale of research

1192
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,720
or any domain which uh

1193
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,780
researcher or engineer is working on

1194
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:31,079
can be described to his active internal

1195
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:33,480
language and stuff to informed from

1196
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,680
where

1197
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,380
using affordances to computational

1198
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,319
modeling or some other types of modeling

1199
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:43,040
and so on

1200
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,559
yeah

1201
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,420
yeah what are the goals of the research

1202
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,000
to embody our mission to support the

1203
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,300
active inference ecosystem to to be the

1204
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,520
best Institute we can be be the best in

1205
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,619
estimates within it what do you think

1206
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,280
maybe we should remove goals okay here

1207
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,460
let's change it to preferences

1208
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,960
yeah at least

1209
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,740
and considering

1210
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,240
in open-endedness way again we're okay

1211
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,819
we can speak about those ones it looks

1212
00:54:23,819 --> 00:54:26,640
like it's not so useful concept

1213
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,520
yes sometimes when we're talking about

1214
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,520
the um specific research papers we talk

1215
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,460
about the goal of that paper but goal is

1216
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,740
not to be found in the active inference

1217
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,880
ontology

1218
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,200
and

1219
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,520
we find ways of making do and thriving

1220
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,240
without needing to rest upon goals and

1221
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,819
reward and that's really exciting and

1222
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:52,079
that's something that a lot of people

1223
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,300
don't even realize that they're steeped

1224
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,780
in reward maximization and goal

1225
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,740
implementation

1226
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,980
until the open-endedness and the

1227
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,500
Vitality of active inference

1228
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,020
becomes understood

1229
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,960
what are you still curious about

1230
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,819
Ola you go first then I'll give the last

1231
00:55:14,819 --> 00:55:17,480
thought as we close

1232
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:22,260
um I always remember our discussions

1233
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,099
about sales of the world curios in the

1234
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:28,460
beginning of

1235
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:29,970
it's like

1236
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,300
[Music]

1237
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,000
I believe it

1238
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,400
is

1239
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,940
a week a week each day each month what

1240
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,559
our appealth our Frontier are showing us

1241
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:48,480
so much

1242
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,579
a lot of different perspectives

1243
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:53,160
different connections real people in

1244
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,099
Communications and projects and so on so

1245
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:59,420
it's happiness

1246
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:01,740
very beautiful

1247
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,000
I'm

1248
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,460
curious about many things like that you

1249
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:09,240
said that we uh develop and hone that

1250
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,880
Curiosity every day and we we seek to to

1251
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,180
spark and be sparked when people come in

1252
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,859
from different backgrounds with their

1253
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:20,819
Curiosities it's inspiring to say the

1254
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:23,520
least and I'm really curious about who

1255
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,980
will have listened or read this far in

1256
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,300
the Stream

1257
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,559
and choose that moment to take an action

1258
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:34,380
to get involved with the Institute so

1259
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,300
there's only one way that my uncertainty

1260
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,280
is going to be reduced about that and I

1261
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,619
think if you know you know so thank you

1262
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:43,200
Alex thank you blue

1263
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,599
thank you to the officers and to all of

1264
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,040
the Institute

1265
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,200
see you around

1266
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,759
thank you thank you
