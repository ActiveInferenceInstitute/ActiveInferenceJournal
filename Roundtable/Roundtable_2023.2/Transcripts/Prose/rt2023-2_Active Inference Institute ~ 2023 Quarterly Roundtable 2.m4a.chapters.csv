4980	91650	00:04	The Active inference Institute quarterly roundtable number two in 2023. All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome, and we'll be following video etiquette for live streams. If you're watching live, please write comments and questions in the live chat.	Welcome to the Active inference Institute quarterly roundtable number two in 2023	Quarterly Roundtable
94120	337340	01:34	The active inference institute in June 2023 has a nested structure. It is within the active inference ecosystem as well as within other ecosystems. Another way to see this is in terms of people and positions at the institute. A lot of people already involved in activity.	The active inference institute has a nested structure based on ecosystem	The Institute of Active Inference: Growth and Updates
339840	427950	05:39	Third applied active inference symposium to be held in August. Theme of enacting ecosystems of shared intelligence, active inference as a cognitive kernel. In coming days and weeks, we'll be providing more information on participating in a more formal call for presenters.

428420	863170	07:08	We have about 20 currently active interns from all around the world. The internship consists of learning, doing and also mentorship and facilitation. In terms of our engagement in the broader digital cyberphysical niche, we continue to grow.	Namjee: Volunteering at the institute is an incredible way to learn	Active Inference Institute Program Summary
863700	1327110	14:23	The active inference qualification system draft will be applied for all institute structure and activities. It's not just a knowledge based qualification system. We also are looking to integrate skills and even project responsibility and autonomy. We are calling for your participation if this is something that you would be interested in using or engaging with.	The active inference qualification system draft is currently very tentative	The Active Inference Qualification System Draft
1329310	1425960	22:09	In May 2023, we began our first course at the Institute, Physics as Information Processing. It is being taught by one of the leading researchers in the area, Chris Fields. We have a question and answer system so that people can ask questions asynchronously Chris then answers them.	Chris Fields is teaching Physics as Information Processing at the Institute	Post-Graduate Physics as Information Processing Course
1427390	1529260	23:47	For me historically, for my fault, the ground starting from beginning on this century. And for now, seeing that latest development on quantum information theory and how it nicely connects to free energy and active inference. Great changes for different ecosystems.	Alex: Seeing developments on quantum information theory is great news for science	Quantum information theory
1529950	1689396	25:29	 Constructing Cultural Landscapes Active Inference for the Social Sciences. Multi teacher massively participatory course avel of Cairos Research. On July 7, we will begin and it will have some lecture sessions as well as participatory discussion sections. All sessions are free. They'll be live streamed and rewatchable.	Second course at Active Inference Institute will be Constructing Cultural Landscapes	Active Inference for the Social Sciences
1689508	2346310	28:09	We now have 336 completed or planned live streams. It would be awesome to have more voices on the live stream and just be able to continue offering these kinds of resources at even faster rate with increased professionalization. Everyone is also welcome to self nominate or suggest someone who you think would fit well on a stream.	We now have 336 completed or planned live streams and 336 planned	Active Inference Live Stream
2347160	2477468	39:07	This is a short active inference based presidential address. I will be just speaking to some recent developments as well as past developments in the active inference space. If you're watching live, please write some questions or comments into the live chat.	This is going to be a short active inference based presidential address	President's Address
2477554	2846710	41:17	In April, we published Generalized Notation notation for conveying active inference generative models. GNN generalized notation notation brings us closer and closer to the triple play. All these different features are layered in like a symphony without developing Bloat. Week after week, our niche provides us with new ways of thinking and doing.	Recent developments in the active inference ecosystem speak to how much has changed	Active Inference: The science of cognition
2847320	3308970	47:27	Using free energy principle and active inference to provide an observability framework for ecology, evolution and development. What would a good understanding enable? To be able to act infer and serve through the institute as a multiscale evolutionary entity. Where do we go or what is next?	Free energy principle and active inference provide framework for ecology, evolution and development	Free Energy Principle and the Inference ecosystem
3309950	3411020	55:09	What are you still curious about? I always remember our discussions about sense of the word curious in the beginning. We seek to spark and be sparked when people come in from different backgrounds with their curiosities. It's inspiring, to say the least. See you around.	Alex: What are you still curious about at the institute	A message about the institute
