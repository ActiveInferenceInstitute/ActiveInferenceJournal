4980	5530	A	0.546256959438324	You.
7500	8408	B	0.5579421520233154	Hello everyone.
8494	14696	B	0.8400629162788391	Welcome to the Active inference Institute quarterly roundtable number two in 2023.
14798	25480	B	0.5100675821304321	It's June 30, 2023, and this is going to be our quarterly updates and ways that you can participate at the institute and in the active ecosystem.
25900	28756	B	0.9280382394790649	So welcome to the active inference institute.
28868	34732	B	0.6568323373794556	We're a participant battori online institute that is communicating, learning, and practicing applied active inference.
34796	47280	B	0.8189551830291748	You can find us at the links on this page and note that we'll be transitioning our emails over from activeinference@gmail.com towards Atactiveinference institute domains.
47640	53684	B	0.534641683101654	This is recorded in an archive Livestream, so please provide us with feedback so that we can improve our work.
53882	65096	B	0.8269748687744141	All backgrounds and perspectives are welcome, and we'll be following video etiquette for live streams today in the quarterly meeting number two of the year.
65278	75836	B	0.7961223721504211	We'll start at the institute scale, give some updates at the institute level, and then we'll look a little bit deeper into primarily education, but also research.
76018	83276	B	0.921787679195404	And then I'll have some closing thoughts by way of a presidential address about where we're at with active inference.
83388	91650	B	0.8499642014503479	And if you're watching live, please write comments and questions in the live chat and we will look to address those during.
94120	102580	B	0.8885679841041565	Okay, so starting with the institute scale, some updates coming from the institute.
105000	111256	B	0.824027419090271	Here's one way that we can visualize the active inference institute in June 2023.
111438	121256	B	0.6635359525680542	We are within the active inference ecosystem as well as within other ecosystems, and we have a nested structure.
121368	123630	B	0.8969019055366516	Alex, would you like to describe this?
127820	139980	A	0.8439210057258606	Yeah, I think for these moments, it's great to see this structure and understand what is actually in place and working and acting and adapting.
140480	151036	A	0.8699870109558105	And from very beginning we consider it from perspective of systems thinking and from perspective of active inference.
151068	162128	A	0.7985778450965881	We always think about some kind of nested and hierarchical structure which can be builded and structured accordingly.
162304	170536	A	0.9651198983192444	So having it right now embodied, it's great to see it totally agree.
170638	180248	B	0.9036921262741089	At the institute scale where these first updates are going to come from, we have the officers, the board of directors, and the scientific advisory board.
180414	187016	B	0.5075709223747253	We have two organizational units which steward the development and support participation in projects.
187208	193464	B	0.8526322841644287	And projects and learning groups are really where it happens on the ground.
193512	195424	B	0.6616328358650208	And so we're going to talk a lot more about these.
195462	200960	B	0.8094833493232727	But this is the nesting and our own relationship with the ecosystem.
202180	208480	B	0.8827393054962158	Another way to see this is in terms of people and positions at the institute.
208640	216272	B	0.6928446888923645	So starting from the left, we have casual engagement with our products and services into the niche.
216336	220724	B	0.7309089303016663	So this might be the very video that you're listening to or watching right now.
220762	223876	B	0.8621804714202881	It could be the transcript of this video that you're reading.
223988	226340	B	0.837281346321106	It might be the active inference ontology.
226420	229028	B	0.712552011013031	It might be the active block, for instance, software package.
229124	233992	B	0.541710376739502	There's all these different open source products and services that we provide to the niche.
234136	246316	B	0.6892167925834656	And one moment you will decide to participate in a project or a learning group, and that can be more towards the learning, more towards the doing and leveraging your contributions at the institute.
246508	259440	B	0.9602949023246765	And some participants will choose to solidify their participation through volunteering or engaging with the internship program, both of which are new and really excitingly.
259520	268580	B	0.6928258538246155	Developing well and then we haven't listed any names of the many of you who are in all of these different stages.
269340	279364	B	0.9152787923812866	And you may want to play another role or another position in the Institute, such as the Scientific Advisory Board, board of Directors or the officers.
279412	287900	B	0.932003378868103	So a lot of appreciation and thanks to everybody who's shown and not shown on this slide.
289280	295680	B	0.9869794845581055	We are really appreciative of how you all show up for the institute.
296340	298450	B	0.881030797958374	Alex, want to add anything on that?
303940	318150	A	0.8962176442146301	Yeah, even from this slide, we can see that a lot of people already involved in activity and provide great insights and different perspective and backgrounds and experience.
319800	327450	A	0.8522326946258545	And yes, a lot of people not shown here, but we know them through our community platforms and so on.
328300	337340	A	0.9686841368675232	So you can see this progress in terms of participation in activities and that's also great progress.
339840	341548	B	0.6023465394973755	All right, moving on.
341634	355372	B	0.9795437455177307	We are excited that for our third applied active inference symposium to be held in August, we will have the theme of enacting ecosystems of shared intelligence, active inference as a cognitive kernel.
355516	361232	B	0.9888962507247925	We have a really broad and global co organizer team, which is very exciting.
361296	368908	B	0.9558237195014954	So thanks to everybody who's in the co organizing team for this symposium, we're just getting started on the organization.
369104	377960	B	0.7834077477455139	So in the coming days and weeks, we'll be providing more information on participating in a more formal call for presenters.
379100	391710	B	0.9078549742698669	However, if you're listening to this message now and you are really excited to do a presentation or a workshop or mentorship and be a part of the active inference ecosystem, then please reach out to us.
392080	393950	B	0.8887924551963806	Alex, anything you want to add here?
398680	424940	A	0.9726728796958923	But actually, yes, I think I can remember that there will be a third symposium and it's cool that we have that yearly written for this type of activity and hopefully this event bring us and for people who will participate, new insights, connections, and ground for future developments.
427200	427950	A	0.84200119972229	Cool.
428420	433772	B	0.8448643088340759	All right, just to summarize and update a few of the institute level programs.
433916	439152	B	0.8172723650932312	So volunteering at the institute, it's a way to engage.
439296	454520	B	0.9525154232978821	It is just making it that much easier to get involved with one or more projects and to start to get that recognition from the institute, understanding your contributions and also on your own resume or your own work history or your portfolio.
455180	459320	B	0.9805480241775513	Volunteering is really an incredible way to learn by doing.
459470	474384	B	0.9011609554290771	If you want to apply or learn about organizational active inference or if you want to think about communication as active inference education in the context of active inference gripper and the gripped if you want a perspective swap and see it multiple ways.
474582	479904	B	0.9660341739654541	Learning by doing on a project through volunteering, we hope, is a really unique opportunity.
480102	484064	B	0.6057941913604736	And what you do will and does really matter.
484182	497430	B	0.6776303052902222	So if you're taking notes on the margin of some paper or if you're developing lists that you felt like help your onboarding into active inference, you can make a leveraged contribution by sharing that kind of information.
497740	505530	B	0.6247940063476562	Or if you're not quite sure what type of contribution or the impact it would have, we can help find that kind of a niche for you.
506940	514412	B	0.6527079939842224	The internship program is being a volunteer but wanting a little bit more structure around that.
514546	536150	B	0.7150149345397949	We have about 20 currently active interns from all around the world, different backgrounds, levels of technical familiarity with the active inference, ranging from truly some of the people who I believe are experts, to people who just found out about active inference and wanted to use this program to accelerate their learning a lot.
537000	545984	B	0.934100866317749	Also in the last weeks and months I would like to commend the two individuals who know who they are who have completed their internship.
546112	557496	B	0.9916188716888428	This has really been a great honor to work with you, both of you, and to those who are still active, I look forward to seeing those updates and continuing to work with you.
557598	563240	B	0.5500812530517578	The internship consists of learning, doing and also mentorship and facilitation.
563400	571580	B	0.8310143351554871	So interns tend to participate in one or more course or textbook group or maybe help out with some live streams.
571920	578364	B	0.7477494478225708	Interns engage on projects and that is usually a minimum of two projects.
578492	580332	B	0.883356511592865	One is hosted at the Institute.
580396	589040	B	0.9196600914001465	So some of the projects that we'll look at later in this roundtable but then also most of the interns have a personal or background research agenda.
589120	598920	B	0.5651341676712036	So sometimes they make very small contributions to an institute project but they're working really diligently on their dissertation or on their hobby project.
599070	611980	B	0.5106293559074402	Other times it's most of the contribution to the Institute project and then a little bit of self guided research and we try to provide our interns with support over multiple spatial and temporal scales.
614480	635984	B	0.8709222078323364	In terms of our engagement in the broader digital cyberphysical niche, we continue to grow on our different platforms and channels, though these are just proxy measures in our discord podcast, Twitter and YouTube as well as mailing lists.
636112	641030	B	0.6452274322509766	So we continue to communicate out to those who want to hear.
644360	654650	B	0.8837987184524536	Here's the big picture on Institute activities and you can find this information at the activities page that's listed here.
655420	672416	B	0.8813025951385498	At the top we have type of project publication live streams such as the one happening right now and the active inference journal which picks up when the live stream hits stop and transcribes and curates publishes that transcript which we'll talk more about.
672598	686432	B	0.9417069554328918	So live streams and journal are a great pair in the active block for instance project we continue to build the soft and hard skills associated with generative modeling in the active inference tradition.
686576	694736	B	0.8209222555160522	And so we use the complex Adaptive systems modeling framework Cadcad to implement different active inference generative models.
694848	696592	B	0.9824969172477722	This is a really great place.
696666	701620	B	0.790852963924408	A lot of discussions about modeling, robotics and embodied.
701780	714072	B	0.95379239320755	JF Kotcher continues to offer his expertise and updates from this really incredible project where real Lego robots are implementing symbolic active inference.
714136	720808	B	0.9371089935302734	So thanks, JF, for hosting this project the way you do in the active inference ontology.
720984	741680	B	0.6491093039512634	We continue to refine and update the active inference ontology, which is the real language that we speak, whether it happens to be deployed in English or visually or in a programming language or however, the active inference ontology is how we're communicating and we develop that and offer it as a service to the niche.
741760	747620	B	0.561540961265564	In this project, we have multiple ongoing learning groups which we'll talk more about soon.
747690	750008	B	0.7823135852813721	But we have a textbook group with Par et al.
750094	752660	B	0.8781175017356873	The 2022 active inference textbook.
752820	761556	B	0.9660391807556152	We have Sanjeev Namjoshi, who's writing a really incredible work that will be a textbook published as Fundamentals of Active Inference.
761668	766444	B	0.8513226509094238	And we're alpha testing along with Sanjiv and right there alongside him.
766482	773020	B	0.8933756351470947	So thanks, Sanjiv, for bringing this work in progress to the institute and to really sticking with the trouble.
773380	775570	B	0.9865663647651672	This is going to be an incredible product.
776340	784832	B	0.8268730640411377	And we have two courses, one on physics as information processing and one on active inference for the social sciences, which we'll address soon.
784966	791700	B	0.5942279696464539	And also multiple times per week in our discord, we have open discussions for education and research.
791850	803364	B	0.7670089602470398	So if this is all a lot or you're not sure about anything, probably the best way to just drop in and find out would be to check out when and how we're meeting and come to the open discussions.
803412	806200	B	0.8076279163360596	If you just want to see what's up.
806350	808520	B	0.8957171440124512	Anything you want to add there, Alex?
816660	825060	A	0.9483193159103394	Good to see that projects are active and mostly maybe for last period of time.
825130	833860	A	0.6156235337257385	It's having that new courses which we'll describe later, but having and feeling is growing.
834600	841050	A	0.9791613221168518	It provides great opportunities for second half of the year.
841900	859448	B	0.6010555028915405	So true, in the first quarterly roundtable, we had no courses, but as of now, we can say that there are two courses that are really pushing the frontier of education and even research in quantum information sciences and in social sciences.
859624	861532	B	0.8881667852401733	So thanks again.
861586	863170	B	0.7710439562797546	We'll get to those soon.
863700	867644	B	0.7547878623008728	All right, let's dive into a little more detail on active.
867772	876100	B	0.9338967204093933	So, Alex, would you like to first introduce and give a little thoughts on the active inference qualification system draft?
880430	895322	A	0.7645357251167297	Yeah, we put it here, like for now at education adjective scale, but future it will be applied for all institute structure and activities.
895466	927420	A	0.8510734438896179	We should have some cornerstone in terms of how we can measure effectiveness of our educational activities and educational services in the beginning, to understand courses and our materials, how we change actually someone's mind and how deep this mind need to be changed in some formal sense.
928030	933094	A	0.6082003116607666	And we not started from Greenfield.
933222	950480	A	0.6586097478866577	We just take one of stable system of qualifications level from European and adopt it for how we can see it in application to active inference and participations in projects and so on.
950930	967830	A	0.6415744423866272	And for now, we have a basic draft and we'll have discussions around with interested parties, different scales of institute, and finally have some stable form which will apply to different direction.
968730	969480	B	0.6283750534057617	Thanks.
970090	973862	B	0.8891561031341553	I'll just add a few notes on this first, just echoing your last point.
973916	984026	B	0.9515811800956726	If you're interested in active inference, professionalization education, qualification systems, even as a critic, we would really love to have you in the game.
984128	987130	B	0.6625730395317078	So please participate early, participate often.
987280	993470	B	0.9833932518959045	And I'll just highlight a few pieces of this system draft that are really exciting.
993890	1002530	B	0.8263687491416931	First, it begins at level zero, which everybody de facto can have, perhaps even upon or before birth.
1003270	1010978	B	0.8434320092201233	Then, as the levels proceed, active inference is always being connected with domains and systems of interest.
1011144	1026658	B	0.6409313082695007	So it's about yes, and with active inference about connecting active inference to other fields and topics, understanding a different domain's ontology robotics or neuroscience or pure mathematics, whatever it may be.
1026844	1035590	B	0.7533161640167236	And working with active inference as you gain knowledge of the ontology and of the details of active inference.
1035670	1039440	B	0.7810598611831665	But it's not just a knowledge based qualification system.
1039890	1047770	B	0.5605865120887756	We also are looking to integrate skills and even project responsibility and autonomy.
1047930	1057614	B	0.8785433769226074	So just to give kind of an example of this, levels one and two, again, currently very tentative drafts, so for your engagement.
1057662	1071990	B	0.8113057613372803	But in levels one and two, people are able to act as basic learners and collaborators and begin to get a grasp on what terms we're using in active inference and how do those concepts relate to their field of interest.
1072060	1075414	B	0.5887461304664612	And we see this every single day in the textbook group.
1075452	1079686	B	0.7525386214256287	And in discussions, someone says, oh, I'm working as a physical therapist.
1079798	1082822	B	0.8533605933189392	And so in action, that's like the person moving their arm.
1082966	1086570	B	0.5290074348449707	That is where these levels are targeted.
1086910	1093520	B	0.8807597756385803	Level three begins to get into describing and understanding some of the technical details of what we do.
1094130	1102930	B	0.9007816314697266	Level four begins to approach the evaluation and recapitulation of technical models in active inference.
1103910	1116520	B	0.6518504023551941	Level five is related to comprehensive development and implementation, as well as in the projects and autonomy, exerting more supervision for self and others.
1117690	1121510	B	0.6737185716629028	Level six, developing advanced skills.
1121850	1126702	B	0.7363721132278442	Level seven, engaging with very specialized problem solving skills.
1126866	1133238	B	0.7824289798736572	And level eight, engaging in synthesis, evaluation and critical problem solving.
1133334	1144254	B	0.5783647298812866	So again, can't emphasize enough it's just a draft, and we are calling for your participation if this is something that you would be interested in using or engaging with.
1144372	1153298	B	0.9249957799911499	But we think this is going to be a really important direction for the active inference ecosystem carrying on to the textbook group.
1153464	1163326	B	0.8877334594726562	So in the active inference textbook group, we are working on and through the Par, Pazulo and Friston 2022 textbook.
1163518	1172360	B	0.940562903881073	Currently we have cohort three working on the second half of the book and cohort four on the first half of the book.
1172730	1177100	B	0.8680191040039062	Together, these two cohorts compromise about 150 people.
1177630	1179910	B	0.741553008556366	Not every person joins every meeting.
1180070	1193040	B	0.794674813747406	Some people engage with the recordings asynchronously other people are in our shared epistemic niche, just gleaning and contributing to this kind of collaborative stigmaergic process.
1194450	1205298	B	0.7435495853424072	As educators, we're focused on the continual delivery and deployment of questions and enrichment and discourse in just some ways that this plays out.
1205464	1217990	B	0.9060802459716797	Here are, for example, questions that people have asked live or before or after a synchronous meeting where we can connect the specific figures and the ontology terms to people's uncertainties.
1218490	1223586	B	0.8799028992652893	And on the right is an example of an equation.
1223698	1234406	B	0.8219966888427734	Here's the variational free energy equation 2.5, and the way that we can use the ontology to unpack and connect some of the dots with these equations.
1234518	1243326	B	0.5110325217247009	And in the last few weeks, we've actually taken that even further and explored how to use language models through Coda AI in this process.
1243508	1248160	B	0.795734167098999	So here we have Equations 2.1 and Equations 2.2.
1248530	1254798	B	0.9244869947433472	They are being rendered in Coda via typing in LaTech.
1254974	1273094	B	0.8105692863464355	And then we are using language models within Coda to provide explanations, contextualizations for different backgrounds and expertises, and also translation into different languages, describing the variables and the notation and the who, what and why.
1273212	1293962	B	0.9274860620498657	So this has been a pretty fun avenue and a really cool example of how language models and education can be hand in hand and empower our own learning by using all kinds of models to help us, where frankly, it can be quite challenging, which is in understanding some of the analytical details of the framework.
1294106	1295710	B	0.8908585906028748	Anything you want to add, Alex?
1298610	1316814	A	0.9011068940162659	This is that type of technology which looks like magic, but having in place ontology, which is nicely integrated for Coda again to all projects.
1316942	1327110	A	0.6818262934684753	It's really like an engine for this car which is getting more and more speed.
1329310	1330060	A	0.84200119972229	Cool.
1331630	1354878	B	0.5987141728401184	Okay, in May 2023, we began our first course at the Institute, and that was Physics as Information Processing, being taught by one of the leading researchers in the area, Chris Fields, and with a Math PhD course assistant, Andre Agira.
1354974	1366440	B	0.9850833415985107	So Chris, thank you for stepping up again from the Scientific Advisory Board to offer this truly incredible and unique educational experience.
1367130	1388474	B	0.84368497133255	We've had massive response, dozens of registrants who want to engage in the participatory discussions that happen in between your lectures, the second discussion being tomorrow for those who want to join, and 1500 views of the first lecture in a month.
1388512	1391582	B	0.675472617149353	There's many people who are following along the course.
1391636	1394830	B	0.6310200095176697	Syllabus is explicit and innovative.
1395330	1402834	B	0.7906503677368164	We have a question and answer system so that people can ask questions asynchronously Chris then answers them.
1402872	1406926	B	0.5418663024902344	And we have them posted again through this interactive Coda interface.
1407038	1411726	B	0.9578666090965271	And that's really supporting an incredible level of discourse and participation.
1411918	1420040	B	0.8940658569335938	All transcripts are going to be curated and published along with the questions and answers and some other supplemental information.
1420650	1425960	B	0.9908785223960876	So this has been a really great experience and something new over the last few months.
1427390	1435306	B	0.8637943863868713	Anything you want to add, I'm tempted to just talk about how cool the quantum information free energy principle is.
1435408	1437660	B	0.5804573893547058	But perhaps now is not the moment.
1440750	1459890	A	0.5266863107681274	For me historically, for my fault, the ground starting from beginning on this century, starting from It technology technologies and computer science and this notion of information processing.
1461830	1470870	A	0.8512440323829651	It always was like in engineering sense, like working field and working domain.
1472490	1480700	A	0.8452867269515991	But I always had that need and feeling for first principles and for physics in place.
1481070	1502798	A	0.9665637612342834	And for now, seeing that latest development on quantum information theory and how it nicely connects to free energy and active inference, it's really great to have these frontier curves in place in our activities.
1502894	1522086	A	0.9848337173461914	And really great thanks to Chris and ander and I believe that it's kind of starting point maybe ten years after we'll come back altogether and discuss how this course started.
1522268	1526070	A	0.798025369644165	Great changes for different ecosystems.
1527470	1528294	B	0.9094076156616211	Thank you, Alex.
1528342	1529260	B	0.570740818977356	Totally agree.
1529950	1544170	B	0.9581462740898132	And also we are fresh off the presses, happy to announce the second course that we'll be offering at the institute, which is Constructing Cultural Landscapes Active Inference for the Social Sciences.
1544330	1553220	B	0.598231315612793	And this is going to be a multi teacher massively participatory course avel of Cairos Research.
1553670	1559250	B	0.9294394254684448	Thank you for taking the initiative to suggest even this possibility.
1559670	1565058	B	0.9675373435020447	And Ben and Mahault Lorena, thanks a lot for joining on for the journey.
1565234	1574642	B	0.8134613037109375	On July 7, we will begin and it will have some lecture sessions as well as participatory discussion sections.
1574786	1578006	B	0.5576207637786865	All sessions are free.
1578188	1580358	B	0.5721441507339478	They'll be live streamed and rewatchable.
1580454	1585146	B	0.8567148447036743	The transcripts will be curated and published into a book at the end of the year.
1585328	1593354	B	0.9721344113349915	And this is going to be a really great on ramp and space for people with a humanities or social sciences background.
1593482	1597918	B	0.6191237568855286	So we've heard people waiting for such a thing.
1598084	1607150	B	0.6028289198875427	It was Avel's insight that such a course could be hosted at Cairos Research and at the Active Inference Institute.
1607230	1618230	B	0.9715363383293152	So thanks to all the teachers here and just really looking forward to how you tackle and engage with this question of active inference in the social sciences.
1619130	1620520	B	0.8323939442634583	Anything you want to add?
1623720	1634612	A	0.869760274887085	Yeah, like these two different courses, like from different two distinct scales, like from quantum scale and social scale.
1634756	1642590	A	0.8286242485046387	And possibly it's like two different ends of spectrum in which we can work on with our research and education.
1643840	1665732	A	0.9751499891281128	It's great that this step to social sciences because it brings active inference and it's formal and first principles principled framework into the domain which haven't got it before and now it's a great begin also.
1665866	1674870	A	0.8443255424499512	And our scales between quantum and social will be on us to work on next years.
1677560	1689396	B	0.8415938019752502	Yes, and the kind of oroborous or horseshoe theory with quantum social sciences onto the live streams.
1689508	1694332	B	0.8297539353370667	So, lot to say, of course, a little bit meta since we're on a live stream right now.
1694466	1696830	B	0.8360004425048828	But I'll just note a few things.
1697680	1708828	B	0.8388572931289673	First, across our different series, we now have 336 completed or planned live streams.
1709004	1719408	B	0.8133392930030823	So most of those have already happened, but there are several that are planned, but we're over 300 completed and 336 as of now being planned.
1719584	1732180	B	0.9764636754989624	And even just specifically looking at the next 30 days, we have just such a breadth and depth it's quite exciting to watch, let alone to enact.
1732340	1739044	B	0.8760465979576111	We'll have the Chris Fields course, a discussion section, a lecture and then another discussion section.
1739172	1747112	B	0.8490018844604492	We'll begin the active inference for the social sciences course with Avel Ben having contributions.
1747256	1766820	B	0.9665613174438477	We'll have a guest stream with professors from around the world, researchers, all these different topics being able to be slotted in with a really great way to platform and give visibility and catalyze discussion around these incredible researchers work.
1766970	1771190	B	0.9910921454429626	So it's really exciting and it would be great.
1771640	1777830	B	0.5994003415107727	Not going to say it's specifically a personal request, but if you choose to read it as such then great.
1778140	1785588	B	0.962432861328125	It would be awesome to have more assistance with participating and preparing and enacting live streams.
1785764	1791556	B	0.7956445217132568	We have role based ways of planning and preparing and enacting live streams.
1791668	1804284	B	0.5315858721733093	So whether you want to play a more technical or operational or logistical role, if you want to be a conversational facilitator, if you want to do it in a different language, if you want to do a series, there's so many ways that you can get involved.
1804412	1819808	B	0.9375659823417664	But it would just be awesome to have more voices on the live stream and just be able to continue offering these kinds of resources at even faster rate with increased professionalization.
1819984	1828500	B	0.9208056926727295	And I know that there's many people out there who would be incredible contributors to broadcast and or facilitate.
1828840	1835556	B	0.8351054191589355	Everyone is also welcome to self nominate or suggest or introduce somebody who you think would fit well on a stream.
1835588	1839770	B	0.6150661706924438	If it's like a perspective that we haven't heard from, that would be really important.
1840300	1848744	B	0.7609167098999023	There's a lot of background technical and educational work on the zero videos when we do a paper discussion.
1848872	1865052	B	0.8159468770027161	So if there's a paper that you want to have a million X leveraged contribution on your preparation around, if we discuss that in a live stream and you're able to help before with the zero, you'll be a co.
1865126	1878340	B	0.9166316986083984	Author on a research publication of the transcript and you'll have made an absolutely unique, irreplaceable contribution to active inference knowledge with what you did in your diligence in the zero.
1878490	1881850	B	0.8899790644645691	So for people who hear that calling, that's incredibly important.
1882460	1889076	B	0.7016312479972839	We invite people to share the live streams on social media or with their colleagues, however they find it relevant.
1889108	1897708	B	0.6303709149360657	Like if there's a topic or a person that has come up on our streams, sharing it where relevant will help bring people in.
1897874	1900696	B	0.8694848418235779	And also we have weekly live stream meetings.
1900728	1908204	B	0.5788995027542114	So if you just want to find out what we do and how we do it in the live streams, then I would recommend that you join the regular meetings.
1908332	1914832	B	0.5903689861297607	And if you really want to join but that time never works for you, then email and let us know that you're specifically interested.
1914966	1916516	B	0.749566376209259	We'll find a different time.
1916698	1918580	B	0.8702885508537292	Any other comments there Alex?
1925280	1946470	A	0.6811782121658325	For this moment, we can see that a lot of Livestream activity is happening with participation of people, not only with our own preparations, but with people who just want to share this and so on.
1946840	1967130	A	0.9222598075866699	And if we can keep this written to having different people with their interests and sharing ideas, and yes, if people will join to help us to do it more and more often, maybe it will be great.
1969200	1970190	B	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
1972080	1977260	B	0.9074903130531311	The active inference journal picks up where live stream stops.
1977600	1990124	B	0.683029055595398	The Active Inference Journal is engaged in continuous deployment and development of speech to text transcription, automated and manual editing, curation and finally publication.
1990252	1998848	B	0.8746533393859863	So just to give an example, a live stream will occur and then we use speech to text onto a public GitHub repository.
1998944	2020988	B	0.8505013585090637	Everybody can edit the markdown file and then we're able to publish those transcripts so that they can be citable, so that a conversation someone has can go onto their resume as a true citable publication and we can just facilitate the accessibility and the findability of these incredible conversations and moments that we have.
2021154	2023336	B	0.8748725652694702	And also in the active inference journal.
2023368	2029304	B	0.5629947185516357	We're always developing the process from setup for those of all technical backgrounds.
2029432	2037890	B	0.6424166560173035	How to get things working on your own local setup or on a cloud setup using free and open source software where possible.
2038660	2059480	B	0.8232077360153198	The speech to text, the text processing the editing, translating into languages, rendering into a diversity of formats, publishing through different channels and then engaging in further analysis related to natural language processing and the active inference ontology all these fun things we can do.
2059550	2081692	B	0.6939611434936523	So if you in an alternate multiverse, we're a librarian or an editor or a reviewer or an advocate of the Active Inference corpus, bring it into this reality and make a huge contribution by cultivating our epistemic garden and our offerings.
2081836	2104550	B	0.9030119180679321	Because there's so much enrichment that can happen with past streams and with proactively, letting the live stream project know and letting courses know how we can help them at the Journal to develop these kinds of publications that in new ways are expanding definitions of scholarship and research and service.
2106220	2107610	B	0.8361332416534424	Anything else to add?
2111420	2144230	A	0.8622141480445862	Yeah, as for this project, I believe it's like most technical heavy in the institute and maybe we can call it more broadly like language Processing project and maybe it is a good starting point for people who have good technical skills, some programming skills which are related to language processing in general or some specific part of it.
2145960	2157688	A	0.9071999192237854	Maybe it will be of interest for them to start from this project and later get better grasp on what is active influence is awesome.
2157774	2158712	B	0.570740818977356	Totally agree.
2158846	2170430	B	0.9014238715171814	It's like seeing the range of live streams is really one of the best ways to just jump into understanding the ways and the topics that people speak.
2171120	2190480	B	0.9530843496322632	Okay, we'll just briefly mention the research work happening, but this last several month period has been extremely focused and extremely productive on education with the two new courses, the qualification system, all of these other curricular developments.
2191860	2194880	B	0.8117388486862183	So there's several ongoing research projects.
2195040	2212132	B	0.8088715076446533	We have the active inference ontology as a research and development initiative, active blockference as a software package for complex systems modeling using active inference robotics and embodied with JF's symbolic active inference robots.
2212276	2226188	B	0.8596060872077942	And then there's some project seeds that we always love to offer up to interns or to volunteers as something that they can restart and take a lot of initiative, something that's just planted but barely there.
2226354	2236960	B	0.5941088795661926	And that right now is the graphical interface with thinking really expansively about what it looks like to learn and apply active inference from an embodied perspective.
2237300	2258740	B	0.751086413860321	And cognitive agent modeling, doing metaanalysis and synthesis across different cognitive modeling frameworks so that we can really have a place to point when we describe how different cognitive phenomena speaking to a cognitive pattern language are implemented or addressed by active inference and other frameworks.
2259080	2264248	B	0.7902172207832336	And then there's the so many of you who engage in individual research.
2264414	2277256	B	0.6270079016685486	So there's a lot of research happening in the space, and we see education as a fundamental enablement for research as part of the institute's mission for education and research development.
2277368	2291040	B	0.9921798706054688	So it's been good times with research, and I'm really excited to see all the projects that people share during sessions start to develop and flourish.
2291380	2293940	B	0.918372392654419	Anything else you want to add about research, Alex?
2298920	2330492	A	0.618730366230011	Yeah, maybe this direction was not so active last time, but as we discussed for future directions, that we will bring more attention and more efforts to maybe formalize a bit how we as institute can survive people around from ecosystems, how we can support them on their ways and so on.
2330546	2335470	A	0.9322856068611145	So it will be good times here, too.
2335940	2337356	B	0.5535995960235596	Yeah, agreed.
2337468	2346310	B	0.6003408432006836	We want to provide a lot of research services, so for people who want to be on any side of that table, reach out.
2347160	2357210	B	0.878569483757019	All right, well, the last section here is going to be a short active inference based presidential address.
2358220	2370830	B	0.878389298915863	I will be just speaking to some recent developments as well as past developments in the active inference space and just give a few thoughts on how they relate to the active inference institute and what we're all doing here.
2371760	2377016	B	0.902725875377655	If you're watching live, please write some questions or comments into the live chat.
2377048	2389088	B	0.8985679149627686	And at the end of this short address, we will review any other comments or questions from those who are here live, give some last thoughts, and then we'll be back into the work.
2389254	2400100	B	0.8788635730743408	So I wanted to begin this address with a reference to the work that was before active inference institute, which was active inference lab.
2400170	2411988	B	0.644818902015686	But even before active inference lab, there was the collaboration with Alex, Ivan, Alexandra, RJ, and myself around active inference and behavior engineering for teams and organizations.
2412164	2413576	B	0.7572580575942993	And this was in.
2413598	2421230	B	0.754030168056488	September 2020, only a few years ago, now more than two, but less than three years ago.
2421760	2444516	B	0.9308525919914246	And it's amazing how far things have come and at the same time how many of the topics that we were able to bring into this context of remote teams and organizations still ring as relevant and they're just gestured to here.
2444698	2465540	B	0.6631526947021484	We've gone far towards enacting and implementing and improving, but still we can think about cognitive entities engaged in the cyberphysical niche with narrative and rhetoric structuring their understanding of how sensory data translate into action.
2465700	2477468	B	0.8772847056388855	So for people who are interested in this topic, we invite you one way or another to engage with us on this journey because we are only going to do it all together.
2477554	2499220	B	0.5494933724403381	So I just wanted to begin with that kind of callback to several years ago, though so much has changed, certainly for all of us in the times between that when we really find first principles approaches like active inference and when we really care about systems of interest and communities, then the actions that we take, we don't regret.
2500040	2522088	B	0.7361850738525391	But I think we can go into a little bit more detail and reference some recent developments in the active inference ecosystem that speak to how day after day, week after week, our system of interest, active inference, learning and application really gifts or blesses us with new ways of thinking and new ways of acting.
2522184	2532110	B	0.89226233959198	So for example, just within the last months, the inner screen model of consciousness was released as a preprint by Maxwell Ramstead et al.
2532500	2544628	B	0.5998157858848572	Dealing with all these topics that we know and love and building upon the quantum free energy principle formalism, which again, it's easy to forget, was not even in place two years ago.
2544794	2561930	B	0.6430947780609131	Discussed in Live stream number 40 and weeks after publication, we're able to enact a conversation hearing from voices all over the world, bringing experts and those with different backgrounds onto the screen.
2562540	2573052	B	0.626362144947052	Here, the screen that you see is the classical information depository that enables us as quantum cognitive agents to engage with each other.
2573186	2602448	B	0.8262904286384583	And so all of these beautiful people on the stream who with their regime of attention and their quantum cognitive rotation brought to bear their attention and their language contribution through action, we are able to inscribe that on classical digital artifacts like live streams and transcripts and then provide it to the niche for all of you to rotate that into your own space and context.
2602624	2610520	B	0.599828839302063	So again, the spatial, temporal and conceptual linkages are happening at a speed that is boggling.
2610940	2617540	B	0.9289388060569763	And on the right is a paper from just this month officially by Thomas Parr et al.
2617630	2619704	B	0.8053507804870605	Cognitive effort and active inference.
2619832	2624604	B	0.8248098492622375	And I have the image small because there's more details to go into in the paper.
2624802	2639680	B	0.807654619216919	However, they used a well known model of cognitive burden called a Stroop model, which shows a color written out as a word and that word is shown in some color.
2639750	2652000	B	0.7914422750473022	So the color red written in red, the color red written in blue, and the timing dynamics of people's reading behavior and recognition behavior is a proxy for cognitive effort.
2652160	2673384	B	0.7581647038459778	And so this is just one more, not even brick in the wall, not even just one tool in the toolkit, but like another lens or layer or ability or capacity for active inference framework which adds these features affect, memory, anticipation.
2673512	2689356	B	0.7296380400657654	All these different features are layered in like a symphony without developing Bloat, because the first principles kernel, the cognitive firmware, is not getting Bloated, it is staying at first principles.
2689388	2692960	B	0.6039175391197205	And sometimes it feels like even diving down to zero with principles.
2693560	2715844	B	0.5121892094612122	While advanced research in the space is able to help us understand really sophisticated cognitive phenomena like cognitive effort, now one can look back through the previous stream and what we discussed and how could cognitive effort help us support the accessibility, rigor and applicability of active inference?
2715972	2723516	B	0.8263627886772156	It's such a natural question and again, week after week, our niche provides us with new ways of thinking and doing.
2723618	2729500	B	0.9602054357528687	So it's so fun to be gripping and gripped within active inference.
2731460	2736130	B	0.9669528603553772	I'd like to recognize and commend jacob's, excellent work.
2736820	2743380	B	0.7704323530197144	Just in April, we published Generalized Notation notation for active inference models.
2744040	2751648	B	0.8843440413475037	GNN generalized notation notation is a plain text format for conveying active inference generative models.
2751744	2758920	B	0.585105299949646	It's something like a dialect of markdown and it brings us closer and closer to the triple play.
2759070	2768080	B	0.7964879870414734	The triple play is the idea that we should have integrity amongst multiple representations of active inference models.
2768260	2783360	B	0.8714814186096191	That is, what we see visualized graphically or tangibly what we hear and say in terms of the natural language use and with executable cognitive simulations.
2783780	2799120	B	0.7655842304229736	So if someone looks at an organizational flowchart and there's three A's connected to two B's, that is something that we can visualize, describe and execute so that there isn't a front and a back room conversation.
2799280	2807464	B	0.6003286242485046	Rather, there's an integrated conversation that allows for everybody to make contributions in the modalities and in the ways that they want.
2807582	2817492	B	0.7841601967811584	And the interlingua, not the only interlingua, and by no means its final version is the plain text generalized notation notation.
2817636	2824424	B	0.9761248230934143	We're having a lot of fun working with language models and visualizing this, transforming it into executable simulations.
2824552	2846710	B	0.9647281169891357	And so thanks again, Yakup, for the really creative and dedicated work because this method is going to be a real core functionality for translating across visual elements, our natural languages and the kinds of simulations that we want to run.
2847320	2855860	B	0.8439189195632935	And I'll close with a recent publication with Karl Friston at all, including myself and Blue.
2855940	2859320	B	0.7297510504722595	So two out of three officers on the paper, not terrible.
2859900	2875464	B	0.710211992263794	And in this paper we used free energy principle and active inference to provide something like a measuring or an observability framework for ecology, evolution and development or ecoevo devo.
2875592	2880552	B	0.8925030827522278	And the way that this was done is through the Renormalization group of physics.
2880616	2890060	B	0.8818928599357605	And so in this image on the left, we can see it as like maybe a bunch of cells which each contain organelles and those cells make a tissue.
2890220	2897476	B	0.8651430606842041	Or the big circle might be the population of organisms or the ecosystem community.
2897658	2918048	B	0.756827712059021	Again, recognizing the nested niche engagement within and across levels of spatial and temporal modeling and looking at just two layers and how they're connected, we can think of that as a nested action perception cycle.
2918244	2940444	B	0.8495148420333862	So here's, like the sensory and the behavior of a worm, in this case, happening at whatever timescale it's being modeled at, and then at the slower or the deeper level of the hierarchical model, we have the Bayesian learning like process of the extended genotype happening in a slower adaptive layer.
2940572	2953030	B	0.7411456108093262	And so this should clearly connect to what we said at the very beginning of the stream about the institute as part of a nested system.
2953800	2959092	B	0.7984418869018555	Here we have the ecosystem, the space around here's, the institute.
2959156	2968700	B	0.5585231184959412	This is what it really means to enter and to join, not just to look into, but to be on or in the institute.
2969200	2980068	B	0.8463751673698425	And then the kinds of dynamic partitions that we're able to embody within the institute through our communications and through our actions.
2980264	3008980	B	0.9744392037391663	And so it's just so exciting to see everyone's incredible research contributions, the kinds of questions and developments that even if I were not an author, even if I were not in the active inference field, I would believe are at least the right things to be trying in terms of bringing theoretical integration in ecology, evolution and development.
3009140	3011860	B	0.5265834331512451	At least these are the right research avenues.
3012020	3036804	B	0.8214223980903625	But then again, to be able to act infer and serve through the institute as a multiscale evolutionary entity in and of itself, this kind of real time enactment of multiple scales and quantum reference frames is something that is only arising through cocreation.
3036952	3045860	B	0.9575743675231934	So in closing, I send my deepest appreciation to all those who support and care and engage.
3046360	3058170	B	0.8510235548019409	To those who are not sure, I welcome you to the past, the present and the future we respect and that's why we do what we do.
3059740	3065770	B	0.8862273693084717	So Alex, where do we go or what is next?
3069920	3091088	A	0.9771096110343933	Yeah, thank you very much for the talk and really providing that vision from the beginning and how it's going now and congratulations on that publication on evolutionary work.
3091254	3104230	A	0.9788439869880676	And it's a great opening direction and I believe this direction will make a next step into technical evolution also.
3104760	3112230	A	0.6929463744163513	And we will use this technique, evolution approach to develop institute candidacy system.
3114780	3117364	B	0.5441755652427673	Yes, I'll just wait a few more seconds.
3117412	3128008	B	0.9042534232139587	If anyone writes a question that we can address in the live chat, let's look at some of these questions that we look at at the end of every live stream.
3128184	3130244	B	0.8156956434249878	What would a good understanding enable?
3130392	3142364	B	0.5103455781936646	Well, if we were able to really understand our own generative model as the institute and as the active inference ecosystem, it would support our sense making and decision making.
3142502	3145670	B	0.5041428208351135	We'd be able to act and infer and serve better.
3146280	3149300	B	0.8869377970695496	What are the unique predictions and implications?
3150600	3152710	B	0.850426435470581	That's a very interesting question.
3154280	3162810	B	0.5406386852264404	I'm sure there are many ways to address this and we did have many future oriented expressions during this discussion, even today.
3164620	3168540	B	0.9080055356025696	What are the next steps for free energy principle and active inference?
3169360	3171004	B	0.8616304993629456	Again, do you have any thoughts on this one?
3171042	3172732	B	0.8366883397102356	The middle question or the second question?
3172786	3173500	B	0.6014144420623779	Alex.
3177840	3189740	A	0.7391628623008728	Delivered and unique predictions and next steps depends on some specific field or domain for ourselves.
3189820	3200580	A	0.6775983572006226	We understand that active inference is a scale free approach and it can be applied to any scale of research.
3200730	3221310	A	0.8458737730979919	Any domain which any researcher or engineer is working on can be described with active inference language starting from where using accordances to computational modeling or types of modeling and so on.
3224230	3224980	A	0.5491447448730469	Yeah.
3226470	3228580	B	0.8858540058135986	What are the goals of the research?
3230550	3240742	B	0.9156646728515625	To embody our mission to support the active inference ecosystem, to be the best institute we can be, be the best nest mates within it.
3240876	3241960	B	0.8090039491653442	What do you think?
3245070	3247130	A	0.6143413186073303	Maybe we should remove goals.
3248750	3250410	B	0.8029342889785767	Let's change it to preferences.
3251470	3252620	A	0.6082335710525513	Yeah, at least.
3253310	3259294	A	0.7888669371604919	And considering it in open endedness way.
3259492	3266030	A	0.7583573460578918	Again, we can speak about goals, but looks like it's not so useful concept.
3266770	3289026	B	0.5056305527687073	Yes, sometimes when we're talking about the specific research papers, we talk about the goal of that paper, but goal is not to be found in the active inference ontology and we find ways of making do and thriving without needing to rest upon goals and reward.
3289218	3290530	B	0.9822660684585571	And that's really exciting.
3290610	3308970	B	0.5611679553985596	And that's something that a lot of people don't even realize that they're steeped in reward maximization and goal implementation until the open endedness and the vitality of active inference becomes understood.
3309950	3311740	B	0.8943389654159546	What are you still curious about?
3312910	3315006	B	0.853803277015686	I'll let you go first, then I'll give a last thought.
3315028	3315920	B	0.778113067150116	As we close.
3319750	3326690	A	0.6112952828407288	I always remember our discussions about sense of the word curious in the beginning.
3329030	3341094	A	0.7183921933174133	It's like I believe more and more curious with week each day, each month.
3341292	3355674	A	0.5539394021034241	What our field, our frontier are showing us so much, a lot of different perspectives, different connections, real people in communications and projects and so on.
3355712	3357610	A	0.778483510017395	So it's happiness.
3359570	3360800	B	0.9611037969589233	Very beautiful.
3361730	3365214	B	0.7514366507530212	I'm curious about many things like that.
3365252	3377886	B	0.641175389289856	You said that we develop and hone that curiosity every day and we seek to spark and be sparked when people come in from different backgrounds with their curiosities.
3378078	3381058	B	0.9583246111869812	It's inspiring, to say the least.
3381144	3393622	B	0.8030325174331665	And I'm really curious about who will have listened or read this far in the stream and choose that moment to take an action to get involved with the institute.
3393806	3397658	B	0.6069149374961853	So there's only one way that my uncertainty is going to be reduced about that.
3397744	3399610	B	0.7654470801353455	And I think if you know, you know.
3399760	3400122	B	0.617027759552002	So.
3400176	3401206	B	0.9094076156616211	Thank you, Alex.
3401318	3402570	B	0.9037600755691528	Thank you, Blue.
3403150	3406650	B	0.9456404447555542	Thank you to the officers and to all of the institute.
3407070	3408140	B	0.673657238483429	See you around.
3409230	3410074	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
3410192	3411020	A	0.8529649972915649	Thank you.
