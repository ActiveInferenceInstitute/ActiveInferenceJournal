1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,160
hello

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,440
and welcome everyone to actin flab today

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:11,759
is

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,440
may 6 2021 and we're really excited to

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,880
have shauna dobson back

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,240
for mathstream 2.1 this is going to be a

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,640
fun

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,199
discussion diamond holographic principle

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:23,680
and

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,480
d square emergent time maybe you'll

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,599
teach us how to pronounce it

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,160
and what it is so thanks again for

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,960
coming on

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,040
this stream and really looking forward

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,520
to it so please take it away

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,120
thank you so much daniel i just want to

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,360
say your community is so supportive

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,360
and i'm so happy to be back for a second

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,520
talk you are all working on

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,320
some of the most you know profound ideas

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,120
um

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,960
here and so i'm really excited and thank

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,960
you for having me yay all right

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,760
so this talk i'm gonna go a little bit

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,719
into

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,960
the more like the diamond part because i

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,239
got some feedback on what are these

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,160
diamonds and what was she talking about

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,840
and so i was really excited that d

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,280
square is actually a d diamond for

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,479
emergent time

32
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,520
so um if i i'll try to do my best to lay

33
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,320
all these out

34
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,240
please ask um like daniel was saying

35
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,520
questions every you know

36
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,119
10 slides or something like that i'm

37
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,000
happy to answer it um i'm also

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,240
trying to constellate and weave together

39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,360
this sort of

40
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,080
kind of grand unified picture so um

41
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,080
there's some drawings in here and i hope

42
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,640
that it's

43
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,159
fun okay so uh let's let's go um i'll be

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,360
talking about the diamond holographic

45
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,000
principle

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,360
and d diamond emergent time yay okay so

47
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,960
the goal i sort of talked about this

48
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,159
last time but

49
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,360
not too too in detail um today i'm gonna

50
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,720
actually weave together

51
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,040
this kind of new math with uh active

52
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,159
inference and let's try to put it

53
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,680
together and all work together

54
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,439
so the goal is like to take the

55
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,960
holographic principle which we're you

56
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,280
know

57
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,399
um um all aware of uh which was like

58
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,520
begotten by um

59
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,799
maldacena's uh you know a beautiful

60
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,640
gauge gravity duality between

61
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
anti-disinterface space and conformal

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,600
field theory

63
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,159
i have an idea to sort of reinterpret it

64
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,000
in terms of continuous k

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,200
theory and something i'm going to call

66
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,280
pro emergence so a pro

67
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,640
object is a specific object

68
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,800
kind of in category theory that's being

69
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,760
used everywhere

70
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,360
and it's sort of this idea of sewing

71
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
together a bunch of

72
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,720
kind of smaller things that are

73
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,800
self-contained to get a grand object

74
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,319
and it's sort of built into the very

75
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,760
structure i thought oh this is a great

76
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,640
idea

77
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,239
so i talked about k theory a little bit

78
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,440
last time which is this beautiful

79
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,120
construction by grothen deek

80
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,720
to actually look at classifying

81
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,200
very difficult objects using isomorphism

82
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,040
classes of the spaces so

83
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
it's like oh we can tell if two spaces

84
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,319
are equivalent based on their

85
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,760
equivalence relations

86
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,680
and i thought that's a very very very

87
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,879
nice higher

88
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,800
way of looking at things and there's a

89
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,040
new work uh by ephemoth talking about

90
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,000
continuous k

91
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,319
theory so again this idea of sort of

92
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,360
sewing together maybe

93
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,440
smaller k theories to build a bigger

94
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,480
object

95
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,959
so for this pro emergence right i am

96
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,840
fascinated by

97
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,680
time and i want us to kind of get into

98
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,920
it right how does active inference see

99
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,640
these uh

100
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,800
these sort of time streams like are

101
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,480
there little local times with little

102
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,400
thicknesses around them what is this so

103
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,879
in this

104
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,040
this idea of mine is pro emergence you

105
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,560
have a doubly emergent time that's

106
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,400
emergent on two fronts

107
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,120
so um you have a local singular

108
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,720
condensed time which is sort of the time

109
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,640
that we all experience this very like

110
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,159
you know i'm presenting to uh your

111
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,080
lovely community 906 a.m

112
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,560
this is like shanna's now right but

113
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,680
there's also like

114
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,840
you know alpha centauri now and the

115
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,280
unicorn constellation

116
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,879
now right so there's all these different

117
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,440
nouns and who's now is what

118
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,200
so you have these like local singular

119
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,239
time and then you're going to have

120
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,760
actually have this global what i'm going

121
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,319
to try to push for is a non-locality

122
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,760
in the diamonds so um to rephrase the

123
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,519
holographic principle and

124
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,519
kind of upgrading ads which is

125
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,519
anti-sitter space which is the bulk

126
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,200
which has gravity in it i'm going to try

127
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,879
to actually rebuild that from the six

128
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,159
functor formalism

129
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,519
so that's what you see in this figure

130
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,680
with these um sort of six columns

131
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,239
is the six operations uh from peter

132
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,239
schultz the telecomology of diamonds

133
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,560
it's so beautiful so imagine building

134
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,439
space

135
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,080
from a functor formalism which is a very

136
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,200
very specific

137
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,399
and then um

138
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,680
if you're going to get the conformal

139
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,918
field theory which has no gravity

140
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,680
um i was thinking okay so the gravity

141
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
list should could be in the pro-finite

142
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,120
condition of the diamond so you see i

143
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,320
have a bunch of diamonds kind of glued

144
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,120
together

145
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,440
and so maybe this gluing in the diamond

146
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,240
condition can

147
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,080
kind of you know replace the conformal

148
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
field theory so in this

149
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,720
um you can actually get a holography and

150
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,000
it's really interesting to think what

151
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,080
active inference thinks about

152
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,520
uh holography like what's the actual um

153
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,080
reflection what's the actual object so

154
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,759
you can relate this to strong and weak

155
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,479
coupling

156
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,800
you know whichever theory is strong

157
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,240
right has a strong coupling which is

158
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,320
like you know the tension um um

159
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,040
you know in the interaction terms and um

160
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,320
so you can relate

161
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,720
you know you know whichever one you know

162
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,520
has maybe a

163
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,039
a weaker coupling you normally use like

164
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,720
a perturbation theory the stronger

165
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,440
coupling you have to use the

166
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,120
non-perturbation methods so it's very

167
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,160
physics-oriented

168
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,960
um and you know the beauty and the

169
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,800
duality is that if one space is too hard

170
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,759
you go to the other space

171
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,520
so this is really fun and this is then

172
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,840
um the i sort of have this grand opus

173
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,479
paper

174
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,720
uh the dob21 you're like she refers to

175
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,000
it all the time

176
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,160
okay so the goal right so i said you're

177
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,919
gonna have this pro emergent thing which

178
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,199
is like has multiple

179
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,039
emergent times going on it's not just

180
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,639
emergent time but i think they're

181
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,280
all over the place so in that is what

182
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,039
i'm gonna call v stack time

183
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,840
so um a stack is going to be this

184
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,080
particular object that takes um

185
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,880
values in categories not just sets so

186
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,840
we're not looking at like

187
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,440
the set of continuous functions but

188
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,280
maybe you're looking at the category

189
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,600
um of you know of continuous functions

190
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
and every object in the category is a

191
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,400
continuous function

192
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
so you're getting this sort of grand

193
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,600
unified view

194
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,800
um of of objects which is really really

195
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,199
neat

196
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,039
i say v because it's it's going to be a

197
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,240
stack with a v

198
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,520
topology on it i think i spoke last time

199
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,120
that you can actually put a topology on

200
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,639
categories and that's what i'm really

201
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,600
interested in

202
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,160
so the beach apology is uh peter schultz

203
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,720
says

204
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,080
topology that he's using for the

205
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
diamonds and it's um

206
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,400
it's a nice fine topology and i'll go

207
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,520
into it a little bit

208
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
so the big questions that are driving

209
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,280
some kind of you know wild diagram that

210
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,720
i have here in the middle this con d

211
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,560
diamond is like what is the mathematics

212
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,919
of simultaneity

213
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,000
so i'm really interested in what we mean

214
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,280
by simultaneity

215
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,680
and we say two events happen quote at

216
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,120
the same time what time

217
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,639
is that um and is there a difference

218
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,160
and what is the difference between

219
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,400
simultaneity and non-locality

220
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,479
non-locality you know you have spatial

221
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,520
non-locality

222
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,039
maybe the view from a pair of entangled

223
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,840
photons um and then what does temporal

224
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
non-locality mean that time is actually

225
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,280
everywhere that there is no

226
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
difference in time between events right

227
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,720
you have events that are maybe

228
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,880
spread out into space but maybe they

229
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,080
happen at the same time

230
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,400
so i'm really interested in what kind of

231
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,160
mathematics would be able to hold

232
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,759
something like that right maybe you have

233
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,440
a bunch of multiplicities going on but

234
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,199
they're all at once

235
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,120
so um you know i'm asking what is

236
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,599
embodied cognition in non-locality

237
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,599
how could you actually reframe one of

238
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,960
the fundamental tenets of like

239
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,080
active inference based on

240
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,319
like reframe it and non-locality not a

241
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,520
progression but what would actually

242
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,960
happen all at once

243
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,199
so this is where i think um you know the

244
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,639
mathematics would actually help like

245
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,080
infinity categories and this double

246
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,680
emergence that i'm talking about so i

247
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,280
talked about infinity categories last

248
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,840
time

249
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,240
these are categories that have a lot of

250
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
a lot of rich structure in them and

251
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,400
you're able to

252
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,199
create morphisms uh between morphisms

253
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,879
and between morphisms all the way up to

254
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,560
infinity morphisms which is really

255
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,840
really beautiful

256
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,919
so maybe the claim maybe it's kind of a

257
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,919
wild claim is that embody cognition like

258
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,360
is emergent time right so um what am i

259
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,759
gonna

260
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,280
you know hopefully that's something that

261
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,879
can i can kind of show throughout these

262
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,599
slides

263
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,560
in body cognition like is um emergent

264
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,039
time

265
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,039
so again the basis behind emergent time

266
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,560
is was it always here

267
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,400
i don't i don't know was time always

268
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,759
here who knows and that's what i'm kind

269
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,800
of after

270
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,240
so in this diagram you see i have the

271
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
spa fq which is the attic spectrum i'm

272
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,080
going to go into on the other side you

273
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,360
have spa qp

274
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,039
which is the attic spectrum of the p

275
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,639
addicts the diamond interpretation with

276
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,080
a little diamond on top

277
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,240
you've got these two factorization maps

278
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,440
these xps from

279
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,599
fargs work on his geometrization of the

280
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,639
local language so

281
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,720
heavy math in this um which is really

282
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,719
beautiful on the bottom you've got

283
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,159
this y diamond se these are um

284
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,120
this is called the diamond

285
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,039
interpretation of the fog fontaine curve

286
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,559
this is an attic curve

287
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,880
that has an actual forbinius action on

288
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,040
it and so this curve is very important

289
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,839
it's used in

290
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,080
the language program which is a you know

291
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,760
the top a grand unified theory of

292
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,880
mathematics right now

293
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,480
so then you have these ln maps that are

294
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,360
mapping up whatever up means

295
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,600
into what i call condensed tea diamond

296
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,120
so the condensed category

297
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,360
is uh peter schultz's construction about

298
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,880
category of condensed objects i'm gonna

299
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,760
go into those

300
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,839
it's a beautiful idea about sheaves over

301
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,000
points so anybody in the crowd

302
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,760
who knows what a sheep is it's like a

303
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,519
awesome topological way of keeping track

304
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,360
of local data local data liquid data

305
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
local data like a little bag

306
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,640
and um so i can't like normally um you

307
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,320
don't you have shaves over spaces

308
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,160
but here's an actual chief over a

309
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,519
singular point and

310
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,720
so he's uh he and um uh um dustin

311
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,000
claussen have been like putting together

312
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,800
this really

313
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,959
um awesome uh lecture notes on this

314
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,080
topic so it's great

315
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,360
it's in its embassy and i think it's

316
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,080
great so that d diamond is um

317
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,920
a conjecture of mine that you take the

318
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,279
diamond i talked about last time

319
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,560
and you can actually extend it to the

320
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,480
infinity category of diamonds so i call

321
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,600
that d-dime

322
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,200
a lot of stuff in that diagram but this

323
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,120
is you know what i think is actually the

324
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,839
aesthetic

325
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,560
uh because it you know what if we could

326
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,320
actually map this to like um

327
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,760
you know a string theoretic

328
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,120
interpretation or something then you get

329
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,399
the grand unified theory of math and

330
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,040
physics

331
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,959
boom okay so um

332
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,360
let me open that just a little bit so if

333
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,079
you take

334
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,760
uh let c be the category of diamonds

335
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,200
like condensed c be the category of

336
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
condensed objects in c

337
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,440
objects are condensed diamonds right

338
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,320
that's what's in there

339
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,480
um let r be the reflective full

340
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,320
subcategory of condensed c

341
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,399
this is a subcategory where all objects

342
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,720
and are actually reflections

343
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,920
of objects in uh the bigger category

344
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,600
so it's very neat we have diamonds and

345
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,959
they're reflections

346
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,120
so objects in our reflections so if you

347
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,480
take d diamond to be the infinity one

348
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,000
category of diamonds you can extend

349
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,720
this to conde diamond so condensed e

350
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,240
diamond and you get this actual

351
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,040
um object so following precedent from

352
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,320
fargs amazing work

353
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,079
uh the fiber product of this diagram is

354
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,839
claimed a modulized space and a diamond

355
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,360
that's very hard

356
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,040
all right so that's uh that's hard

357
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,480
so modulai of v stack time so let's take

358
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,399
this condensed diamond and just

359
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,200
up it just a little bit so i have this

360
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,959
other conjecture right

361
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,360
let's take um so the way that you get

362
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,800
these diamonds

363
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,240
oh i don't have a figure all right i

364
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,680
have the figure of a diamond very very

365
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,279
soon the way you get the diamond is by

366
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,040
taking equivalence classes

367
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,120
uh certain prohibited equivalence

368
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,800
classes of

369
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
these objects called perfectoid spaces

370
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,320
which are like berkovich space it's kind

371
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,160
of like cancer objects

372
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,760
and so you glue those together and you

373
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,120
get a diamond well why don't we glue

374
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,800
diamonds together and get something else

375
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,920
so you can do that so if you can take

376
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,600
diamond equivalence relations of this

377
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,839
diamond curve then you can get a stack

378
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,839
and the v topology and then why don't we

379
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,760
work in the modulized space of v stack

380
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,200
so modular space

381
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,040
is this awesome parameter space where

382
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,360
each point represents an isomorphism

383
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,079
class

384
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,519
of objects so you're looking at so each

385
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,360
point like in this little figure below

386
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,880
um is uh an isomorphism class

387
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,839
and so the question is like uh you know

388
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,839
how do you move in a diagram like that

389
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:54,959
is it a chess board

390
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,120
is it can i only move this way and this

391
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,399
way and this way so i'm really

392
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,600
interested in like

393
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,760
what it means phenomenologically to have

394
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,639
something like this

395
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,440
and to start in the upper left like dot

396
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,320
and jump to the

397
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,480
like the bottom right dot so how do you

398
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,160
actually move through this thing so i'm

399
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,519
thinking that every point

400
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,279
of that moduli space would actually be

401
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,800
an incarnation

402
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,959
of the condensed d diamond diagram so

403
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,120
that that huge factorization with these

404
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,160
maps

405
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,360
would actually be each point and i think

406
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,480
that's actually really beautiful so

407
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:24,959
that's the

408
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,320
type of like grand unified theory i'm

409
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,399
kind of thinking of um

410
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,120
yeah so these ln maps play a dual role

411
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,240
of what's called topological

412
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,279
localization

413
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,680
localization is a beautiful phenomenon a

414
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,440
beautiful way of actually

415
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,200
constructing equivalences between um

416
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,160
between objects and so topological

417
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,760
localization passes through this

418
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,440
reflective subcategory so

419
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,920
objects are being sort of stared at by

420
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,120
their reflections and it's a way of

421
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,959
getting more equivalences and maps

422
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,600
so i'll just leave that at that so this

423
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,440
pro terminology this is a little mathy

424
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,639
but i thought you know we're

425
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,079
let's do it i'm not going to go

426
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,600
supermathy but i want to give you enough

427
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,040
terms so you know like what i'm talking

428
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,760
about

429
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,399
so for this pro which i think is very

430
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,240
cool the idea is that emergence

431
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,959
is built into the very space as a pro

432
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,519
object

433
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,519
and not as additional counter terms i

434
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,959
think the ai community the active

435
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,880
inference community does that as well

436
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,639
you want everything sort of built into

437
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,440
the structure as opposed to adding these

438
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,880
uh counter terms there's a lot of

439
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,320
beautiful like feynman path integral

440
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,000
work that has all of these additional

441
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,880
counter terms

442
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,399
um added to it and it's like i wish it

443
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,720
could just be built into the actual

444
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,760
space

445
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,760
so you can actually do that with this

446
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,360
pro terminology

447
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,200
right so a pro object all this is um

448
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,880
there's a great reference called in cat

449
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,560
lab that has all these definitions

450
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,959
so i'm pulling all these um and lots of

451
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,399
great lecture notes on any kind of pro

452
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,199
object

453
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,880
so what is a pro object a pro object of

454
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,959
a category c is a formal

455
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,000
co-filtered limit of objects of c so

456
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,920
basically roughly um what we mean by

457
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,600
this co-filtered limit is that for every

458
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:55,920
two

459
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,480
objects c1 c2 and c you have a third

460
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,320
object c3 and c

461
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,120
that they both get mapped to it so it's

462
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,399
sort of self-contained

463
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,920
you see it's built into the structure

464
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,360
you don't have to go off and leave the

465
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,440
category to find the limit

466
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,360
so you have a hom functor um

467
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,440
also so what you do you take s to be a

468
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
closed symmetric manoidal category

469
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,959
closed um i have the definition for both

470
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,320
of these symmetric minority means it has

471
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,519
a tensor product

472
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,839
and you take c and s in rich category

473
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,600
which means that it takes values um

474
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,160
the harm set of c takes values in s so

475
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,000
you have this enriched hom functor

476
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,680
which is written like this c takes in

477
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,240
two pairs um going from the product

478
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,079
of c opposite with itself whereas the

479
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,680
opposite is the same category

480
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,040
the arrows are just reversed 2s

481
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
that sends a pair of objects in c to

482
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,120
this hum object which is a collection of

483
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,720
morphism so look at that

484
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,440
you're actually mapping each pair of

485
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,519
objects to where it can go

486
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,519
right to all the possible paths and i

487
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,959
think this is very nice

488
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,959
so a closed category means for any pair

489
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,560
cc prime of objects the collection of

490
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,320
morphisms is an actual object

491
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,240
of c so everything is inside of itself

492
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,839
and it's sort of like a categorical

493
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,440
closure property right

494
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,880
if anyone's familiar with just the

495
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
closure property of um

496
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,320
that you learn in like you know abstract

497
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,639
algebra so this is called the internal

498
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,040
hom

499
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,519
object right so um five the pro functor

500
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,040
so with the pro terminology you can

501
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,160
actually have a profunctor which

502
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,360
generalizes the word

503
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,399
uh term functor so let's c and d both be

504
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,240
enriched over c the pro-functor from c

505
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,800
to d is an

506
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,920
s functor so it's enriched uh with d op

507
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,360
um tensor c over s so again taking the

508
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,600
pairs and mapping them over

509
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,199
so you can also make this into like i

510
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,959
told you this modulized space

511
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,720
right right here with the points where

512
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,480
isomorphism classes

513
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,959
um are each point and they can vary

514
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,720
geometrically and i'll go into what that

515
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,440
means

516
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,560
um and you can get stacks from that so i

517
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,920
think i'll finish the pro and then ask

518
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,199
if there's any questions daniel just to

519
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,880
wrap up this this pro okay

520
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,800
before yeah let's get the supers techy

521
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,000
stuff out of the way

522
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,480
um all right so what's also beautiful

523
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,560
and uh all over the language program is

524
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,399
the idea of a pro finite group

525
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,480
so you can either you can take this pro

526
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,519
language

527
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,880
this kind of multi-gluing and

528
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,720
self-containedness and extend it to a

529
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,399
profinite group which is a topological

530
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,320
group that's isomorphic to the inverse

531
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,040
limit

532
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
of an inverse system of discrete finite

533
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,360
groups so you have this inverse limit

534
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,959
over the discrete finite groups these

535
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,320
are finite groups that they all have the

536
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,600
discrete topology

537
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
and you have a collection of

538
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,040
homomorphisms that satisfy nice

539
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,240
relations

540
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,800
so my idea is like okay let's let's

541
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,279
let's

542
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,519
up the game even more there's a lot of

543
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,040
work about spectra

544
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,639
and prime spectra and this is also

545
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,639
growth in d where the spectrum of a ring

546
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,480
i think i talked about it last time

547
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,600
um is a certain um the spectrum of ring

548
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,079
refers

549
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,399
is a space where the actual points of

550
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,399
the space refer to prime ideals

551
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,959
so again you have this like point

552
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,480
referring to something higher than a

553
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,160
point

554
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,560
okay so you can extend that to what i

555
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,279
call a

556
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,360
formal spectrum so gothic had this great

557
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,839
idea of like including

558
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,000
infinitesimals and things so it's not

559
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,760
like you have a singular

560
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,400
now but what if we had a singular noun

561
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,160
with a little bit of infinitesimal

562
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,119
thickening on it

563
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,079
right like every every now or every like

564
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,919
local time of ours had a little bit of

565
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:18,480
thickening

566
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,000
and we could call that an infinitesimal

567
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,679
thickening and so

568
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,280
um he actually has the same idea and he

569
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,520
calls it formal spectra

570
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,559
so we say the formal spectrum spuf r of

571
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,720
a community of ring r and as an ideal

572
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,160
that obeys certain properties

573
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,679
it's actually the inductive limit of the

574
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,600
prime spectrum so inductive limit

575
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,880
um meaning like this so uh the

576
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,919
the pro refers to a projective phenomena

577
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,760
on the end refers to an inductive so

578
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,280
it's like a co-limit

579
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,400
so spf r is the co limit of spec r um i

580
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,280
n which is um the where r is complete

581
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:51,919
with the i

582
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,760
attic topology there's various ways of

583
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,000
completing rings in the i attic

584
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,440
so um where the connective morphisms are

585
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
these closed nil potent immersions

586
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,880
spec r-i-n immersed

587
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,840
with spec uh r i n plus one so these are

588
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,440
of affine schemes and the co-limit is

589
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,039
taken in the category of topologically

590
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,480
ringed spaces so

591
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,120
uh what is a what is a closed nilpotenum

592
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,199
not

593
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,039
a available sheath which is again this

594
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,480
kind of thickening thing so imagine a

595
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,080
space with a little bit of like skin

596
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,720
on it and so i'm thinking that okay it's

597
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,400
not just a pro emergence of points it's

598
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,520
a pro emergence of these

599
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,919
formal spectra which are like times

600
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,440
intervals with little thickenings on

601
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,840
them so nilput and elephants uh and i

602
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,880
say elephants and no

603
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,799
nail pold and elephants nilpoten

604
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,240
elements are

605
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,880
our infinitesimal neighborhoods and so a

606
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,559
beautiful

607
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,880
way to complete again to complete the

608
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,720
ring you know having convergence issues

609
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,440
like settled

610
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,440
is to actually take added completion so

611
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,200
added completion is to actually have all

612
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,799
the infinite testable neighborhoods

613
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,600
at once and i think that's a grand goal

614
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,200
and anybody after added completion to

615
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,120
have all the thickenings right

616
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,600
um is what is probably what we should be

617
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,880
after

618
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,559
any questions on that so far before i

619
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,799
get to the fun

620
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,559
just like i yep okay thanks for this um

621
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,960
interesting intro i think one thing

622
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,000
that's really gonna

623
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,559
resonate with people hopefully of all

624
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,039
different

625
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,120
backgrounds is what you said about we

626
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,120
want emergence built into the base

627
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,760
structure of our model not a counter

628
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,799
term which isn't

629
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,400
a term that's familiar to me but it's

630
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,080
kind of like magic

631
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,080
shouldn't be added at the higher level

632
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,120
we should have a model

633
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,080
where at the base level we have

634
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,720
emergence and then you um mentioned

635
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,120
the pairs of objects and a few different

636
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,600
kind of pair operations like inverses

637
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,120
and so i was just wondering how should

638
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,440
we think about these pairs of objects

639
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,120
for example are they organisms

640
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,280
in the niche or are they two organisms

641
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,039
because if so then we can kind of think

642
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,480
every time you say pair

643
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,240
we might be able to like map it on to

644
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,520
something that that

645
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,880
we've talked about from the embodied

646
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,559
cognitive perspective

647
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,240
oh i like that yeah go ahead try that

648
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,679
try that um

649
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,120
you know well you could take you know

650
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,880
the category c of organisms and then it

651
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,440
could be

652
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,679
um any two organisms in the actual

653
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,919
category if you wanted the category

654
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,080
you know to be um you know pairs of

655
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
organisms like uh the organism daniel an

656
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,679
organism shanna or something different

657
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,280
then you could actually construct the

658
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
category to be that that's the beauty of

659
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,320
category theory

660
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,039
you construct it to be whatever you want

661
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,240
because structurally

662
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,320
you know the goal the goal is to get

663
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,679
everything built

664
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,919
inside the actual space and to have

665
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,440
these consistency issues

666
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,799
that you're not like oh well

667
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,080
yeah you know so like uh we come online

668
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,960
and then there's this counter term oops

669
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,159
so you actually have it

670
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,280
um where organism you know is

671
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,440
relating to or interacting with like

672
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,640
organism right

673
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,080
or you could actually have a category b

674
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,840
just the way that my organism is

675
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,159
identifying and

676
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,159
interpreting information like whatever

677
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,600
you want those objects to be it's

678
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,840
completely loose

679
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,080
cool thanks and i'll relay any questions

680
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,679
from live chat in another

681
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,480
10 slides yay awesome okay this is so

682
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,400
great yay so we're all on the same page

683
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,640
um you know built it build it into the

684
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,919
structure you know

685
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,000
and if you want the structure centered

686
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
around you know you can actually have

687
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,120
this c3 being like

688
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,200
the organism daniel the organism shanna

689
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,039
that everything maps back to me

690
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,960
because that's what we're doing right

691
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,720
inactive everything comes back to me

692
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,919
i'm trying to process um okay cool

693
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,440
all right so um okay this is a

694
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,120
i don't know these ideas may just all be

695
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,840
wild but i'm glad you know i'm here to

696
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
help right

697
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,919
so i don't know this is where my brain

698
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,039
thinks okay

699
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,280
so we have the idea of an infomorphism

700
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,480
which is an actual

701
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,799
pair of an adjoint pair of functors

702
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,640
that's on a chew space

703
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,080
and my colleague my great colleague

704
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,159
chris fields has done so much work

705
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,520
with that you know chris fields pairs

706
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,600
with levin all the time they come up

707
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,640
with this great step

708
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,760
so an infomorphism is one pair one set

709
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,039
of adjoint uh

710
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,000
functors which um um which satisfy some

711
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,799
information

712
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,840
my idea is to make a two infomorphism

713
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,080
from these six functor formulas so in

714
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,400
these

715
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,559
kind of wild equations down here the two

716
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,600
tails is

717
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,840
is a structural property an internal hom

718
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,360
and an actual tensor product how you

719
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,799
actually combine things

720
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,280
but the four in the middle represent two

721
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,760
pairs of adjoint functors so if

722
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,400
one set of two pairs is infomorphism i

723
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,000
just want to actually construct

724
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,799
a two infomorphism which would actually

725
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:39,440
be

726
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,760
a morphism between morphism so that's a

727
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,600
categorical thing at this point

728
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,200
we're working on the semantics of what

729
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,360
that actually means right now

730
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,039
and so bear with us that should be out

731
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,559
very very soon

732
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,960
so what is this the idea is the

733
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,360
incarnation of global time emerges from

734
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,440
diamond non-locality what i just tried

735
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,520
to say local time emerges from these

736
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,720
singular condensed

737
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,679
sets the two infomorphism is going to

738
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,320
connect

739
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,400
the global time with the local time

740
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,760
that's the whole point right that's how

741
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,120
your organism evolves

742
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,840
right uh that's how you deduce is to

743
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,320
connect

744
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,760
your local time with what's actually

745
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,840
happening globally right these cannot be

746
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,360
singularly they have to intersect at

747
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,159
some point

748
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,000
so if this two infomorphism can actually

749
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,760
do that then you can actually get this

750
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,159
temporal simultaneity non-locality i'm

751
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,600
still not convinced that there is a

752
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,799
difference

753
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,960
between simultaneity and non-locality i

754
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,400
would love it for anyone and you're um

755
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,000
you know if anyone's um

756
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,080
like interested in that that's that's

757
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,280
really that's tricky

758
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,919
because uh maybe maybe the instance of

759
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,200
simultaneity

760
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,000
is a slice of the non-locality or maybe

761
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,960
we were actually

762
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,679
in tune enough with what's happening

763
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,080
like

764
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,320
um like embodied cognition-wise or

765
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,840
whatever that we were actually

766
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,360
able to access for just a second

767
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,720
maybe the true non-locality of

768
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,080
everything that is the non-locality of

769
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,200
information whatever you want to call it

770
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,320
what is the difference i don't really

771
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,200
know

772
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,960
uh people normally refer to like special

773
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,559
relativity in reference frames

774
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,520
and i i have a couple questions about

775
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,960
what reference frames are

776
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,159
so um anytime you know i i think i'm

777
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:10,559
gonna

778
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,640
tackle a new subject i invent a new

779
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,159
dictionary i'm like okay let's start

780
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,679
with a dictionary to actually translate

781
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,039
what i'm talking about

782
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,240
okay so the notion of a site in category

783
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,799
theory

784
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,880
is where i can put a topology so i'm

785
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,000
thinking if i'm

786
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,440
you know for instance looking at the

787
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,039
site over you know organism

788
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,559
you know investigating its environment

789
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,200
something like this the site of shanna

790
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,279
that couldn't that's a categorical

791
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,960
categorical way of actually

792
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,440
um referring to the localization

793
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,039
phenomena and the collapse

794
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,039
right so quantum mechanics is saying you

795
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,480
go from you know the collapse of the

796
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,200
wave function

797
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,760
is uh great i go from a simultaneous

798
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,720
like super position

799
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,840
state to like a localized now of course

800
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,120
there's you know

801
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,400
controversy about the collapse and

802
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,840
things like that that's why i'm using

803
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,760
the word localization you localize and

804
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,880
then now

805
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,600
so um coupling perturbation right so

806
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,960
again strong coupling you have to use

807
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,919
these um

808
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,320
um these non-perturbative methods weak

809
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,159
coupling you can use perturbation

810
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,840
there's a i think there's a link between

811
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,600
perturbation and this perfectoid stuff

812
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,039
that i've been looking at

813
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,960
so there's a way called uh called

814
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
tilting to go from uh characteristic

815
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,640
zero if people are familiar with that to

816
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,159
characteristic p

817
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,919
you can also add these beautiful objects

818
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,640
called uh p divisible formal group laws

819
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,760
uh which are um uh you know once again

820
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
uh i would say ways of connecting like

821
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,799
groups um

822
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,960
the kernels of these actual maps are p

823
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,919
to the end torsion

824
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,559
so the torsion element um actually

825
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,080
annihilates any other element

826
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,000
so an element is torsion if it actually

827
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,679
um is annihilated by another element

828
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,880
so you can see that you have these p to

829
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,480
the n sort of phenomena that are

830
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,760
canceling terms

831
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,960
so the whole idea is that you can get

832
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,120
this cancellation and sort of a

833
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,000
sequence phenomena um also in perpecute

834
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,960
spaces

835
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,279
so there's also torsion in these objects

836
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,720
called shimura varieties which we'll

837
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,240
talk about later that's in the language

838
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,200
conjecture

839
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,600
strong coupling maybe it's strong uh you

840
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,480
know maybe

841
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,919
in the diamond we could say strong

842
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,360
coupling is in the diamond side of the

843
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,559
holography

844
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,240
because there's many incarnations of

845
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,080
these covers spa cd

846
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,279
and i'll go into this a little bit later

847
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,039
just trying to put the ideas up front

848
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:11,919
weak coupling

849
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,600
right so maybe you can do perturbation

850
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,960
phenomena um

851
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,039
in the condensed setting uh in the

852
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,480
interior um

853
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,320
you know so maybe that's in the singular

854
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,000
perfectoid time it's weak because it's

855
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,480
uh you know condensed maybe it's easier

856
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,000
to work with protel covers than

857
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,360
in the condensed setting so it would

858
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,720
make you work in the conformal field

859
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,400
theory which is the diamonds

860
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,760
so the whole relation to the diamond

861
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,600
holography is that if you have these six

862
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,919
operations right in the bulk

863
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,440
then you're gonna have to go from the

864
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,840
bulk to the conformal field so maybe the

865
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,000
inside is the six operations

866
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,520
uh you know um whichever one you want to

867
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,880
call strong and we coupling

868
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,320
so what do i what do i need to finish

869
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,760
well you need to like to i need to

870
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,440
actually take the six operations and put

871
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,200
them in the condensed setting

872
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,799
and then link the diamond profinite

873
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,720
conditions with non-locality

874
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,600
so you get what's called diamond descent

875
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,520
descent is another way

876
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,960
like daniel was saying about keeping the

877
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,120
the system contained the scent is a way

878
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,720
of actually making sure that

879
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,840
the covering spaces can can reconstruct

880
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,400
the lower space so my local space is

881
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,159
actually constructable from my glow

882
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,960
my global space and vice versa this is

883
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,000
another way of keeping

884
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,399
the structure built inside the actual

885
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,279
space

886
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,720
okay and we'll talk about diamond

887
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,039
localization which is going to be a way

888
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,799
to make relations between the various

889
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,080
diamonds

890
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,480
all right so let's try to link this

891
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,159
right so we're calling infomorphism it's

892
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,679
an adjoint pair of structure preserving

893
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,520
maps for a choose space the beauty about

894
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,200
two spaces it's got a very very nice

895
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,039
construction categorically

896
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,640
the chew constructions build builds

897
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,120
what's called a star autonomous category

898
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,559
this is a monoidal category it has a

899
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,320
tensor product in them to help help you

900
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,799
move nav objects around where all

901
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,679
objects have

902
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,000
duals right so i thought this might be

903
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,440
interesting from embodied cognition

904
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,720
because maybe you're looking around at

905
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,320
your reflection and learning off of your

906
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,279
reflection

907
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,039
right and where are these reflections

908
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,640
everywhere so if all

909
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,159
objects have duals that's a very strong

910
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,679
property for a category which is why

911
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,120
there's a lot of type theory and stuff

912
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,960
that works in the choose space

913
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,559
so you also have a category five

914
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,480
forbinius algebra this is an associative

915
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
algebra with a linear form on it

916
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,559
i told you furbinius was even in the

917
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,600
langlens right so furbinius is powerful

918
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,360
in body cognition everything is related

919
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,640
right so you want everything to be

920
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,840
related so what if

921
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,919
what if everything was a star autonomous

922
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,520
category so i think the true

923
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,200
construction is actually very pertinent

924
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,919
here

925
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,320
so if the hidden states what if those

926
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,039
are like a pro

927
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,919
finite condition or a pro object that

928
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,760
maybe just only become

929
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,120
uh you know visible upon a certain

930
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,039
pullback so in the diamond construction

931
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,320
that i gave you i said those

932
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,159
those geometric points were mathematical

933
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,600
impurities yeah that they were not

934
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,559
visible

935
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,720
unless you pulled them back over these

936
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,120
covers there's once again a lot of work

937
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,320
um about neurology um

938
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,640
acting topologically meaning that you

939
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,720
your proprioception is gotten by these

940
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,399
topological covers

941
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,640
where portions of the mind or the brain

942
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,440
are actually

943
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,559
working uh together um

944
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,399
and where where portions sort of

945
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,840
intersect and overlap

946
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,440
that's a that's a covering phenomenon

947
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,520
and that's how you actually um deduce

948
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,799
and things like this

949
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,880
so shared action okay okay so if we were

950
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,720
if we're after shared action

951
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,360
you know what if we start looking at

952
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,640
relations between

953
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,200
relations that's where the shared action

954
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,120
is we want to think collectively yeah

955
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,679
in the face of uncertainty if we start

956
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,720
thinking

957
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,159
in the framework of two morphism

958
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,760
then you're already in the global space

959
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,440
and i think there's nothing more shared

960
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,200
than working in the relation of the

961
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,880
relation space instead of being so

962
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,600
siloed

963
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,799
you can be silent in your own

964
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,640
localization but that's not going to

965
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,840
help for shared action

966
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,440
you need to actually so if everyone can

967
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,640
get a hold of everyone else's two

968
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,080
morphisms

969
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,760
you know what does that mean that means

970
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,679
they're actually all intersecting

971
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,919
and interacting um you can take that and

972
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,080
go to in awareness which is what

973
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,159
my awesome colleague robert prentner and

974
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,679
i have been working on as well

975
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,600
that you know i i'm not sure i think i

976
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,960
said that last time but i do not believe

977
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,799
that there's only one channel here

978
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,440
right i feel like through uh shared

979
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,320
action

980
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,640
you could access more of these sort of

981
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,840
consciousness channels

982
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,880
um and so the an awareness is actually a

983
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,799
categorical phenomenon that i can show

984
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:19,600
here

985
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,799
so i think i showed this last time but

986
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,399
i'll just show it again so on the left

987
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,520
you have a basic

988
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,440
uh depiction of a category this one

989
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,720
right here

990
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,559
my little mouse is like not working all

991
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,720
right so the one on the left

992
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,919
uh top row left

993
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,600
so you have um two um two objects here a

994
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,399
and b

995
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,640
f1 and g1 amorphisms right you have two

996
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,760
objects c and d

997
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,200
um f2 and g2 are those are morphisms

998
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,960
we'll call them one morphisms

999
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,640
let's go to the category in the middle

1000
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,799
so the category middle is a two category

1001
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,919
oh and i'm sorry the category on the

1002
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,760
left is a one category so if you go to a

1003
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,039
two category in the middle

1004
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,440
you have the same objects a b c d and

1005
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,240
the same one

1006
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
one morphism but look at these wild maps

1007
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,279
on the side

1008
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,679
so you're mapping uh look look what

1009
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,279
we're mapping on the left you're mapping

1010
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,320
the morphism

1011
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,200
f1 to g2 by that map fee and then you're

1012
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,480
also by gamma

1013
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,679
you're mapping a g uh g1 to

1014
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,480
f2 so this is awesome so look what we're

1015
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,279
doing there

1016
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,799
now you're mapping the morph isn't

1017
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,240
between the morphisms and this is where

1018
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,000
i think shared action lives

1019
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,440
you can go even wilder because you know

1020
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,360
it's me um

1021
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,760
so the third the third cat you can have

1022
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,120
a three category

1023
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,000
um which is the top right piece and look

1024
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,880
at that

1025
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,080
a three category consists of objects one

1026
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,399
morphisms between the objects

1027
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,279
two morphisms between the one morphisms

1028
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,880
and then look at the three morphism you

1029
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,760
have going on

1030
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,320
the big double bar a triple bar

1031
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,440
horizontal bar

1032
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,279
that's connecting fee and gamma is there

1033
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,919
racy so you see you can just keep going

1034
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,559
and why not that's where collection yeah

1035
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,120
go ahead

1036
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,960
oh just wanted to give one little

1037
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,159
thought on this it's almost like

1038
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,799
yes let's say a b c d are people and

1039
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:01,840
then

1040
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,399
the two mapping is kind of like best

1041
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,200
friends

1042
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,360
or marriage it's like two people who are

1043
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,440
married there's some parallelism

1044
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,760
between couples of married people and

1045
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,640
then the three

1046
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,200
is like the mapping between marriage and

1047
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,640
being a best friend

1048
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,080
and so it's like saying the relationship

1049
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,919
between person a and b

1050
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,399
in the marriage is like the relationship

1051
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,760
between a and b in the best friend

1052
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,640
relationship

1053
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,679
so it's like we can put the relationship

1054
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,279
and almost objectify it but not in a

1055
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,440
demeaning way just in a containing

1056
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,559
formal way

1057
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,880
and then use that to build higher order

1058
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,880
relationships so this is like

1059
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,760
very interesting look at that yeah you

1060
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,279
say it i should just give you my slides

1061
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,679
and you present

1062
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,640
it's a co it's a co-presentation and we

1063
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,360
as in

1064
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,320
as a dyad are interacting with the

1065
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,480
material you've prepared as well as any

1066
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,640
questions that anyone else brings wow

1067
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,320
and so does everyone see so like

1068
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,720
collectively oh that makes me excited so

1069
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,600
collectively like

1070
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,039
even this interaction is like a three

1071
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,039
morphism right now and so

1072
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,600
that's actually really cool and you see

1073
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,519
um

1074
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,600
i like the yeah the with like marriage

1075
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,360
maybe you know maybe

1076
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,120
if you stayed in the one category you

1077
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,480
would have just been friends and you

1078
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,519
would have never actually tried the

1079
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,799
other relationship or the other

1080
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,480
relationship or you can go like

1081
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,159
you know twin flames and all this kind

1082
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,840
of stuff and so it's actually really

1083
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,559
exciting

1084
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,159
and so you can see just like daniel's

1085
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,320
saying that's shared action and let's

1086
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,240
like let's take shared action

1087
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,760
to infinity and then what a beautiful

1088
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,679
place this would be you know you kind of

1089
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,960
have like you know the people like me

1090
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,919
that are you know

1091
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,600
related to animals too so it'd be like

1092
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,360
oh okay so then you have the morphism

1093
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,880
between like the theta wave of the

1094
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,960
animals talking to like the humans and

1095
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,440
then

1096
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,120
like oceans and things like that and

1097
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,039
then you might start relating on the

1098
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:47,440
higher

1099
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,399
like higher um connection level right

1100
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,000
not hierarchical but like a higher

1101
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,039
connection level

1102
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,880
and so you can see that uh robert and i

1103
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,559
were trying to think okay

1104
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,679
let's let's get weird and like take you

1105
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:00,000
know

1106
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,919
the one level of awareness which is like

1107
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,519
uh you know daniel and i co-presenting

1108
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,559
here because he's

1109
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,519
says my slide's better than me so the

1110
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,520
the co-presentation right is maybe like

1111
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,879
a one awareness

1112
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,359
okay and then two awareness let's let's

1113
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,960
just bump this up a little bit

1114
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,320
would be that you know he and i are

1115
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,199
presenting here and then simultaneously

1116
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,560
like we're both cambridge apostles

1117
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,399
what yes that's the level that i'm

1118
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,000
willing to go right

1119
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,679
because if time is non-local which i

1120
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,199
sort of think it is

1121
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,879
why can't we map to it using these

1122
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,239
morphisms right of course we'd have to

1123
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,520
do i don't know some kind of partition

1124
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,000
in the brain

1125
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,480
or whatever but we'll get to that later

1126
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,560
but that's what we're saying about this

1127
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,359
nested hierarchy so use the same uh

1128
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:42,639
everything that daniel's saying about

1129
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,560
the categories right one category two

1130
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,000
category three category

1131
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,480
and bump it to like awareness meaning

1132
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,000
actual interaction

1133
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,679
like let's take in body cognition and

1134
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,760
bump it like what would a two embodied

1135
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
cognition be a three embodied and let's

1136
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,879
keep going up

1137
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,720
because that would require higher higher

1138
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,560
levels of this awareness this stacky

1139
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,000
thing and again the beauty about

1140
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,160
this is that look we didn't add some

1141
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,200
counter term

1142
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,440
right we didn't just add uh you know the

1143
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,960
whole thing is magic of course and you

1144
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,560
know i love magic but we didn't just

1145
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,480
add it out of nowhere this was like

1146
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,560
built into the actual structure

1147
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,839
which i think is cool so again most

1148
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,760
people may be um intimidated by category

1149
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,200
theory or whatever at the first

1150
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,119
but it's like i think there's a payoff

1151
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,640
it's like let's let's put a little bit

1152
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,920
of work into that structure and then you

1153
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,760
can make this aesthetic and it actually

1154
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,640
i think it

1155
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,599
helps you know so um just an overview

1156
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,000
real quick

1157
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,760
i'm going to try to talk about this uh

1158
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,880
you know this emergent time a little

1159
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,359
better

1160
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,040
and a concomitant theory of condensed

1161
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,320
types which are proposedly they're

1162
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,440
supposed to be immediate

1163
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,880
from the recently introduced diamond

1164
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,240
holographic principle you've seen me

1165
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,760
already kind of introduced that

1166
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,280
so if you're connecting this beautiful

1167
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,119
mathematical grand unified theory of

1168
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,760
geometrized local language in the stack

1169
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,400
language

1170
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,839
with emergent time that would be a new

1171
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,839
incarnation of a new reciprocity law you

1172
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,520
see i'm using the word incarnation to

1173
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,480
refer to diamonds and reflections yeah

1174
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,800
also choose spaces infomorphism star

1175
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,000
autonomous

1176
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,079
all of this star autonomous objects

1177
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,119
having duals

1178
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,200
reflections reflective subcategories pro

1179
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,720
finite condition it's all about the

1180
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,720
mirror phenomena which is in embodied

1181
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,079
cognition i think

1182
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,680
of course there's problems everywhere

1183
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,280
which is why i'm excited about this

1184
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,920
right problems everywhere you know

1185
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,960
you're going to talk about a theory of

1186
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,599
emergent time how do you measure that

1187
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,280
how do you actually measure time without

1188
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,640
constructing it

1189
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,960
and that that is like that's huge

1190
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,000
that'll stump me

1191
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,800
you know i talk fast i'm like wait wait

1192
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,280
so

1193
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,880
how do you how do you measure a double

1194
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,320
emergent something as crazy as i'm

1195
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,920
talking about how do you measure a pro

1196
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,079
emergence how do you measure like

1197
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:36,880
you know if you want to do this

1198
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,320
categorical construction like we're

1199
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,079
doing a two emergence

1200
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,119
a three emergence i don't know

1201
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,880
and that's what i hope to so like we can

1202
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,240
all work together to figure this out

1203
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,240
how do you actually measure emergence

1204
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,920
it's like do you collapse emergence are

1205
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,960
you too late

1206
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,200
if you measure it too early is it a

1207
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,440
partial emergence and you've missed it

1208
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,000
if we sneeze do we miss it is it fast

1209
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,960
you know

1210
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,720
so our model gives levels of

1211
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,040
non-locality levels of non-locality not

1212
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,079
just saying like

1213
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,599
you know there exists a spatial

1214
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,119
non-locality no

1215
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,240
if you can put them together in that

1216
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,240
formal spectra what if you had levels of

1217
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,000
non-locality everywhere and that's sort

1218
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,880
of what i'm into

1219
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,800
so i call it like a stacking on locality

1220
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,400
and stackification i think

1221
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,680
stockification is a word like

1222
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,400
spaghettification it does exist

1223
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,720
i may have misspelled it sorry all right

1224
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,480
so you can do local this

1225
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,880
you know i'm interested um one of your

1226
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,760
um awesome

1227
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,000
um um members of the community was

1228
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,880
asking me about like

1229
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,920
what are you talking about this local

1230
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,400
global meaning like the local singular

1231
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,240
now is like where i'm existing now and

1232
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,680
then of course you know you have your

1233
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,839
unicorns constellation time monoceros

1234
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,119
and all this other stuff

1235
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,960
so that's what there's a play here

1236
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,720
between taking an information

1237
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,880
and then like existing and stuff so you

1238
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,240
can do this by this diamond descent i

1239
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,440
told you this gluing and that's going to

1240
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,200
be an infinity one version of spatial v

1241
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,640
descent which is that peter schultz's

1242
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,040
work

1243
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,520
diamond localization so what's already

1244
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,200
neat is that once again when i talked

1245
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,640
about the emergence is built into the

1246
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,359
structure

1247
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,920
this localization those l maps in the

1248
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,920
reflective subcategory it's already a

1249
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,599
descent condition

1250
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,079
whoa so let's use these beautiful

1251
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:08,880
theorems

1252
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,400
right and actually use them for

1253
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,800
phenomenology for phenomenology

1254
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,240
and so that's already a descent

1255
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,839
condition so we're on our way

1256
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,800
you know so the goals to actually link

1257
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,119
like

1258
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,560
strong and weak coupling how do you

1259
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,480
actually construct this diamond

1260
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,200
non-locality for a temporal multiplicity

1261
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,920
i think that's

1262
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,240
really in tune with embodied cognition

1263
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,079
is to have a multiplicitous

1264
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,800
time meaning like there is not just one

1265
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,680
but it's

1266
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,839
what how could you actually model time

1267
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,200
acting

1268
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,160
globally non-locally but also in a

1269
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,440
multiple way

1270
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,960
and that's super french continental

1271
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,560
philosophy at that point and i you know

1272
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,240
that's like my upbringing

1273
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,359
so i'm really interested in this

1274
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,200
phenomenal multiplicity because it lee

1275
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,960
it lets the individual be

1276
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,720
and it makes like one of body cognition

1277
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,560
is like what i feel it is

1278
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,839
so i'll have to build this diamond

1279
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,680
descent and then again these v stacks

1280
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,119
are going to have to satisfy this gluing

1281
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,320
condition that's fine

1282
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,400
our model is a double emergence but it's

1283
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,720
pro finitely many copies of emergence

1284
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,000
that's what's strange i told you last

1285
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,520
time a pro finite set

1286
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,079
was a totally disconnected compact has

1287
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,920
um hazdorf space

1288
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,960
so that's uh that's uh what like what is

1289
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,440
that

1290
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,040
you know um um what a totally

1291
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
disconnected um compact space

1292
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,240
not hazdwarf so but so the profinite is

1293
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,200
very strange

1294
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,480
it's like what is that if you have

1295
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,880
profanity many copies of something what

1296
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,400
is that actual space

1297
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,839
so if you have this double emergence and

1298
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,680
it's very kind of fractal like

1299
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,680
um i'm really interested in that so

1300
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,200
again maybe the strong coupling has to

1301
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,640
do with irreversibility and

1302
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,560
reconstructability i'm very

1303
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,280
very interested and what we mean by you

1304
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,520
know something is irreversible

1305
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,720
right i think we need to go into that

1306
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,720
just a little bit more um and is there a

1307
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,359
play between

1308
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,599
irreversibility and reconstructability

1309
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,200
right the descent condition says you can

1310
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,720
reconstruct this higher space from this

1311
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,880
global space what does it mean that you

1312
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,680
if you like

1313
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,920
fail to reconstruct so we say is the

1314
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,599
diamond x like reconstructable

1315
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,680
up to irreversibility you've seen the up

1316
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,599
to condition in in mathematics

1317
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,640
which is like a is sort of equal to b

1318
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,640
up to some condition meaning con

1319
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,640
considering that condition

1320
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,800
so the hope is that yes so if i can get

1321
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
this play between reconstructability and

1322
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,000
irreversibility

1323
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,040
maybe that'll make more sense

1324
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,480
mathematically for what it means to be

1325
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,760
irreversible

1326
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,920
so coupling the strength of the coupling

1327
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,040
would be in the levels of the

1328
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,359
profiniteness and the non-locality

1329
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,720
how many levels do you actually have

1330
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,720
there what's those strength so coupling

1331
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,160
by perturbation i already said that's

1332
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,200
perfectoid and

1333
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,319
tilting so big questions what would

1334
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:37,760
actually non-locality be an

1335
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,040
act of reference i want to leave these

1336
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,480
rhetorically because i want to get to

1337
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,200
this um

1338
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,440
um that pretty image daniel before we

1339
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,280
wait for pause to the next question so

1340
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,800
and i think it's like coming up yeah

1341
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,400
it's right there okay so what is

1342
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,079
non-locality and active inference what

1343
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,520
is holography an

1344
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,359
active inference right which is this

1345
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,960
very awesome

1346
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,079
dimensional phenomena where there's a

1347
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,040
strong

1348
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,560
interaction and you know say dimension n

1349
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
and then maybe there's like a weaker

1350
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,319
interaction and n minus one

1351
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,319
what does that mean and that if one

1352
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,839
space is too difficult you go to the

1353
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:10,800
other space

1354
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,000
what does that actually mean and they're

1355
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,079
actually related sort of like a hologram

1356
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,160
so hologram is this 2d kind of scrambled

1357
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,599
image that maybe you bounce light on and

1358
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,359
you get this 3d phenomena

1359
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,000
so in one sense the 3d is redundant

1360
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,839
because you already had it in 2d

1361
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,680
so what is the notion of redundancy and

1362
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,359
active inference that's what i'm

1363
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,400
interested in

1364
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,240
so what is the diamond equivalent of pro

1365
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,319
finite an active insert where's the

1366
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:33,440
fractalness

1367
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,800
that's sort of happening right the

1368
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,560
fractal multiplicity

1369
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,119
what is object persistence and active

1370
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,400
inference that's tricky

1371
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,960
right so um you know when we you know we

1372
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,560
say you know the observer measures the

1373
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,079
electron and things like this

1374
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,880
um you know the pair of entangled

1375
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,599
photons

1376
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,280
you know acts non-locally or something

1377
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,520
like this what does that actually mean

1378
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,480
why is it the same photon and so uh

1379
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,599
chris fields and are trying to work on

1380
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,440
this awesome idea of object persistence

1381
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,480
of what that actually

1382
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,720
is right i mean you saw me a couple

1383
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,560
weeks ago right but

1384
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,040
is it the same shanna how does that work

1385
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,960
how does objects persistence

1386
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,720
work when you're going through like a

1387
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,480
multiple time you know

1388
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,760
what is emergent time and active

1389
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,079
inference where is it more likely where

1390
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,520
in embodied

1391
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,400
like cognition is emergence so what is

1392
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:20,880
pro

1393
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,400
emergence there so i want you to think

1394
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,520
about these as we're kind of going

1395
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,240
through

1396
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,720
what is a singularity right in active

1397
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,960
inference like a singular event

1398
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,800
what is coupling right what is the

1399
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,000
actual coupling what does the strength

1400
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,440
of an interaction mean

1401
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,359
so if you want a player for shared

1402
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,359
action amid global uncertainty

1403
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,960
maybe we should work in discrete time

1404
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,800
operating grand unified theories

1405
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,040
master this local global localization by

1406
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,280
these higher order awarenesses

1407
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,200
machine learning right operating grain

1408
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,119
unified theories let's go higher

1409
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,800
right let's not work in networks anymore

1410
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,960
let's work in three morphisms

1411
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,720
medical okay let's model the brain as a

1412
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,640
hologram maybe these thoughts or these

1413
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,319
certain chromatic towers i talked about

1414
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:58,720
the

1415
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,040
the chromatic homotope theory last time

1416
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,560
it has this beautiful

1417
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,640
notion um of um equating spectra

1418
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,240
you have this notion of uh this theorem

1419
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,920
called chromatic convergence theorem

1420
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,000
that says that you can recon you can

1421
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
reconstruct a certain object

1422
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
from its towers of spectra so you have a

1423
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,680
boost field localization which

1424
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,839
which is sort of like um the idea of my

1425
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:21,680
top the topological localization i

1426
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,480
referred to

1427
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,880
which is a way of sort of connecting

1428
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,000
spaces

1429
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,200
and um again if if

1430
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,319
you know you know if in certain

1431
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,160
neurological maybe degeneration

1432
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,319
maybe the actual morphisms are cut you

1433
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,520
know you can think about things like

1434
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,240
that

1435
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,400
you're no longer able to recall because

1436
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,000
maybe all the maps are gone

1437
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,480
right so maybe that you could more aptly

1438
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,079
model things like enterograde amnesia

1439
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,359
and neurodegeneration

1440
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,520
so medical level and uh 11 and fields

1441
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,280
have this awesome um

1442
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,800
kind of new workout about entanglement

1443
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,480
across daughter cells

1444
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,480
what is holography and daughter cells at

1445
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,520
least it's

1446
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,720
you know at least we can measure

1447
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,480
entanglement in something besides

1448
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,280
photons

1449
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,560
you know so you need this particularity

1450
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,400
um is temporal non-locality is it like

1451
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,560
instantiation

1452
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,520
without reciprocity advent right this is

1453
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,200
me going like wild here

1454
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,440
so advent means that you've arrived but

1455
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,880
in been in body cognition if the

1456
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,400
environment has arrived i've arrived

1457
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,440
this is double play

1458
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,040
right so is it an instantaneousness

1459
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,760
without a sort of two-way interaction

1460
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,040
what does that actually mean what does

1461
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,800
temporal non-locality mean

1462
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,079
i don't really know can we actually

1463
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,920
construct for instance a pro-finite

1464
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,440
version of that which is again this kind

1465
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,240
of

1466
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,880
super-disconnected fractal space is

1467
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,680
temporal non-locality dialethism time

1468
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,200
everyone knows i'm a super fan of

1469
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,880
dialethism this is a construction of

1470
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,520
logic

1471
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,880
where you can have both a and not a

1472
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,200
at the same time normally you cannot

1473
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,160
right you have a

1474
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,640
you know uh you know a or b a they're

1475
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,160
you know not a therefore b

1476
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,319
why can't a and not a obtain at the same

1477
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,760
time so you get this beautiful

1478
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,280
construction called dialethism we may

1479
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,800
start messing around in that

1480
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,480
so it is does a diamond construction of

1481
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,000
temporal non-locality fail

1482
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,839
time as it fails all pro incarnations of

1483
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,760
duration so you can get a lot of

1484
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,520
interesting heavy questions with this if

1485
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,119
so what are the actual conditions for

1486
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,960
object persistence in a non-locality

1487
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,319
that is pro finite

1488
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,480
how do you actually do that right how

1489
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,160
does something persist um

1490
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,319
in those conditions how does persistence

1491
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,079
work in a singular case such as

1492
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,079
anterograde amnesia you know i spoke of

1493
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,760
clive waring last time

1494
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,640
um you know was a beautiful pianist um

1495
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,240
he's still living which is great

1496
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,640
but he got an anterior grade amnesia and

1497
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,400
has no more personal memory but has a

1498
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,520
motor memory

1499
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,839
and so there's um you know some some

1500
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,200
difficulties there but it's very

1501
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,280
interesting how the memory levels work

1502
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,960
so the question is multiply profound so

1503
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,720
at least try to hold on to it you know

1504
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,079
with a small assessment

1505
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,839
maybe this has to do with like with

1506
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,599
thoughts and memory recollection and we

1507
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,040
can go into that

1508
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,119
but first a dream oh go ahead kind of

1509
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,800
just make a few active inferences

1510
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,839
yes there do it okay so i'm uh recalling

1511
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:58,160
my

1512
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,760
thoughts here by looking at the paper

1513
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,599
which i took notes on

1514
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,760
um first you mentioned the dynamic

1515
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,720
persistence

1516
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,640
and the multi-scale persistence and that

1517
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,319
reminded me of the ship of

1518
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,160
theseus which is like if you replace all

1519
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,520
the planks of the ship

1520
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,560
is it the same ship so it's a philosophy

1521
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,040
styled question and then we're

1522
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,079
approaching it in a

1523
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,200
formal way and then it comes very close

1524
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:21,599
to

1525
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,440
active inference when you had the slide

1526
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,440
a needed particularity

1527
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,760
that reminded me of carl fristen's

1528
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,280
recent paper which was called

1529
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,599
a free energy principle for a particular

1530
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:32,400
physics

1531
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,839
and particular is a pun because it means

1532
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:36,720
specific

1533
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,599
but also it means particle and so when

1534
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:40,160
we say

1535
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,359
a particle or a point it's like that

1536
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,920
is the unit of analysis that we can pick

1537
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,800
up we can

1538
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
make edges between points and we can

1539
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,960
engage in a higher level of network

1540
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,040
mapping so when we're thinking about

1541
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,400
particles here

1542
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,240
and this way that particles can be

1543
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,599
related in

1544
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,200
nested uh models or nested categories

1545
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:01,599
i'm not

1546
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,240
sure what technical word would be we're

1547
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:04,880
kind of

1548
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,000
talking about a particular approach

1549
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,200
oh i love this yeah just trying to

1550
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,880
give a little little active inference

1551
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,319
you know throw out some redness no

1552
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:16,800
please

1553
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,480
yeah every ten slides every five stop me

1554
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,960
yes i i think wow how neat you see

1555
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,319
that's like an incarnation

1556
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,040
it's like this this this is uh this is

1557
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,160
exciting

1558
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,720
yeah what a play that's perfect i'm

1559
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,680
curious to see what you think about the

1560
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,720
next couple slides

1561
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,599
um okay i say but first right so you

1562
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:36,800
have all this mathy stuff we're gonna do

1563
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,760
this we're gonna do this

1564
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,200
you know uh like daniel said we're

1565
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,800
probably going fristen stop pulling at

1566
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,880
everybody's stuff ship of theseus

1567
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,400
but first a dream because i want to get

1568
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,240
like a little pretty so we are

1569
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,599
interested in the relation between

1570
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,640
diamond descent

1571
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,200
the stop mechanism so i know uh fields

1572
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,559
and levin and everyone has been like

1573
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:53,599
baffled by that

1574
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,440
uh the stop mechanism that you know

1575
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,119
doesn't work in something like cancer

1576
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:57,599
cells

1577
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,839
yeah when when do things stop i'm

1578
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,400
actually very curious about that

1579
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,119
um and the storage and reflection and

1580
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,359
recollection of profanity many copies of

1581
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:08,800
information in the form of

1582
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,960
mathematically and pure geometric points

1583
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,520
right

1584
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,319
if you're modeling um you know neurons

1585
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:14,800
as

1586
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,839
diamonds what is whoa uh okay you have

1587
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,400
covers of diamonds like i said um

1588
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,240
you know the if the proprioception is

1589
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,079
topological and in the covers then maybe

1590
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,200
you could actually model

1591
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,920
neurons as these diamond phenomena so um

1592
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,520
someone like clive wearing has all the

1593
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,640
diamonds but

1594
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,119
the the covers are cut so it's almost

1595
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,960
like you cannot access that

1596
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,359
right very interesting when the actual

1597
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:38,079
you know

1598
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,680
balloons are cut you cannot get the

1599
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,200
balloon anymore

1600
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,040
if they're attached to you so we posited

1601
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,319
a model of the brain that's actually

1602
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,079
allowing for various mathematical

1603
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,079
partitions in the brain in the form of

1604
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:49,920
uh profoundly many copies of the diamond

1605
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,400
right

1606
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,760
so the neurons are geometric points

1607
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,440
which are morphisms of schemes like i

1608
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,000
said

1609
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,599
then maybe anterograde amnesia would

1610
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,520
resemble some kind of sustained

1611
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,920
truncation of diamond descent why are

1612
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,760
those maps continually

1613
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,240
continuously cut which is why i'm very

1614
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,400
interested in this object persistence

1615
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,160
so considering temporal non-calorie can

1616
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,079
we model thoughts as pro-finite

1617
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,160
reflections of pro-tell topological

1618
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,119
covers

1619
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,280
oriented and non-locality right someone

1620
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,160
from your um

1621
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,599
from your community also has asked me

1622
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:18,720
about thoughts and i was like that's

1623
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,920
such a great question

1624
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,440
what you know clearly there's something

1625
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,280
like there's an em field going on but

1626
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,559
it's something more than that and then

1627
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,000
the brain seems to operate like a

1628
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,680
hologram as well

1629
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,240
so what is that right are these actual

1630
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:30,720
the pro

1631
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,880
finite reflections you know like if you

1632
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,559
cannot organize your thoughts or things

1633
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,240
bouncing all over the place

1634
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,760
um you know there's a lot of people that

1635
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,839
are internal or the you know is the

1636
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,599
the diamond super internally reflected

1637
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,680
at that point so this may help

1638
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,119
i said you know to model the state of

1639
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,720
being fully conscious

1640
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,079
right during dreamless sleep no one has

1641
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,119
that

1642
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,040
uh fully conscious during the dreamless

1643
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,720
sleep what would that actually be

1644
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,640
um which perhaps takes the form of

1645
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,800
sleeping in a diamond hourglass

1646
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,680
so um you know i write like kind of

1647
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,520
fantastical mathematical fiction books

1648
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,119
and this is my second one

1649
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,800
that i'm working on about you know

1650
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,119
sleeping and a diamond hourglass what

1651
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,079
does that actually mean so you're

1652
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,000
working in diamond time at that point

1653
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,920
what does that mean profinitely many

1654
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,200
reflections of time

1655
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,720
which probably takes some kind of image

1656
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,480
like this right so i always have

1657
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,920
unicorns over because i'm like oh it's

1658
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,480
magic

1659
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,839
right and what does that actually mean

1660
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,920
to sleep inside

1661
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,720
of anything hourglass i'm very very

1662
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,079
curious because you know

1663
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,400
when we go to sleep nothing is really

1664
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,400
asleep your system is still functioning

1665
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,200
right but

1666
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,119
quote where do you go and i'm not sure

1667
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,559
what you know i'm gonna

1668
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,720
put that out there to the your community

1669
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,599
what is that

1670
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,400
right why can you not be fully conscious

1671
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:42,800
during

1672
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,599
dreamless sleep not the little brief

1673
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:46,559
periodics

1674
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,280
right of uh of dream sleep that you get

1675
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,400
but where is that

1676
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,760
so it'd be something like sleeping in an

1677
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,520
hourglass which is actually very strange

1678
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,480
and he's like oh god

1679
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,160
what if somebody takes the hourglass and

1680
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,760
turns it upside down and shakes it

1681
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,240
okay you know um but this would almost

1682
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,160
be an hourglass without cardinality so

1683
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,760
there is no up or down

1684
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,640
here you know and so um stay tuned that

1685
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,319
book is coming out soon okay

1686
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:11,280
which is cool but it's all it's nested

1687
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,559
in

1688
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,240
in the pro finite condition if you're

1689
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,599
going to say object persistence that

1690
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,200
happens when you sleep as well

1691
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,440
so to get to some of the mathy stuff

1692
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,800
there's some main conjectures

1693
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,559
i'll talk about the fm k theory of

1694
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,079
diamonds um let's

1695
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,440
let's actually look up that diamond

1696
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,680
shape again um and let's get into the

1697
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,200
diamond holographic principle the fard

1698
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,319
fontaine curve

1699
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,319
why we're using a telecoilmology and

1700
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,480
let's get to emergent time you know

1701
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,760
or as far as many of these as we can so

1702
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,160
um i may start skipping around daniel on

1703
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,760
the interest of time

1704
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,040
you know so that we can get to the good

1705
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,520
stuff so i introduced this kind of wild

1706
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,800
um conjecture about you know this epimof

1707
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,000
k theory of diamonds in this

1708
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,599
localization sequence which is a

1709
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,920
co-fiber sequence

1710
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,000
and a modification of something called

1711
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,920
continuous k theory so again i told you

1712
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,599
earlier that maybe continuous k theory

1713
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:00,720
is the way to go

1714
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,079
if we're going to be modeling emergent

1715
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,000
time because you want to kind of stick

1716
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,200
together small pockets of

1717
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,440
of local emergence so this uh this

1718
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,240
number two

1719
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,480
uh localization sequence is a co-fiber

1720
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,440
sequence

1721
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,440
and uh you've got the the k theory

1722
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,559
acting on the

1723
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,720
little sub diamond and then k ephemoth

1724
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,720
of the diamond farc fontaine curve

1725
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,680
uh mapping to the ephemoth k theory of

1726
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,200
the non-diamond

1727
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,720
uh fog fontaine curve with a

1728
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,200
modification of this f continuous

1729
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,200
um working in the the category of

1730
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,800
sheaves and this is actually

1731
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,079
um this third um left-hand side is

1732
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,520
actually going to be

1733
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,480
corresponded to the actual that that

1734
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,359
omega to the n

1735
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,520
is an actual continuous k theory

1736
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,640
spectrum

1737
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,880
of d diamond so again it's a way of

1738
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,400
actually gluing together

1739
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,400
and looking at the like isomorphism

1740
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,920
classes of what's happening in these

1741
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,800
diamonds

1742
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,400
so again my idea is this you have these

1743
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,079
profinitely many copies

1744
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,599
uh that of of uh the actual geometric

1745
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,280
impurities so you already have those

1746
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,640
and we actually want to figure out

1747
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,400
what's happening

1748
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,640
between those so like what's a two

1749
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,720
morphism between the profinite copies

1750
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,160
that's what my interpretation of the k

1751
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,280
theory is going to be

1752
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,800
so you have this level let's go up a

1753
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,400
higher level k theory is actually

1754
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,200
looking at

1755
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,599
what makes things like unified at that

1756
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,200
higher level so it's cool

1757
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,760
so this d um upper diamond is the stable

1758
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,440
dualizable presentable

1759
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,839
infinity one category of diamonds d sub

1760
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,680
diamonds actually the complex of

1761
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,920
v stacks of locally spatial diamonds

1762
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,359
where complex is a

1763
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,599
um sort of like a collection and then

1764
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,040
you have the actual relative farc

1765
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,319
fontaine curve and the dye

1766
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:37,359
so i don't want to talk about that too

1767
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,200
too much let's get to the actual diamond

1768
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,559
holography principle

1769
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,319
but the diamond holographic principle

1770
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,559
should fall out and be immediate from

1771
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,720
this localization sequence

1772
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,480
so once again our diamond holographic

1773
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,920
principle is going to use these two

1774
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,760
adjoint pairs where these

1775
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,839
uh you have a direct image an inverse

1776
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:56,079
image functor and then an exceptional

1777
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,000
um and an inverse exceptional functor

1778
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,640
which is this

1779
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,880
uh f lower shriek and f upper streak

1780
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,079
that's the kind of

1781
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,520
cool way of saying exclamation point

1782
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,079
what's the main point is that um again

1783
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:11,440
we want to take these double

1784
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,880
adjoint pairs and make a two

1785
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,800
infomorphism out of them so these are

1786
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,200
from

1787
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,559
schultz's six operations they tell

1788
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,400
chromology of diamonds um

1789
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,800
we'll actually want to condensify this

1790
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,559
so how do you rephrase all this in terms

1791
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,000
of a sheaf of sets

1792
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,920
like on a certain site i'm gonna go into

1793
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,040
what that means

1794
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,119
and then sort of uh you know how do how

1795
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,880
do we think about holography in terms of

1796
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,160
a mathematically

1797
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,480
uh mathematical impurity geometric point

1798
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,960
the spa cd that's the attic spectrum

1799
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,839
of this closed algebraic curve mapping

1800
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,680
to the actual diamond

1801
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,680
so again try to think of uh you know

1802
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,040
when we think about reflections we're

1803
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,960
trying to mathematically interpret that

1804
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,880
so let's actually discuss emergent time

1805
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,839
from that condensed setting and

1806
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,440
investigate a condensed version of the

1807
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,000
actual

1808
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,480
continuous k theory for pro emergence

1809
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,040
right

1810
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,440
that's wild so the continuous k theory

1811
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,400
right so let's use up them off

1812
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,160
continuous k3 and then actually try to

1813
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,960
put the pro

1814
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,079
object together as a pro emergence

1815
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,240
okay so here's this um image i think i

1816
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,520
showed it last time

1817
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,200
so the one of the main goals is to

1818
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,400
actually have an infinity one

1819
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,920
categorification of geometrical

1820
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,359
england's the language program is so

1821
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,160
beautiful

1822
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,559
what is it trying to do it's um you know

1823
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,480
it's a mathematical interpretation of

1824
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,000
shared action you are

1825
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,319
working across very difficult disparate

1826
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,200
fields

1827
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,359
um with lots of uncertainty and um

1828
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,119
so you have these beautiful phenomena

1829
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,880
called langlin's reciprocity

1830
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,200
langlin's functoriality we're actually

1831
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,480
you know uh

1832
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,319
you're creating a certain situation in

1833
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:37,960
which um you know certain

1834
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,440
representations

1835
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,359
of objects are actually automorphic

1836
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:42,640
forms and so

1837
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,079
different incarnations are being shown

1838
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,839
to be the same thing which is like a

1839
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,599
a version of the same thing which is

1840
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,440
cool so in this um

1841
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,200
model that i have here so the diamonds

1842
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,640
in the middle and again you have the

1843
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,880
fmof k theory of the actual diamond

1844
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,680
curve

1845
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,359
and at the bottom you know i said oh

1846
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,119
this structure is you know possibly an

1847
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:01,280
infinity one to poi which goes back to

1848
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,400
daniel's point about bringing all the

1849
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,599
structure in so

1850
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,440
uh an infinity one toe poi is infinity

1851
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,920
one category it satisfies a descent

1852
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,839
condition it's locally cartesian closed

1853
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,359
so everything maps to each other

1854
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,359
it's got a kappa filter on it so

1855
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:15,440
everything is nice and contained

1856
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,240
which is really nice all right and so

1857
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,440
you can also

1858
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,200
these lns can also be interpreted in

1859
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,799
terms of i have a little note there

1860
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,040
about a lube and tape formal

1861
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,799
sheath module this is a law to link

1862
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,160
once again one of these higher grain

1863
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,760
unified theories you could actually

1864
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,680
maybe link the geometerization of local

1865
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,520
langlens with fmof k3 so i'm just

1866
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,319
putting some

1867
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:37,680
supermathy things because some people

1868
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,599
wanted some mathy things all right so um

1869
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,200
that's weinstein's work which is really

1870
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,000
pretty

1871
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,760
so let me actually formally define

1872
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,000
diamond i don't think i did last time

1873
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,319
um yeah and then we get to the actual

1874
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:49,760
holography part okay

1875
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,760
so let perf d be the category of

1876
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,760
perfectoid spaces so again these are

1877
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,200
attic spaces

1878
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,160
they look like huber spaces and um they

1879
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:58,720
are

1880
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,160
fractal and strange kind of like

1881
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,760
berkovic spaces

1882
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,640
so the let perf d be that category and

1883
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,559
perf be the subcategory perfectoid

1884
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,839
spaces of characteristic

1885
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,920
p so no longer zero p so a diamond is a

1886
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,640
probitel

1887
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,319
sheath that's a sheaf in the protel

1888
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:15,520
topology which i told you it's a very

1889
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,400
fine topology

1890
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,720
which can be written as a quotient um

1891
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,000
you know x mod r

1892
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,599
so it's of a you take the perfectoid

1893
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,520
space and you mod out you glue

1894
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,520
by these protel equivalence relations

1895
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,119
boom you get a diamond

1896
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,119
what a beautiful way of doing that so we

1897
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:30,160
say let c

1898
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,000
be an algebraically closed aphenoid

1899
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,079
field um it's a certain construction and

1900
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,280
the uber sentence

1901
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,960
and then we say geometric points this is

1902
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,160
the thing that i think would be

1903
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,440
beautiful to actually

1904
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,880
the thing this is the actual object that

1905
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,200
could actually model neurons very nicely

1906
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,520
geometric point the which is the attic

1907
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,720
spectrum of that c

1908
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,799
mapping to the diamond is made visible

1909
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,480
by pulling it back

1910
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,880
through a pro-ital cover x to d

1911
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,480
resulting in profiling many copies of

1912
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,599
spa c

1913
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,400
so this is again a huge relation with

1914
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:58,960
like

1915
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,599
um proprioception by topology right how

1916
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,960
do you actually visualize how do you

1917
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,400
interpret things like this

1918
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,880
so diamond is an actual algebraic space

1919
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,079
for that beach apology

1920
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:09,760
and the v topology if anyone wants to

1921
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,599
know is this actual cover f i

1922
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:14,480
x i x um that consists of any maps x i

1923
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,040
to x such that for any uh quasi compact

1924
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,839
uh open subset u and x you have finite

1925
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:21,040
indices i

1926
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,119
so that these um these open subsets

1927
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:24,079
jointly

1928
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,680
uh cover you so x there is an actual

1929
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,200
um uh v stack okay so here's the diamond

1930
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:31,520
again

1931
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,559
right so um we can think

1932
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,559
what are these actual geometric points

1933
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,400
in terms of like embody cognition in

1934
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,359
terms of you know

1935
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:42,559
um um you know shared action whatever

1936
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,520
you want to think

1937
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,440
if if i you know if i'm a diamond

1938
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,960
daniel's how do you actually relate

1939
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,799
those two diamonds by these like big

1940
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:49,680
maps

1941
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,920
and so you can see that right here you

1942
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,960
have this diamond

1943
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,240
so um the the actual footnote is

1944
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,720
calling it what it is so you take the p

1945
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,440
addicts

1946
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,760
right which is the field of p at x q p

1947
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,440
we can if we want to find the diamond

1948
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,319
spectrum of that

1949
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,960
which is that spod d so the diamond

1950
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,760
spectrum

1951
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,440
that's akin to the actual prime spectrum

1952
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,200
of the attic spectrum i showed you

1953
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,440
so you can actually only ever get the

1954
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,440
attic spectrum of qp cycloatomic

1955
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,359
which is the cycloatomic field of the p

1956
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:18,640
addicts you don't actually get

1957
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,520
all the p addicts so this uh modded out

1958
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,480
by this zp cross which is a galwa action

1959
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,200
um it's it's underlined because it's pro

1960
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,160
finite

1961
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,079
so how interesting that you never

1962
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,640
actually get you want the left-hand side

1963
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,280
spotty qp but you only get profoundly

1964
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,520
many copies of the cycloatomic

1965
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,599
so you never actually get what you're

1966
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,599
after and this is actually

1967
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,839
has a lot of phenomenology behind it

1968
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:45,440
because like again robert and i really

1969
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,520
and chris and i are really fascinated by

1970
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,520
the phenomenology of what is

1971
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,640
so if we actually have you know um

1972
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,400
if you want to think interface or if you

1973
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,920
want to think whatever it is

1974
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,079
in our organism are we actually ever

1975
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,079
truly interacting with the thing or just

1976
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,920
our representation of the thing

1977
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,839
um you know you've got me at the level

1978
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,119
going well

1979
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:09,520
you know if interaction is just me

1980
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,359
interacting with a reflection of my

1981
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,960
environment if it's actually me

1982
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,799
interacting with hidden states that were

1983
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:17,359
probably my reflections the whole time

1984
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:20,000
um what is it are we just sitting around

1985
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,799
with the profinet

1986
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,400
many copies of the thing and we never

1987
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,960
actually get the thing

1988
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,359
any questions for for um i feel like

1989
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:30,160
that's a lot of math

1990
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,480
yeah there's a question in the chat oh

1991
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,359
wonderful

1992
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:38,240
yep uh cb writes according to this

1993
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,160
fascinating framework and from an

1994
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,760
awareness perspective

1995
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,839
is the dark room problem still

1996
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:46,000
considered as a problem

1997
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,760
grateful for any elaboration on that and

1998
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,359
thanks to the speaker so

1999
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:51,440
the dark room problem being um the

2000
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,480
philosophical

2001
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,480
thought experiment where what does an

2002
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,160
agent in a dark room

2003
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,440
do and in the free energy world

2004
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,520
some people initially several years ago

2005
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,799
brought that up as something like a

2006
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:03,359
critique

2007
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,880
they'd say well aren't you very

2008
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,480
precisely sure that you're in a dark

2009
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,240
room so if active inference is about

2010
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,680
reducing uncertainty

2011
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,000
then isn't that the perfect state but of

2012
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,760
course the pragmatic answer is that

2013
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,440
while you're in that dark room your

2014
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,040
uncertainty about the world is

2015
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,240
increasing

2016
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,880
so i'm wondering if that maps on to a

2017
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,839
multi-level

2018
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:24,960
uncertainty concept because

2019
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,280
it's almost like you're getting precise

2020
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,319
at the visual

2021
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:30,640
level that you're in a dark room but

2022
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,880
you're getting increasingly imprecise

2023
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,920
at not just a different lateral level

2024
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,240
like

2025
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,920
you're getting imprecise on smell while

2026
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,520
you're getting precise on vision

2027
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,040
but actually at a higher level you're

2028
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,960
getting imprecise on visually what's

2029
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,280
outside

2030
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,280
oh wow well yeah keep going what do you

2031
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,799
think what a beautiful question thank

2032
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,079
you so much

2033
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,720
oh yes more questions and less me

2034
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,599
talking yeah

2035
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,920
i'm just i'm uh thinking of it as

2036
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,039
there's three roads

2037
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:58,880
meeting in some ways here there's

2038
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,480
philosophy you know we've brought up the

2039
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,319
dark room the ship of theseus

2040
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:05,039
then there's a lot of the formal

2041
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:06,160
mathematics which

2042
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,359
certainly i'm scribbling down but are um

2043
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:10,880
just beginning to learn

2044
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,559
and then there's the active inference

2045
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,480
community who might be familiar with

2046
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,520
this idea of

2047
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,559
multi-level uncertainty but

2048
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:20,480
not have connected it to for example

2049
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,680
philosophy or math

2050
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,760
so we got people coming and going on all

2051
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,960
those roads

2052
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,960
no this is beautiful so it's like yeah

2053
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,720
yeah okay so let's not take

2054
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,680
one single dark room let's expand it if

2055
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,599
every organism had their own dark

2056
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,240
room yeah let's like let's take that

2057
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:36,640
question

2058
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,319
accelerated a little bit would a dark

2059
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:41,039
room survive in a two infomorphism

2060
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:43,599
right let's go a little let's let's say

2061
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:44,480
um

2062
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,160
you know on an information perspective

2063
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,559
is it dark probably not it's just on the

2064
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,480
organism perspective right

2065
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,880
so that's a actually the dark room is a

2066
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,319
very beautiful

2067
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:56,079
i think instantiation of what i'm

2068
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,480
actually saying here with the diamond

2069
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,920
so in the dark room you may just have

2070
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,000
profile many copies of the dark but is

2071
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,680
daniel saying like all your other senses

2072
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,480
are being very

2073
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,440
like perfectoided i'm just playing your

2074
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,079
other

2075
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,760
senses are being uh more fine-tuned

2076
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,400
at the expense of something else so my

2077
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,319
question is this it's like why don't

2078
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:19,119
why can't we increase the sort of

2079
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,200
bandwidth to be able to be precise

2080
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,200
everywhere like why is it dark to the

2081
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,720
extent of something else

2082
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,760
right um and how do we actually do that

2083
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,480
that's that's very interesting um i

2084
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:30,799
think

2085
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:32,160
i think dark room is still a problem has

2086
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,839
anybody solved that it's still a problem

2087
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,839
right

2088
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:38,559
i guess a problem for philosopher but

2089
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:39,599
not a problem for

2090
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,760
the human in the dark room and let me

2091
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:42,640
ask one

2092
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,119
one question on operations on diamonds

2093
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,559
yes people might be familiar

2094
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:49,599
with the operations on numbers like

2095
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,520
addition subtraction multiplying

2096
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,920
dividing so is it fair to say that

2097
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,440
the operations that you're going to be

2098
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,520
describing they're like ways to work

2099
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,359
with diamonds just like plus and minus

2100
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,440
are ways to work with numbers

2101
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,760
oh that's yeah okay it's a very good um

2102
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,359
very good question so you know

2103
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:07,039
we can answer that very abstractly that

2104
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:09,039
there really is no intrinsic definition

2105
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:09,680
of a number

2106
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,920
you can say uh the number five well what

2107
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,039
is it five times one

2108
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:15,359
you know six uh you know six minus one

2109
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,960
you have so many ways of going

2110
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,480
going at it that a number is actually

2111
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,280
just an equivalence class right

2112
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,200
so if a number is just an equivalence

2113
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,559
class then

2114
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:25,680
then you can think of the same thing as

2115
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,359
a diamond diamond is still equivalence

2116
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:28,400
class right

2117
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,559
a certain equivalence class between um

2118
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:31,599
but you're in a different

2119
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:34,640
a different structure so sheaves

2120
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,400
sheaves don't really add like one plus

2121
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,960
one so there's a little more yeah you

2122
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,720
can is there an algebra of sheaves oh

2123
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,599
absolutely

2124
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,359
and the beauty is that so if sheaves are

2125
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:46,160
this like way of keeping track of local

2126
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,160
data like a little bag that's associated

2127
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,440
to every space

2128
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,240
there are ways of gluing those together

2129
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,599
you don't really add them

2130
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,760
but you can glue them and start gluing

2131
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,760
them and start gluing them and start

2132
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,880
gluing them

2133
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,240
so in a sense they are number theoretic

2134
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,760
because if you're defining a number as

2135
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,359
an equivalence relation

2136
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,440
so you can think yeah one plus one like

2137
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,119
equals two whatever that means

2138
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,359
or you can say gluing and then gluing

2139
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:12,400
and then gluing

2140
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,240
and then gluing so you can actually get

2141
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,760
an infinity category

2142
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,920
of these sheaves so i recommend anyone

2143
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,039
looking at like

2144
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:21,039
um you wanna learn like some of the the

2145
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,599
best global mathematics and like

2146
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,440
learning it uh conceptually first is to

2147
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,559
look at the sheaf

2148
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,119
interpretation you're like wait was

2149
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,000
addition a sheath the whole time yeah

2150
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,680
talk about dark room and mathematics i'm

2151
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,839
just like

2152
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:38,799
yeah so operation so and so um you know

2153
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:40,079
bless peter for being

2154
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,079
so amazing in coming up with this idea

2155
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:43,680
it's like oh

2156
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,200
not only can you put a sheaf on a

2157
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,119
topological space you can put a sheaf on

2158
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:48,480
a category

2159
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,920
that's the sort of interesting thing

2160
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,760
that i'm into so take your idea of

2161
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,599
operating of like adding numbers and

2162
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,599
just go to the category of numbers

2163
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:56,559
and then if you start working

2164
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,319
categorically that's already shared

2165
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:01,440
action you're in this like higher space

2166
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,960
um yeah so operations with diamonds on

2167
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,839
diamonds showing something is a diamond

2168
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,839
okay it's all just a little rigorous but

2169
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:12,000
at the end it gives you such an

2170
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,200
asceticism because um i think that

2171
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,200
you know all this work should be pulling

2172
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,200
in everyone you need the philosophers

2173
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,480
make sure we're asking the right

2174
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,200
question

2175
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,039
you need the you know crazy math people

2176
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:24,960
like me to come up with like

2177
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,000
well i don't know let's try like an

2178
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,319
infinity category and then you need um

2179
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:29,839
you know you need active like we need

2180
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:31,599
people actually uh

2181
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,760
you know working on how do you relate

2182
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,359
all this so you need active influence

2183
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:36,480
you need the philosophy and you need to

2184
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,680
put everyone together

2185
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,599
yeah so in the dark room my question is

2186
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,280
it's like um

2187
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,359
you know at what point was dark like

2188
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:45,039
light you know so i think also the

2189
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:46,799
darkness is like maybe a pro finite

2190
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:47,599
condition

2191
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:48,960
the question is if we sat in the dark

2192
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,480
room forever would it eventually become

2193
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,039
light

2194
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:53,440
you know and then you bring in time so

2195
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,039
dark room is really interesting and try

2196
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:56,240
to think of dark room

2197
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,319
in a temporal non-locality that's how i

2198
01:06:58,319 --> 01:06:59,599
would take that problem and kind of

2199
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,520
accelerate it just a little bit

2200
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,520
dark room in terms of a diamond dark

2201
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,880
room inter change the time

2202
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,400
interpretation like

2203
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,960
in all these uh models you know time is

2204
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:09,760
always

2205
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,079
uh modeled as a total order that's

2206
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:13,280
another thing i would like to hear from

2207
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,400
your community like

2208
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,880
um you know total order has this like

2209
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,400
connectivity property that

2210
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,520
every two objects in the total order are

2211
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,880
comparable

2212
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,760
why why do we model time as continuous

2213
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,079
why do you model time as a total order

2214
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,720
um i think that i think that should be

2215
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,920
changed just a little bit

2216
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,599
and move it like non-arch medium quantum

2217
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:34,400
mechanics is going to work

2218
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,440
non-ar-comedian

2219
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,440
with a very specific cut off right the

2220
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,119
plank length then i think you should

2221
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:41,119
also be working with non-archimedean

2222
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:42,319
time so

2223
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:44,160
um the awesome person who asked the

2224
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,440
question about the dark room

2225
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,839
please try to think about dark room like

2226
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,079
in in some kind of temporal non-locality

2227
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:51,520
if time was everywhere

2228
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,720
i'm really interested in that i'll make

2229
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,680
one more one more comment here quite

2230
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,960
early you mentioned how

2231
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,160
a stack you said it's it it takes in

2232
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,520
categories not for example sets and

2233
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,880
connecting that to what you said about

2234
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,200
operations this might be quite familiar

2235
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,760
to a computer scientist for whom the

2236
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,559
function

2237
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:14,400
can take in different things so we know

2238
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,920
there's functions that take in

2239
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,238
numbers like two plus two but then there

2240
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,279
might be a function

2241
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,799
that takes in a large data set that has

2242
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:25,759
a diamond description and so computer

2243
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:27,520
science and engineering kind of the

2244
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,880
application

2245
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,399
it's really easy sometimes to apply

2246
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,960
these recursive definitions recursion

2247
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,238
central to computer science

2248
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:37,600
but you're right when you go to the

2249
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,279
infinite level

2250
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:42,158
that's kind of where the theory builds

2251
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:42,880
beyond

2252
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,198
any real implementation of a computer

2253
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:45,920
program

2254
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,759
so we're on the bottom looking up with

2255
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:49,759
the computer science implementations

2256
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,279
of nested networks and then

2257
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:55,759
here's the hand coming from the top down

2258
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:57,040
saying there's a way to

2259
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,040
you know infinitely structure that and

2260
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,439
throw a sheath on it or i don't know

2261
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,520
oh see that's what i'm saying yeah it's

2262
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,279
like to upgrade a machine learning

2263
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:06,399
that's another project i'm working on

2264
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:06,799
it's like

2265
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:09,359
categorify it you know what i mean like

2266
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:10,000
um

2267
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,080
when you know the specific definition of

2268
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,600
stack is a two sheaf

2269
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,920
right so it's a sheath that takes values

2270
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,279
and categories

2271
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,600
that's actually and so it's like yeah if

2272
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,040
you move from

2273
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,759
you know like an output is a weighted

2274
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:24,319
function

2275
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,640
or something if you move from that to

2276
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,080
the category

2277
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:32,158
of all possible weighted functions

2278
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:35,120
then you know your complexity has just

2279
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:35,600
grown

2280
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,319
probably like threefold you see the

2281
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:40,319
output no longer needs to be something

2282
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:41,679
singular i outputted

2283
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:43,839
a weighted function you know particular

2284
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:45,439
to this distribution

2285
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:48,640
why why don't you output an actual

2286
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,920
category yeah

2287
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,080
here's a another great question from the

2288
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,198
chat from stephen

2289
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:56,320
he wrote if these category theory and

2290
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,000
geometry approaches

2291
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,320
enable another multi-scale formalism

2292
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,000
that treats time differently

2293
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,080
can this approach play nicely with

2294
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,840
current multi-scale active inference

2295
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,840
formalisms

2296
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,040
sounds like he summarized our

2297
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,960
conversation

2298
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,000
stephen should present

2299
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,239
yeah can he tell me a little bit more

2300
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:18,480
about the multi-scale active embassy

2301
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,040
he you're right on it if you stackify

2302
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:21,920
things

2303
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,840
right think of it like this think that

2304
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,120
um you know

2305
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,760
like daniel was saying if every you know

2306
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,280
if every like

2307
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:32,080
think of every network being like a

2308
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:32,800
point

2309
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,960
in the modulized space do you see then

2310
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,800
that whole thing is just a point

2311
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,760
and then how do you actually get from

2312
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,600
point to point so is that the sort of

2313
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:39,920
like

2314
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,719
multi-scale multi-class i'm super into

2315
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:43,280
like

2316
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:46,080
multi-class classification you know i

2317
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,280
really like this question

2318
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,320
yes switch it up to like pro finite if

2319
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,760
you categorify the thing

2320
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,360
you're going to get more connections

2321
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,280
right then you're then you're working in

2322
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:55,840
like

2323
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,840
categories of multi-class active

2324
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,040
inference not just

2325
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,960
one why don't we split it up why don't

2326
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,280
you color it call them incarnations

2327
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,120
and relate them if it's a powerful

2328
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,120
enough category you can put a sheaf on

2329
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:07,520
it

2330
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,360
put a sheaf on it and then start gluing

2331
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,640
them all together and then i think you

2332
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,080
really have a multi-class shared

2333
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,480
inference

2334
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,159
does that make sense wow what a great

2335
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:17,280
question do you have any thoughts on

2336
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,800
that on the multi-class i mean i think

2337
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,520
that's what

2338
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,800
you know we're saying one thought

2339
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,560
and the way that we've been talking

2340
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,880
about multi-scale active inference

2341
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,120
is like let's say the brain is the

2342
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,880
internal state and the body is external

2343
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,239
to it so then you have the blood-brain

2344
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:32,880
barrier

2345
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,640
and then at the next level out you have

2346
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,000
the brain in the body

2347
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
interacting with the social niche and

2348
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,600
then you can go up and you can have

2349
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,360
societies or groups that are interacting

2350
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,360
with each other and it's a debate

2351
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,360
in active efforts does the group really

2352
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,199
have a blanket or what kind of blanket

2353
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,239
does it have

2354
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,800
and here we're not gonna speak directly

2355
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:51,440
to that

2356
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,320
but we can think of quote american

2357
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,199
society

2358
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:58,239
as a point it's a point and then

2359
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,880
it has internal structure but by using

2360
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:01,520
that

2361
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,159
basically linguistic token by saying it

2362
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:05,679
is a point it's literally

2363
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:09,520
one term that you can pass then

2364
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,120
it abstracts over lower levels and

2365
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,679
i'm not exactly sure on um what is

2366
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,600
strong enough to have a sheath or not or

2367
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,080
what that enables but it sounds like

2368
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:20,960
it's making

2369
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,000
these nested structures and uh laterally

2370
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,360
interacting structures

2371
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,920
making them composable and kind of

2372
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,040
compilable

2373
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,840
so that we can tractably zoom in and

2374
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,800
zoom out

2375
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,159
or work with guarantees or

2376
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:39,360
proofs on these types of structures

2377
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,440
oh i love that yeah and so i encourage

2378
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,800
everyone to

2379
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,640
uh maybe as a challenge and stephen will

2380
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,040
like this too when we say like okay so

2381
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,159
thank you for explaining that for the

2382
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:48,880
multi-class

2383
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,520
yeah i agree super like all these levels

2384
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,080
yeah

2385
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,320
to reinterpret that because it's always

2386
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,440
a boundary condition

2387
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,040
right blood brain barrier vary between

2388
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,560
me and group vary between

2389
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,239
like uh collectivity and

2390
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,560
non-collectivity things like this right

2391
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,640
um what is a group group action and

2392
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,600
things like this

2393
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,920
so reinterpret that with a notion of a

2394
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,760
pro finite boundary

2395
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,600
i'm very curious as to what these

2396
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,199
boundaries are right

2397
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,280
they're not solid they seem to be sort

2398
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,400
of like uh

2399
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,040
are they hidden so the very concept of a

2400
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,040
boundary is a hidden state is something

2401
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,560
that i was playing with and i was like

2402
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,520
you know what

2403
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,000
at what point is the boundary there does

2404
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:26,719
that make sense

2405
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:29,280
it's almost like um you know boundary

2406
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,880
and hidden state is like this dark room

2407
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,159
phenomena that all of a sudden somebody

2408
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,960
turns on a light

2409
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,679
boom boundary is there right so when you

2410
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:36,000
have

2411
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,280
levin and fields talking about like

2412
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,840
entanglement like uh you know across

2413
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,840
uh boundaries and things like this like

2414
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,199
or maybe the only way to deco here is on

2415
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:46,239
the boundary

2416
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,080
where is the information and that's

2417
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,600
actually a really important question

2418
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,600
but if you can reframe all of that try

2419
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,960
to reframe the multi-class

2420
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,400
like uh you know the multi-scale

2421
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,400
active inference in terms of a boundary

2422
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,159
that's like a fractal

2423
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,159
that's very strange you see what i mean

2424
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:03,920
daniel right then it's like

2425
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,560
then there's no clear defined boundary

2426
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,120
um

2427
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,400
i'm sure there's if there's a lot of

2428
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,320
people listening like anyone kind of

2429
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,000
super empath or if you have impact

2430
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:12,480
friends

2431
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,400
i mean i swear like some i can just be

2432
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,840
walking and like you know

2433
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,600
the tree goes into me or something like

2434
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,960
that so i don't have very good

2435
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,159
boundaries like that

2436
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:23,199
right my mind thinks about everything

2437
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:25,040
and it swaps you know like i wish there

2438
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,320
was like a jedi school you know i mean i

2439
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,840
would totally be there like how do i do

2440
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:28,800
this

2441
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,239
um and i think the active inference

2442
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,000
people like are the jedi school it's

2443
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:32,320
like

2444
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,320
okay let's figure this out so if you do

2445
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,800
multi-scale any of this

2446
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,040
play with that notion of a boundary you

2447
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,120
know just like you saw i'm very

2448
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,800
you know math people can almost get kind

2449
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,800
of you know too much with it but you

2450
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,040
want to be precise about every word

2451
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,960
and we're real careful when we define

2452
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,199
things like modulized space like

2453
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:53,920
what a family of bundles means what a

2454
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,880
family of isomorphism classes mean

2455
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,159
so really think about what you're

2456
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:00,080
defining as boundary

2457
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,080
and if that boundary was not solid

2458
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,600
because they never are

2459
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,440
if you have a pro-finite boundary it

2460
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,199
just changes a little thing

2461
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:10,159
it changes the way in which that scale

2462
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,480
is sort of hierarchized i think

2463
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,239
yeah do you have multiple levels of

2464
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:15,920
inference going on oh my god

2465
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,120
yeah if i can give a physical metaphor

2466
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,239
to what you said about these

2467
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:22,640
i'm going to schedule yes so let's just

2468
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:25,120
say that you were looking at a textbook

2469
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,760
for anatomy and it would say what is the

2470
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,040
boundary of the lungs

2471
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,040
what is the blanket around the lungs

2472
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,480
well at that level

2473
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,480
the gross anatomy level it's the

2474
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,760
peripleura it's the

2475
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,679
the membrane that just encloses it like

2476
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:40,320
one bag and you can even have a point

2477
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,640
just the lungs but then if you really

2478
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,760
zoom in

2479
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,480
it's actually truly a fractal with the

2480
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,520
alveoli

2481
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,040
and the way that actually the boundary

2482
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,960
of the lung it probably looks like a

2483
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,239
piece of broccoli

2484
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:54,880
because are you looking at it from the

2485
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,040
outside with just a single sack

2486
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,800
or will you go into finer scale

2487
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,840
and see that the interface has a fractal

2488
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,120
dimension oh

2489
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,040
see and that's what i'm saying right

2490
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,239
like

2491
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:13,679
you know at what point was the room dark

2492
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:15,520
was it always dark and we just didn't

2493
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,600
notice it that's what i'm talking about

2494
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,040
and will the room always be

2495
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,960
dark i don't think so right i think at

2496
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:21,920
some point if you were in the dark room

2497
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:22,640
would change

2498
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,080
and so just like what daniel is saying

2499
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,840
you zoom in on this stuff

2500
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,280
and you know there's more space between

2501
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,120
the like atoms if you actually want to

2502
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,080
use that approach

2503
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,480
right what is that and that's what i'm

2504
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,159
really interested in

2505
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:36,239
so you have all these different smears

2506
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:37,760
it could be happening that like

2507
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,520
if all of these events actually happen

2508
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,120
and they are just temporarily

2509
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,280
extended what does that actually mean

2510
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,960
it's almost like a time sheath

2511
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,719
you know what i mean if interaction is

2512
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,719
like this what time spread

2513
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:52,080
no idea no idea these are i think

2514
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,800
these these interrogatories should

2515
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:55,679
direct

2516
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,679
all of the work and that's why all my

2517
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,239
math is like super philosophy like

2518
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,159
philosophically i don't know i did say

2519
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,440
elephants earlier now i just said it

2520
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,719
phillips

2521
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,400
so it's like uh okay i'm just getting

2522
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,000
excited this is awesome

2523
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,400
um yeah one more on the philosophy

2524
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,560
um point wait the dark the dark room

2525
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:15,440
problem

2526
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,280
so you just rephrase the dark room

2527
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,880
problem as being like no was it room

2528
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,480
always dark it's almost like

2529
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,880
well if there's no person in the room

2530
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:23,920
what's the problem

2531
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,360
or it's it's thinking about the person's

2532
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,199
the time that they're in that room

2533
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:30,480
because you're not appealing to an

2534
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,520
alternate universe where

2535
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,000
somebody has always been and always will

2536
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,120
be in a dark room

2537
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,320
you're appealing to our everyday

2538
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,400
experience of being in a dark room

2539
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,600
but that is only part of our regular

2540
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,239
behavioral

2541
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:46,080
sequences so not exactly sure where that

2542
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:46,640
would uh

2543
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:50,000
take the the dark room investigation

2544
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,640
but it it helps us see that it's part of

2545
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,600
a bigger

2546
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,960
set of experiences or of uh

2547
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,800
of scenarios that the agent is

2548
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,440
experiencing

2549
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,120
yeah and my question is like if this

2550
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,199
boundary is like pro finite and fractal

2551
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:05,840
what's

2552
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,239
what's to prevent us going from dark

2553
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:10,080
room and then maybe a white room

2554
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,920
right dark room white room dark room

2555
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,920
white room dark room white room right

2556
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,159
or let me ask if anyone knows what would

2557
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:17,040
be the actual

2558
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,920
um antipodal reference of a dark room is

2559
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:23,120
there an actual opposite of a dark room

2560
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:27,120
would that be like what would that be

2561
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:30,239
if it were interesting if it were a

2562
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:31,120
stochastic

2563
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,040
signal coming into your eyes so just

2564
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,560
like a white noise

2565
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,960
then it would almost be like a dark room

2566
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,640
of a different kind because sure there'd

2567
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,239
be light coming on your retina

2568
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:42,480
but informationally you're still not

2569
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,840
getting anything

2570
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,920
so at the higher level it's a similar

2571
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:46,960
problem but it

2572
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,719
it uncouples it from the photons hitting

2573
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:49,920
your retina which actually doesn't

2574
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,120
matter

2575
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,880
right yeah and i think there was

2576
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,320
something i was reading

2577
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:58,080
um um i forgot what it was about like

2578
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,679
synesthetes and how cinnace store

2579
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:01,120
information because i have sort of half

2580
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:01,840
of that

2581
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,320
um but i was like maybe i should find

2582
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,440
out a little about myself

2583
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,880
anyway um there was some wild study that

2584
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:09,679
was like if you put

2585
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:11,760
pure white light on the retina i would

2586
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,040
love for your community to investigate

2587
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,880
this like you actually can't see

2588
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,679
it actually negates object vision pure

2589
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:18,640
white light

2590
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,360
so unspectraed on the retina well

2591
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,800
actually negate object vision

2592
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,679
now again i saw this it was in a

2593
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,360
philosophy work which i you know i trust

2594
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:27,679
the

2595
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,760
you know again i'm i'm not like a super

2596
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,880
scientist about that

2597
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,960
but that's really interesting right so

2598
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,000
just like daniel said

2599
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,520
in a pure white room you'd also be in

2600
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,400
the dark so that's that's interesting

2601
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,120
and so you see you need this like messy

2602
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,040
so pure white light

2603
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,920
you know would hurt us you cannot see

2604
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:46,960
object vision

2605
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,840
so it makes me think is object vision

2606
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,760
itself pro finite

2607
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,560
right if it seems to be emergent if it

2608
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,560
seems to be falling out if you cannot

2609
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:56,960
see

2610
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,760
the actual when pure white light if it's

2611
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:00,880
a non-spectra

2612
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,800
is interacting with our system we cannot

2613
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,800
take it what are the actual

2614
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,880
implications of that and can you

2615
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,080
actually scale that

2616
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,360
right so that's why i was saying with

2617
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,159
the dark and and with emergence like

2618
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:15,120
at what point it is emergent at what

2619
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:15,760
point

2620
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,840
of like you know photonic light hitting

2621
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:18,800
your eyes

2622
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:22,239
um must it be non-white like pure you

2623
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:23,360
know

2624
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,120
so that's actually interesting that the

2625
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,800
actual purest conditions of something

2626
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,520
may

2627
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,840
may negate the uh the organism's object

2628
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,480
functionality right

2629
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,400
and then we're actually hurting so at

2630
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,760
that point you may have to rely on the

2631
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,199
higher two morphisms and then you go

2632
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,920
join the shannon daniel jedi school

2633
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:43,040
i'm just like so uh

2634
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,480
um maybe i should talk just a little bit

2635
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,320
more about the time stuff and then

2636
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,880
um leave with like another fun drawing

2637
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:49,520
um

2638
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,000
this is an awesome conversation um okay

2639
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,360
so again we all know that time is a

2640
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,040
problem why is an emergent why am i

2641
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,880
talking about emergent time

2642
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,800
when when we can go so far with these

2643
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,400
ideas it's good to bring in

2644
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,920
an example like daniel was saying about

2645
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,760
you know alveoli and things like that

2646
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,480
um the actual um i take care of a lot of

2647
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,360
elderly

2648
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,360
family members and so i my earliest

2649
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,199
memories are hospitals and

2650
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,440
that might be why i kind of grew up so

2651
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,679
quick um just with all these like heavy

2652
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:16,480
questions

2653
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,480
and i remember um you know we were

2654
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,840
having a lot of problems with like

2655
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:23,600
the actual oxygen co2 exchange

2656
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,239
right that's actually really tricky so

2657
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:27,280
it's it's not like

2658
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,239
if someone you know is uh suffering you

2659
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:30,639
know

2660
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:33,199
in the like the pulmonary sense you

2661
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:34,480
can't just

2662
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,560
you know and put an oxygen mask on and

2663
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,719
it's fine so the actual body's way of

2664
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:39,760
absorbing that

2665
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,280
i think is very very very tricky the co2

2666
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,360
um you know exchanging with the o2 in

2667
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,000
this fractal web of broccoli you know

2668
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,239
so what is that and that's happening 24

2669
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,000
7 as i like giggle and give this talk

2670
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:52,480
it's like

2671
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,520
my alveoli are excited i think i just

2672
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,840
said alveoli like ravioli am i ravioli

2673
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,120
you're excited all right anyway

2674
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,080
i don't know what i'm saying all right

2675
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,880
so um but it's nice to when you have all

2676
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,280
this

2677
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:06,000
high math too try to reign it in with

2678
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,600
something biological so people like

2679
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:08,400
shannon why are you talking about

2680
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,840
biology like because i want to try to

2681
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:10,719
find

2682
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:13,280
something here that we can use to sort

2683
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,800
of justify temporal

2684
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,960
non-locality besides entangled photon

2685
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,880
pairs everybody uses entangled photon

2686
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:19,440
pairs

2687
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,960
why don't we use like daniel was saying

2688
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,719
like the actual system why don't we use

2689
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:24,239
the organism to test on

2690
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,239
um so again if if there's actual

2691
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:27,360
entanglement going on

2692
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,679
in the daughter cells i am excited about

2693
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:31,199
that i want to think uh want to ask the

2694
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:31,920
community

2695
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,840
what we think about uh entanglement

2696
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,040
which is again going to mess with this

2697
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,080
idea of time

2698
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,960
right time and boundaries so we know

2699
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,719
that there's a problem of time

2700
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:42,960
um you're like you know your heavy

2701
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,480
weights and quantum mechanics have the

2702
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,840
wheeler dewitt equation says the

2703
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,360
universe is static

2704
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,280
to an external observer i'm gonna have

2705
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,520
some questions with like the external

2706
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,120
versus the internal observer i don't

2707
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:53,920
know what that is

2708
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,360
because again i think all boundaries are

2709
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,000
pro finite so it's a little tricky

2710
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,760
um quantum mechanics is you know going

2711
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,000
to say that time is universal and

2712
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:02,880
absolute

2713
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,000
general relativity is going to say that

2714
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,159
it's actually malleable and relative

2715
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:07,920
right and then you know people like me

2716
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,679
the category theory of people maybe time

2717
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:11,360
is like a morphism you know

2718
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,960
so i oh wait you know i asked back to

2719
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,480
the dark room question things like this

2720
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:17,040
even your local time was it like what is

2721
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,560
time was it always here

2722
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,880
where is not our comedian time so if

2723
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,639
we're thinking about like hidden states

2724
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:24,800
right and any kind of embodied cognition

2725
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,280
it's very interesting how your memory

2726
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,440
it's not very solid what peop maybe

2727
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,199
people's earliest memories like when

2728
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:31,520
they're

2729
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,840
six my one friend he's like uh i don't

2730
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,120
know like 12 i'm like you don't remember

2731
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,159
anything until you're 12.

2732
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:39,440
like what is that so when does your

2733
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,480
little system

2734
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,719
actually come online is this once again

2735
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:44,639
a play between irreversibility and

2736
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:47,040
reconstructability is it also a play

2737
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,440
between your multi-scale own active

2738
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,239
inference

2739
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:53,040
have you stopped is it possible that you

2740
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,360
were only in your own reflections

2741
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:59,120
until age seven and then you were able

2742
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,120
to actually reach your reflections right

2743
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,679
is this like people's earliest numbers

2744
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:05,840
so if you're thinking about like i am

2745
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,600
that interaction and perception and all

2746
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,560
these things

2747
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,400
that are feedback loops with your own

2748
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,639
system right anything that's feed

2749
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,800
feeding back into the actual kind of

2750
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,360
non-local organism for cognition

2751
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,920
it's reflection based so but if you were

2752
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,760
only in reflection land maybe your

2753
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,520
memory would never come online

2754
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,679
so where is it like where is time was it

2755
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:27,520
always here where's yesterday like i

2756
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,560
just don't know

2757
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,040
you know um so we say these like you

2758
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,320
know we have these existential

2759
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,159
qualifiers like there exists

2760
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:35,840
right but what are the conditions for

2761
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,280
all of this it's you know we're here for

2762
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,800
such a short time and there's all these

2763
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,159
big questions right

2764
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,760
i want to know what an emergent time

2765
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,520
asymmetry is it's very interesting when

2766
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,480
i ask

2767
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,880
you know why do we seem to go forward or

2768
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,560
something you you're almost

2769
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,719
you're dealt with another answer that's

2770
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:52,320
super fuzzy and only defined in the

2771
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,280
negative right

2772
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,800
uh there seems to be like a time

2773
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,199
asymmetry and like did you just use time

2774
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:58,480
to define time like

2775
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,800
isn't that we can't do that right um i

2776
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,639
mean i guess we can but

2777
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:05,199
what would actually be an emergent time

2778
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:07,040
asymmetry at what point if you think

2779
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,400
about that pro construction i was

2780
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,520
talking about

2781
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,600
how do you actually get a time asymmetry

2782
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,520
and that crazy environment

2783
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,760
right or just like um you know the

2784
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,600
beautiful dark room example um or even

2785
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,360
steven's example the question right

2786
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,960
how do you actually get asymmetries

2787
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,120
on this emergent scale go even weirder

2788
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,239
with what i said how do you get

2789
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:28,320
asymmetries in this doubly emergent

2790
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:28,800
scale

2791
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,120
can you actually get an asymmetry in

2792
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,280
just one of the morphisms i don't know

2793
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,840
these questions are once again huge how

2794
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,520
would you actually have the notion of an

2795
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:38,639
entropy

2796
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,719
right in an embodied cognition where

2797
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:41,840
you're you know exchanging with the

2798
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:42,800
environment

2799
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:46,000
if time was discrete this is what i want

2800
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:46,639
to think about

2801
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:48,000
so just like daniel gave us a great

2802
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
example on the outside we're all so

2803
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:50,719
beautiful

2804
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:52,480
we wear these like awesome clothes and

2805
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,440
we have these you know beautiful

2806
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,320
features

2807
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,639
and if you actually zoom in like to the

2808
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:57,840
actual lung sacs

2809
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,639
right very tricky fractal stuff going on

2810
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:01,280
there

2811
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:02,800
why don't we look at time the same way

2812
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,400
out here you have this you know like

2813
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,639
supposed continuum which i don't really

2814
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:08,239
like believe in

2815
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:10,400
what if you zoomed in how would you

2816
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,000
actually figure if time was actually

2817
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,600
discrete like a set of points like that

2818
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,600
modulized space

2819
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,120
is there a dark room in between each

2820
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,880
time and that's why i'm really

2821
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,159
interested in this dark room

2822
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:23,840
who's to say that you're not blinking in

2823
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,280
and out of it like every

2824
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,840
plank second you know that's what i'm

2825
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,120
really interested in is that

2826
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,880
you know your eye seems to be doing an

2827
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,560
interpolation anyway

2828
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,920
right they've done those studies about

2829
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,600
like eye tracking and when you're

2830
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,719
actually looking at someone it's just

2831
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:38,080
like eyes and mouth or something like

2832
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,480
this

2833
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,719
you don't really look at the ear so it's

2834
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:41,840
actually you're putting together an

2835
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,520
image of me based on your tracking

2836
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,600
yeah and so you're actually doing an

2837
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,880
interpolation like

2838
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,000
24 7 even go down to like the cesium

2839
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,880
atom like time so are you not doing the

2840
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,000
same thing for time

2841
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,080
itself that's where i'm really that's

2842
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,280
what i'm interested in

2843
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,360
take the time zoom in if time is also

2844
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,520
this boundary this fractal curve

2845
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,400
um you know my awesome mentor uh

2846
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,320
beautiful amazing wizard mentor dr

2847
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:07,679
lapidus michelle lapidus

2848
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:08,719
you know came up with like you know

2849
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:10,960
fractal curves and fractal chromology

2850
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,080
and all this stuff

2851
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,159
that's really interesting right fractals

2852
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:15,120
data functions

2853
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,400
um what if time is something like that

2854
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,159
so what is structural causality you've

2855
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:21,600
got bertrand russell and these great

2856
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,440
wizards right wittgenstein

2857
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,920
language is a you know a game and um you

2858
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:26,719
know uh

2859
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:29,280
you know bertrand russell saying you

2860
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:29,920
know

2861
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,520
there's no there's no structural

2862
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,120
relation between uh now

2863
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,719
and actually assuming that the world was

2864
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:36,560
created you know five minutes ago

2865
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,000
so there's last thursday as and then you

2866
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,679
get these fun things all right once

2867
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:41,280
again what is object persistence how do

2868
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,239
you actually do that

2869
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:43,679
who's to say that the dark room is not

2870
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:45,280
flickering in and out like every

2871
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,440
you know second and once again the stop

2872
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:48,800
mechanism really interested in what your

2873
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,000
community thinks about that

2874
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,400
right so again uh in something like you

2875
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,320
know horribly sad like the proliferation

2876
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,239
of cancer cells or something

2877
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:59,040
why how does that act so locally right

2878
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,239
you could just have that in a particular

2879
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:01,600
area and it starts like spraying through

2880
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,280
like you know metastasis and stuff like

2881
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,000
that but it

2882
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,040
originates locally it doesn't originate

2883
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,400
as a systemic thing

2884
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,000
and that's what i'm very interested in

2885
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,520
seems to be these pockets

2886
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,080
right pockets of the stop mechanism

2887
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,120
failing

2888
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,679
can destroy the whole organism which is

2889
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:19,520
back to that torsion thing i was talking

2890
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:21,040
about you can have these few elements

2891
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,400
that annihilate

2892
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,560
um you know these torsion elements that

2893
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,600
are annihilated

2894
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,520
right at the expense of the actual

2895
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,360
organism so if we actually say how does

2896
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,040
causality actually change for your per

2897
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,480
your turing degree remember i sort of

2898
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,520
think that we can

2899
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,880
you know in your multi-scale active

2900
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,560
imprints it would be nice to classify

2901
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:37,760
organisms maybe based on their

2902
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,920
problem-solving um capability

2903
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,239
um so i really think there are no optic

2904
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:43,440
boundaries it seems to be these

2905
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,960
pro-finite boundaries then you're going

2906
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,800
to ask ontake boundaries of what

2907
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,239
ontake boundaries of the organism which

2908
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:49,920
you zoom in and find that it's like

2909
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,120
lung sac like fractal broccoli you know

2910
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,800
and then you know just to keep going why

2911
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,400
is space-time only a manifold i showed

2912
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,840
you these other structures what if we

2913
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,679
reinterpreted any of that gr stuff is

2914
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:00,159
like

2915
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:01,760
space-time being a diamond you'd be

2916
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,159
allowing the multiplicity which is the

2917
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,480
power of the organism right you are

2918
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,679
it is not top-down you are learning from

2919
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:11,440
everything right

2920
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,800
so what would actually like a number

2921
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,199
theoretic time look like um so let's go

2922
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:17,199
just a little bit deeper into emergence

2923
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:18,639
right assuming it's emergent

2924
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:20,159
what is an emergent from what is the

2925
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:21,840
actual eschatology of time that's what

2926
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:22,719
i'm really interested in

2927
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:24,960
like is it going to be here what if it

2928
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,719
just left you know what if time just

2929
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:27,760
walked off and left

2930
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,920
okay um i'm really interested in

2931
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,760
planarium so chris fields has taught me

2932
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,520
a lot about the planarium

2933
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:35,760
so these are the the little worms that

2934
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:36,639
if you actually

2935
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:38,080
cut off a piece of that again i'm not

2936
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:39,840
into like animal cruelty but if somehow

2937
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,840
a piece of them gets like removed

2938
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,080
that little piece can regenerate the

2939
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,600
whole organism and so daniel was going

2940
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:46,320
to ask like

2941
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,440
do y'all have any any thoughts um about

2942
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,960
that because it seems to be that the

2943
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:51,840
nervous system is

2944
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,800
acting non-locally and it seems like or

2945
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,320
the planarium like

2946
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:59,360
can they is that like an emergence like

2947
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,440
what is that you know so how can you

2948
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,600
actually have a piece

2949
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,880
reproduce the whole organism when we

2950
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,480
can't do that so is there any thoughts

2951
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,520
about that like we

2952
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,239
lose a finger and it's very sad we have

2953
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:12,239
a stop mechanism that actually prevents

2954
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:13,360
that so i was going to just

2955
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,960
ask you all since you're also complexity

2956
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,120
theorists right do you also think that

2957
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,040
because our organism is

2958
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:22,560
more complex we have a stronger

2959
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,400
mark of irreversibility stronger cut off

2960
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,159
of reconstructability

2961
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:30,719
my like if we all lost an arm our arm is

2962
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:32,880
not reconstructable given our system but

2963
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,159
it is for a planaria

2964
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:36,080
so is there a play between complexity

2965
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,320
theory hidden do we have more hidden

2966
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:38,880
states

2967
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,719
than the actual planaria just one of

2968
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:43,120
y'all's thoughts on that

2969
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:46,000
awesome question i'm going to address it

2970
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:46,639
with

2971
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:48,960
an empirical observation rather than an

2972
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,320
appeal to theory

2973
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,239
and just as you said if we lose part of

2974
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,080
our body we can't grow back but maybe

2975
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:54,800
you know future

2976
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,639
technology could change that but if you

2977
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,719
go to an ant colony

2978
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:01,120
and you scoop up the ants from a certain

2979
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,239
location

2980
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:04,480
a few minutes later other nest mates

2981
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,480
will have functionally

2982
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,800
replaced the nest mates that you had

2983
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,639
taken because they're all diffusing

2984
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,080
around in the space

2985
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,239
and so it's almost like the ant colony

2986
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:15,520
is more resilient

2987
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,000
to perturbation including extreme

2988
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,280
perturbations

2989
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:22,560
however it has less morphological

2990
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,480
complexity in the interactions

2991
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,960
than for example a synapse so it's like

2992
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:28,800
if you want to have you know the library

2993
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,400
with a lot of books it's going to take a

2994
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,360
lot of space

2995
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,719
if you want to have a really precisely

2996
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:35,120
specified topology of interactions like

2997
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,320
neurons do

2998
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,480
you're going to have limited not zero

2999
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,080
but limited flexibility

3000
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,280
relative to a sort of distributed

3001
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,440
totally fluidly mixing system like an

3002
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:46,880
ant colony so there's definitely

3003
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,639
something there with a trade-off on the

3004
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:50,320
complexity frontier

3005
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,800
of how much resilience do you have an

3006
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,400
ability to regenerate or

3007
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,239
maybe even to perpetuate indefinitely

3008
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:58,159
like a sponge or a coral or something

3009
01:31:58,159 --> 01:31:59,199
like that

3010
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:02,400
versus irreversibly move towards order

3011
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,560
which comes with the cost of uh building

3012
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,080
tall buildings that can

3013
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:09,199
fall down right

3014
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:11,280
right and would we rather have like our

3015
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,199
sugar cubes as an ant colony or the tall

3016
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:15,920
building i don't know

3017
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,360
right am i weird there would be able to

3018
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:20,000
do both in awareness we could be ants

3019
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,199
you know just play um wow that's

3020
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:26,159
that's very remarkable so that example

3021
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:26,480
is

3022
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,480
just as profound as these questions that

3023
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,920
i'm asking right

3024
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,520
there seems to be so many things

3025
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:32,880
happening at once and thinking about it

3026
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,719
in terms of perturbation which again i

3027
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:35,920
linked perturbation

3028
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,080
to the diamonds as well right you can

3029
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,520
you can still do that

3030
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,320
and again so that's a excellent question

3031
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:42,960
um

3032
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,960
and um with like a more excellent answer

3033
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,480
right like how do you actually talk

3034
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,320
about emergence and also emergence and

3035
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,400
perturbation right those go hand in hand

3036
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,400
but also emergence and irreversibility

3037
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,159
and just like you said a complexity

3038
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:58,400
so thinking about complexity in terms of

3039
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,560
um you know emergence and also

3040
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,679
uh i like how you said resistance but

3041
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:05,280
you know with the advent of stuff like

3042
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,880
you know epigenetics and things like

3043
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,000
that i'm wondering

3044
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,239
um i don't know if you put plenaria in a

3045
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:11,760
very horrible environment if they still

3046
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,280
continue it seems like ants kind of

3047
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,239
continue right

3048
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:17,280
they're like little fighters um yeah and

3049
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,480
again who's to say i don't want to be

3050
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,320
speciesist who's to say that you know we

3051
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,080
are more complex than the ants because

3052
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:23,920
they have a collective phenomena

3053
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:27,040
which is like super profound right yeah

3054
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,040
and so it's like are we building tall

3055
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,960
buildings to the extent of like

3056
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,800
not really connecting with each other

3057
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,159
right you need to think about stuff like

3058
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:34,480
that

3059
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,600
um okay so that's a question yes

3060
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,560
okay okay just uh cb has returned with

3061
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:40,880
some

3062
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,480
funny and interesting questions so

3063
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,880
there's two questions there's a tiny one

3064
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:47,679
and then uh a big one the tiny one go

3065
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:48,159
for it

3066
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:51,280
no pun intended is can you elaborate on

3067
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:54,000
the idea of the infinitesimal thickening

3068
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,600
so what does that mean

3069
01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:00,159
what is your infinitesimal thickening

3070
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:02,080
yeah sure say you had

3071
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,560
a space right i have a space or i have a

3072
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:05,120
pen

3073
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:07,920
this is my pen so we would actually say

3074
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:08,480
that the pin

3075
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,000
is carved out and it has a specific

3076
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,520
boundary right um

3077
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,760
outside of the pin we would say is like

3078
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,600
a measure zero there's nothing else

3079
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,840
outside of the pin the pin stops and

3080
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:18,639
then you have like

3081
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:20,480
space no pen do we all agree there's a

3082
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,239
very strict boundary line between pin

3083
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:24,960
and no pin so in infinitesimals these

3084
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:25,600
are

3085
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,000
these are um in the they're like um

3086
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,199
collections

3087
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:32,719
of infinitely small small pieces

3088
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:35,840
they're not identically zero they are

3089
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:39,199
they still they exist but they're almost

3090
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:42,000
zero but they're not quite zero so

3091
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,040
surrounding the pin

3092
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,800
we could say is an infinitesimal

3093
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,960
thickness which is not all the way to

3094
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:47,760
zero

3095
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,239
but there is like a little bit of wiggle

3096
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:51,600
does that make sense

3097
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,639
so that's what we're saying that there

3098
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:55,600
is a wiggle a space around

3099
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,880
spaces so just like i was saying um it

3100
01:34:58,880 --> 01:34:59,360
gets

3101
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,600
you know it gets rid of notions like um

3102
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:02,960
singular points so we know there's there

3103
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,880
was a lot of problems and you know uh

3104
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,400
part the standard model is great

3105
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,600
but in particle physics there was

3106
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,280
problems with having points interact in

3107
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,360
these finemen diagrams remember everyone

3108
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,440
and so you actually made the point a one

3109
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:16,080
a one dimensional object called a string

3110
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,679
to avoid the complications of just

3111
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:19,600
having a point so in math you can do the

3112
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:20,320
same way

3113
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,320
instead of having a singular condition

3114
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,520
like this is my

3115
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:26,159
now there's problems with that what if

3116
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,719
you actually had a now that had a little

3117
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:30,000
infinitesimal so

3118
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,719
surrounded by not almost zero so think

3119
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:34,560
about the smallest numbers possible but

3120
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,719
they go infinitely right so this is

3121
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:38,400
almost like um

3122
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,920
if we know that you know the archimedean

3123
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,280
property that you can always make a

3124
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,239
bigger number you can always make a

3125
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:43,119
smaller number

3126
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:45,440
always so imagine that that that

3127
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:46,639
negative our comedian

3128
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:49,520
all the way down and so you surround a

3129
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:50,320
space with

3130
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,639
those and then you don't have a singular

3131
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:54,560
space anymore

3132
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,320
thank you for the answer and the second

3133
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:59,360
question from cambridge breaths was

3134
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:02,080
also is it accurate to say that every

3135
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:02,880
experienced

3136
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:06,159
now can reflect innumerable other nows

3137
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:09,440
if so is time travel possible oh

3138
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:13,280
see i love your community you know

3139
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,400
well you know i'm going to say yes

3140
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,000
because i'm like the magic person here

3141
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:16,480
yeah

3142
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:19,600
so again what is a now it's very

3143
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:20,639
interesting you can have all the

3144
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:21,440
elaborate

3145
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,800
physics on the planet and then you ask

3146
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,639
what is an observer and the room goes

3147
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:25,280
quiet

3148
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,440
right so when we say what is a now

3149
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,040
that's what i'm saying like and now

3150
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,239
according to whom

3151
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:33,360
we're all connected right now um i

3152
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:34,239
shouldn't say now

3153
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:35,840
but at the same time you're peripherally

3154
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,679
aware of everything going outside like

3155
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:38,000
my

3156
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
animals your next appointment your

3157
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
digestive system your autonomic nervous

3158
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:42,719
system

3159
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:44,560
so when we say now it's like now

3160
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,080
according to whom are you neglecting

3161
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,360
your own hidden states

3162
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,199
and that's why very curious as to what

3163
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:51,119
we mean by now also

3164
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:53,199
i'm very you know i'm very adamant about

3165
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:54,719
saying um

3166
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:57,040
you know there is no synchronous

3167
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:58,159
reference

3168
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:00,320
anyone who thinks this now is actually

3169
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,080
happening now you've neglected the

3170
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,239
neuronal processes that are actually

3171
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:04,960
happening

3172
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,960
there's neurotransmitter signals you

3173
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:08,000
know everything happen

3174
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,480
happening on neurological time to

3175
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,239
actually get you to have this now so

3176
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:13,760
you're always in the past

3177
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,080
does that make sense right you're always

3178
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,199
in the past

3179
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:20,800
uh but you're also not in the past so

3180
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,159
you can get very like alan watts and

3181
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:23,920
eggheart toll here and say

3182
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,679
you really only have now it is a

3183
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:27,360
hallucination to think that there is

3184
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,560
like a tomorrow

3185
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,239
because even when you actually remember

3186
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:32,000
the past you're doing it now we all

3187
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,560
agree you're always in this slice right

3188
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,600
but if you there's a little bit more do

3189
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,600
you see that if you do a formal spectra

3190
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:40,719
with the now

3191
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:42,560
if you put a little bit of thickness on

3192
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,159
it it allows

3193
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:45,840
for you to actually have a little bit of

3194
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,600
more room in the now

3195
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,119
which is just like what um you know the

3196
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:50,960
question is asking can you

3197
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,119
you know the now actually contains other

3198
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:54,480
nouns yeah

3199
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,880
because um if the whole if time is this

3200
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,159
pro construction which is what i'm

3201
01:37:58,159 --> 01:37:59,600
trying to say then you are linking

3202
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:00,080
together

3203
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,560
all kinds of things right your thoughts

3204
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:05,119
happening now where are they coming from

3205
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:07,520
i don't know and so is time travel

3206
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:09,280
possible oh yeah you bet that's what i

3207
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,320
said that's why i was

3208
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:11,920
saying look at me i'm all excited you

3209
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:14,080
know if you can actually partition the

3210
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,600
brain okay so let's get weird

3211
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:16,880
i mean not too weird don't do this to

3212
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:19,119
yourself like right now hold on

3213
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:20,719
um if you were actually to make the

3214
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:22,719
brain so that it was almost like a split

3215
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:24,239
screen this is a very rough analogy if

3216
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:25,360
you remember those like

3217
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:26,800
i don't know older films that had like

3218
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,560
one panel going and the other one i

3219
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,080
loved those just because

3220
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,600
you know i think like synthetic

3221
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,280
hyperactive i need to be like doing a

3222
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:35,360
lot like multitask

3223
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,360
so imagine you had that kind of split

3224
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:39,440
screen but in your own awareness

3225
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,760
in the awareness not the now but if we

3226
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:42,880
were actually able to

3227
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,199
split the system then you would actually

3228
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:46,639
be able to quote

3229
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:48,880
time travel if time is non-local and if

3230
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,560
it was always there

3231
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,719
all you really have to do is try to get

3232
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:53,840
to your like

3233
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:56,400
your your own v stack and i think people

3234
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:57,360
are really

3235
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,440
what is this girl talking about but it's

3236
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,119
like if you could actually

3237
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:02,760
get to where you had those

3238
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,480
hieromorphisms

3239
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,800
then that would be very very exciting

3240
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,159
and then time travel

3241
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:10,560
should be possible when people time

3242
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,000
travel it's like they normally

3243
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,159
they normally like them the object

3244
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:15,840
themselves doesn't travel and they seem

3245
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,800
to think

3246
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,280
that you know perturbation doesn't exist

3247
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:20,000
so it's like

3248
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,280
if you're going to time travel you're

3249
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,199
going to be perturbing time be ready

3250
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:25,520
for time to perturb you back i'm not

3251
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,199
saying it will be like a very gentle

3252
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:28,320
experience

3253
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:31,360
but i am completely all for it there

3254
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:33,760
seems to be something in the system

3255
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,320
that keeps us on one channel and i you

3256
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,040
know i

3257
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:38,320
just to ask the community those are

3258
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,239
great questions and even ask the

3259
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:40,960
question you know

3260
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:42,880
the if the question i want to ask again

3261
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,960
what is their own thoughts about

3262
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,639
why do you seem to be in this one

3263
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:48,080
channel everyone will say well because

3264
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:48,960
there's a time

3265
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:52,000
there's a time asymmetry and the past is

3266
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,239
irreversible well we've seen how shady

3267
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:56,000
irreversibility is right

3268
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,159
it's a boundary phenomenon and so you

3269
01:39:58,159 --> 01:39:59,119
almost have to be like

3270
01:39:59,119 --> 01:40:00,800
somebody called me miss frizzle once

3271
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,320
like the magic school bus lady i was

3272
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,440
like okay this is great

3273
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,880
and she's got like red hair and she's

3274
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,639
driving this school bus

3275
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:08,480
going into these things i would totally

3276
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:09,920
take a school bus and go into the

3277
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,920
alveoli like what is this place

3278
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,679
if you were to actually drive the school

3279
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:16,000
bus into the actual boundary

3280
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,840
you're gonna see it's not there i mean

3281
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,040
it is because you can hear me like

3282
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,400
hitting the table

3283
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,400
it is to on this channel but if we were

3284
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,760
actually like able to access the

3285
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:24,719
multi-channels

3286
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:26,480
you know i'm not sure is time travel

3287
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:27,920
possible yeah you're going to have to

3288
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:28,639
partition

3289
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:30,800
awareness not partition the brain

3290
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:32,159
because you would be very sick and i

3291
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:33,760
don't want to lose you

3292
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:36,000
um you cannot you know but try to think

3293
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:36,800
of why

3294
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,480
this whole interface and why in body

3295
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:41,440
cognition is here for one channel

3296
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,440
like can we actually have a multi and

3297
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:44,480
that's what i was saying can we actually

3298
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,600
have like a three

3299
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,920
embodied cognition you know what do you

3300
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:49,119
think about time travel dan or any of

3301
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:51,040
that sorry if that was too wild everyone

3302
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:53,520
but i'm getting excited you know

3303
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:57,040
good question um i have

3304
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:58,960
i've heard a few different ways it could

3305
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,080
happen

3306
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:03,360
yeah and i uh would love to see

3307
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:06,320
evidence it could yeah evidence it could

3308
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,159
and that's why you know you can look to

3309
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:10,639
um so you know as free as i am in the

3310
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:12,159
math space and i'm open

3311
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:13,760
and i want to travel because i want you

3312
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,400
know humans to like succeed and you know

3313
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:16,800
uh

3314
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,639
yeah i want or i want organic life to

3315
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:20,800
continue i'm very worried about that

3316
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,480
so whatever we can do let's let's try to

3317
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:23,920
keep it going um

3318
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,560
and then uh you know something to help

3319
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,400
the questioner also is like

3320
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:29,920
this great work it'll be coming out soon

3321
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,440
by lebanon fields about

3322
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,440
you know um decoherence is actually

3323
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,040
localized to intercompartmental

3324
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:35,840
boundaries

3325
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:39,440
right where is it not okay so if the

3326
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,119
internal bulk states of daughter cells

3327
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:42,719
may remain entangled

3328
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:44,480
for macroscopic times following cell

3329
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,400
division so you have little pockets of

3330
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,520
time travel

3331
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,920
right if you have entanglement and so

3332
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,199
there is like hope

3333
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:52,480
if there is entanglement in the

3334
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,800
biological setting um again most people

3335
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:56,400
may think their work is like you know to

3336
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:57,679
future thinking or whatever but i'm

3337
01:41:57,679 --> 01:41:58,719
super future thinking

3338
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:01,520
let's try to figure this out you know um

3339
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:02,960
lots of ramifications

3340
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,320
you know this theory of extended mind

3341
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:05,920
this philosophy theory i thought was

3342
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:06,560
actually like

3343
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:09,440
really great andy clark right um you

3344
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,520
know if you're operating through time

3345
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,360
as these series of dots you're going to

3346
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,199
have something called a singular support

3347
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:17,520
you've got i i'm really curious how you

3348
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:19,600
remember a memory

3349
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,760
right so again if the whole point of

3350
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:23,520
shared action is to get these

3351
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:26,560
morphisms between morphisms um you know

3352
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,239
when the questions are asked is it

3353
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:29,760
possible that your now is a

3354
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,280
you know like a collection of other

3355
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:32,880
nouns well absolutely

3356
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,719
you're probably operating in a nested

3357
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:36,639
space right about like a

3358
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:40,639
a perturbative pro-finite um

3359
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:42,719
memory of a memory right so you start

3360
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:44,239
having these meta memories

3361
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:45,840
memory of memory and it's very

3362
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,760
interesting you're like oh i know what a

3363
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:48,719
cat looks like

3364
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:50,560
and then i see it again that is my cat

3365
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:52,639
it's very interesting how you link that

3366
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:53,920
so something as simple as object

3367
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:55,920
persistence right is actually everywhere

3368
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,520
time is not a total order

3369
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:59,360
right um and how do you actually relate

3370
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:00,960
all this stuff um

3371
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,840
great i i should probably go in about

3372
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:04,320
like

3373
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:05,760
five minutes because i have a class but

3374
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,360
i wanted to actually show

3375
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:08,800
oh i have unicorns everywhere right so

3376
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,560
there's magic i'm like how would you

3377
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,800
so the another main takeaway for the

3378
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:14,159
math take away the diamonds and the

3379
01:43:14,159 --> 01:43:15,199
sheaths and all the stuff

3380
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:17,440
is also the notion of a reciprocity law

3381
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,199
these are really beautiful reciprocity

3382
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:20,400
laws connect

3383
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:21,600
seemingly different branches of

3384
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,040
mathematics so like in the lang lens

3385
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:23,679
program

3386
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:25,679
connecting uh these certain galwa

3387
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:27,280
representations which is one branch of

3388
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:29,280
math with automorphic forms which is

3389
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:29,679
like

3390
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:32,560
you know harmonic analysis like that is

3391
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:33,199
beauty

3392
01:43:33,199 --> 01:43:34,400
right that's actually kind of

3393
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,080
synesthetic at a certain point and i

3394
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:37,360
think since i am kind of like

3395
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:38,239
synesthetic

3396
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:39,600
but i align with these sort of grand

3397
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,040
unified theories i'm like oh that feels

3398
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,960
like home like that feels right

3399
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:45,119
to be siloed like doesn't feel right

3400
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:47,040
still be individual but also

3401
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:49,040
be able to uh connect in these like

3402
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:50,480
reciprocity laws

3403
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:51,679
so how would you actually have a

3404
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:53,520
reciprocity law of emergent time

3405
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:54,880
that actually means you're able to link

3406
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,040
emergent time with newtonian time string

3407
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,080
theory time

3408
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:02,159
alveoli time the time of c of co2 and o2

3409
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:04,719
exchange right how do you actually how

3410
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:06,000
do you actually relate all those

3411
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,400
times quantum time everybody's time no

3412
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,159
time dark room time

3413
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:12,239
uh the time before existence that kind

3414
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:14,400
of like long like christ consciousness

3415
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,480
time all the times right

3416
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:18,159
that's huge and that's why i said well i

3417
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:19,440
don't know i put a big unicorn on there

3418
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,199
because it's gonna be some magic

3419
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:22,880
so it'll take some magic to actually get

3420
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,400
a lot of time but you've got great heavy

3421
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:25,920
weights trying to work on that

3422
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:28,560
um you know uh like emergent theories of

3423
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,239
time or like tricky and they're hard

3424
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:32,159
you know so if you have this like new

3425
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:33,840
reciprocity law if you actually could

3426
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,440
connect the diamonds and like

3427
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:36,960
you know i'm really everyone knows and

3428
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,639
um i'm really interested in like the

3429
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:40,000
mirror framework

3430
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,320
if mirror phenomena are actually how

3431
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:43,760
you're interacting so when people say

3432
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:45,440
well what is the now is it just your

3433
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,360
mirror system imitation and daniel i

3434
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,199
wanted to ask your community and you

3435
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,760
what is your interpretation of like if

3436
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,520
you believe in mirror neurons

3437
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:56,719
or the actual mirror system that learns

3438
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:58,080
by imitation

3439
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,920
because that's very very powerful right

3440
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:01,199
we were talking about stuff like that

3441
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:04,239
so um just wanted your thoughts on the

3442
01:45:04,239 --> 01:45:05,679
mirror framework

3443
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:07,600
and uh the mirror framework in terms of

3444
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:10,719
like these hidden states as well

3445
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:14,000
it's a great question i'd be curious to

3446
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:14,480
know

3447
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:17,360
what a different hypotheses the mirror

3448
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:18,239
neuron

3449
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:19,760
helps us get at what different

3450
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,119
observations in the world we could

3451
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:23,040
actually test for example does somebody

3452
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:23,600
who's

3453
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,119
not looking but they're feeling someone

3454
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:26,800
else move maybe does that

3455
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,040
i'm just curious about it don't have the

3456
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,800
answers although in general i'd say

3457
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,960
adding an adjective like oh it's the

3458
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:34,719
jennifer aniston neuron it's the mirror

3459
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:35,280
neuron

3460
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:38,480
it's like okay but that's a reductionist

3461
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:38,880
take

3462
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:41,600
because it's labeling the neuron so if

3463
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,360
it turns out that we have a dynamic

3464
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:44,639
distributed function

3465
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:47,199
in our brain that does have action

3466
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:48,159
models of

3467
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:50,080
ourself as well as action models of

3468
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,920
others and maybe there are some firing

3469
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,280
patterns that are overlapping but

3470
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,719
there's probably some action patterns

3471
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,159
only if you're watching someone else

3472
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:58,320
and only if you're moving or every other

3473
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,000
combination so i just think

3474
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,880
it's one of the facets of the brain

3475
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,600
diamonds

3476
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:06,719
and it's not um the whole picture

3477
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:09,119
i like that yeah seeing once again right

3478
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:10,480
even like even having this

3479
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,239
very strange like little piece that's

3480
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:14,080
this mirror thing i just know i was

3481
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,600
watching um

3482
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:18,159
uh someone um you know like another

3483
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:20,000
heavyweight give this talk about this

3484
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,280
and the sort of the phantom limb

3485
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:22,960
syndrome and stuff like that right if

3486
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,400
your limb is lost and

3487
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,080
someone else is maybe like you know

3488
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:27,920
touching the same limb that you lost you

3489
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:29,360
sort of feel that

3490
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:30,800
and there's like and these people aren't

3491
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,480
even kind of empath

3492
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:34,480
like like me you know they're not like

3493
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,000
me coming up and stuff like this

3494
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,760
they're like you know less hyperbolic i

3495
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:39,280
would say but um

3496
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:41,760
they so uh it was interesting the

3497
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:43,840
neurologist i was actually happy to hear

3498
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,639
him kind of go

3499
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:47,600
do a shared action kind of thing said uh

3500
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:48,880
you know it seems that the only thing

3501
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:51,040
that separates us is the skin

3502
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,639
because if i can feel what you can feel

3503
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:54,400
you can feel what i can feel everything

3504
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:55,520
is imitation

3505
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,360
then it seems to be like this skin

3506
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:59,360
boundary and then again boundaries are

3507
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:02,320
pro finite not ontic right so you know

3508
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:03,520
that had me perplexed

3509
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:05,679
so i appreciate your answer there yeah

3510
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:06,719
um okay

3511
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:09,440
i think i've already talked about most

3512
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,080
of this

3513
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,480
the topological localization so when i

3514
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:13,920
said you know you can put a

3515
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:15,840
you know a topology i said you could put

3516
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,119
a sheath on a category

3517
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:19,360
well everyone should also think how you

3518
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,040
actually could put a topology on an

3519
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:22,159
infinite one category

3520
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:23,520
so i'm working on something like that

3521
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,199
that's actually really tricky you have

3522
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:27,280
to figure out what the open sets are

3523
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:28,960
in an infinite category with infinite

3524
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:30,560
morphisms you know

3525
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,480
so this sort of condensed framework that

3526
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:33,840
i was talking about

3527
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:35,920
um i'll wrap up with this so you have

3528
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:37,600
this notion i said the condensed

3529
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,000
framework was a sheaf over a point

3530
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
so if we talk about a site so remember i

3531
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,440
told you the site is a place where you

3532
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:44,960
can actually put a topology

3533
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:47,040
so we called um peter and dustin call

3534
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,520
this the pro-tell site of a point

3535
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:52,239
is the category of pro finite sets s

3536
01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:54,320
with finite jointly subjective families

3537
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,159
of maps as covers

3538
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:59,280
a condensed set it's a sheaf of sets on

3539
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,480
this site

3540
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,800
so on this site right so it's a sheath

3541
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:03,600
of sets

3542
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:06,800
over a point but on the point is the

3543
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:08,080
category

3544
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:10,480
of pro finite sets so you already have

3545
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:11,440
that kind of

3546
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:14,400
multi scale in this sort of point so you

3547
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,920
do have sheaves over a point

3548
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:17,840
but the point has the site of profinite

3549
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:19,679
sets so you can do this to condensed

3550
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:20,239
ring

3551
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:21,840
if this this is all about trying to do

3552
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:23,040
the same algebra mathematics you've

3553
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:23,920
always done

3554
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:27,040
but when your objects actually carry

3555
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:29,920
a topology that's what's interesting all

3556
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:31,119
the objects so

3557
01:48:31,119 --> 01:48:33,119
reframe everything like the six tuple

3558
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:34,320
and active friends inference

3559
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,719
put a topology on it have all of your

3560
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:37,760
algebraic things

3561
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:40,159
modules groups rings carry topology how

3562
01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:41,679
do you do stuff with that

3563
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:45,040
um okay so that's fine

3564
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:46,800
that's fine the way that you can

3565
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,239
associate this

3566
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:50,159
you take t to be any topological space

3567
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:51,920
to t there was an associated condensed

3568
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:52,480
set t

3569
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:54,320
underline you saw the underline and the

3570
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:57,280
spot of qp the spa qp sub atomic

3571
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:59,199
mod uh galwa action with the underline

3572
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:00,480
that i showed you earlier

3573
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:02,639
um this is defined by sending any pro

3574
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:03,760
finite s

3575
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:07,040
to the set of continuous maps from s to

3576
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:08,800
t so that's what you're trying that's

3577
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:10,880
how you can associate to any topological

3578
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:11,920
space

3579
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:14,400
a condensed set so how beautiful is that

3580
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,000
so you can reframe if you have stuff in

3581
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,280
terms of topology

3582
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:19,040
we can bulldoze it i shouldn't say

3583
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:20,639
bulldoze that's a little extreme

3584
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:22,480
reframe it in terms of these condensed

3585
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:23,840
if you want to get this

3586
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:27,119
very interesting sort of sheaf over a

3587
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:28,000
point and then you can do

3588
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,440
like the weird thing that i was saying

3589
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:31,520
put a formal formal spectre around it to

3590
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,480
make it a little like

3591
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:35,679
a little thicker um okay so

3592
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:38,880
to actually consider this emergent time

3593
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,480
what i what i said let's consider the

3594
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,719
simplest case an event

3595
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:44,719
um you know which is like a truncated

3596
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:46,159
perturbation something like that a

3597
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:47,920
topological localization of any

3598
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,599
particular reference frame so that means

3599
01:49:49,599 --> 01:49:50,719
i'm in the now

3600
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:53,840
i am staring at my reflections whatever

3601
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:54,800
that is

3602
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:57,280
um let's take an event to be a point in

3603
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,199
the diamond topological space

3604
01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:00,960
t we're gonna actually convert this to a

3605
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,800
condensed set on that point is the pro

3606
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:03,840
it tells site

3607
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,440
uh the category for finite set so here

3608
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:08,000
we go this global time maybe emerges as

3609
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
a set of continuous maps from all pro

3610
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,239
finite sets s to t because i said the

3611
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:13,840
individual time is diamond which is pro

3612
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:14,719
finite

3613
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:16,560
so if time if global time is constructed

3614
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:19,040
as the sheaf of sets on this site

3615
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:21,440
as a condensed set right then emergent

3616
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,119
time is going to result in passing

3617
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:25,520
to the larger category of sheaves right

3618
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:26,960
so we just keep talking about sheaves on

3619
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:27,840
categories

3620
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,920
let's talk about like the larger cat

3621
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:31,599
let's just frame it all in the category

3622
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:32,320
of sheaves

3623
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:33,760
and you can consider a condensed version

3624
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:36,000
of this continuous k theory this is so

3625
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:36,560
hard

3626
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:38,400
um and it'll take me a bit to finish it

3627
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:40,000
but as soon as i make little progress i

3628
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:40,880
get excited

3629
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,719
a second way to get emergent time is to

3630
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:44,000
take those like if

3631
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,800
if if condensed time is local time let's

3632
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:47,360
take

3633
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:49,280
you know uh equivalence relations of

3634
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,360
those to get your multi-scale active

3635
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:52,080
inference again

3636
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:53,360
and you can actually take diamond

3637
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:54,800
equivalence relations to get the v

3638
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,480
stacks and already went over that

3639
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:57,920
so i made up i came up with this like

3640
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,520
dictionary between ordinary quantum

3641
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:00,880
mechanics and perfectoid quantum

3642
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:01,760
mechanics

3643
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:03,280
upgrade the hilbert space which is a

3644
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:04,880
sort of like you know complete inner

3645
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,719
product space let's make it a perfectoid

3646
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:08,960
space right the sort of strange

3647
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:11,760
uh fractal space replace you know state

3648
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:13,520
vectors with the geometric points the

3649
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:15,760
tensor product with the diamond product

3650
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:17,760
the non-locality phenomena maybe it's

3651
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,679
the profinitely many copies of spa

3652
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:22,880
c if you have that many reflections uh

3653
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,000
you don't know which one is the

3654
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,159
reference point you can uh the wave

3655
01:51:26,159 --> 01:51:27,840
function collapses this tilting the

3656
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,599
coupling behavior right holographic

3657
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:30,400
principle

3658
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:32,159
uh quantum topology replace it with the

3659
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:34,080
satellite of diamonds

3660
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:35,599
take your operator algebra replace it

3661
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:37,280
with a non-ethereum complete evaluation

3662
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:38,000
ring

3663
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,199
um uh unitarity pro

3664
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:43,760
telescent datum or that diamond descent

3665
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:44,719
that's great

3666
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:47,440
okay so i will end there and say thank

3667
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:48,000
you

3668
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,520
so you know i'm into everyone working

3669
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:50,960
together and you see there's draft

3670
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:53,040
elephant baby unicorn unicorns everyone

3671
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:54,400
is working together here and there's

3672
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:55,199
some like

3673
01:51:55,199 --> 01:51:57,440
zero sharp on the board and the spot of

3674
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:00,159
qp diamond

3675
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:03,840
i should stop there yeah and take other

3676
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,239
questions yeah

3677
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:08,480
we'll let you head off to your class in

3678
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:10,320
just a minute but this was

3679
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,560
very thought-provoking and interesting

3680
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:15,280
so i hope that um

3681
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:17,199
people will ask you questions in the

3682
01:52:17,199 --> 01:52:18,560
meanwhile and

3683
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:21,040
then uh i'm sure there'll be more math

3684
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,960
streams in our future

3685
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:24,400
that's wonderful and then um does

3686
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:25,760
everyone have my email or guess they do

3687
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:28,320
on the um

3688
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:31,760
yeah i mean i'm yeah anyone can always

3689
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:32,560
get in touch

3690
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:35,199
with actonflab to contact a guest or if

3691
01:52:35,199 --> 01:52:36,639
you send us a link that you want us to

3692
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:38,480
put in the video description

3693
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:40,719
then we'll add that there but i think

3694
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:42,560
we're all going to uh

3695
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:46,080
go home go back hit the books and uh

3696
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:49,199
i really enjoyed doing it live

3697
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:50,880
oh youtube this was so fun and i think

3698
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,480
like maybe the next talk would be like

3699
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:52,880
uh

3700
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:54,000
it'd be fun to do these thought

3701
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,560
experiments right like what if

3702
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,880
what if the question of dark room and

3703
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,800
how we use active inference and this map

3704
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:01,599
to get out of it

3705
01:53:01,599 --> 01:53:04,639
you know i'd i'd uh suggest a event

3706
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:05,760
format where we have

3707
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:07,280
multiple different backgrounds and

3708
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,199
perspectives and then we

3709
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:11,440
give people the prompts and the thought

3710
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:12,480
questions and then we do have a

3711
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,159
spontaneous conversation about how

3712
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:15,760
different perspectives lead to different

3713
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:17,760
views on the thought questions

3714
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:21,199
oh that sounds so great okay yes

3715
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:23,040
well thank you so whoever wants to join

3716
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:24,400
whoever wants to join you're always

3717
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:24,880
welcome

3718
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,880
so thank you again and we'll see you

3719
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,000
later

3720
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,040
thank you so much
