00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,543
Hello
and welcome everyone to Active Flab.

2
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:15,348
Today is May six, 2021,
and we're really excited

3
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:19,052
to have Shawna Dobson
back for Math Stream 2.1.

4
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:21,388
This is going to be a fun discussion.

5
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:26,059
Diamond Holographic Principle
and D Square Emergent Time.

6
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:28,361
Maybe you'll teach us how to pronounce it
and what it is.

7
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:33,333
So thanks again for coming on the stream
and really looking forward to it.

8
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,201
So please take it away.

9
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:36,636
Thank you so much. Daniel.

10
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,339
I just want to say
your community is so supportive

11
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,708
and I'm so happy to be back for a second
talk.

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,079
You are all working on
some of the most profound ideas

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,748
here, and so I'm really excited.

14
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,884
And thank you for having me. Yeah.
All right.

15
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,521
So this talk, I'm
going to go a little bit into

16
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,724
the more like the diamond part
because I got some feedback

17
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,793
on one of these diamonds.
What was she talking about?

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,695
And so I was really excited
that these squares actually d

19
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,397
diamond for emergent time.

20
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:08,134
So if I I'll try to do my best
to lay all these out.

21
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,402
Please ask.

22
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,037
Like, Daniel was saying questions every,

23
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,073
you know, ten slides or something
like that.

24
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,607
I'm happy to answer it.

25
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,510
I'm also trying to concentrate

26
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,914
and weave together this sort of
kind of grand unified picture.

27
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,984
So there's some drawings in here,
and I hope that it's fun.

28
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,454
OK, so let's let's go.

29
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:29,989
I'll be talking
about the diamond holographic principle.

30
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,092
And did Diamond emerge in time?

31
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:32,759
Yeah.

32
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:37,564
OK, so the goal I sort of talked about
this last time, but not to too in detail.

33
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,667
Today, I'm actually weave together

34
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,770
this kind of new math
with active inference and let's

35
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,738
try to put it together
and all work together.

36
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:48,842
So the goal is like to take
the holographic principle, which we're

37
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,945
all aware of,

38
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,447
which was like begotten by design as

39
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,118
beautiful gage gravity duality

40
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,187
between entities that are office space
and conformal field theory.

41
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:06,359
I have an idea to sort of reinterpret
it in terms of continuous case theory

42
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,561
and something
I'm going to call pro emergence.

43
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:12,632
So a pro object is a specific object

44
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,602
kind of an category theory
that's being used everywhere.

45
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,371
And it's sort of this idea
of sewing together a bunch of

46
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,508
kind of smaller things
that are self-contained

47
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,811
to get a grand object and it's sort of
built into the very structure.

48
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,613
I thought, Oh, this is a great idea.

49
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,781
So I talked about case theory
a little bit last time,

50
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:32,952
which is this beautiful construction
by Growthand to actually look at

51
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,458
classifying very difficult objects
using Isomorphism classes of the spaces.

52
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,592
So it's like, oh,

53
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:43,496
we can tell if two spaces are equivalent
based on their equivalence relations.

54
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,001
And I thought that's a very, very, very
nice higher way of looking at things.

55
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:52,305
And there's new work by them off
talking about continuous case theory.

56
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,008
So again,
this idea of sort of sewing together

57
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,911
maybe smaller case areas
to build a bigger object.

58
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:02,215
So for this pro emergence, right,
I am fascinated by time

59
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,317
and I want us to kind of
get into it. Right.

60
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:08,488
How does active inference see these
these sort of time streams, like

61
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,558
are there little local times
with little thicknesses around them?

62
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,192
What is this?

63
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,561
So in this idea of minus pro emergence,

64
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:18,031
you have a doubly emergent time
that's emergent on two fronts.

65
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:22,001
So you have a local, singular,
condensed time

66
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,770
which is sort of the time
that we all experience

67
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,907
this very like, you know, I'm presenting
to your lovely community nine or 6 a.m.

68
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,510
This is like Shana's now, right?

69
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,744
But there's also like

70
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:35,582
you know, Alpha Centauri
now and then, Unicorn Constellation now.

71
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:35,915
Right.

72
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,651
So there's all these different nouns
and whose now is what?

73
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,055
So you have these like local,
singular time, and then you're going to

74
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,489
actually have this global.

75
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,493
What I'm going to try to push for
is a non locality in the diamonds.

76
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:53,566
So to rephrase the holographic principle
and kind of upgrading AIDS, which is

77
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,469
anti disorder space, which is the bulk
which has gravity in it.

78
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,939
I'm going to try to actually rebuild
that from the six functor formalism.

79
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:03,476
So that's what you see in this figure
with these sort of six columns

80
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:07,981
as the six operations from Peter Shull
says, a telco emoji at diamonds.

81
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,482
It's so beautiful.

82
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:14,954
So imagine building space from a functor
formalism, which is very, very specific.

83
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:15,788
And then

84
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,092
if you're going to get the

85
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,162
conformal field theory,
which has no gravity, I was thinking, OK,

86
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:26,599
so the gravity list should could be
in the finite condition of the diamond.

87
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,768
So you see I have a bunch of diamonds
kind of glued together.

88
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,572
And so maybe this gluing in the diamond
condition can kind of,

89
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,674
you know, replace the conformal
field theory.

90
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:38,378
So in this,
you can actually get a holography.

91
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,281
That's really interesting to think
what active inference thinks about

92
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,383
holography.

93
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,152
Like, what's the actual reflection?

94
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,887
What's the actual object?

95
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,223
So you can relate this to strong and weak
coupling.

96
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,126
You know, whichever theory is strong,
right?

97
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,128
Has a strong coupling,
which is like, you know, the tension

98
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,197
you know, in the interaction terms.

99
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,999
And so you can relate,

100
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,702
you know, whichever one

101
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,404
has maybe a weaker coupling,

102
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,205
you normally use
like a perturbation theory

103
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,641
the stronger coupling, you have to use
a non perturbation methods.

104
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,910
So it's very physics oriented.

105
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,713
And, you know, the beauty
and the duality is that

106
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,715
if one space is too hard,
you go to the other space.

107
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,849
So this is really fun.

108
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,253
And this is isn't the
I sort of have this grand opus paper,

109
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,189
the top 21, you're like
she refers to it all the time.

110
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,458
Yeah. OK, so the goal. Right.

111
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,426
So I said you're going to have

112
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:30,630
this pro emergent thing which is like
has multiple emergent times going on this

113
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,333
not just emergent time,
but I think they're all over the place.

114
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,669
So in that is what I'm going to call
stack time.

115
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,606
So Stack is going to be
this particular object

116
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:45,678
that takes values and categories,
not just so we're not looking at like

117
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,948
the set of continuous functions,
but maybe you're looking at the category

118
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,651
of continuous functions.

119
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,387
And every object in the category
is a continuous function.

120
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:57,323
So you're getting this sort of grand
unified view

121
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,027
of of objects,
which is really, really neat.

122
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:05,198
I say V because it's it's going to be
a stack with a V topology on it.

123
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,334
I think I spoke
last time that you can actually put

124
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,237
a topology on categories,
and that's what I'm really interested in.

125
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:15,541
So the ecology is Peter
Shull says topology that he's

126
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:19,679
using for the diamonds and it's, it's
a nice fine topology.

127
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,481
And I'll go into it in a little bit.

128
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:25,151
So the big questions that are driving
some kind of wild diagram

129
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,719
that I have here
in the middle of this con

130
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,589
diamond is like,
what is the mathematics of simultaneity?

131
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:33,226
So I'm really interested in what we mean
by simultaneity.

132
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,529
And we say
two events happen at the same time.

133
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,297
What time is that?

134
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,433
And is there a difference?

135
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:44,370
And what is the difference
between simultaneity and non locality?

136
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,538
Not locality.

137
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,573
You know,
you have spatial known locality,

138
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,642
maybe the view
from a pair of entangled photons.

139
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,213
And then what does temporal not locality
mean that time is actually everywhere,

140
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,250
that there is no difference in time
between events.

141
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:57,550
Right.

142
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,184
You have events

143
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:02,088
that are maybe spread out into space,
but maybe they happen at the same time.

144
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,423
So I'm really interested

145
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,093
and what kind of mathematics would be
able to hold something like that?

146
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:07,493
Right.

147
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,530
Maybe you have a bunch of multiplicities
going on, but they're all at once.

148
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,435
So, you know, I'm asking what is embodied
cognition in non locality?

149
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,636
How could you actually

150
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,839
reframe one of the fundamental tenants
of like active inference

151
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,142
based on like reframe it

152
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,412
a non locality, not a progression, but
what would actually happen all at once?

153
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:27,947
So this is where I think

154
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,617
the mathematics would actually help,
like infinity categories

155
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,486
in this double emergence
that I'm talking about.

156
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,521
So I talked about infinity categories
last time.

157
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:39,625
These are categories that have a lot
of a lot of rich structure in them.

158
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:44,230
And you're able to create more isms
between morph isms and between morph isms

159
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,266
all the way up to Infinity Morph isms,
which is really, really beautiful.

160
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,403
So maybe the claim, maybe it's
kind of a wild claim

161
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,406
is that embody cognition like is emergent
time.

162
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,173
Right.

163
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:57,577
So what am I going to, you know,
hopefully that's something that can

164
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,280
I can kind of show throughout these
slides, embody cognition like is

165
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,149
emergent time.

166
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,118
So again, the basis behind emergent
time is was it always here?

167
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,621
I don't
I don't know, was time always here?

168
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,823
Who knows?
And that's what I'm kind of after.

169
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,992
So in this diagram,
you see I have this spot of Q,

170
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,994
which is the added spectrum
I'm going to go into.

171
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:19,398
On the other side, you have Spark Up,
which is the attic spectrum of the attic,

172
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,701
the diamond interpretation
with the little diamond on top

173
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,037
You've got these two factorization
matches expose

174
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:28,274
from Fargo's work on his geometry ization
of the local England.

175
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,110
So heavy math in this,
which is really beautiful.

176
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,779
On the bottom. You've got this y diamond.

177
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,981
See, these are

178
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,118
this is called the diamond interpretation
of the dark fontane curve.

179
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,989
This is an attic curve that has an actual
for bonus action on it.

180
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,091
And so this curve is very important.

181
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,560
It's used in the landlords program,
which is the, you know,

182
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,696
the top a grand
unified theory of mathematics right now.

183
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,299
So then you have these Elon maps
that are mapping up

184
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,403
whatever openings
into what I call condensed diamond.

185
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,140
So the condensed category is Peter
Charles's construction about

186
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,543
category of condensed objects.
And I go into those.

187
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,178
It's a beautiful idea
about sheaves over points.

188
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,081
So anybody in the crowd here
knows what a sheaf is.

189
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:12,318
It's like a awesome topological way
of keeping track of local data,

190
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,754
local data, local data, local data,
like a little bag.

191
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:19,559
And so, like,
normally you have sheaves over

192
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,995
spaces, but here is an actual sheaf
over a singular point.

193
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,630
And so he's he and

194
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,467
Dustin Wilson have
been like putting together this really

195
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,370
awesome lecture notes on this topic.

196
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,573
So it's great. It's in its infancy
and I think it's great.

197
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,209
So that diamond is a conjecture of mine.

198
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,278
But you take the diamond
I talked about last time

199
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,114
and you can actually extend it
to the infinity category of diamond.

200
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,850
So I call that do
diamond lot of stuff in that diagram.

201
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,587
But this is what I think
is actually the esthetic

202
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:51,824
because you know what
if we could actually map this to like,

203
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,860
you know, a string
theoretic interpretation or something,

204
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,896
then you get the Grand Unified
Theory of math and physics.

205
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,733
OK, so

206
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,102
let me open that just a little bit.

207
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,606
So if you take let's see, be
the category of diamonds, let condensed C

208
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:11,043
be the category of condensed objects
and see objects are condensed diamonds.

209
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,878
All right. That's what's in there.

210
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,048
Let are be the reflective,
full subcategory of condensate.

211
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,516
This is a subcategory.

212
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,252
We're all objects
and are actually reflections

213
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,856
of objects in the bigger category.

214
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:24,690
So it's very neat.

215
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,059
You have diamonds
and they're reflections.

216
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,894
So objects in our reflections.

217
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:29,929
So if you take the diamond to be,

218
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,733
then if any one category of diamonds,
you can extend this to Candy Diamond.

219
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:37,203
It's a condensed diamond
and you get the sexual object.

220
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,507
So following precedent, from Fargo's
amazing work, the fiber product of this

221
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,809
diagram has claimed a modular space
and a diamond.

222
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,077
That's very hard.

223
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,713
All right. So that's that's hard.

224
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:49,849
So modular.

225
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,684
I ve stacked time.

226
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:55,755
So let's take this condensed diamond
and just up it just a little bit.

227
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,924
So I have this other conjecture right?

228
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,326
Let's take.

229
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,763
So the way that you get these diamonds,
I don't have to figure out.

230
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,965
I have a figure of a diamond very,
very soon.

231
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:09,035
The way you get the diamond
is by taking equivalence classes.

232
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:13,105
Certain protocol equivalence
classes of these

233
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:16,108
objects called perfected spaces,
which are like Perkovich Space.

234
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,077
It's kind of like cancer objects.

235
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,312
And so you through those together
and you get a diamond.

236
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,715
Well, why don't we glue diamonds together
and get something else?

237
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:23,983
So you can do that.

238
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:27,620
So if you can take diamond equivalence
relations of this

239
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,990
diamond curve, then you can get a stack
and the V topology.

240
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,826
And why don't we work
in the modular space of B stack?

241
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:37,730
So modulus space is this awesome
parameter space where each point

242
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,100
represents
an isomorphism class of objects.

243
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:45,004
So you're looking at so each point,
like in this little figure below

244
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,441
is an Isomorphism class.

245
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:53,846
And so the question is like, you know,
how do you move in a diagram like that?

246
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,681
Is it a chessboard? Is it.

247
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,883
Can I only move this way and this way
and this way?

248
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,553
So I'm really interested in
like what it means phenomena

249
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,223
logically to have something like this
and to start in the upper left,

250
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,326
like dot and jump to the
like the bottom right dot.

251
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,962
So how do you actually move
through this thing?

252
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,665
So I'm thinking that
every point of that modulo space

253
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:16,435
would actually be an incarnation
of the condensed new diamond diagram.

254
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,538
So that that huge factorization
with these maps

255
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,742
would actually be at each point.

256
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,410
And I think that's actually
really beautiful.

257
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,012
So that's the type of like grand
unified theory I'm kind of thinking of.

258
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:28,948
Yeah.

259
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:33,285
So these Elon maps play a dual role of
what's called topological localization.

260
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:37,022
Localization is a beautiful phenomena,
a beautiful way of actually

261
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,227
constructing equivalencies between

262
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,728
between objects.

263
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:47,133
And so topological localization passes
through this reflective subcategory.

264
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,703
So objects are being sort of stared
at by their reflections.

265
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,738
And it's a way of getting more
equivalencies and maps.

266
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,241
So I'll just leave it at that.

267
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:58,010
So this pro terminology,
this is a little mathy, but I thought,

268
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,545
you know, we're let's do it.

269
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,914
I'm not going to go super mathy,
but I wanted to give you enough terms

270
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,783
so, you know,
like what I'm talking about.

271
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,651
So for this pro

272
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,788
which I think is very cool,
the idea is that emergence is built

273
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:13,392
into the very space as a pro object
and not as additional counter terms.

274
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,195
I think that I can make the active
inference community does that as well.

275
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,498
You want everything
sort of built into the structure

276
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,501
as opposed to adding these counter terms.

277
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,669
There's a lot of beautiful like form

278
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,437
and path integral work
that has all of these

279
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,640
these additional counter
terms added to it.

280
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,243
And it's like, I wish it could just
be built into the actual space.

281
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:35,581
So you can actually do that
with this pro terminology Right.

282
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:39,118
So a pro object, all this is there's
a great reference called Inkjet Lab.

283
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,653
It has all these definitions.

284
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,488
So I'm pulling all these

285
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,757
and lots of great lecture
notes on any kind of pro object

286
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:48,194
So what does a pro object, a pro
object of a category C is a form

287
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,063
of cocoa, filtered limit of objects of C.

288
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,000
So basically, roughly
what we mean by this code filtered limit

289
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,871
is that for every two objects, C, one,
C, two, and C, you have a third object,

290
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,941
C three, and C,
that they both get mapped to it.

291
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,911
So it's sort of self-contained
You see, it's built into the structure.

292
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,581
You don't have to go off
and leave the category to find the limit.

293
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,016
So you have a functor

294
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,119
also.

295
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:14,653
So what you do,

296
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,790
you take us to be a closed, symmetric,
minor middle category closed.

297
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,125
I have the definition
for both of these symmetric modal means

298
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,863
that has a tensor product
and you take C and S in rich category,

299
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,633
which means that it takes values,
the whole set of C text values and s,

300
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,002
you have this enriched form Functor,

301
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:34,206
which is written like this, C
takes in two pairs going from the product

302
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,443
of C opposite with itself
or C opposite is the same category.

303
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:42,414
The arrows are just reversed to S
that sends a pair of objects

304
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,718
and C to this hum object,
which is a collection of Morph isms.

305
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:46,752
So look at that.

306
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,922
You're actually mapping
each pair of objects

307
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:53,192
to where it can go
right to all the possible paths.

308
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,994
And I think this is very nice.

309
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:58,097
So a closed category means for any pair
cc prime of objects.

310
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,133
The collection amorphous MS
is an actual object of c,

311
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,069
so everything is inside of itself.

312
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:07,006
And it's sort of
like a categorical closure property.

313
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,875
Right? Anyone familiar
with just the closure property of

314
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:11,076
that?

315
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,178
You learn it like abstract algebra.

316
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,547
So this is called the internal hum
object.

317
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:17,082
Right.

318
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,251
So five the pro functor.

319
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,853
So with the pro terminology,

320
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:24,256
you can actually have a pro functor
which generalizes the word term functor.

321
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,059
So let's C and D both be enriched over.

322
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,428
See the pro functor from Saturday's
An S Functor.

323
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:34,433
So that's enriched with deep tensor
C over S.

324
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,802
So again,
taking the pairs and mapping them over.

325
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,240
So you can also make this into,
like I told you, this modulo space right?

326
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,209
Right here with the points
where isomorphism classes

327
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,880
are r each point
and they can vary geometrically.

328
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,882
And I'll go into what that means.

329
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,051
And you can get stacks from that.

330
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,920
So I think I'll finish the pro and
then ask if there's any questions and.

331
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,091
Just to wrap up this, OK, before you,
let's get the super sticky stuff

332
00:15:59,091 --> 00:15:59,925
out of the way.

333
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:00,592
All right.

334
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,461
So what's also beautiful

335
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:06,231
and all over the Leyland's
program is the idea of a finite group.

336
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,101
So you can see that
you can take this pro language,

337
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,837
this kind of multi gluing
and self-contained ness

338
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,939
and extend it to a finite group,
which is a top

339
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,709
a logical group
that's isomorphic to the inverse limit

340
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,411
of an inverse system of discrete
finite groups.

341
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:23,615
So this inverse limit over the discrete
finite groups is a finite groups

342
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,552
that they all have the discrete topology,
and you have a collection

343
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,621
of some amorphous
sums that satisfy nice relations

344
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:34,460
So my idea is like, OK, let's,
let's let's up the game even more.

345
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:38,931
There's a lot of work about spectra and
prime spectra, and this is also a graph

346
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,001
and where the spectrum of a ring,
I think I talked about it last time,

347
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:44,903
is a certain

348
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,638
the spectrum of varying refers is a space

349
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:50,376
where the actual points of the space
refer to prime ideals.

350
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:54,213
So again, you have this like point
referring to something higher

351
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,247
than a point.

352
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:00,386
OK, so you can extend that to what I call
a formal spectrum.

353
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:04,590
So then you have this great idea of like
including infinitesimals and things.

354
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,062
So it's not like you have a singular now,
but what if we had a singular now

355
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,365
with a little bit of infinitesimal
thickening on it, right?

356
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:17,169
Like every, every now
or every like local time of ours

357
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,504
had a little bit of thickening

358
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,873
and we could call that
an infinitesimal thickening.

359
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:25,077
And so he actually has the same idea
and he calls it formal spectra.

360
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:30,783
So we say the formal spectrum stuff
are of cumulative ring are in an ideal

361
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,184
that to be certain properties,

362
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,553
it's actually the inductive limit
of the prime spectrum.

363
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,989
So inductive limit meaning like this.

364
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,492
So the the pro refers

365
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,629
to a projective phenomena
on the end refers to an inductive.

366
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,330
So it's like a code limit.

367
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,634
So as far as the co
limit of spec are I n,

368
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,337
which is where R is complete
with the erratic

369
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,374
topology, there's various ways
of completing rings in the attic.

370
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:59,478
So we're expecting more isms
or these closed nail cogent emotions

371
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:02,381
spec our AI and immersed

372
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,950
with spec our AI and plus one.

373
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:08,220
So these are of fine schemes
and the column is taken in the category

374
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,755
of topological range spaces.

375
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,792
So what is a
what is a closed and l potent immersion?

376
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,995
So an L potent phenomena is some property
that you take an element,

377
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,131
raise it to a certain power
and eventually go to zero.

378
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,500
So it's a way of canceling out elements.

379
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,002
The Affine scheme is a ringed space.

380
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,004
It's a top, a logical space, and it has

381
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,042
a structure sheath, which is again
this kind of thickening thing.

382
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,377
So imagine a space
with a little bit of light skin on it.

383
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,414
And so I'm thinking that, OK, it's
not just a pro

384
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,584
emergence of point, it's
a pro emergence of these formal spectra

385
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,587
which are like times intervals
with little thick endings on them.

386
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,356
So no point in elephants and I say
elephant.

387
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,526
No, no golden elephants,
no button elements are

388
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,295
our infinitesimal neighborhoods.

389
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,531
And so a beautiful

390
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,167
way to complete again
to complete the ring

391
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,338
having convergence issues like settled
is to actually take at it completion.

392
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,239
So at it completion

393
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,842
is to actually have all the infinitesimal
neighborhoods at once.

394
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,644
And I think that's a grand goal.

395
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,780
And anybody after at a completion
to have all the thickening right

396
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,984
is what is probably
what we should be after.

397
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,253
Any questions on that so far?

398
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,254
Before I get to the fun,

399
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,924
just I. Yep.

400
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,960
OK. Thanks for this interesting intro.

401
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,497
I think one thing that's really going
to resonate with people

402
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:29,935
hopefully of all different backgrounds
is what you said about We want emergence

403
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:34,106
built into the base structure
of our model, not a counter term,

404
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,509
which isn't a term that's familiar to me,
but it's kind of like magic

405
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,112
shouldn't be added at the higher level.

406
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,648
We should have a model where at the base
level we have emergence.

407
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:46,518
And then you mentioned
the pairs of objects

408
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,321
and a few different
kind of pair operations like inverses.

409
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,756
And so I was just wondering

410
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:54,092
how should we think about these pairs
of objects, for example,

411
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:57,262
are they organisms in the niche
or the two organisms?

412
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,064
Because if so, then we can kind of think

413
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:02,701
every time you say pair,
we might be able to map it onto something

414
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,871
that we've talked about from the embodied
cognitive perspective.

415
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,173
Oh, I like that. Yeah, go ahead,
try that.

416
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,708
Try that.

417
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,442
You know what?

418
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,245
You could take the category sea
of organisms and then it can be

419
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,281
any two organisms in the actual category.

420
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,650
If you wanted the category to be,

421
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,987
you know, pairs of organisms
like organism Daniel,

422
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,755
the organism Shannon
or something different,

423
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,491
then you could actually
construct the category to be that.

424
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,427
That's the beauty of category theory.

425
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:33,198
You construct it to be whatever you want
because structurally the goal,

426
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,603
the goal is to get everything
built inside the actual space

427
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,872
and to have these consistency issues
that you're not like, Oh,

428
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,343
well, yeah, you know, so like

429
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:48,180
we come online
and then there's this counter term, oops.

430
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,917
So you actually have it more organism

431
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:56,455
is relating to or interacting
with like organism, right?

432
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,225
Or you can actually have a category
B, just the way that my organism

433
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:03,395
is identifying
and interpreting information

434
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,464
like whatever you want
those objects to be.

435
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,165
It's completely this.

436
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:08,734
Cool, thanks.

437
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:12,304
And I'll relay any questions
from live chat in another ten slides.

438
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,007
Yeah, all this cases so great. Yeah.

439
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,842
So we're all on the same page,

440
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,578
you know, built it,
build it into the structure, you know,

441
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,714
and if you want
the structure centered around, you know,

442
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,851
you can actually have this C three
being like the organism.

443
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:26,818
Daniel the organism.

444
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:31,023
Shana that everything maps back to me
because that's what we're doing right?

445
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,724
And everything comes back to me.

446
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,027
I'm trying to process. OK, cool.

447
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:36,928
All right. So

448
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,065
OK, this is a these,

449
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,135
these ideas might just all be wild, but
I'm glad you know, I'm here to help you.

450
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,171
All right, so now I don't know,
this is where my brain thinks.

451
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,141
OK, so we have the idea of an info
morph ism,

452
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:54,579
which is an actual pair of an adjoining
pair of functor sits on a choose space.

453
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:58,050
And my colleague, my great colleague
Chris Fields has done so much work

454
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:58,583
with that.

455
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,485
You know, Chris, the upstairs of that

456
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,688
Levon all the time,
they come up with this great stuff.

457
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,324
So an info Marxism is one pair,

458
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,959
one set of joint funders which

459
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,862
which satisfies some information.

460
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,699
My idea is to make a two
and info morph ism

461
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:17,703
from these six functor formulas.

462
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,905
So in these kind of wild equations
down here,

463
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,842
the two tails is, is a structural
property, an internal home

464
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,411
and an actual tensor product
how you actually combine things.

465
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:30,982
But the four in the middle
represent two pairs of joint functor.

466
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,952
So one set of two pairs inform our prism.

467
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:37,622
I just want to actually construct
a two and four morph ism,

468
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:41,293
which would actually be a morph
ism between morph ism.

469
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,662
So that's a categorical thing
at this point.

470
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,531
We're working on the semantics of what
that actually means right now.

471
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,300
And so bear with us.

472
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,569
That should be out very, very soon.

473
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,536
So what is this?

474
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:56,575
The idea is the incarnation of global
time emerges from dimension locality.

475
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,243
So what I just tried to say

476
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,146
local time emerges
from these singular condensed sets.

477
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:05,317
The two and four morph
ism is going to connect the global time

478
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,418
with the local time.

479
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,486
That's the whole point, right?

480
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,988
That's how your organism evolves right?

481
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:13,125
That's how you deduce
is to connect your local time

482
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,127
with what's actually happening
globally, right?

483
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,495
These cannot be singular.

484
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,230
They have to intersect at some point.

485
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,866
So if this to and fro more present
can actually do that, then

486
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,902
you can actually get this temporal
simultaneity non locality.

487
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,104
I'm still not convinced
that there is a difference

488
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,907
between simultaneity and non locality.

489
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,475
I would love it for anyone in your,

490
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,145
you know,
if anyone's like interested in that.

491
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,481
That's, that's really that's tricky
because maybe,

492
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:41,353
maybe the instance of simultaneity
is a slice of the non locality

493
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:45,991
or maybe we were actually in tune enough
with what's happening like

494
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:50,095
like embodied cognition wise or whatever
that we were actually able

495
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,864
to access for just a second.

496
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,000
Maybe the true non
locality of everything.

497
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,535
That is the normal reality
of information,

498
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,537
whatever you want to call it. What is the
difference? I don't really know.

499
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,541
People normally refer to like
special relativity and reference frames

500
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:08,613
and I have a couple of questions about
what reference frames are so any time.

501
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:13,084
You know I, I think I'm going to tackle
a new subject, I invent a new dictionary.

502
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:14,853
I'm like,
OK, let's start with a dictionary

503
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,022
to actually translate
what I'm talking about.

504
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:22,327
OK, so the notion of a site in category
theory is where I can put it topology.

505
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:23,462
So I'm thinking

506
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:27,032
if I'm, you know, for instance,
looking at the site of an organism,

507
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:30,001
you know, investigating its environment,
something like this, the site of Shana,

508
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,940
that could and that's a categorical,
categorical way of actually

509
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,877
referring to the localization phenomena
in the collapse.

510
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:39,611
Right.

511
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,379
So quantum
mechanics is saying you go from,

512
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:44,082
you know, the collapse of the way
function is great.

513
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:48,320
I go from a simultaneous like
superposition state to like a localized.

514
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,324
Now, of course, there's,
you know, controversy about the collapse

515
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,258
and things like that.

516
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,960
That's
why I'm using the word localization.

517
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,531
You localize in the now
so coupling perturbation, right?

518
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,266
So again,
strong coupling, you have to use these,

519
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,834
these

520
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,770
non preservative methods we coupling,
you can use perturbation

521
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,740
there's a I think there's a link
between perturbation and this.

522
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,009
It's stuff that I've been looking at.

523
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:15,480
So there's a way called called tilting
to go from characteristic zero

524
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,850
if people are familiar with that
to characteristic P, you can also add

525
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,488
these beautiful objects called
P divisible formal group laws which are

526
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,126
once again I would say ways of connecting
like groups.

527
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,830
The kernels of these actual maps
are repeated the in torsion.

528
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,967
So the torsion element
actually annihilates any other element.

529
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:39,571
So an element is torsion if it actually
is annihilated by another element.

530
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:40,772
So you continue to have these P

531
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,408
to the N sort of phenomena
that are canceling terms.

532
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,111
So the whole idea is
that you can get this cancelation

533
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:50,515
and sort of a sequence phenomena
also in perfect spaces.

534
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,452
So there's also torsion in these objects
called shimmer varieties,

535
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:55,387
which we'll talk about later.

536
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,757
That's in the language is conjecture,
strong coupling, maybe it's strong,

537
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,927
you know, maybe in the diamond
we could say strong

538
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,095
coupling is in the diamond side
of the holography.

539
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,965
Because there's many incarnations
of these covers.

540
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:07,632
False.

541
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,334
And I'll go into this little bit later

542
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:12,203
just trying to put the ideas up
front week coupling, right?

543
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:15,974
So maybe you can do perturbation
phenomena in the condensed setting

544
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:21,012
in the interior, you know, so maybe
that's in the singular perfect wait time.

545
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,181
It's weak because it's condensed.

546
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:27,018
Maybe it's easier to work with protocol
covers than in the condensed setting.

547
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,721
So it make you work in the conformal
field theory, which is the diamonds.

548
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,824
So the whole relation
to the diamond holography is that

549
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,360
if you have these six operating zones
right in the bulk,

550
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:39,297
then you're going to have to go
from the bulk to the conformal field.

551
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:42,667
So maybe the inside is
the six operations, you know,

552
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,005
whichever one you
want to call strong and weak coupling.

553
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,340
So what do I what do I need to finish?

554
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,075
Well, you need to like I need to actually

555
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,577
take the six operations
and put them in the condensed setting

556
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,081
and then link the diamond
for finite conditions with non locality.

557
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:59,184
So you get what's called diamond descent.

558
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:00,151
Descent is

559
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:04,255
another way, like Daniel was saying,
about keeping the system contained.

560
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:08,226
The center is a way of actually
making sure that the covering spaces

561
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,829
can can reconstruct the lower space.

562
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,365
So my local space is actually constructed

563
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:16,334
from my globe,
my global space, and vice versa.

564
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,603
This is another way
of keeping the structure

565
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,839
built inside the actual space.

566
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,843
OK, and we'll talk about Diamond
Localization, which is going to be a way

567
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,312
to make relations
between the various diamonds.

568
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:28,680
All right.

569
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,782
So, well, let's try to link this. Right?

570
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,050
So we're call and info morphs some.

571
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,953
It's an add joint pair structure
preserving maps for a choose space.

572
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,989
The beauty about two spaces that's
got a very, very nice construction.

573
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,126
Categorically the true construction
build builds what's called

574
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:44,329
a star autonomous category
this is a mineral category.

575
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,631
It has a tensor product in then
to help you move

576
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,268
objects around
where all objects have duals.

577
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:51,269
Right.

578
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,505
So I thought this might be interesting
for my body cognition

579
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,440
because maybe you're looking around
at your reflection

580
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,575
and learning off
of your reflection. Right?

581
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,078
And where are these reflections?
Everywhere.

582
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:03,181
So if all objects have doors, that's
a very strong property for a category,

583
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,384
which is where there's a lot of type
theory and stuff that works in the space.

584
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:09,654
So you also have a category
five for business algebra.

585
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:12,023
This is an associative algebra
with a linear form on it.

586
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,560
I told you for business
was even in the language, right?

587
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,664
So forgiveness is powerful in body
cognition, everything is related, right?

588
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:21,032
So you want everything to be related.

589
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,536
So what if what if everything was a star
autonomous category?

590
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:27,405
So I think the true construction
is actually very pertinent here.

591
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:31,509
So if the hidden states,
what if those are like a pro finite

592
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:35,413
condition or a pro object
that maybe just only become

593
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,751
visible upon a certain pullback?

594
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,586
So in the diamond construction
that I gave you,

595
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,789
it said those those geometric points
were mathematical impurities.

596
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:44,956
Yeah.

597
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:49,227
That they were not invisible unless
you pulled them back over these covers.

598
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:52,197
There's once again a lot of work

599
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:55,767
about neurology, acting topological,

600
00:28:55,934 --> 00:29:00,004
meaning that your proprioception
is gotten by these topological covers

601
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,341
where portions of the mind
or the brain are actually

602
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:06,511
working together.

603
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,647
And we're where we're portioned
sort of intersect and overlap.

604
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:13,618
That's that's a covering phenomena
and that's how you actually deduce

605
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:14,786
and things like this.

606
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:15,854
So shared action.

607
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:19,390
OK, OK, so if we were for after shared
action, you know what?

608
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:23,394
If we start looking at relations
between relations,

609
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,396
that's where the shared action is.

610
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,098
We want to think collectively. Yeah.

611
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:32,036
In the face of uncertainty,
if we start thinking in the framework

612
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:35,840
of two morph ism,
then you're already in the global space.

613
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,442
And I think there's nothing more shared

614
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,145
than working in the relation
of the relation space.

615
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,679
Instead of being so siloed,

616
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,715
you can be siloed
in your own localization,

617
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,618
but that's not going to help
for shared action to actually.

618
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:50,355
So if everyone can get a hold
of everyone else to morph isms, you know,

619
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:51,489
what does that mean?

620
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:54,592
And that means they're actually
all intersecting and interacting.

621
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:59,063
You can take that and go to in awareness,
which is what my awesome colleague

622
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,633
Robert Putnam
and I've been working on as well

623
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,369
that, you know, I'm
not sure I think I said that last time,

624
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,105
that I do not believe that
there's only one channel here. Right.

625
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:11,176
I feel like through shared action
you could access

626
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,711
more of these sort of consciousness
channels.

627
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:18,149
And so that in awareness
is actually a categorical phenomenon

628
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,651
that I can show here.

629
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,719
So I think I showed this last time,
but I'll just show it again.

630
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:25,156
So on the left,
you have a basic depiction of a category.

631
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,526
This one right here,
my little mouse is not working.

632
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:29,761
All right. So the one on the left,

633
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,898
top row left.

634
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,967
So you have

635
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:39,971
to two objects here and B F1
and you want to work Ism's.

636
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:40,305
Right?

637
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:45,210
You have two objects, Sandy, F
two and G2 or those are Morph isms.

638
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,011
We'll call them one Morph isms.

639
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,780
Let's go to the category in the middle.

640
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,849
So category middle is a two category.

641
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,117
Oh, and I'm sorry, the category on
the left is a one category.

642
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,053
So if you go to a two category
in the middle,

643
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:59,090
you have the same objects, ABCD
and the same 11 more pheasants.

644
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,292
But look at these wild maps on the side.

645
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:04,796
So your mapping look,
look what we're mapping on the left.

646
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,932
You're mapping
the morph ism f one to G to buy that map.

647
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:11,569
See and then you're also by gamma,
you're mapping a

648
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,272
G G one to F two.

649
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:15,874
So this is awesome.

650
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,308
So look what we're doing there.

651
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,744
Now you're mapping the Morph isms
between the Morph isms

652
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:22,046
and this is where I think shared
action lives.

653
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,848
You can go even wilder
because you know, it's me.

654
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,385
So the third, the third cat,

655
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:31,289
you can have a three category,
which is the top right piece.

656
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:32,957
And look at that.

657
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,260
A three category consists of objects.

658
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,862
One morph isms between the objects

659
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,999
to morph, isms
between the one morph isms.

660
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:45,069
And then look at the three morph ism
you have going on the big double bar,

661
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:49,107
triple bar, horizontal bar
that's connecting fee and gamma.

662
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,241
They're rising.

663
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,910
So you see you can just keep going.

664
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,178
And why not? That's for a collection.

665
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,179
Yeah, go ahead.

666
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,482
I just wanted to give one little thought
on this.

667
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:01,286
It's almost like,
yes, let's say ABCD people and then yes,

668
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:05,957
the two mapping
is kind of like best friends or marriage.

669
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:07,859
It's like two people who are married.

670
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:12,864
There's some parallelism between couples
of married people and then the three is

671
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:16,267
like the mapping between marriage
and being a best friends.

672
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:20,672
And so it's like saying the relationship
between person A and B in the marriage

673
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:24,442
is like the relationship between A
and B in the best friend relationship.

674
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:29,380
So it's like we can put the relationship
and almost objectify it,

675
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:34,152
but not in a demeaning way,
just in a containing formal way,

676
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,622
and then use that to build
higher order relationships.

677
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,757
So this is like very interesting.

678
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,126
Look at that. Yeah, you say it.

679
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,861
I should just give you
my slides and you present.

680
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,799
It's a co it's a co presentation

681
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,804
and we as an as a dyad are interacting
with the material

682
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,407
you've prepared as well as any questions
that anyone else brings out.

683
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:57,709
And so does everyone see.

684
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:00,345
So like collectively.
Oh, that makes me excited.

685
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,580
So collectively, like even
this interaction

686
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,082
is like a three morph ism right now.

687
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,551
And so that's actually really cool.

688
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:07,952
And you see

689
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,455
I like it. Yeah.

690
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:15,026
The with like marriage maybe, you know,
maybe if you stayed in the one category,

691
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,428
you would have just been friends
and you would have never actually tried

692
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,497
the other relationship
or the other relationship.

693
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,467
Or you can go like, you know, twin planes
and all this kind of stuff.

694
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,569
And so it's actually really exciting.

695
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:28,039
And so you can see just like Daniel
saying that's shared action

696
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,042
and let's like
let's take shared action to infinity

697
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,910
and then what
a beautiful place this would be.

698
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,178
You know, you kind of have like,

699
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,115
you know, the people like me that are,
you know, related to animals, too.

700
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,316
So it'd be like, oh, OK.

701
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:41,352
So then you have the Morpheus in between
like the fade away with the animals

702
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,956
talking to like the humans and then
like oceans and things like that.

703
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,257
And then you might start

704
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:50,061
relating on the higher
like higher connection level, right?

705
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,730
Not hierarchical,
but like a higher connection level.

706
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,100
And so you can see that Robert
and I, we're trying to think, OK,

707
00:33:56,534 --> 00:34:01,372
let's, let's get weird and like take,
you know, the one level of awareness

708
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,308
which is like, you know, Daniel
and I co presenting here because he's

709
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,344
says my slides better than me.

710
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,913
So that's the co presentation right?

711
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,815
Is maybe like a one awareness.

712
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,884
OK, and then two awareness.

713
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,986
Let's, let's just bump
this up a little bit

714
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,221
would be that,
you know, he and I are presenting here

715
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:21,659
and then simultaneously like
we're both Cambridge apostles.

716
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:23,027
What.

717
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,930
Yes, that's the level
that I'm willing to go. Right.

718
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,733
Because if time is not local,
which I sort of think it is

719
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,536
why can't we map to it
using these Morph isms?

720
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:31,736
Right.

721
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:32,804
Of course we'd have to do

722
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,740
some kind of partition in the brain
or whatever, but we'll get to that later.

723
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:39,744
But that's what
we're saying about this nested hierarchy.

724
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,681
So use the same everything that Daniel
saying about the categories, right?

725
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:46,851
One, Category two, category
three category and bump it to

726
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,787
like awareness,
meaning actual interaction.

727
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:52,890
Like let's take in body cognition
and bump it like what would a

728
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,493
two embodied cognition be?
A three embodied?

729
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:56,961
And let's keep going up

730
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,864
because that would require higher,
higher levels of this awareness.

731
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:00,832
The statue thing.

732
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:01,499
And again,

733
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:05,536
the bit about this is that, look,
we didn't add some counter term, right?

734
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,306
We didn't just add, you know,
the whole thing is magic.

735
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:11,642
Of course, and, you know, I love magic,
but we didn't just add it out of nowhere.

736
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:15,413
This was like built into the
actual structure, which I think is cool.

737
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,080
So again, most people

738
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,850
maybe intimidated by Category
three or whatever at the first,

739
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,152
but it's like I think there's a payoff.

740
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,920
It's like let's
let's put a little bit of work

741
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,089
into that structure
and then you can make this esthetic.

742
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:27,458
And it actually I think it helps,
you know,

743
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,496
so just an overview real quick,
I'm going to try to talk about this,

744
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:32,029
you know,

745
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:34,532
this emergent time
a little better and a concomitant theory

746
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,201
of condensed types, which are supposedly
this supposed to be immediate

747
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,804
from the recently introduced
diamond holographic principle.

748
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,806
You've seen me already
kind of introduce that.

749
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,475
So if you're connecting this
beautiful mathematical grand unified

750
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:49,347
theory of geometry as local language
in the stack language with emergent time,

751
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,716
that would be a new incarnation
of a new reciprocity law.

752
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:55,553
You see, I'm using the word incarnation
to refer to diamonds and reflections.

753
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:56,154
Yeah.

754
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,655
And also choose faces.

755
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,924
And for Morpheus, I'm star autonomous.

756
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,827
All of this star
autonomous objects, having doors,

757
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,063
reflections, reflective subcategories,
pro finite condition.

758
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:09,600
It's all about the mirror phenomena,
which is in embodied cognition, I think.

759
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:13,237
Of course, there's problems everywhere,
which is why I'm excited about this.

760
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,339
Right? Problems everywhere.

761
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,708
You know, you can talk about
a theory of emergent time.

762
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:18,609
How do you measure that?

763
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,046
How do you actually measure time
without constructing it?

764
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,982
And that that is like, that's huge.

765
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:25,883
That'll stump me.

766
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,885
You know, I talk fast. I'm like,
wait, wait.

767
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,522
So how do you how do you measure
a double emergent something?

768
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,458
It's crazy as I'm talking about,
how do you measure a pro emergence?

769
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:37,428
How do you measure like, you know,
if you want to do this categorical

770
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:41,332
construction, like we're doing
a two emergence, a three emergence,

771
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,268
I don't know.
And that's what I hope, too.

772
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:46,304
So we can all work together,
figure this out.

773
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,206
How do you actually measure emergence?

774
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,708
It's like, do you collapse the margins?
Are you too late?

775
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:55,079
If you measure it too early, is it
a partial emergence and you've missed it?

776
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,982
If we sneeze do we miss it? Is it fast?

777
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:02,820
You know, so our model gains levels
of non locality, levels of non locality.

778
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,991
And I'm just saying like, you know, there
exists a spatial among locality no.

779
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,393
If you can put them together
in that formal spectra,

780
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,662
what if you had levels of non
locality everywhere?

781
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:12,964
And that's sort of what I'm into.

782
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,866
So I call it like a stacking on locality
and stack ification.

783
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:19,804
I think stack ification is a word like
spaghetti ification and it does exist.

784
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,406
I may have misspelled it. Sorry.

785
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:22,707
All right.

786
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,508
So you can do local this.

787
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:27,712
You know,
I'm interested one of your awesome

788
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,549
members of the community was asking me
about like, what are you talking about?

789
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:32,583
This local global

790
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:36,187
meaning like the local singular
now is like where I'm existing now.

791
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,088
And then of course, you know,

792
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,725
you have your unicorns Constellation Time
on this Eros and all this other stuff.

793
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:44,729
So that's when there's a play here
between taking in information

794
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,564
and then like existing and stuff.

795
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,232
So you can do this by this time
and again,

796
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,034
I told you this gluing
and that's gonna be an infinite

797
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,236
one version of spatial V descent,
which is up here.

798
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,572
So this is work diamond localization.

799
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:57,975
So what's already neat is that once again
I talked about the emergence

800
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:01,345
is built into the structure,
this localization, those L maps

801
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,882
in the reflective subcategory,
it's already a descent condition.

802
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:09,153
Whoa, so let's use these beautiful
theorems, right?

803
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,390
And actually use them for phenomenology,
for phenomenology.

804
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,659
And so that's already a descent
condition.

805
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,861
So we're on our way you know,

806
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:20,231
so the goal is to actually link
like strong and weak coupling.

807
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,632
How do you actually construct

808
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,902
this diamond non locality
for a temporal multiplicity?

809
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:28,773
I think that's really in tune
with embodied cognition is to have

810
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:32,610
a multiplicities
time, meaning like there is not just one,

811
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:36,480
but it's what
how could you actually model time acting

812
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:40,985
globally non locally
but also in a multiple way

813
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:44,021
and that's super French
continental philosophy at that point.

814
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,190
And you know, that's like my upbringing

815
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,392
so I'm really interested
in this phenomenon multiplicity

816
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,661
because at least
it lets the individual be

817
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:54,031
and it makes like when a body cognition
is like what I feel it is.

818
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,334
So I'll have to build
this diamond descent.

819
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,470
And then again these V stacks are going
to have to satisfy this living condition.

820
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,271
That's fine.

821
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,174
Our model is a double emergence,
but it's finite.

822
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:05,576
Many copies of emergence.
That's what strange.

823
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:08,879
I told you last time a finite set
was a totally disconnected

824
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,282
compact has high storage space.

825
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:15,920
So that's, that's
what like what is that, you know,

826
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,890
not sort of a totally disconnected

827
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:25,129
compact space not or so,
but so the pro finite is very strange.

828
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,163
It's like, what is that?

829
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:29,967
If you have pro final and many copies
of something, what is that actual space?

830
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,802
So if you have this double emergence

831
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:35,206
and it's very kind of fractal
like I'm really interested in that.

832
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,476
So again, maybe the strong coupling
has to do with irreversibility

833
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:39,643
and reconstruct ability.

834
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,779
I'm very, very interested.

835
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:45,883
And what we mean by, you know,
something is irreversible, right?

836
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,852
I think we need to go into that
just little bit more.

837
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:51,622
And is there a play between
irreversibility and reconstruct ability?

838
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:51,889
Right.

839
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:52,790
The descent condition

840
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,459
as you can reconstruct
this higher space in this level space,

841
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,863
what does it mean
that if you like, fail to reconstruct?

842
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,967
So we say it's a diamond X, like
reconstruct a ball up to irreversibility.

843
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:07,037
You've seen that up to condition
in mathematics, which is like a is

844
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:11,909
sort of equal to be up to some condition,
meaning can considering that condition.

845
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,278
So the hope is that. Yes.

846
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:17,782
So if I can get this play between
reconstruct ability and irreversibility,

847
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:19,650
maybe that'll make more sense
mathematically

848
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,752
for what it means to be irreversible.

849
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:26,023
So coupling the strings of the coupling
would be in the levels of the finiteness

850
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,893
and the non locality. How many levels
do you actually have there?

851
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,261
What's the string?

852
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,530
So coupling by perturbation,
I already said that's perfect.

853
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,265
Do it in tilting.

854
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,000
So big questions.

855
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,436
What would actually non locality
be an act of reference?

856
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,704
I mean, I'll leave these rhetorically
because I want to get to this.

857
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,742
That pretty image Danielle, before
we wait for possible, the next question.

858
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,710
So I think it's like coming up.

859
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,144
Yes, right.

860
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,847
OK, so what is known locality
and active inference?

861
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:52,716
What is holography
and active inference right?

862
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:56,554
Which is this very awesome
dimensional phenomena

863
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:59,990
where there's a strong interaction

864
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:03,861
and you know say dimension in
and then maybe there's

865
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:07,198
like a weaker interaction and in -1,
what does that mean?

866
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,534
And that if one space is too difficult,
you go to the other space,

867
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:11,735
what does that actually mean?

868
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:14,104
And they're actually related,
sort of like a hologram.

869
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,440
So hologram
is this 2D kind of scrambled image

870
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,009
that maybe you bounce light on
and you get this 3D phenomena.

871
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,846
So in one sense, the 3D is redundant.

872
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,848
Because you already had it in 2D.

873
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:26,584
So what is the notion of redundancy
and active inference?

874
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,486
That's what I'm interested in.

875
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,388
So what is a diamond equivalent of pro
finite and active

876
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:34,525
where's the fractal ness
that's sort of happening?

877
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:39,463
Right, the fractal multiplicity, what is
object persistence and active inference?

878
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,065
That's tricky, right?

879
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,435
So you know, when we you know,
we say, you know, the observer measures

880
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:46,003
the electron and things like this,

881
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:50,241
you know, the pair of entangled photons,
you know, X

882
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,511
non-local or something, like this,
what does that actually mean?

883
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,713
Why is it the same photon?

884
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:58,148
And so Chris Fields and I
are trying to work on this awesome

885
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:01,352
idea of object persistence
and what that actually is right?

886
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,721
I mean, you saw me a couple of weeks
ago, right?

887
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,890
But is it the same shannah?

888
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,091
How does that work?

889
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,393
How does objects persistence work

890
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,229
when you're going through
like a multiple time, you know,

891
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,064
what is emergent
time and active inference?

892
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:19,103
Where is it more likely where in embodied
like cognition is emergence?

893
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,772
So what is pro emergence there?

894
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,841
So I want you to think about these
as we're kind of going through

895
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,143
what is a singularity, right?

896
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:30,481
And act of inference like
a singular event, what is coupling right?

897
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:31,348
What is the actual coupling?

898
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,450
What is the strength
of an interaction mean?

899
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,954
So if you want to play hard for shared
action amid global uncertainty,

900
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:40,424
maybe we should work in discrete time
operating grand unified theories,

901
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:44,562
master this local global localization
by these higher order awarenesses.

902
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,463
Machine learning, right?

903
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,132
Operating grand unified theories.

904
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,868
Let's go higher, right?
Let's not work in networks anymore.

905
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,470
Let's work in three more isms medical.

906
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:55,539
OK, let's model the brain as a hologram.

907
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:59,209
Maybe these thoughts of these certain
chromatic towers I talked about the the

908
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,111
chromatic commentary theory last time.

909
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:03,113
It has this beautiful notion

910
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:06,450
of equating spectra.

911
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,753
You have this notion of this theorem
called Traumatic Convergence Theorem.

912
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,757
That says that you can reconstruct,
you can reconstruct a certain object

913
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,659
from its towers of spectra.

914
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:16,327
So you have a boost

915
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:19,863
field localization, which
which is sort of like the idea of my

916
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,299
the topological localization
I referred to,

917
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,736
which is a way of sort of connecting
spaces.

918
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:29,540
And again, if if you know,

919
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:34,445
you know, if in certain neurological
maybe degeneration, maybe

920
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,781
the actual morph isms are cut, you know,
you can think about things like that.

921
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:42,319
You're no longer able to recall because
maybe all the maps are gone, right?

922
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:46,123
So maybe that you could more aptly model
things like anterograde, amnesia,

923
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:50,294
neurodegeneration, so medical level
and Levin and Fields have this awesome

924
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,831
kind of new work out about entanglement
across star cells.

925
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,333
What is holography and daughter cells?

926
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,470
At least it's at least
we can measure entanglement

927
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,672
in something besides photons, you know,

928
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:06,543
so you need this
particularity is temporal non locality.

929
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:10,247
Is it like instantiation
without reciprocity?

930
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:12,816
It's Advent, right?
This is me going like wild here.

931
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:16,720
So Advent means that you've arrived,
but you've been in body cognition,

932
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:17,755
the environment has arrived.

933
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:20,190
I've arrives double play, right?

934
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,660
So is it an instantaneous ness

935
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,362
without a sort of two way interaction?

936
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:26,730
What does that actually mean?

937
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,433
What is temporal non locality mean?
I don't really know.

938
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,201
Can we actually construct, for instance,

939
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:35,172
a finite version of that, which is again,
this kind of super disconnected

940
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:39,677
fractal space is temporal
non locality, daily theism time.

941
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,945
Everyone knows I'm superfan of dilithium.

942
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,580
This is a construction of logic

943
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,851
where you can have both A
and not A at the same time.

944
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:49,453
Normally you cannot, right?

945
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:54,091
You have a, you know, a, A or B either,
you know, not A, therefore B

946
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,627
why can't A
and not obtain at the same time

947
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:59,029
so you get this beautiful construction
called dialectic, is it?

948
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,864
We may start messing around enough

949
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:04,401
so it there's a diamond construction
of temporal known locality fail time is

950
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:08,272
it fails all pro incarnations of duration
so you get a lot of interesting

951
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:09,373
heavy questions with this.

952
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:13,010
If so, what are the actual conditions
for object persistence in a non locality

953
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,344
that is pro finite.

954
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:17,614
How do you actually do that right
how does something persist

955
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:19,516
in those conditions?

956
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:23,287
How does persistence work in a singular
case such as anterograde amnesia?

957
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:25,322
You know,
I spoke of a Clive Waring last time

958
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:28,358
you know, was a beautiful pianist.

959
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:32,129
He's still living, which is great,
but he got an interim grade amnesia

960
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:35,132
and has no more personal memory
but has a motor memory

961
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,736
and so there's, you know,
some some difficulties there.

962
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,338
But it's very interesting
how the memory levels work.

963
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:42,873
So the question is not really profound.

964
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,776
So at least try to hold on to it,
you know, with the smallest assessment.

965
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:49,513
Maybe this has to do with thoughts
and memory recollection.

966
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,115
We can go into that.

967
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:52,983
But first, a dream. OK.

968
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:54,752
Can I just make a few active inference?

969
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,786
Yes. There.

970
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:59,223
OK, so I'm recalling my thoughts here
by looking at the

971
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,958
paper, which I took notes on.

972
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:04,528
First,
you mentioned the dynamic persistence

973
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:08,899
and a multi skill persistence, and
that reminded me of the ship of Theseus,

974
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:12,636
which is like if you replace all the
planks of the ship, is it the same ship?

975
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,506
So it's a philosophy styled question.

976
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:18,976
And then we're approaching it
in a formal way

977
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:22,379
and then it comes very close
to active inference.

978
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,915
When you had the slide
a needed particular charity,

979
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,650
that reminded me of

980
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:30,420
Karl Christian's recent paper,
which was called a free energy principle

981
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,825
for a particular physics
and particular is a pun

982
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:38,295
because it means specific,
but also it means particle.

983
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:41,832
And so when we say a particle or a point,

984
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:47,504
it's like that is the unit of analysis
that we can pick up, we can make edges

985
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:51,408
between points and we can engage
in a higher level of network mapping.

986
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:54,044
So when we're thinking about particles
here,

987
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:58,182
and this way that particles
can be related in nested

988
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:00,083
models

989
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,920
or nested categories, I'm
not sure what technical what would be

990
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,456
we're kind of talking about a particular

991
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:07,491
approach.

992
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,929
Oh, I love this.

993
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:12,663
Yeah.

994
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,831
Just trying to give a little,

995
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,033
little active inference,
you know, throw out some red.

996
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:16,800
No, please.

997
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,100
Yeah.

998
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,870
Every ten slides, every fight stopped me.

999
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,573
So yes, I think, wow, how neat.

1000
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,274
You see, that's like an incarnation.

1001
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:27,578
It's like this
this this is, this is exciting.

1002
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,880
Yeah. What a play.

1003
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,081
That's perfect. I'm curious.

1004
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,750
See what you think
about the next couple of slides.

1005
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,751
OK, I say.

1006
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:36,486
But first, right.
So you have all this mathy stuff.

1007
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:37,020
We're gonna do this.

1008
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,457
We're going to this you know, like,
you know, said recurring first and stuff,

1009
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,993
pulling at everybody step a thesis,

1010
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,229
but first a dream because
I want to get like a little pretty.

1011
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:46,730
So we are interested

1012
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:50,000
in the relation between diamond descent,
the stop mechanism.

1013
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,370
So I know Fields and Levin and everyone
has been like baffled by that

1014
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:57,507
at the stop mechanism that doesn't work
in something like cancer cells.

1015
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,643
Yeah. When do things stop?

1016
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:02,312
I'm actually very curious about that

1017
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:06,617
and the storage and reflection
and recollection of profanely

1018
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:09,820
many copies of information
and the form of mathematically impure

1019
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,456
or geometric
points. Right. If you're modeling

1020
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:14,725
neurons as

1021
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,829
diamonds, what is whoa, OK,
you have covers of diamonds.

1022
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:22,966
Like I said, you know,
if the proprioception is topological

1023
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:23,834
and in the covers, then

1024
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,870
maybe you could actually model neurons
as these diamond phenomenon

1025
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,274
so someone like Clive Waring
has all the diamonds, but

1026
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:34,645
the covers are cut, so it's almost like
you cannot access that.

1027
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:35,612
Right.

1028
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:39,082
Very interesting
when the actual balloons are cut,

1029
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,019
you cannot get the balloon anymore
if they're attached to you.

1030
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,422
So we posited a model of the brain
that's actually allowing for various

1031
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,825
mathematical partitions in the brain
in the form of providing them

1032
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:50,460
many copies of the diamond, right?

1033
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,163
So there is a geometric points
which are morph isms of schemes.

1034
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:56,466
Like I said, then maybe Anterograde
amnesia would resemble some kind of

1035
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:59,536
sustained truncation of diamond descent.

1036
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:03,173
Why are those maps continually
continuously cut?

1037
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,275
Which is why I'm very interested
in this object.

1038
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:09,146
Persistence so considering
temporal locality, can we model thoughts

1039
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:12,683
as pro finite reflections of pro
atl, topological covers

1040
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:15,018
oriented and non locality? Right.

1041
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:18,322
Someone from your from your community
also has asked me up thoughts

1042
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:19,890
and I was like,
that's such a great question.

1043
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:20,157
What?

1044
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,692
You know, clearly there's something like

1045
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:24,328
there's an M field going on,
but it's something more than that.

1046
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:27,064
And then the brain seems to operate
like a hologram as well.

1047
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,299
So what is that? Right?

1048
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,902
Are these actual the finite reflections?

1049
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:32,569
You know,

1050
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:35,038
like if you cannot organize
your thoughts, are things bouncing

1051
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:36,673
all over the place?

1052
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:39,576
You know, I was a lot of
people are internal are the is the

1053
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:42,079
the diamond super
internally reflected at that point.

1054
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,048
So this may help
I said you know to model the state

1055
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:48,585
of being fully conscious
right during dreamless sleep.

1056
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:50,354
No one has that

1057
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:53,290
fully
conscious during the dreamless sleep.

1058
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,125
What would that actually be

1059
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:58,562
which perhaps takes the form
of sleeping in a diamond hourglass.

1060
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:02,432
So, you know,
I write like kind of fantastical

1061
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:05,869
mathematical fiction books and
this is my second one that I'm working on

1062
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:09,072
about, you know,
sleeping in a diamond hourglass.

1063
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:09,873
What does that actually mean?

1064
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:12,009
So you're working in Diamond Time
at that point?

1065
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:12,843
What does that mean?

1066
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:16,747
Pro finite in many reflections of time,
which probably takes some kind of image

1067
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:17,948
like this, right?

1068
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:20,751
So I always have unicorns over
because I'm like, Oh, it's magic, right?

1069
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:24,721
And what does that actually mean
to sleep inside of anything?

1070
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:29,626
Hourglass, I'm very, very curious
because, you know, when we go to sleep

1071
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:32,396
and nothing is really asleep,
your system is still functioning.

1072
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:34,498
Right? But where do you go?

1073
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:35,999
And I'm not sure what you know,

1074
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:38,368
I'm going to put that out there
to your community.

1075
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,903
What is that? Right.

1076
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:44,141
Why can you not be fully conscious
during dreamless sleep?

1077
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:46,443
Not the little brief, periodic

1078
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:50,147
right of of dream sleep that you get,
but where is that?

1079
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,349
So it'd be something
like sleeping in an hourglass,

1080
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:53,583
which is actually very strange.

1081
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:54,518
And it's like, Oh, God,

1082
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:57,687
what if somebody takes the hourglass
and turns it upside down and shakes it,

1083
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:58,588
you know?

1084
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:02,025
But this would almost be an hourglass
without cardinality.

1085
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:04,594
So there is no up or down here, you know?

1086
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,230
And so section that book is coming out,

1087
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,367
which is cool, but it's all it's

1088
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:14,071
nested in in the finite condition.

1089
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:14,604
If you're going to say

1090
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:16,740
object persistence, that happens
when you sleep as well.

1091
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:20,877
So to get to some of the math stuff,
there's some main conjectures.

1092
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:23,046
I'll talk about the theory of diamonds

1093
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,049
let's let's actually
look at that diamond shape again

1094
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:29,186
and let's get into the diamond
holographic principle of the Forward

1095
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:32,089
Fontaine Curve,
why we're using its helical homology.

1096
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:36,293
And let's go to emergent time, you know,
or as far as many of these as we can.

1097
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,130
So I may start skipping around Daniel

1098
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,300
in the interest of time, you know,
so that we can get to the good stuff.

1099
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:47,304
So I introduced
this kind of wild can conjecture

1100
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:51,241
about this eponymous K theory of diamonds
in this localization sequence,

1101
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:52,642
which is a co fiber sequence

1102
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:57,180
and a modification of something
called continuous K theory.

1103
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,450
So again, I told you earlier that maybe
continuous K theory is the way to go

1104
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,452
if we're going to be modeling
emergent time

1105
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,521
because you want to kind of stick
together

1106
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:08,158
small pockets of, of, of local emergence.

1107
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:13,029
So this this number two localization
sequence is a CO fiber sequence.

1108
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:18,301
And you've got the K theory acting on D
little sub diamond and then K F.M.

1109
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:24,307
off of the Diamond four Fontane curve
mapping to the f k theory of the non

1110
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:28,712
diamond fork fontane curve
with a modification of this f continuous

1111
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,815
working in the category of sheaves and

1112
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,217
this is actually this third

1113
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:39,589
left hand side is actually going
to be corresponded to the actual

1114
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:42,959
that that'll make it to
the end is an actual continuous

1115
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,962
K three spectrum of D diamonds.

1116
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:49,266
So again, it's a way of actually
gluing together and looking at the

1117
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:52,369
isomorphism classes
of what's happening in these diamonds.

1118
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:55,772
So my idea is this
you have these pro finite mini copies

1119
00:52:56,506 --> 00:53:00,210
that of,
of the actual geometric impurities.

1120
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:03,480
So you already have those and we actually
want to figure out what's happening

1121
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:05,682
between those.

1122
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,752
So what's a two morph schism
between the pro finite copies?

1123
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:11,021
That's what my interpretation of the K
theory is going to be.

1124
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:13,423
So you have this level,
let's go to a higher level.

1125
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:17,027
K theory is actually looking at
what makes things like unified

1126
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,229
at that higher level. So it's cool.

1127
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:23,099
So the upper diamond is a stable
do allies will presentable

1128
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:27,304
infinity one category of diamonds
D sub diamonds actually the complex of

1129
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:30,974
V stacks of look will be spatial diamonds
where complex is a

1130
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,276
sort of like a collection

1131
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:36,213
and then you have the actual relative
fork fontane curve in the diamond.

1132
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,081
So don't talk about that too too much.

1133
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:40,417
Let's get to the actual diamond
holography principle.

1134
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:43,520
But the diamond holographic
principle should fall out

1135
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,922
and be immediate
from this localization sequence.

1136
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,992
So once again, our diamond holographic
principle is going

1137
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:53,263
to use these two joint pairs for these
you have a direct image,

1138
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,732
an inverse image, functor,
and then an exceptional

1139
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,035
and an inverse

1140
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:02,906
exceptional functor, which is this
F lower sreak and F upper streak.

1141
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,909
That's the kind of cool way of saying
exclamation point.

1142
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:11,414
What's the main point is that again,
we want to take these double

1143
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,950
joint pairs and make a two and four morph
as a matter of them.

1144
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:17,554
So these are from shows six
operations, eight technology of diamonds.

1145
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,790
We actually want to condense a find this.

1146
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:22,192
So how do you rephrase all this

1147
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:25,495
in terms of a sheaf of sets
like on a certain site

1148
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:28,865
and then go into what that means
and then sort of, you know, how to

1149
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:31,801
how do we think about holograph V
in terms of a mathematically

1150
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:36,673
mathematical and purely geometric point,
the Spar CD, that's the static spectrum

1151
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:40,910
of this closed algebraic curve
mapping to the actual diamond.

1152
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:44,981
So again, try to think of a you know,
when we think about reflections,

1153
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:47,017
we're trying to mathematically interpret
that.

1154
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:49,753
So let's actually discuss immersion
time from that condensed setting.

1155
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,121
An investigator condensed version

1156
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,758
of the actual continuous K theory for pro
emergence, right?

1157
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:55,725
That's wild.

1158
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,160
So the continuous case

1159
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,229
theory
or instances of marketing a.k.a theory

1160
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:02,565
and then actually try to put the pro
object together as a pro emergence.

1161
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,002
OK, so here's this image.

1162
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:07,470
I think I showed it last time.

1163
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,173
So the one of the main goals
is to actually have an infinity

1164
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:13,076
one category ification of geometric
Englands England's England sorghum.

1165
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:14,177
It's so beautiful.

1166
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:15,445
What is it trying to do?

1167
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:19,282
It's, it's a mathematical interpretation
of shared action.

1168
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,819
You are working across very difficult,
disparate fields

1169
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,822
with lots of uncertainty.

1170
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:31,361
And so you have these beautiful phenomena
for England's reciprocity, Lenglen

1171
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,397
to reality, where actually, you know,

1172
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:37,901
you're creating a certain situation
in which certain

1173
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:41,938
representations of objects
are actually automatic forms.

1174
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:44,941
And so different incarnations
are being shown to be the same thing,

1175
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:47,844
which is like a version
of the same thing, which is cool.

1176
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:51,748
So in this model that I have here,
so the diamonds in the middle

1177
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:55,218
and again, you have the famous case
theory of the actual diamond curve.

1178
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,421
And at the bottom, you know, I said, oh,
this structure is, you know,

1179
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:01,624
possibly an infinity one to a point,
which goes back to Daniel's

1180
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,093
point
about bringing all the structure in.

1181
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:04,661
So and it's only one

1182
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:08,431
turquoise and failing category,
it satisfies a decent condition.

1183
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,101
It's locally Cartesian clothes.
So everything maps to each other.

1184
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:13,236
It's got a Kappa filter on it.

1185
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:16,406
So everything is nice and contained,
which is really nice.

1186
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,640
All right.

1187
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,711
And so you can also these lines
can also be interpreted in terms of

1188
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:26,149
I have a little note there
about a Lubin Tate formal sheath module.

1189
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:31,020
This is a law to link once again, one of
these higher grade unified theories.

1190
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:34,090
You can actually maybe link
the geometry zation of local languages

1191
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:35,225
with FMF K through it.

1192
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,861
So I'm just getting some super
mathy things that some people want.

1193
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:39,229
It's mathy things, right?

1194
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,464
So that's bunch things work,
which is really pretty.

1195
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:44,100
So let me actually formally
define Diamond.

1196
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,435
I don't think I did last time.

1197
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:47,237
Yeah.

1198
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,139
And then we get to the actual holography
part.

1199
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:53,009
OK, so let perf d be
the category of perfected spaces.

1200
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:55,211
So again, these are annex spaces.

1201
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:58,515
They look like Huber spaces and they are

1202
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:01,084
fractal and strange,
kind of like Perkovic spaces.

1203
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,287
So let perf be that category

1204
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:08,191
and perf be the subcategory
perfecto and spaces of characteristic p

1205
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:13,563
so no longer zero p so a diamond is a pro
hotel sheet that's a sheave.

1206
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:14,798
And the proton topology,

1207
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:17,734
as I told you, is a very fine topology,
which can be written as a quotient

1208
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:19,969
x, not r.

1209
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,971
So it's of a
you take the perfect workspace

1210
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:25,375
and you model out and you glue
these proto equivalence relations.

1211
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,378
You get a diamond
what a beautiful way of doing that.

1212
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:32,315
So we say, let's see main
algebraically closed F and right field,

1213
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,351
it's a certain construction
and you percents

1214
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,754
and then we say a geometric point
so this is the thing that I think

1215
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:40,824
would be beautiful to actually the thing
this is the actual object

1216
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:44,093
that could actually model neurons
very nicely geometric point

1217
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:48,832
which is the attic spectrum of that C
mapping to the diamond is made visible

1218
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:52,001
by pulling it back
through a protocol cover

1219
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:54,871
xD resulting in profanely
many copies of spots.

1220
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:57,874
So this is again huge relation

1221
00:57:57,874 --> 00:58:01,478
with like proprioception
by topology, right?

1222
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,080
How do you actually visualize,
how do you interpret things like this?

1223
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:07,984
So Diamond is an actual algebraic space
for that v topology.

1224
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:12,322
And the Etiology typology everyone wants
to know is the sexual cover f i x my x

1225
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:16,826
that consists of any maps excited x
such that for any quasi compact,

1226
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:20,697
open subset,
you and x your final indices i

1227
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,700
so that these these open subsets jointly

1228
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,370
cover you so x there is an actual

1229
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,806
v stack.

1230
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:32,041
OK, so here's a diamond again, right?

1231
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:36,546
So we can think
what are these actual geometric points

1232
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:39,115
in terms of like embodied
cognition, in terms of, you know,

1233
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:43,553
shared action,
whatever you want to think.

1234
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:46,055
If, if I, you know, if I'm a diamond,
Daniel's not.

1235
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:49,259
How do you actually relate those
to diamonds by these like big maps?

1236
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:52,862
And so you can see that right here
you have this diamond.

1237
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:57,300
So the actual footnote is calling it
what it is.

1238
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:01,404
So you take the addicts, right,
which is the field optics, kewpie.

1239
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:06,209
We can if we want to find the diamond
spectrum of that, which is that body.

1240
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,512
So the diamond spectrum
that's akin to the actual prime spectrum,

1241
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,114
the addict spectrum. I showed you.

1242
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:14,250
So you can actually only ever
get the addict spectrum

1243
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:17,720
a piece like Automata, which is a six
atomic field of the particles.

1244
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,923
You don't actually get all the particles.

1245
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:23,826
So this model out by the CB Cross,
which is a Galois action,

1246
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:27,764
it's underlined because it's pro finite.

1247
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,265
So how interesting

1248
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:33,503
that you never actually get
you want the left hand side spotted cup,

1249
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:36,940
but you only get pro
at the many copies of the six atomic.

1250
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:41,477
So you never actually get
what you're after and this is actually

1251
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:45,381
has a lot of phenomenology behind it
because like again, Robert and I really

1252
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:49,719
and Chris and I are really fascinated
by the phenomenology of

1253
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:54,123
what is so if we actually have, you know,

1254
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:57,493
if you want to think interface
or if you want to think whatever it is

1255
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:00,530
in our organism,
are we actually ever truly

1256
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,566
interacting with the thing
or just our representation of the thing?

1257
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:07,470
You know, you've got me at the level
going, well, you know,

1258
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:11,941
if interaction is just me interacting
with a reflection of my environment,

1259
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,444
if it's actually me interacting
with hidden states

1260
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,713
that were probably my
reflections the whole time,

1261
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:19,082
what is it?

1262
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:22,018
Are we just sitting around with a finite
many copies of the thing?

1263
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:24,387
We never actually get the thing.

1264
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,090
Any questions for four?

1265
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,492
I feel like it's a lot of math

1266
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:31,728
yeah. There's pretty pictures.

1267
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:33,730
Yeah. There's a question in the chat.

1268
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:35,331
Oh, wonderful.

1269
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:38,234
Yet KB writes, According to this

1270
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:41,371
fascinating framework
and from an awareness perspective,

1271
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:45,208
is the dark room problem
still considered as a problem?

1272
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,710
Grateful for any elaboration on that.

1273
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:48,945
And thanks to the speaker

1274
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:53,750
so the dark room problem being the
philosophical thought experiment where

1275
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:59,122
what does an agent in a dark room do
and in the free energy world?

1276
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:02,158
Some people initially, several years ago
brought that up

1277
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,393
as something like a critique.

1278
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:05,862
They'd say, Well, aren't
you very precisely sure

1279
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:06,763
that you're in a dark room?

1280
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:07,830
So if active inference

1281
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:11,467
is about reducing uncertainty,
then isn't that the perfect state?

1282
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:14,837
But of course, the pragmatic answer
is that while you're in that dark

1283
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:17,573
room, your uncertainty about the world
is increasing.

1284
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:23,546
So I'm wondering if that maps on
to a multilevel uncertainty concept,

1285
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:27,183
because it's almost like
you're getting precise

1286
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,153
at the visual level
that you're in a dark room,

1287
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:35,892
but you're getting increasingly imprecise
at not just a different lateral level,

1288
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:39,295
like you're getting imprecise on smell
while you're getting precise on vision,

1289
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:42,732
but actually at a higher level,
you're getting imprecise on visually

1290
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:43,399
what's outside.

1291
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:46,102
Oh, wow.

1292
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:47,537
Well, yeah, keep going.
What do you think?

1293
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,739
What a beautiful question.
Thank you so much.

1294
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:51,441
Oh, yes.

1295
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,109
More questions and less me talking.

1296
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:53,443
Yeah.

1297
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:58,414
I'm just I'm thinking of it as there's
three roads meeting in some ways here.

1298
01:01:58,681 --> 01:01:59,649
There's philosophy.

1299
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:01,951
You know, we've brought up the dark room,
the ship of Theseus.

1300
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:05,788
Then there's
a lot of the formal mathematics,

1301
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:10,560
which certainly I'm scribbling down,
but are just beginning to learn.

1302
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:14,363
And then there's the active
inference community who might be familiar

1303
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:17,934
with this idea of multi-level
uncertainty. But.

1304
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:21,604
Not have connected it
to, for example, philosophy or math.

1305
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:24,574
So we've got people coming
and going on all those roads.

1306
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:27,243
No, this is beautiful.
So it's like, yeah, yeah.

1307
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:30,780
OK, so let's not take one
single dark room.

1308
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:31,547
Let's expand it.

1309
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:33,916
If every organism had their own
dark room.

1310
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:37,754
Yeah, let's like, let's take that
question, accelerate it a little bit.

1311
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,554
What a dark room.

1312
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:40,723
Survive and a two info morph ism.

1313
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:42,525
Right. Let's go a little.

1314
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:46,963
Let's let's say you know, on
an information perspective, is it dark?

1315
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:47,964
Probably not.

1316
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:50,399
It's just on the organism perspective,
right?

1317
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:53,870
So that's actually the dark
room is a very beautiful

1318
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:58,141
I think, instantiation of what
I'm actually saying here with the demon.

1319
01:02:58,508 --> 01:02:59,342
So in the dark room

1320
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:02,378
you may just have profaned like
many copies of the dark, but as Daniel

1321
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:05,982
saying, like all your other senses
are being very, like, perfect weighted.

1322
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,885
I'm just fine,
you know, other senses are being

1323
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:10,787
more fine

1324
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,389
tuned at the expense of something else.

1325
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,124
So my question is this.

1326
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:18,294
It's like,
why don't why can't we increase

1327
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:21,697
the sort of bandwidth
to be able to be precise everywhere?

1328
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:24,634
Like, why is it dark to the extent
of something else?

1329
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,501
Right.

1330
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:27,837
And how do we actually do that?

1331
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:30,339
That's that's very interesting.

1332
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:32,041
I think I think dark
room is still a problem.

1333
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,042
Is anybody solve that?

1334
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:35,211
It's still a problem, right?

1335
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:40,016
I guess a problem for philosopher,
but not a problem for the human

1336
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:41,050
in the dark room.

1337
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,587
And let me ask 11 question
on the operations on diamonds.

1338
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:49,225
Yes. People might be familiar
with the operations on numbers

1339
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:52,061
like addition,
subtraction, multiplying, dividing

1340
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:56,098
so is it fair to say that the operations
that you're going to be describing

1341
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:59,969
there, like ways to work with diamonds,
just like plus and minus are ways to work

1342
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:00,503
with numbers?

1343
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:02,371
Oh, that's OK.

1344
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,540
It's a very good, very good question.

1345
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:05,374
So, you know,

1346
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:08,578
we can answer that very abstractly
that there really is no intrinsic

1347
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:09,745
definition of a number.

1348
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:13,349
You can say the number five,
but what is it, five times one, you know,

1349
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,351
six, six -1.

1350
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,919
You have so many ways of going

1351
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:20,223
going at it that a number is actually
just an equivalence class, right?

1352
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,260
So if a number is just an equivalence
class, then

1353
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,128
then you can think of the same thing
as a diamond.

1354
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,464
Diamond still equivalence class, right?

1355
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:30,633
A certain equivalence class between

1356
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,668
but you're in a different
a different structure.

1357
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:36,672
So sheaves you sheaves
don't really add like one plus one.

1358
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,175
So there's a little more than you can.

1359
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,377
Is there an algebra sheaves?
Oh, absolutely.

1360
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:45,448
And the beauty is that sort of sheaves
are this like way of keeping

1361
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:49,218
track of local data, like a little bag
that's associated to every space.

1362
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:51,954
There are ways of gluing those together.

1363
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:54,957
You don't really add them,
but you can glue them

1364
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:58,394
and start gluing them and start
gluing them and start gluing them.

1365
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:01,998
So in a sense, they are number theoretic

1366
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:04,967
because if you're defining a number
as an equivalence relation,

1367
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:09,138
so you can think, yeah, one
plus one equals two, whatever that means.

1368
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:13,109
Or you can say gluing and then gluing
and then gluing and then gluing.

1369
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:16,712
So you can actually get
an infinity category of these sheaves.

1370
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:20,116
So I recommend anyone looking at like
you want to learn

1371
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:24,153
like some of the best global mathematics
and like learning it

1372
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,490
conceptually first
is to look at the sheath interpretation.

1373
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,693
You're like, Wait, was Edition
the sheaf, the whole time?

1374
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:30,960
Yeah,

1375
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:33,596
talk about darkroom and mathematics.

1376
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,831
I'm just feeding him.

1377
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:36,132
Yeah.

1378
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:38,601
So operations and so,

1379
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:42,038
you know, bless Peter for being
so amazing and coming up with this idea.

1380
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:45,041
It's like, oh,
not only can you put a sheath

1381
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:47,910
on a top, a logical space,
you can put a sheaf on a category.

1382
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:50,680
That's the sort of interesting thing
that I'm into.

1383
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:52,315
So take your idea of operating,

1384
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:55,151
of adding numbers
and just go to the category of numbers.

1385
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,321
And then if you start working
categorically, that's already shared

1386
01:05:58,321 --> 01:05:58,688
action.

1387
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:01,457
You're in this like higher space

1388
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:02,491
yeah.

1389
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:08,097
So operations with diamonds on diamonds
showing something is a diamond, OK,

1390
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,533
it's all just a little rigorous,
but at the end

1391
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:13,703
it gives you such an A in Estheticism
because

1392
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:17,807
I think that, you know, all of this work
should be pulling in everyone.

1393
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,208
You need the philosophers.

1394
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,243
Make sure
we're asking the right question.

1395
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:24,246
You need the crazy
math people like me to come up with like,

1396
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:26,782
well, I don't know, let's try
like an infinity category.

1397
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:29,285
And then you need, you know,
you need active.

1398
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:34,190
Like, we need people actually, you
working on how do you relate all this?

1399
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:35,391
So you need active efforts,

1400
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,660
you need the philosophy
and you need to put everyone together.

1401
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,162
Yeah. So in the dark
room, my questions, it's like

1402
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,065
at what point was dark?

1403
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:44,233
Like light, you know?

1404
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:47,370
So I think also the darkness is like
maybe a pro finite condition.

1405
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:49,505
The question is,
if we sat in a dark room forever,

1406
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,073
would it eventually become light?

1407
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:53,275
You know, and then you bring in time.

1408
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:56,012
So Dark Room is really interesting
and try to think of dark room

1409
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:57,847
and it's impossible non locality.

1410
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,950
That's how I would take that problem and
kind of accelerate it just a little bit.

1411
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:05,688
Dark room in terms of a diamond dark room
and change the time interpretation.

1412
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:08,724
Like in all these models, you know, time

1413
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:11,727
is always modeled as a total order.

1414
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:13,729
That's another thing
I would like to hear from your community.

1415
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:18,067
Like, you know, total order
has this like Connect City property

1416
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:22,204
that every to objects in the total order
are comparable.

1417
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:26,075
Why, why do we model time as continuous
and why do you

1418
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:27,576
model time as a total order?

1419
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:31,080
I think
that I think that should be changed

1420
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,382
just a little bit and move it
like non hour comedian

1421
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:37,086
quantum mechanics is going to work on
our comedian with a very specific cutoff.

1422
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:38,521
Right the planking.

1423
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:41,457
But I think you should also
be working with non hour comedian time.

1424
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:45,261
So the awesome person to ask you
a question about the dark room.

1425
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:48,364
Please try to think about dark room
like in in

1426
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:51,067
some kind of temporal non-local
eddy of time was everywhere.

1427
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,269
I'm really interested in that.

1428
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:56,072
OK, well I make one more
one more comment here.

1429
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,107
This is quite early.

1430
01:07:58,107 --> 01:08:02,945
You mentioned how a stock
you said it's it takes in categories

1431
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:07,583
not for example sets and connecting
that to what you said about operations.

1432
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:10,619
This might be quite familiar
to a computer scientist

1433
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:14,090
for whom the function
can take in different things.

1434
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:17,726
So we know there's functions
that take in numbers like two plus two,

1435
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:21,464
but then there might be a function
that takes in a large data set

1436
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:24,467
that has a diamond description.

1437
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:28,370
And so computer science and engineering
kind of the application,

1438
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:32,074
it's really easy sometimes to apply

1439
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:36,011
these recursive definitions
of recursion central to computer science.

1440
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:36,812
But you're right,

1441
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:42,151
when you go to the infinite level
that's kind of where the theory builds

1442
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:45,654
beyond any real implementation
of a computer program.

1443
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,123
So we're on the bottom

1444
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:51,527
looking up with the computer science
implementation of nested networks.

1445
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:55,764
And then here's the hand
coming from the top down

1446
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:58,400
saying there's a way
to infinitely structure

1447
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,603
that and throw a sheath on it
or I don't know.

1448
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:03,205
Oh, see, that's what I'm saying.

1449
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,141
Yeah, it's like to upgrade a machine.

1450
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,408
That's another project I'm working on.

1451
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:08,978
It's like categorically,
you know what I mean? Like

1452
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:10,713
when you know, the

1453
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:13,916
specific definition of stack
is a two sheave, right?

1454
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,952
So it's a sheath
that takes values and categories.

1455
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:17,987
That's actually.

1456
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,756
And so it's like, yeah, if you move from,

1457
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:24,894
you know, like an output
is a weighted function or something.

1458
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:29,331
If you move from that to the category
of all possible

1459
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:32,535
weighted functions, then

1460
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:35,571
your complexity has just grown

1461
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:38,574
probably like threefold
using the out years.

1462
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:40,743
It no longer needs to be something
singular.

1463
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:44,847
I output it a weighted function, you
know, particular to this distribution.

1464
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:49,084
Why don't you output an actual category?

1465
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:49,652
Yeah.

1466
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:52,988
Here's another great question
from the chart from Stephen.

1467
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:57,660
He wrote, If these category theory
and geometry approaches

1468
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,730
enable another multi scale formalism
that treats time differently,

1469
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:05,834
can this approach play nicely with
current multi scale active inference?

1470
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:06,535
Formalisms

1471
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:10,973
sounds
like he summarized our conversation.

1472
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:12,308
Stephen should present.

1473
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:15,077
Yeah, yeah.

1474
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:17,913
Can he tell me a little bit more
about the multi scale active?

1475
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:19,982
I'm see you're right on it.

1476
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:23,252
If you stackify things right,
think of it like this.

1477
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:28,724
Think that, you know, like Daniel was
saying, if every, you know, if every like

1478
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:34,530
think of every network being like a point
in the modular space, do you see?

1479
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:36,799
Then that whole thing was just a point.

1480
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,801
And then how do you actually get
from point to point?

1481
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:41,670
So is that the sort of like multi scale
multiclass?

1482
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:44,840
I'm super
into like multi class classification.

1483
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,643
You know,
I really like this question. Yes.

1484
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:51,814
Switch it up to like pro finite
if you category five the thing

1485
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:55,150
you're going to get more connections
right then you're then you're working

1486
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:59,321
in like categories of multi class
active inference, not just one.

1487
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:00,723
Why don't we split it up?

1488
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:04,159
Why don't you color it,
call them incarnations and relate them.

1489
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:07,229
If it's a powerful enough category,
you can put a sheath on it,

1490
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:10,065
put a sheet on it
and then start gluing them all together.

1491
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:13,602
And then I think you really have
a multi class shared inference hmm.

1492
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:15,237
Does that make sense to you?

1493
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:17,539
What what a great question.
Do you have any thoughts on that?

1494
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:18,407
On the multi class?

1495
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:20,476
I mean, I think that's what we're saying.

1496
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:25,681
One thought and the way
that we've been talking about multi scale

1497
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:29,652
active inference is like
let's say the brain is the internal state

1498
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:31,153
and the body is external to it.

1499
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:34,323
So then you have the blood brain barrier
and then at the next level out

1500
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:37,860
you have the brain in the body
interacting with the social niche.

1501
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:40,796
And then you can go up
and you can have societies or groups

1502
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:44,133
that are interacting with each other
and it's a debate in active members.

1503
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:47,836
Just the group really have a blanket
or what kind of blanket does it have?

1504
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:52,474
And here we're not going to speak
directly to that, but we can think of,

1505
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:56,045
quote, American society as a point.

1506
01:11:56,612 --> 01:12:00,049
It's a point
and then it has internal structure.

1507
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:03,252
But by using that basically
linguistic token,

1508
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:07,923
by saying it is a point, it's
literally one term that you can pass.

1509
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:11,960
Then it abstracts over lower levels.

1510
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:16,298
And I'm
not exactly sure on what is strong enough

1511
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:20,302
to have a sheath or not or what
that enables, but it sounds like it's

1512
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:25,107
making these nested structures
and laterally interacting structures,

1513
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:28,844
making them composable
and kind of compile level

1514
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:32,414
so that we can actively zoom in
and zoom out

1515
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:35,517
or work with guarantees

1516
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:38,787
or proofs
on these types of structures. Mm.

1517
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:40,522
Oh, I love that. Yeah.

1518
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,291
And so I encourage everyone

1519
01:12:42,291 --> 01:12:45,227
to maybe as a challenge
and Stephen will like this too

1520
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:48,831
when we say like, OK, so thank you
for explaining that for the multiclass.

1521
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:50,032
Yeah, I agree.

1522
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,067
Super like all these levels. Yeah.

1523
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:55,738
To reinterpret that because it's always
a boundary condition, right?

1524
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:56,572
Blood brain barrier.

1525
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:58,807
Barrier between me and group vary
between like

1526
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:02,077
collectivity and non collectivity,
things like this, right?

1527
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:03,946
What is a group.

1528
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:05,581
Group action and things like this.

1529
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:09,284
So re-interpret that with a notion
of a pro finite boundary.

1530
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:12,988
I'm very curious
as to what these boundaries are, right?

1531
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:14,456
They're not solid.

1532
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:17,259
They seem to be sort of like,
are they hidden?

1533
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:20,596
So the very concept of a boundary
is a hidden state.

1534
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:23,098
Something that I was playing with
and I was like, you know what?

1535
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:25,834
At what point is the boundary there?

1536
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:26,769
Does that make sense?

1537
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:30,873
It's almost like, you know, boundary
and hidden state is like this darkroom

1538
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:34,109
phenomena that all of a sudden something
turns on a light boom boundaries there.

1539
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:35,010
Right?

1540
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:38,013
So when you have Levon and Fields
talking about like entanglement,

1541
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:41,049
like, you know, a cross boundary is.
