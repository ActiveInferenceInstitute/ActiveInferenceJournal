1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
okay

2
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,800
all right all right welcome everybody

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,000
and

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,720
thanks for joining today it is june 9th

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,320
2021

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,039
and we're here in actin flab math stream

7
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,399
number 3.1

8
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,160
with dobson safran knight prentner and

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,800
friedman

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,600
today is going to be a fun discussion we

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,719
hope that

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,320
you're also able to if you're watching

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,480
live ask us some questions because

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,239
certainly we don't have much planned and

15
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,600
would appreciate from that

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,800
feedback with you we're just going to

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,600
jump right into it and by way of

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,320
introduction

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,640
and welcome ask what is active inference

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,199
and how we got here we're going to go

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,079
around

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,239
and give just some initial conditions

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,519
initial thoughts

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,240
on these questions from wherever we're

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
coming from as we sort of converge on

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,520
this discussion

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,680
and then we'll just be writing down

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,759
thoughts and ready to

29
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,400
jump in and continue the discussion so

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,240
who would like to give a first pass

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,839
on either or both of these questions

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,119
i could try thank you adam go for it

33
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,360
um

34
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,680
so for me um active inference

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,799
is a normative

36
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,920
process theory for how

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,040
um a principle of what it takes to exist

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,640
the free energy principle or what it

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,240
takes to persist

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,200
can be realized and it's what are the

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,799
things you have to do

42
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,880
if you're going to have you want to say

43
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,079
to you

44
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,479
outsource your entropy or avoid getting

45
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,439
all mixed up

46
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,040
in the meat grinder of existence or

47
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,080
whatever what kind of intelligence what

48
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,520
kind of modeling

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,239
will you need to exhibit to do this to

50
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,599
and so in a way it's for me the answer

51
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,959
to the question of

52
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,000
what is mind um and potentially with

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,200
certain versions of it

54
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,640
uh what is life and with other versions

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,120
of it

56
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,400
what is consciousness and maybe even

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,040
what is free will

58
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,319
nice big questions and how did you get

59
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,599
here i have no idea

60
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,080
um i think it all started with an

61
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,160
existential crisis when i was young that

62
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,480
went on for a very long time

63
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,000
um but then i would say i found my

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,599
way to uh the architect

65
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,640
aka carl fristen um

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,840
when i was basically uh

67
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,200
through jeff hawkins book on

68
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,560
intelligence i learned about predictive

69
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,360
coding

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,080
and that was my on wrap to carl's work

71
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,280
and

72
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,319
rest is history awesome

73
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,360
so we heard some big general ideas what

74
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,440
is mine what is life

75
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,760
who else would like to go or i'll give a

76
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,840
thought

77
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,000
blue want to go for it sure i

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,879
am came to active inference through my

79
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,519
interest

80
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,720
in scaling so how do you scale

81
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,319
processes like at like from very small

82
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,519
like subatomic to cellular to organismal

83
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,239
to societal so that that was kind of how

84
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:42,720
i got

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,680
hooked into the active inference

86
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,319
framework

87
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,840
and and for me it's a framework um

88
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,400
that pretty it gives a pretty good

89
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,920
representation of how we tend to

90
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,879
represent and think about the world we

91
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,840
predict

92
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,080
we have feedback from like we predict

93
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,360
something will happen you know

94
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
if i turn the thermometer on the if i

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,959
turn the temperature up

96
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,959
the heat will go on so we predict that

97
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,159
we take the action

98
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,599
and if the heat doesn't go on we have a

99
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,200
surprise and so

100
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,358
it it you know we we then we go well

101
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,880
what what made our model go wrong

102
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,959
right like maybe my heater is broken so

103
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,040
it's kind of minimizing the surprise and

104
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,160
uncertainty

105
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,720
in our interactions in the world

106
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,120
awesome would either the two of you like

107
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,919
to go or

108
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,360
sure shannon do you wonder should i um

109
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
go ahead i'll go after you go ahead

110
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,800
okay well so i'm i'm perhaps

111
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,240
in some sense the outsider because i'm

112
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,880
not um i'm not doing research with

113
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,840
active insurance but

114
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,280
i'm a philosopher my background is in

115
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,600
philosophy and um

116
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,199
i think active inference is a very

117
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,520
interesting thing first of cour

118
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
first of course i like this big general

119
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,800
questions that adam raised at the

120
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,240
beginning what is mine what is life what

121
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
is consciousness and it's very close to

122
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,280
what i normally think about i'm a being

123
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,960
a philosopher i'm a bit skeptical

124
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,080
whether one could

125
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,919
actually answer this big question in a

126
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,799
very um

127
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,199
but that's a different story i think

128
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,120
active inference is very interesting

129
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,680
from a

130
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
philosophical historical perspective as

131
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,520
well because it kind of

132
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,000
um embodies um attention

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,320
um which ran through philosophy or

134
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
through the history of thinking

135
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,880
um which more or less started with a

136
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,600
very famous philosopher emanuel khan

137
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,120
with the distinction between an object

138
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,440
or

139
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,520
a world he called it the world in itself

140
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,880
like an outside world

141
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,840
and the way how we represent it and now

142
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,039
we can go

143
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,960
two ways from here one more one could

144
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,600
stay in this kantian

145
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,800
paradigm where the questions how do we

146
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,919
actually perceive

147
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,080
or are able to make representations of

148
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,120
the outside world

149
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,960
or we could go into the different

150
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,240
directions say oh

151
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,039
it's really about acting in this world

152
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,199
and active inference is a kind of

153
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,080
an interesting twist mix between these

154
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,440
two ideas

155
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,840
and my experience with it that some

156
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,720
thinkers

157
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,240
in the active inference camp they

158
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,600
tend to align closer with

159
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,080
or in the neocanteen tradition and the

160
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,960
other line of thinkers

161
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,360
they tend to align more closely to this

162
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,039
perception action

163
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,800
way of thinking so i'm very interested

164
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,600
in in this tension maybe it would be

165
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,319
to think about how it could be resolved

166
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:38,639
so

167
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,280
i'm i'm curious and how do i did i get

168
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,680
there

169
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,280
um like um well i

170
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,360
worked a lot with shanna here and china

171
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,479
basically

172
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,520
um got me in so yeah

173
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,720
thank you robert shannon go for it

174
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,240
yes um so right what is what's active

175
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,120
imprints so

176
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,520
um i too i'm probably more outside than

177
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,599
robert is i'm the math person here so

178
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,280
i'm just sort of off in the woods trying

179
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,160
to think about

180
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,000
like blue said how to scale all of these

181
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,919
theories so you have this formalism of

182
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
an activism

183
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,240
and uh you know inference based on sort

184
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,919
of discriminating between system and its

185
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,360
environment and i think that's uh

186
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,120
predicated upon a

187
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,280
kind of a very serious boundary argument

188
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,960
so i'm really interested in boundaries

189
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,639
i'm interested in also how boundaries

190
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,240
are predicated upon also

191
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,280
a possible holography theorem so

192
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,199
when we say you know um agent is you

193
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,599
know interacting with its environment

194
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,639
how does that actually work um

195
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,639
in a categorical way so we have a

196
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,000
venezianism probability

197
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,280
way but i'm sort of interested in how do

198
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,039
you do that categorically

199
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,800
and can you mathematize that even more

200
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,120
and sort of infinity categorify that

201
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,919
um perhaps like the definition between

202
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,000
inside and outside is

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,440
i think a very very beautiful one and uh

204
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,639
so how can we actually say that you know

205
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,479
what is represented in the outside is

206
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,240
you know the inside uh inferred

207
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,319
like what are the mathematics of that

208
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,160
also this seems to be happening

209
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,199
in a certain version of a simul

210
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,520
simultaneousness

211
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,319
so i'm really interested in the

212
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,000
mathematics of simultaneity and also

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,840
this sort of synchronic and diachronic

214
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,680
emergence sort of phenomena

215
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,199
so i think that what's happening also in

216
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,840
that i think the active inference

217
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,400
formalism is

218
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,599
dynamical enough to allow for these

219
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,080
sort of mathematical ideas to come in

220
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,919
and if you can mathematize then perhaps

221
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,120
you can answer these questions that

222
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,799
adam's asking what is consciousness what

223
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,159
is mine and those are those are the

224
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,440
heavyweights and that's i think that's

225
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,559
why you have the heavyweights of this

226
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,760
panel

227
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,399
as opposed like like for the question

228
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,760
how did you get here i'm trying to

229
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,959
figure that out myself

230
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,320
so i didn't know if that meant like

231
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,399
existentially or whatever somehow i just

232
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,560
kind of came online if you want to know

233
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
how i got like in this uh

234
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,519
interface i don't know and then um

235
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,399
but uh my very good colleague fields

236
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,200
gave a talk

237
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,000
and i sort of attended and i uh he there

238
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,839
so he was asked a math question and i

239
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,120
sort of answered it and then your

240
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,360
community like welcomed me so that

241
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,640
that's how i got here but i don't know

242
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,200
how i got here that makes sense

243
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,160
awesome thank you and yep excuse any

244
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,880
strange

245
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,320
noises in my background um

246
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,880
what is active inference i really liked

247
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,080
just a bunch of

248
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,399
pieces that people brought up robert you

249
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,519
brought up that

250
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,920
there's this action element this

251
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,640
pragmatic

252
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,600
turn uh looking at action and perception

253
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,560
in the world

254
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,240
and then right there the second word is

255
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,480
inference and that's that transcendental

256
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,200
or like a kantian type approach so when

257
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
i look at active inference i see

258
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,480
action and inference sounds a little uh

259
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
first level but those are the two pieces

260
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,680
that are coming together

261
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,240
which is traditions of action in the

262
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,880
world

263
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,600
and traditions of inference in the world

264
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,399
now as

265
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,959
compares with reinforcement learning or

266
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,640
other approaches to thinking about

267
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,600
agency and action in the world or other

268
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,079
economic

269
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,399
metaphors active inference diverges in a

270
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,240
few key ways

271
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,320
it focuses on the reduction of

272
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,440
uncertainty

273
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,600
rather than the maximization of for

274
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,760
example reward or value alone

275
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,399
so uncertainty reduction is a key

276
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,920
component of active inference

277
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,600
and also what adam brought up which is

278
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,440
the resistance to dissipation

279
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,600
and the characteristics of living

280
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,240
systems to be actively resisting

281
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
by making increasingly adequate

282
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,560
generative models of their niche

283
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,959
resisting dissipation and then also i

284
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,440
see active inference as a bridge

285
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,000
to disciplines and communities such as

286
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,200
systems engineering

287
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,480
or ecological psychology or embodiment

288
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,320
and so all these different areas that

289
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,600
relate in one way

290
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,720
to action and inference or to

291
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,040
philosophy there's so many roads that

292
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,920
come together

293
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,240
at active inference and that's a little

294
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,040
bit about

295
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,360
how i think i got here as well i

296
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,200
remember hearing about it for the first

297
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,920
time

298
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,399
from yella brunenberg who came on an

299
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,680
earlier stream

300
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,399
and it was a picture of i think a dutch

301
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:08,880
person

302
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,560
holding a cup of coffee and listening to

303
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,720
music and biking with one hand

304
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
and asking about this question of skill

305
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
and of action in the world

306
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,680
and just raising this provocative notion

307
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,440
that current models that we had for

308
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:21,920
action

309
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,480
planning weren't doing their job they

310
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,000
weren't able to explain that person on a

311
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,880
bicycle

312
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,200
so since then i've just been learning by

313
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,480
doing

314
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,800
so cool for this first question and i'm

315
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,839
sure we can return

316
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,240
back to it and ask more questions about

317
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,360
active inference

318
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,440
as we head on and of course anybody

319
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,640
who's watching live is

320
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,560
more than welcome to ask us a question

321
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,360
which i'll relay on

322
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,240
let's go to some of our questions that

323
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,160
we've thought about before

324
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,760
and this slide asks what is the role

325
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,959
of space in active inference

326
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,360
or in other areas that people are

327
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,200
familiar with working

328
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,839
and what is the role of time and then we

329
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,839
have that non-locality for both

330
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,200
space and time because

331
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,560
maybe we're curious about what

332
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,800
non-locality looks like in space and

333
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,760
time

334
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,279
so anyone's welcome to raise their hand

335
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,760
or

336
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,320
give a first thought danielle can i give

337
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,440
her a first thought

338
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,839
that was yeah yeah so in the

339
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,200
probabilistic setting and the

340
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,560
statistical mechanics that's the

341
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,680
mathematics that

342
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,000
fuels active inference right and before

343
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,120
you have me trying to come in and

344
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,800
categorify everything

345
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,040
um just for the active inference um kind

346
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,399
of experts in the crowd i was going to

347
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:36,959
ask you

348
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,560
um the role of space

349
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,079
like what is it so are you you know

350
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,680
modeling all of this on some kind of

351
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,600
euclidean sort of

352
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,480
uh manifold or are we looking at you

353
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,560
know something a little more interesting

354
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,959
so where i come from i'm sort of if you

355
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,560
really believe there's only now

356
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,399
then what does that actually translate

357
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,680
to so if we're going to take these sort

358
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,279
of powerful philosophies

359
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,079
of like you know if there really is no

360
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,680
future and you only act or the future of

361
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,880
some kind of potential that you only

362
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,240
actualize now

363
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,920
can you translate that for me into what

364
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,680
your space looks like so quantum

365
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,040
mechanics is working over

366
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,600
sort of non-archimedean space where you

367
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,360
have a very severe cut off

368
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,200
you don't have these infinitesimals and

369
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,120
things so

370
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,200
what like what does the space actually

371
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,560
look like for someone like

372
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,200
me who really believes that this sort of

373
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,760
in this interface is discretized

374
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
that every other nanosecond it does not

375
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,600
exist like whatever that means so this

376
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,000
whole thing

377
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,160
is a grand interpolation i just wanted

378
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,760
to know what y'all thought

379
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,800
about um in this inference model if

380
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,880
space is actually jagged and singular

381
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,160
or if you're assuming that it's some

382
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,480
sort of interpolated continuity

383
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,320
nice question adam you have a thought

384
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,760
there

385
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,000
um a few um

386
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,720
the

387
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,680
so most of my thinking has been in um

388
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,320
focusing on goal-oriented behavior uh

389
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,120
consciousness

390
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,800
agency pursuing goals and

391
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,519
this is in general the that's what i'm

392
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,519
gunning for and that's like

393
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,959
all questions end up getting filtered

394
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,199
through that for me but

395
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,120
um and

396
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,519
so for instance and i could see space

397
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,639
and time

398
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,600
uh in different senses showing up in

399
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,000
different

400
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,480
ways so um

401
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,560
a theory of consciousness i uh recently

402
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,120
proposed um i was suggesting that

403
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,639
we can think of it in terms of world

404
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,800
modeling but for this role modeling to

405
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,600
actually

406
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,519
be capable of um bringing forth the

407
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,519
world or being experienceable

408
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,160
it has to have certain um coherence

409
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,040
properties

410
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,600
and so i was thinking of con synthetic

411
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,959
operatory categories

412
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,360
as not just preconditions for judgment

413
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,240
space time

414
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,639
cause maybe some sort of uh unifying

415
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,880
minimal selfhood um but

416
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,720
these are also preconditions for any

417
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
kind of sense making whatsoever and for

418
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,880
the appearance of the world

419
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,079
people could object to that but um

420
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,360
then the question well what exactly do

421
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,040
you mean by space time and cause and

422
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,680
self

423
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,120
uh how much and what kinds and which

424
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,800
circumstances

425
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,680
and so for me space i tend to think of

426
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,079
it

427
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,279
more in terms of locality or there's

428
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,600
like

429
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,079
relative degrees of proximity among

430
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,199
things

431
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,880
and then uh there's

432
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,600
for time it would be things changing

433
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,160
within

434
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,959
space in a kind of proportional sense

435
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,240
like there's other senses of time like

436
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,040
you could have

437
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,920
some sort of like clock-like processes

438
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,440
that are like either in parallel and

439
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,399
coming to agreement or

440
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,040
like centralized and another sense of um

441
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
certain bottlenecks that force

442
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,839
a kind of temporal ordering um or you

443
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,120
could just thinking about like

444
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,800
things changing the things at different

445
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,720
uh rates there's

446
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,240
i think problematic circularity in what

447
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,839
i said but in terms of the senses of

448
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,079
space um

449
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,240
well i'll stop there but i could keep

450
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,959
going later no

451
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,399
cool just a few i guess basic

452
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,079
thoughts on space i thought about

453
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,839
embodied agents

454
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,040
and how an agent has a location in a

455
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,000
spatial

456
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,120
model so like the active inference paper

457
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,079
that we had where

458
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,360
different ants were at a different

459
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,279
location in space

460
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,399
now there's a difference between the

461
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,560
space that the actual physical thing is

462
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,920
in and then the model which kind of

463
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,360
relates to this

464
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,480
kantian distinction perhaps but even

465
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
when we have a disembodied agent there's

466
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,360
a state space

467
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,040
so i don't know what is the relationship

468
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
between a mathematical state space

469
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,399
and whatever you were mentioning there

470
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,639
previously and then as for time it just

471
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,079
made me think about the distinction

472
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:00,720
between

473
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,160
kronos and kairos where chronos being

474
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,119
like sort of a

475
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,079
metric or a measured time like a model

476
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,480
of time or something that's regularized

477
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,599
and then kairos being timeliness

478
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,480
and action happens kind of in both

479
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,079
action takes clock time

480
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,199
to carry out but also action has its own

481
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,599
time scale and actions have their own

482
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,559
sort of story arc

483
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,000
yeah blue go for it and then anyone else

484
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,640
who raised their hand

485
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,120
so space is something that i've thought

486
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,240
about a lot

487
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,919
um relative to like my previous work and

488
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,679
and i think about it a lot also in terms

489
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,120
of boundaries right

490
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,799
so where does one thing stop and another

491
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,520
thing

492
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,960
start um and you know like even

493
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,640
something so simple as like how do i

494
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,000
define like

495
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,240
my fingernail like where is the boundary

496
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,919
between like your fingernail and your

497
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,760
cuticle and anybody who's like really

498
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,799
dug in there like

499
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,400
there's some parts of your cuticle that

500
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,240
is you're like is this am i supposed to

501
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,440
cut this or what like

502
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,600
like so there's there's not a clear

503
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,440
distinction or

504
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,160
or line that can be drawn around what is

505
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,640
my

506
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,120
thing right and and so trying to find

507
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,720
this this distinct boundary

508
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,919
also in terms of inclusion in a group um

509
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:22,160
and

510
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,720
i listened to your last uh math stream

511
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,520
um

512
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,320
shanna and daniel and i was i was really

513
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,120
kind of um

514
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,080
thinking about this and i've been

515
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,640
thinking about cancer a lot in terms of

516
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,360
inclusion in a group um as you guys were

517
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,480
talking about that

518
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,400
and it's like i also think about it as

519
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,679
like a school shooter

520
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,679
like a cancer cell goes rogue like

521
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,919
they're somehow not included in the

522
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,039
group but they're not part of the

523
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,799
collective anymore and then they take on

524
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,760
their own like

525
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,080
self-interested agenda and i also think

526
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,520
about that like in terms of a school

527
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,280
shooter or someone that like commits

528
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,720
mass violence

529
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,559
and you know like when you have this

530
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,320
kind of you it's someone that's not

531
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,760
included in a group it's someone

532
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,200
that even is not included in like like a

533
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,720
rebel group like the al-qaeda or

534
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,840
something they're rejected from that

535
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,520
group also so when when they can't find

536
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,559
inclusion

537
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,799
they become like this rogue agent and so

538
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,799
so kind of i think about space as

539
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,640
as in where do you draw that line i have

540
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,160
a hard time

541
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,000
finding that space and it's something i

542
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,240
like to push on and then time

543
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,640
i don't really work with time too much

544
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,799
like actually per se other than like i

545
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,160
have to deal with like this

546
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,840
linear time that we're trapped in but i

547
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,000
do think about expansion and compression

548
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,559
of time

549
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,600
relative to age so like as a young

550
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,799
person like time seems to be so expanded

551
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,760
like five minutes is forever and as you

552
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,600
get older in life like a year just flies

553
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:41,919
by

554
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,559
right so so like as time it's it's

555
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,000
expanded as a young

556
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
person and then compressed as you seem

557
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,240
to age through life

558
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,400
thank you blue robert and sean

559
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,360
yeah thank you so much more of a

560
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,320
question than something

561
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
really interesting to say but it's a

562
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,600
question for you maybe

563
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,360
you can give me a good answer because

564
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,280
here on on this slide there's

565
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,120
the second world which is in parenthesis

566
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,799
which is non-locality

567
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,520
and i my guess is that jenna put it

568
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,679
there

569
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,520
and my my question would be whether

570
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,440
there is anything

571
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,000
that remotely resembles some notion of

572
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,039
non-local

573
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,080
inactive inference

574
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,120
to make that more concrete my impression

575
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,799
when i when i read articles by people

576
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,360
who

577
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,360
endorse active inference or work in that

578
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,640
area is that they usually

579
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,799
work against a very classical notion of

580
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,640
space and time as a background

581
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,559
so you mentioned the ants that move in

582
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,679
physical space

583
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,520
and that's usually assumed to be a

584
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,440
classical one or if you

585
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,679
i don't know if you if you think about

586
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,960
the cell

587
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,200
and you apply apply the concepts to a

588
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,360
cell then you say okay the molecules

589
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,679
it's a classical thing so there's no

590
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,000
notion of non-locality there

591
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,440
i guess i don't know um and my question

592
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,320
would be

593
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,120
um how whether and how an active

594
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,960
inference could accommodate some notion

595
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,840
of non-locality

596
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,919
nice question we can definitely wonder

597
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,039
and come back to that um

598
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,080
shauna and then adam yeah

599
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,320
um thanks yeah so just to get to the

600
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,760
time part because i

601
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,440
hadn't talked about that so thanks blue

602
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,760
for watching the last stream

603
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,679
i'm really fascinated by time and i

604
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,520
don't think my time really works linear

605
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,799
it's really hard to say like

606
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,440
uh where is yesterday you can do this

607
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,080
sort of

608
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,799
light cone sort of formulation and if

609
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,159
you want to general like

610
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,159
relativity it then you can say oh yeah

611
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,080
yesterday is in the light cone of

612
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,360
whatever you know so um but like what is

613
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,720
it and where is it so

614
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,400
when i asked like about the role of time

615
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,840
the thing that i'm sort of that i've

616
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,200
proposed in that fmf

617
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,240
um k theory diamond paper that i have

618
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,640
about

619
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,960
like the applications of all this stuff

620
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,880
of this higher category stuff

621
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,120
is to think that maybe time is more like

622
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,440
a pro time so in math you have this pro

623
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,960
object which is glued together from a

624
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,400
bunch of like um

625
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,200
morphisms and other collections of it so

626
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,919
it seems that if time is this

627
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,960
thing that is also emergent um i'm the

628
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,919
advocate that it's not

629
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,320
fixed right i'm also an advocate that i

630
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,520
don't really know how you measure time

631
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,039
without constructing it

632
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,480
so i'm not sure that we're actually

633
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,559
constructing a notion of now or does it

634
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,440
actually exist

635
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,640
so an active difference since you're

636
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,640
constructing you know every

637
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,799
every second of whatever every unit of

638
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,679
time

639
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,720
um you know how how can you actually

640
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,000
uh measure the inference without

641
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,760
constructing a parallel notion of time

642
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,200
like in the same thing

643
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,640
so like when adam's talking about

644
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,080
coherence and you know if you need a

645
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,240
coherence property for temporality

646
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,880
um to actually give you a singular now

647
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,679
or something

648
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:52,799
what does that actually look like so

649
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,240
robert's right that was me that put the

650
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,600
non-locality in there

651
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,360
because we we have like a rough idea of

652
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,520
the non-locality of space you can have a

653
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,440
two-point perspective of space something

654
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,240
like

655
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,679
uh you know my if in my state where i'm

656
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,039
i'm not like an entangled pair of

657
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,720
photons i can

658
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,120
clearly say oh silver lake is over there

659
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,919
and i'm in my

660
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,440
condo on the other side there's a sort

661
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
of separated distance but

662
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,799
according to a pair of entangled photons

663
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,400
there is no separated distance

664
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,159
and so you have a two-point perspective

665
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,799
of space so as in the mastering that i

666
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,240
did last time with dana we were you know

667
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,200
trying to figure out

668
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,720
is there actually a two-point

669
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,280
perspective of time can you actually

670
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,400
be a macro system and say that this is

671
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,080
purely non-local so i really i really

672
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,520
like robert's questions saying where is

673
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,880
the non-locality

674
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,320
i'm trying to build that into the very

675
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,240
mathematics of the thing

676
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,120
um of trying to categorify this awesome

677
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,159
formalism

678
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,720
but yeah so just time i think is it's

679
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,480
very strange and i think it's something

680
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,480
that we should all probably try to

681
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,240
try to tackle instead of assuming that

682
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,000
it's always there it's just some

683
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,679
background phenomena but

684
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,520
if time is emergent and space is

685
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,880
emergent also

686
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,240
then it sounds like active inference is

687
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,840
the right dynamical formalism that could

688
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,960
actually

689
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,400
you know kind of help that too because

690
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,000
maybe the agent is also making

691
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
time at the same time that it's making

692
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,760
you know um a world thanks

693
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,320
yeah we've seen active inference models

694
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,520
where at each time step

695
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,159
of the model the agent does like a roll

696
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:20,559
out

697
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,840
through the future that's called

698
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
sophisticated active inference

699
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,360
and then also it's a great point about

700
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,600
the multiple reference points we have

701
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,760
two eyes at different spatial locations

702
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,320
and that's how we infer depth which

703
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,679
isn't just a feature of the world

704
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:34,799
because it's something that we

705
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,320
have to infer and therefore it's

706
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,559
susceptible to optical illusions

707
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,240
and then the question with time do we

708
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,080
have a monocle we only have one

709
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,520
reference point on time

710
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,840
because then we're going to be just

711
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,159
totally unable to calculate depth

712
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,640
or if we can calculate or experience

713
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,760
temporal depth

714
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,360
does that entail that we're having

715
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,520
multiple reference points in time

716
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,520
so adam and then anyone else

717
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,919
so try to bring a few threads together

718
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,000
um

719
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,120
so some of the top what i'm really

720
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,919
liking

721
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,320
um about what blue and sham are just

722
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,960
saying

723
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,600
is this sort of um relational realism so

724
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,640
instead of saying like

725
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,880
you know what is time what is space

726
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,679
period

727
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,880
um well what is it relative to what and

728
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,440
then

729
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,400
um what is it and when i say coherence

730
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
coherence relative to what

731
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,240
um and so

732
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,279
and let's kind of backtrack some

733
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,440
um

734
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,799
in the kantian issue of like is it that

735
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,720
or just interacting

736
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,760
and and or is it that we're modeling

737
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,919
and the modeling is just a kind of a

738
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,520
pretense that's useful

739
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,400
for describing this like sea of forces

740
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,039
and that

741
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,600
goes beyond description um i think we

742
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,799
can have both

743
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,679
uh and so what i tend to do is view

744
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:00,880
interesting

745
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,919
systems um in terms of an active

746
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:04,880
inference also like

747
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,960
you have nested markov blankets and you

748
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,400
have nested

749
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,600
kind of nested hierarchy of dynamics

750
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,400
and so you could think of for instance a

751
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,440
set of coupling

752
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,760
uh processes some sort of chaining

753
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,919
together of dissipative systems

754
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,919
that manages to stitch itself you know

755
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,120
hold the cell together

756
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,880
through the way it's chained and this

757
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,559
could couple with the world

758
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,240
in a way that doesn't require

759
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,000
necessarily there might be like an

760
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,960
implicit

761
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,360
representation to it if you want to use

762
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,799
the word in that way of like a

763
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,200
correspondence between the dynamics

764
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,240
and like what is evolving

765
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,520
um or you could

766
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,640
that's like but it's not necessarily it

767
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,080
may not be inference in the sense of

768
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,880
like

769
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,480
the model like whether you want to say

770
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,559
that this modeling process is is

771
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,880
real or a way of viewing things that's

772
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,720
it's a matter of perspective

773
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,760
but then as you add layers of complexity

774
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,960
then you can get things like um

775
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,080
inner loop processes that could

776
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,440
refer to this set of kind of

777
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,039
action relations and bringing things

778
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,039
together and then you could even maybe

779
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,320
have on top of those

780
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,600
or within those another process which

781
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,399
points to

782
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,880
those so graphs pointing at graphs

783
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,480
pointing at graphs and so like

784
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,840
shannon's like category theoretic

785
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,159
perspective would be very relevant here

786
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,159
um but and so at some levels you might

787
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,360
talk of things like representations in a

788
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,120
cartesian sense like in good

789
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,480
old-fashioned cognitive science we may

790
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,520
have those

791
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,279
and we have an activist intelligent

792
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,120
coupling where it's just implicit

793
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,399
representation and maybe we shouldn't

794
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,440
even use that word

795
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,000
or maybe we should use that word i'm not

796
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,120
going to say

797
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,000
but i think we can have it all and so

798
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,440
the

799
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,320
um way that you think like space and

800
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,200
time

801
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
um from these nested systems i think

802
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,360
there could be in a way a kind of

803
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,080
non-locality and that they would be

804
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,440
evolving

805
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,039
independent like they're evolving on

806
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,880
their own time skills like a nested deep

807
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,559
hierarchy of dynamics

808
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,760
there's a sense which they're all kind

809
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,080
of brought together by virtue of like

810
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,720
sharing this markov blanket that they

811
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,159
ultimately agree so i guess

812
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,760
i don't know if that would be but

813
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,360
there's a there's potentially ways

814
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,919
that can diverge also and so it seems

815
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,919
like you could have maybe periods

816
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,559
of non-locality and locality and

817
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,919
actually this kind of going

818
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,559
in and out and probably butchering and

819
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,240
abusing the terminology i apologize

820
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,600
but this going in and out might even be

821
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,240
like necessary like necessary for a kind

822
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,320
of dual phase evolution for the systems

823
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,200
to couple

824
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,360
for them to like trade off their free

825
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,039
energy for them to

826
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,399
do what they do is this sort of like

827
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,960
iterative inferring their own existence

828
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,360
and

829
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,399
doing what they need to do process but

830
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,840
so within this view it seems like time

831
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,880
can show up

832
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,120
in multiple ways there's like the uh the

833
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,559
the time of just um

834
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,720
the world is a as this evolving graph is

835
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,080
a generative process in that way in

836
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,200
terms of if there's

837
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,240
um a kind of with it if

838
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,600
we narrow it in um to a particular

839
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,720
system like there's like some things

840
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,559
were before and some things were after

841
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,840
in terms of this

842
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,320
sea of causal influences but then you

843
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,760
might get another kind of time of this

844
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,960
psychological time

845
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,320
of you know spatializing time of

846
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,080
uh and then navigating through

847
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,000
spatialized time

848
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,279
and same things for space and then it

849
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,720
comes in again um

850
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
one more thing i guess i would say is uh

851
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,279
the issue of space and time

852
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,960
i think uh it's going to be

853
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,080
two things about that so one idea i'm

854
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,520
playing with is actually that um

855
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,679
our consciousness is actually the

856
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,640
spatial

857
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,320
kind of it in terms of visual spatial at

858
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,960
least it's actually always 2d

859
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,720
and that to the extent that we have

860
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,000
something like a 3d

861
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,080
awareness of space it's coherent state

862
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,440
transitions

863
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,559
of these 2d projections and there might

864
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:04,880
be

865
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,159
a relevance to holography there

866
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,240
that's one thing to put inside but then

867
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,520
one more thing would be

868
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,159
um and then you have maybe like a 3d

869
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,840
type space in terms of body space so

870
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,360
you'd have like a visual spatial

871
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,799
cartesian space and then like space

872
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,080
relative to the body

873
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,840
maybe like a kind of quasi-polar

874
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,840
coordinate space and between the two of

875
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,480
them

876
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,679
you can get a kind of like 3d spacing

877
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,760
coming out of this or or 4d space

878
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,200
because there's dynamics

879
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,360
yeah um but the one more thing about

880
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,240
um subsuming space and time to action

881
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,600
relative to what

882
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,320
is i think this will be crucial for

883
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,440
boundaries in terms of

884
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,600
what counts as a living system or not

885
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,480
and

886
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
what would count as a conscious system

887
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,320
or not of what kinds what are the

888
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,000
physical and computational substrates

889
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,320
of consciousness what kind of closure is

890
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,480
achieved on what scales

891
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,320
uh that issue i think um

892
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,039
so what i would like to have happen is

893
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:03,760
either

894
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,559
some sort of um definitive handling of

895
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,679
this some sort of like category

896
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,519
theoretic definitive handling

897
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,000
that would basically nail it hard

898
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,640
problem

899
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,440
solved schrodinger's question answered

900
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,640
unambiguous

901
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,399
or i want a proof that this is

902
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,080
impossible and then i can rest

903
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,399
thanks adam maybe robert was alluding to

904
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,159
this with the skepticism but for me

905
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,919
whether something is answered or not

906
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,399
it's a psychological story that

907
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,919
we're telling and you could be convinced

908
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,760
about something that whether it's proven

909
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,519
to be impossible or proven to be ruled

910
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,080
in

911
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,240
that would be a story and then also nice

912
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,200
about the

913
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,679
projective geometry we talked about the

914
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:44,880
projective geometry

915
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,679
paper some time ago about how we can

916
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,120
look at something like the corner of a

917
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,519
room

918
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,039
and even though the angles are going in

919
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,799
weird directions we kind of

920
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,320
infer it to be rectilinear so

921
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,960
that's pretty cool any um thoughts here

922
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,480
a quick thing in the projective geometry

923
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,080
actually um i

924
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,159
really love uh david rubroff's work on

925
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,000
that because it's like putting

926
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,919
it's a discussion of consciousness that

927
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,039
like puts

928
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,880
a person or puts an observer in

929
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,080
subjectivity

930
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,000
and interest like right at the center of

931
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,159
it

932
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,600
one thing i'm wondering about is

933
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,960
what is like the realization of this

934
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,880
sort of

935
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,120
projective geometric perspective engine

936
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,039
that he's thinking we have

937
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,480
um for spatial awareness um

938
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,399
it seems like uh there could be

939
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,640
like a sense that just that this is

940
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,519
something

941
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,039
the brain can do like there's some

942
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,480
proposals for something like this like

943
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,320
hinton has capsule networks

944
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,480
um uh numenta has like their thousand

945
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,519
brains that like

946
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,799
there is a kind of um

947
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,320
reference frame dependent modeling

948
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,000
happen happening in a distributed

949
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,760
way and that's part of the architecture

950
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,919
or they're just like somehow through it

951
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,559
it's it works as this graphics engine i

952
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,240
actually think it might be um

953
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,000
a more uh um an active type

954
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,640
thing in a string where actually the

955
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,279
reason

956
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,399
you get this projective um geometric

957
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,240
perspective capacity is because of this

958
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,039
coupling

959
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,840
between body space and visual space

960
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,640
linked by

961
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,559
different kinds of affordance relations

962
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,240
and that this is actually

963
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,080
part of what's letting you do these

964
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,440
state transitions

965
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,240
and do this kind of projective geometric

966
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,760
modeling rather than it being

967
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,360
baked in a distributed way like some

968
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,880
sort of graphics engine

969
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,399
but this is another way in which like

970
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,960
for instance um embodiment and interest

971
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,840
and value kind of other things get

972
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,600
subsumed to that

973
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,960
like thanks and

974
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,720
anyone can raise their hand just one

975
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,519
thought on that is action requires time

976
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,080
action is almost defined as a sequence

977
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,240
and then we have the policy variables

978
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,799
the pi

979
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,000
that's our kind of active lab pi because

980
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,840
policy is at the level above

981
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,120
a certain active state but action and

982
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,359
policies they do take time so there's

983
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,960
something time like built into our

984
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,000
models because

985
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,520
what we're talking about and the

986
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,879
inferring the state transitions just

987
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,918
like you described

988
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,879
all those are temporal and then the

989
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:19,440
non-locality

990
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,960
um it's kind of like when and drawing on

991
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,000
fristen's older work with dynamic causal

992
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,800
modeling and

993
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,199
statistical parametric mapping you have

994
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,399
an image of the brain

995
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,800
that's changing through time and then

996
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,520
you can make

997
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,320
one type of connected graph with pieces

998
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,839
of the brain that are anatomically

999
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:38,639
connected

1000
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,480
and so when people think about space

1001
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,679
usually that's what they're thinking

1002
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,679
about things that are touching

1003
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,000
but then also you could have effective

1004
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,679
or functional connectivity

1005
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,639
so you could have regions that are local

1006
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:50,960
in

1007
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,239
cause but that local link

1008
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,280
in the causal network could be

1009
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,440
due to some upstream factor that's

1010
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,040
influencing them both

1011
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,599
so causal proximity or functional

1012
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,040
proximity

1013
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,920
may or may not be the same as some

1014
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,720
things that's

1015
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,480
touching so not sure where they're

1016
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,359
where that puts us but cool stuff

1017
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,040
daniel can you say a little bit more

1018
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,280
about like with regards to

1019
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,400
what you just laid out with um um

1020
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,800
action requires requiring time in the

1021
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,280
minimization of surprise

1022
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,760
so is there something in your in the

1023
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,520
active inference formalism

1024
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,680
when we say minimization of surprise is

1025
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,440
there an agent that is

1026
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,640
creating scenarios like dinosaur there's

1027
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,079
no dinosaur in silver but they could be

1028
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,200
a dinosaur i don't

1029
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,960
want dinosaur so i'm going to act in

1030
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,720
such a way as to preclude the very

1031
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,160
possibility of dinosaur

1032
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,760
right so when we say minimization

1033
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,200
um where where is that coming from

1034
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,520
so is that cut again is that is there a

1035
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,320
profound

1036
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,720
creativity that is the basis of this

1037
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,320
system that is launching these

1038
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,760
probabilities right because bayesian

1039
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,560
probabilities

1040
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,520
it doesn't like it seems kind of dull

1041
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,040
right it never says that there's this

1042
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,400
highly creative being

1043
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,560
that is imagining these scenarios that

1044
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,240
they wants to preclude

1045
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,440
so can y'all tell me like where's that

1046
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,520
coming from or has the agent seen

1047
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,640
a dinosaur in you know in l.a walking

1048
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,920
down the street and they go i don't want

1049
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,280
to see that again

1050
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,160
therefore preclude therefore action like

1051
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,440
the action of

1052
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,480
minimizing surprise requires time but

1053
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,240
it's a diff it's an imaginary time

1054
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,320
it's sort of like i don't want that to

1055
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,599
happen again therefore i'm going to act

1056
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,480
in such a way

1057
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,000
as to preclude the very existence of

1058
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,640
dinosaur does any of that make sense

1059
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,320
well as for dinosaurs we know that

1060
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,760
they're in the land before time

1061
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,880
so that is you know clean and done well

1062
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,400
something called scary minimizing

1063
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,160
surprise you know yes

1064
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,880
as for the minimizing the expected free

1065
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,000
energy or

1066
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,200
minimizing the surprise one of the sort

1067
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,079
of tricks

1068
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,079
of active inference is to condition that

1069
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,440
upon a policy

1070
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
if you look at the topology of the

1071
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,880
graphical model

1072
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,200
policies are getting um plugged into

1073
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,119
the state transitions between hidden

1074
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,320
states and then

1075
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,560
what's being minimized is the surprise

1076
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,800
of the sensory outcomes that are emitted

1077
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,359
by the hidden states so at the first

1078
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,839
pass without getting into this

1079
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,720
like meta bayesian creative energy

1080
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,599
the agent has a set of policies that it

1081
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,560
can carry out those are the affordances

1082
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,720
and then conditioning on each of these

1083
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,920
policy options

1084
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,200
if they're discreet like i could turn

1085
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,520
left or turn right and then i'm gonna

1086
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,680
do a conditional expectation on turning

1087
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,119
left as my policy or

1088
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,280
conditional expectation on turning right

1089
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,800
on my policy

1090
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,079
which one of those is going to in my

1091
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,920
prediction of how that policy changes

1092
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,400
the state transition matrix

1093
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,960
what is going to result in less

1094
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,000
surprising

1095
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,200
sensory outcomes that is for a

1096
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,920
sort of fixed set of policy options that

1097
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,400
can be conditioned on

1098
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,200
but it's a great question about how do

1099
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,640
we go from the known

1100
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,400
into the unknown how does the agent

1101
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,960
learn a new affordance or maybe even

1102
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,000
generate a new affordance internally

1103
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,760
so there's probably a lot to be said on

1104
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,440
that but one way that active inference

1105
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,720
speaks to it is that when we focus

1106
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,560
on action hand in hand with inference

1107
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,400
we can think like how could the agent

1108
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,640
ever navigate a new kind of physical

1109
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,440
obstacle

1110
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,040
like there's some kind of a wall that

1111
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,680
you've never climbed before

1112
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,920
but what has to be inferred isn't like

1113
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,839
what's on the other side of the wall or

1114
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,599
to the nth degree the details of the

1115
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,079
wall it's enough to have a model

1116
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,359
of bodily action and a preference for

1117
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,480
being higher up and potentially

1118
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,079
the affordances that the agent does

1119
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,880
control it does know about those things

1120
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,800
like the movement of the joints that

1121
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
will help it deal with the unknown

1122
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,400
because it's not just approaching

1123
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,480
uncertainty as like something that has

1124
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:04,960
to be

1125
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,920
eradicated by determining exactly what's

1126
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,359
out there in the world

1127
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,680
uncertainty is something that's actively

1128
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,200
negotiated with

1129
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,160
through usage of the affordances that

1130
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,279
the agent already has

1131
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,560
right and when you say that are the

1132
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,480
affordances constructed

1133
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,240
are they conditions of the system are

1134
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,400
they properties of the system

1135
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,040
like what is the space of uh affordances

1136
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,839
and is there to

1137
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,520
like a topology on the on the

1138
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,599
affordances because i'm still

1139
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,839
like you know if we categorify any of

1140
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,280
this there's a you know if you work in

1141
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,119
two spaces or anything like this like

1142
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,200
all you know um or in the in the

1143
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,640
reflective subcategory which i always

1144
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,839
talk about these objects have

1145
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,200
reflections and

1146
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,960
i'm still not thoroughly convinced that

1147
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,359
there is no duality between a system and

1148
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,640
its environment

1149
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,560
right so if they're working together

1150
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,079
perhaps these are like you know

1151
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,960
dually in a sort of mathematical sense

1152
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,520
um

1153
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,000
so if if that's the case then i just

1154
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,760
want to know are affordances like

1155
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,160
a property of the system constructed or

1156
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,599
conditions

1157
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,720
um how like

1158
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,280
do they change radically is it dynamical

1159
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,960
nice questions the instrumentalist take

1160
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,800
so active inference is a statistical

1161
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,119
model that we made and it doesn't make

1162
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,119
metaphysical claims about what systems

1163
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,400
really can do

1164
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,400
it's a modeling approach in that case

1165
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,839
affordances are whatever the

1166
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:28,640
investigator

1167
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,079
puts into the model as affordances right

1168
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,520
then the question about what the

1169
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,440
system's affordances truly

1170
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,720
are that's a great question it comes

1171
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,680
back to how do systems

1172
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,839
apparently negotiate completely new

1173
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,079
affordances

1174
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,000
where where was flying a plane where

1175
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,440
does that come into play

1176
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,359
exactly well is that part of our

1177
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,480
extended

1178
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,240
niche part of our constructed niche and

1179
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,920
so we can think about that in terms of

1180
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,400
just

1181
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,240
the same eyesight that we had before and

1182
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,599
the same finger movements

1183
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,000
that we had access to before but now

1184
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,520
it's being deployed

1185
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,520
in a different niche so the extended

1186
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,640
cognitive outcome

1187
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,040
is just radically different so in the

1188
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,560
case of tooling

1189
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,599
and language as a tool and and usage of

1190
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,800
instruments

1191
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,240
potentially one could argue that it's

1192
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,000
still the bodily affordances that are

1193
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,280
being used

1194
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,520
but higher order contingencies are being

1195
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,800
learned by the system

1196
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,079
to be able to play piano or fly a plane

1197
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,560
so the affordance of turning the plane

1198
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,359
left

1199
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,280
can be still seen as moving your hand to

1200
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,880
the left on a joystick

1201
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,960
conditioned on an agent who understands

1202
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,319
that their preference is to move that

1203
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,040
way

1204
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,440
and now has this sort of mapping between

1205
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,640
what they do with their hand on the

1206
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,359
joystick

1207
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,640
and where the plane goes

1208
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,280
but what kinds of new bodily affordances

1209
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,680
you know can we have that's

1210
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,960
right and they think and they take

1211
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,359
different forms that's what's cool

1212
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,440
blue and then anyone else with a raised

1213
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,680
hand

1214
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,880
so i was thinking about affordances in

1215
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,319
relation to time

1216
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,400
and also like in release relation to the

1217
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,920
last math stream

1218
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,319
when you guys were talking about how um

1219
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,119
like when does

1220
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,440
memory start to form right and so like

1221
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,680
as you're looking at your reflections

1222
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,599
in the diamond like there's you're

1223
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,040
looking at your reflections and then

1224
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,560
there comes a space maybe where you can

1225
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,599
reach your reflection

1226
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:20,880
i don't remember if that was exactly how

1227
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,319
it was worded but that's like when maybe

1228
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,079
memory starts to crystallize

1229
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,839
something like that maybe if maybe i

1230
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,359
butchered it do you want to step in and

1231
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,560
correct me

1232
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,240
no okay sorry um so then

1233
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,000
you know i was thinking about like when

1234
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,520
you have young kids

1235
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520
and they perceive time right i talked

1236
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,119
about expansion and compression about

1237
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,400
time a little bit earlier

1238
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,560
so when a kid perceives time a small

1239
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,000
child everything is

1240
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,119
like yesterday or tomorrow right like

1241
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,000
there's no

1242
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,599
like concept of next week like they

1243
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,200
don't even know what a week is right so

1244
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
like you have these new affordances like

1245
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:53,440
the

1246
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,839
that come with learning right otherwise

1247
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:56,960
it's just before

1248
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,839
or next right like it's interesting and

1249
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,440
so when do these affordances like

1250
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,440
does that correspond to maybe the

1251
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,560
ability to to

1252
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,839
reach your own reflection in the

1253
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,760
diamonds

1254
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,440
and i flipped it here to what our

1255
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,520
thoughts so maybe

1256
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,880
if anyone has a thought on that what

1257
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,040
our thoughts are yep adam and then

1258
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,359
anyone else

1259
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,000
but actually before i go um if shanna

1260
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,800
wants to

1261
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,400
speak to a blue just said i'd actually

1262
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,079
like to hear that yeah

1263
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,400
go for it but then i have thoughts yep

1264
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,680
yep yeah yeah

1265
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,000
uh okay feel free well i think it's sort

1266
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,359
of integrated yet uh you know the

1267
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,079
diamonds are

1268
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,640
um um very difficult objects right that

1269
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,720
i was thinking that could be

1270
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,440
the perfect model i shouldn't say

1271
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,000
perfect

1272
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,560
a more perfect model of what's going on

1273
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,520
um

1274
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,079
uh with memory right so you have these

1275
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:48,640
you know

1276
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,640
cases that i always talk about uh you

1277
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,319
know beautiful people like clive waring

1278
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,079
who have a three-second memory from

1279
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,200
a retrograde amnesia and so you have to

1280
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,240
ask

1281
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,560
someone like clyde like is he

1282
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,599
experiencing

1283
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,160
you know a complete temporal

1284
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,760
non-locality

1285
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,240
every two seconds the child right child

1286
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:08,800
mind

1287
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,760
um which i have a lot of right like for

1288
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,440
a child what are the conditions for

1289
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,000
object persistence right in their own

1290
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,119
very state

1291
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,960
you know um like with the diamond and

1292
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,280
things like that i think you can

1293
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,319
model what it means to have shanna

1294
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,560
when i'm six you know and shanna when

1295
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,920
i'm 85

1296
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,319
or something why is it the same shanna

1297
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,760
and i don't think it is

1298
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,720
like at all um so when you say something

1299
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,760
like like

1300
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
memory and what are you actually looking

1301
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,119
at so

1302
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,000
um i'm you know again if i think there's

1303
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,520
this duality between like the system and

1304
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,720
its environment

1305
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,720
um how can you actually visualize that

1306
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,319
in this in this sort of diamond

1307
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,119
mentality

1308
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,480
and so the thing about the diamond right

1309
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,119
is that if perhaps memory is some kind

1310
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,240
of impurity

1311
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,760
and you'll never actually get to it so

1312
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,680
if it if a memory is like a

1313
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,800
mineralogical impurity then you never

1314
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,000
actually get the impurity you just get

1315
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,599
the reflections of the whole thing

1316
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,280
and so to sort of take what blue said

1317
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,440
and just tighten it just a little bit

1318
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,520
that might be more of what's actually

1319
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,560
going on

1320
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,040
that perhaps the mineralogical impurity

1321
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,520
is that if maybe if you only have it now

1322
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,680
and that if you're not able to access

1323
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,040
all the other reflections

1324
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,720
that are on the diamond you may not have

1325
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,400
a future and you may not have you know

1326
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,839
an extended time

1327
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,599
but there's also something to say that

1328
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:26,880
has that diminished

1329
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,160
like your vibrant experience somebody

1330
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,280
like me who's like

1331
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,920
can really drop in can drop in very

1332
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,040
delusion like

1333
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,280
i am a degree of heat i am a degree of

1334
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,319
white i am a unit of sand

1335
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,119
his formalism is super powerful because

1336
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:43,839
it's giving

1337
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,480
um becoming an action to these

1338
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,560
individualities these husseiites right

1339
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,160
that somebody else would say have no

1340
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,680
turn in the unit of consciousness or

1341
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,480
something

1342
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,960
so i think what i'm trying to do combine

1343
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,920
this notion of

1344
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,319
becoming that is individual super

1345
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,160
individualistic like you know

1346
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,960
i am a spoon of coconut like a spoonful

1347
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,240
of coconut like that's it

1348
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,599
um with this notion of this diamond

1349
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:08,640
being

1350
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,079
and they're not just reflections right

1351
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,240
they're like pro finite reflections so

1352
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:12,960
they are

1353
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,319
um totally disconnected so that's sort

1354
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,119
of the mess

1355
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,599
that i'm sort of i think is like

1356
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,599
underlying the beginnings of memory

1357
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,160
maybe it's just this kind of pure mess

1358
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:24,640
and

1359
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,880
as you age or whatever age is sort of

1360
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,119
involved in these pro-ital coverings and

1361
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,040
so in the covering space

1362
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,160
uh you know if you're working uh

1363
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,520
through proprioception and things like

1364
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,720
that there's a lot of work in neurology

1365
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,160
saying that you know

1366
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,680
your brain probably processes more

1367
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,160
topologically if you're a child and you

1368
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,359
only have like a now

1369
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,720
and a bunch of points you don't really

1370
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,800
have a lot of covering spaces right

1371
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,040
um yeah so i think working with diamonds

1372
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,160
which you know we'll get to in a little

1373
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:50,560
bit

1374
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,319
so i think there's something definitely

1375
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,160
at play with you're staring at your

1376
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:54,880
memories

1377
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,480
right you're walking around in your past

1378
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,720
like all the time so i don't ever think

1379
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,920
you can actually get to the

1380
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,160
true memory and if unless you reach like

1381
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,400
the infant state again

1382
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,560
thanks adam ben robert

1383
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,839
so

1384
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,560
that's to revisit the affordance issue

1385
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,280
um

1386
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,760
so if i'm uh understanding things

1387
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,559
there could be in a way um you could say

1388
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:23,680
like in any given moment

1389
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,480
there's like a view from the outside

1390
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,200
like

1391
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,200
uh what were the what was the scope of

1392
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,400
the possibility

1393
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,160
of the actual interactions for the

1394
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,559
system uh

1395
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,800
given its configuration but because of

1396
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,559
niche construction that's also a moving

1397
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:39,359
target

1398
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,119
but then there could be another set of

1399
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,400
like perception of

1400
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,880
these affordances by the system where

1401
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,480
that perception itself

1402
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,319
changes the affordance structure and

1403
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,920
this can be of different variety so like

1404
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:50,880
the system

1405
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,680
and a kind of um uh dynamically self

1406
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,720
configuration

1407
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,160
um and like

1408
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,359
jostling around if was doing like

1409
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,440
implicit inference just figuring out

1410
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,720
sussing out what the affordance

1411
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,240
structure is and then this kind of

1412
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,599
implicit perception

1413
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,359
then there could be on another level

1414
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,040
like explicit

1415
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,000
affordance uh perception and each of

1416
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,040
these influencing

1417
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,040
the other and maybe operating uh

1418
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,280
differently and across purposes

1419
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,400
um with respect to

1420
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,680
uh i was just

1421
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,280
paraphrasing but trying to paraphrase

1422
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,680
whatever and i have my own twist sign

1423
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,440
um because this seems like a

1424
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,119
connected this a lot of things will

1425
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,680
connect to this um

1426
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,319
for memory

1427
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,160
i've been thinking of

1428
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,960
again back to consciousness and

1429
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,240
different forms of it

1430
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,880
um like what do we mean

1431
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,520
when we're accessing something again

1432
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,960
what does it take to remember things in

1433
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,920
different ways

1434
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,839
and how does our different kinds of

1435
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,000
awareness of what happened

1436
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,559
relate to our ability to remember these

1437
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:05,599
things

1438
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,559
and so you could have a kind of memory

1439
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:09,520
uh

1440
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,599
as just a sort of like baked in on what

1441
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,280
would they say a hysteresis a kind of

1442
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:13,920
like

1443
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,000
yeah you push in the thing and then it

1444
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,760
through its dynamics or through it's

1445
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,880
it's

1446
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,040
it's it's material properties just kind

1447
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,400
of holds the shape and you got a memory

1448
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:22,800
there

1449
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,520
of the indentation like a desire but in

1450
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,400
terms of this like

1451
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,480
holding onto memory like a clive wearing

1452
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,520
type memory

1453
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,599
and time does seem

1454
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,720
key for contextualization and like blue

1455
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,839
is saying about the way

1456
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,640
time changes with age it seems like that

1457
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,440
kind of time

1458
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,160
and the way we construct it one of the

1459
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,040
things you

1460
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,040
would say like we spatialize it and we

1461
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,079
spatialize it

1462
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,960
relative to what probably relative to

1463
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,359
you know

1464
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,920
us as an agent pursuing goals in the

1465
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,200
world with this

1466
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,480
the inference of different affordance

1467
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,200
structures but okay what what

1468
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,559
what are the different ways though that

1469
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,640
you can relate to this spatialized time

1470
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,520
into this

1471
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,559
uh maybe objectified you uh and then

1472
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:07,839
different ways of doing this what are

1473
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,200
the different kinds of self-reference

1474
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,960
involved

1475
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,839
that's a issue maybe get into later but

1476
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,280
one of the things i'm wondering in terms

1477
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,640
of memory

1478
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,480
uh and this might relate to um like uh

1479
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,880
impurities in the crystals is that the

1480
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,800
ability of things to get entangled to

1481
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,480
point to themselves in different ways so

1482
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,000
like within this like three second

1483
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:28,880
window

1484
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,359
there's maybe a sequence of frames of

1485
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:32,319
sense making

1486
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,920
but there's a broader frame of sense

1487
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,000
making of a causal unfolding

1488
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,839
that has a certain stability over which

1489
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:39,520
it can hold itself together

1490
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,640
but part of what would let this um

1491
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,000
specious present this um inherent

1492
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,440
depth to to the now might be this kind

1493
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,960
of self-reference

1494
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,760
where um the you know earlier frames of

1495
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,200
experience have predictive information

1496
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,200
about what follows but then what follows

1497
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,119
has information and points to what was

1498
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,559
in the past the kind of

1499
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,319
you know post-sticking the predicting

1500
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,319
the future and post-sticking the fast

1501
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,040
passed as part of this process of

1502
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,040
unfolding sense-making

1503
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,599
and it seems like the degree to which

1504
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,040
you could do this and the ways in which

1505
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,839
you do this

1506
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:16,240
that would be the degree to which uh

1507
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,280
things might likely

1508
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,200
be likely to stick around that they

1509
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,640
would be might likely to be

1510
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,920
made uh saline to find hooks

1511
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,079
um in this process where everything's

1512
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,760
competing with everything to keep going

1513
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,200
that the ability of something to get

1514
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,520
entangled with itself in different ways

1515
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,440
um would provide different degrees of

1516
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,839
sticking power

1517
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:38,160
um and that this would involve

1518
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,119
um things like just you know you know

1519
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:41,760
multi

1520
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,240
modality like like like a heterogeneous

1521
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,359
code like maybe

1522
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:48,559
my uh my direct you know first person

1523
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,280
shooter point of view uh is pointing to

1524
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:51,599
like

1525
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,839
linguistic a linguistic code or some

1526
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,520
sort of iconic symbolization

1527
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,160
or some sort of other like enteroceptive

1528
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,040
intuitive code

1529
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,319
but like these all cross cross

1530
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:01,599
referencing each other that'd be like

1531
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:02,559
one way of like

1532
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,040
hooking things together but you could

1533
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,640
also hook things together in terms of

1534
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:06,960
like

1535
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,200
an explicit causal sequence where it's

1536
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,079
just this

1537
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,000
to this to this that the ball kicked the

1538
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,520
shoe the boot kicked the ball

1539
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,520
the ball went down the ramp the mouse

1540
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,800
got that she like the whole rube

1541
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,000
goldberg thing that

1542
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,520
that could be part of it too but but

1543
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,359
actually more so if it's coherent and

1544
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:21,760
maybe

1545
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,359
agentic if it's related to

1546
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,040
basically i think we're gonna have to

1547
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,480
get personhood into this in the nature

1548
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,280
of it

1549
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,400
um relative like the causal streams that

1550
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,760
you have the most familiarity with and

1551
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,319
that

1552
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,440
um fit into most of this uh

1553
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,720
meaning-making hierarchy

1554
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,760
that has like a visceral uh thing uh

1555
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,160
a visceral grounding a symbolic

1556
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,520
grounding the more of these

1557
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,079
can come together probably the better

1558
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,760
it'll it'll persist

1559
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,880
and and the more that uh impurity uh

1560
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,119
will um

1561
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,359
give the sparkle so

1562
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,480
thanks adam robert and then we'll

1563
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,920
probably move to the next slide yeah

1564
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,160
uh this slide with the thoughts i was i

1565
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,839
wanted to say something about the parts

1566
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,280
yeah but if you still have something

1567
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,520
else then we you don't

1568
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,880
okay so first of course i would be

1569
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,000
curious how

1570
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,640
active infants people would kind of what

1571
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,319
they would say what the thought is or

1572
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,160
what it means um

1573
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,160
and just philosophically i think that's

1574
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,960
a very interesting question

1575
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,920
and there are certain kind of

1576
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,599
traditional ways how we think about

1577
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,040
thinking

1578
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,040
and it seems to me that active inference

1579
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,960
is challenging

1580
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,480
some of those very traditional

1581
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,319
assumptions but i'm not quite sure how

1582
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,359
exactly

1583
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,720
so the first assumption um that's the

1584
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,280
obvious

1585
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,359
way uh that it's kind of obvious how

1586
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:48,880
active inference challenges that but the

1587
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,319
first assumption is

1588
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,920
and that thinking is something which um

1589
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,480
is like a counterpart um to what's

1590
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,520
happening physically

1591
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,040
so in the physical world and there's

1592
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,119
thinking which is i'm kind of opposed to

1593
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,240
it

1594
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,800
and i think in active inference that's

1595
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,359
there

1596
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,720
this dichotomy is kind of um erased um

1597
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,920
that's kind of obvious and the second

1598
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,040
question is

1599
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,319
um there was a long

1600
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,200
um there's a long tradition in thinking

1601
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,040
about thinking which has to do

1602
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,960
or which which says that thinking is

1603
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,520
something which is rule based or

1604
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,720
law like loss of thought or in a more

1605
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,480
modern

1606
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,079
in the more modern saying one would say

1607
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,079
oh it's about information processing or

1608
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,680
probabilistic reasoning or

1609
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,599
whatever and but that seems to me to

1610
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,960
kind of clash at least with the

1611
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,599
phenomenological way

1612
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,079
uh or with the phenomenology of thinking

1613
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,280
in some sense so

1614
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,000
thinking seems to be something direct

1615
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
and unmediated and we talked about

1616
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,839
the now um which is a particular example

1617
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:56,559
of that

1618
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,720
and i wasn't quite sure how that hangs

1619
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,599
together with the whole active inference

1620
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,040
um theory basically with the mathematics

1621
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,520
of it

1622
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,119
i mean if we as i would mainly assume

1623
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,119
you talk about inferences processes

1624
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,200
which are happening and defined over

1625
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,000
some

1626
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,280
bounded system um so that seems to lend

1627
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,559
itself more to this

1628
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,440
information processing view of thinking

1629
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,720
but that seems to be

1630
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,640
somehow opposed to the phenomenology of

1631
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,760
thinking and i

1632
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,440
was wondering how you kind of bring

1633
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,400
these things together

1634
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:34,240
great questions one thought might be

1635
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:34,559
that

1636
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,880
the way that we've seen things like

1637
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,960
anxiety or affective states

1638
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,640
be addressed in active inference is with

1639
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,040
a parameter reflecting that

1640
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,680
and so it's almost like there's the core

1641
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,760
active inference model

1642
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,599
the one that you know data comes into

1643
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,160
and then there's this interpretive layer

1644
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,599
and so i might say at this point that

1645
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,520
the active inference framework doesn't

1646
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,200
make strong claims

1647
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,280
as to the you know what is a packet

1648
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,400
called thought

1649
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,839
or what is the nature of thought because

1650
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,000
as a scale-free framework

1651
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,040
first off there's the whole

1652
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,119
instrumentalism realism so

1653
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,200
it could be a totally defensible stance

1654
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,720
active inference says nothing

1655
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,920
about thought um or maybe somebody wants

1656
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,839
to unpack it in a way where they think

1657
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:18,960
it does

1658
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,960
but at the first past the things that

1659
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,280
we've seen models of active inference

1660
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,559
about that people experience as thought

1661
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:28,480
like anxiety or excitement or something

1662
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,079
like that those are

1663
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:32,000
parameters that are named in a

1664
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,440
mathematical model

1665
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,520
and they don't seem to make strong

1666
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,040
claims on the nature of thought

1667
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,480
adam what do you think about that

1668
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:45,520
um so in terms of like i guess uh

1669
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,599
the good folk and and how they relate to

1670
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:49,920
thought um

1671
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,480
this notion of it being set in a way

1672
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,160
separable from action and distinguished

1673
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,880
from like

1674
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,240
this in the world uh just doing and just

1675
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,119
acting

1676
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,720
uh that seems like a a good

1677
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,599
place to to work with and so if we're

1678
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,280
talking about that it seems like it

1679
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:07,760
would

1680
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,400
relate to different species of

1681
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,400
sophisticated inference

1682
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,480
where you would be doing these kinds of

1683
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,400
counter factual rollouts

1684
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,720
of what it would be to pursue different

1685
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,359
policies or patterns of action selection

1686
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:24,640
and for me it would be

1687
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,240
to the extent that it's conscious it

1688
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,680
would have to be uh

1689
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,880
uh grounded out as some sort of embodied

1690
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,680
simulation

1691
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,680
i want to build everything out of action

1692
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,960
perception cycles

1693
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,799
and everything out of sensory motor

1694
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:38,000
things that i can ultimately that's

1695
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,280
going to be the grounding that'll be the

1696
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,640
experience

1697
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,319
um that's not to say that thought would

1698
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:43,920
only be determined by

1699
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,680
what you simulated in your rollout for

1700
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,960
instance like you could have

1701
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,240
a lot of um spreading semantic

1702
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,520
association

1703
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,839
of just like a kind of priming effect

1704
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:55,599
and then words come to mind that that's

1705
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,119
part of it and that's not necessarily

1706
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:57,680
like

1707
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,119
something you're controlling in terms of

1708
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,040
pursuing a policy that's just happening

1709
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,160
or some sort of um association again

1710
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,599
with interception of just like

1711
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,119
a kind of resonance in your body that

1712
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,280
might play into and parameterize

1713
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,680
this process but the thinking it seems

1714
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,280
like it would be

1715
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,359
a mode of sophisticated inference of

1716
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,119
generating these counter factual

1717
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,880
possibilities and using them for things

1718
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,520
like

1719
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,000
um different kinds of causal reasoning

1720
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,799
um

1721
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:26,720
different ways of um situating

1722
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,680
what you think is happening or could

1723
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,720
happen

1724
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,960
sometimes and that's how i would relate

1725
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,880
to thought i think

1726
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,880
i don't know if the like what do we want

1727
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,880
from thought we want more

1728
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,079
and so that might help great question

1729
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:43,040
and do we want

1730
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,280
to experience the phenomenology of human

1731
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,200
thought which is an uncultured phenomena

1732
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:47,599
or

1733
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,960
are we trying to talk about trees and

1734
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,799
all kinds of other things so everyone

1735
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,319
awesome thanks for the raised hand

1736
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,599
blue shauna robert

1737
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,079
i think shawna was first so all the

1738
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,920
french yep go for it

1739
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,599
oh okay awesome yeah just a couple

1740
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:04,960
things um

1741
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,640
you know just like daniel was saying

1742
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,000
when we say thought

1743
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,839
right so i'm i mean you know i

1744
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,359
you know it's i don't think thought is

1745
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:14,880
like recognition of a truth and a

1746
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,680
proposition

1747
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,960
i'm of the mindset you know that uh

1748
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,400
i think kierkegaard said like all

1749
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,000
thought as a self-repeating false

1750
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,799
sororities

1751
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,520
which yeah it's like so i'm not of the

1752
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,960
sense that thought is logic

1753
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,240
or anything like that because there's

1754
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,920
first order logic second order logic and

1755
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,280
it's just you know you can get

1756
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,920
uh like what is pro finite thought so i

1757
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,359
really think we need to actually when we

1758
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:36,640
say what our thoughts we need to say

1759
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,520
like what do we mean

1760
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,920
by thought right so robert and i have

1761
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,960
this model of like

1762
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,200
in awareness so it could be that the

1763
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,160
level of your awareness you know

1764
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:46,880
dictates

1765
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,559
the levels of time you have and then

1766
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,960
also what these thoughts are

1767
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,559
so you know someone can say oh a rock

1768
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,480
has no thought but perhaps the

1769
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,319
the units of thought of the rock are

1770
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:58,640
just lower than our units of perception

1771
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,200
something like that so i think it's very

1772
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,640
strong to say that things

1773
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,040
do not have thought right so to ask like

1774
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,079
what a thought is

1775
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:07,839
it's interesting also to say what is not

1776
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:09,359
a thought you know

1777
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,359
so you know i have these um kind of you

1778
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,720
know interesting ideas like if you can

1779
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,240
model the brain as this

1780
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,000
you know protel sheath in a perfectoid

1781
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,839
space which is what this diamond is

1782
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:20,160
then if you can actually model neurons

1783
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,200
as you know these

1784
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,400
points in the diamonds these

1785
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,839
mathematical impurities that are

1786
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:24,799
actually

1787
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:26,559
morphisms of schemes and you would say

1788
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:29,119
that okay thoughts are these morphisms

1789
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:30,799
but we know thoughts are a little more

1790
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:32,640
messy than just satisfying strict

1791
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,680
associativity

1792
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,839
and up to conditions so the math can

1793
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:37,599
only give you a model of the thing

1794
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,040
because perhaps it's not strictly

1795
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,040
associative so i mean we all know that

1796
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:41,760
you do have a

1797
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,319
sodium potassium like channel like kind

1798
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:46,160
of neurotransmitter cluster network

1799
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:46,880
happening

1800
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,400
you always want it to be springtime in

1801
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,680
your head you would not want like a

1802
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,559
winter

1803
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,240
um in your head where all the synapses

1804
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,839
and the trees die and things but nobody

1805
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:54,960
can tell you how the trees in your head

1806
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,720
sort of photosynthesized

1807
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,079
so i know after i gave that first talk

1808
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:59,440
someone asked you know well what are

1809
01:00:59,440 --> 01:00:59,839
actually

1810
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:01,359
thoughts so again if these neurons are

1811
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,359
these geometric points and i still think

1812
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,880
the brain is some sort of non-local

1813
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,079
hologram

1814
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,240
sort of thing the its ability to rewire

1815
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,200
is profound

1816
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,960
you also don't want to get injured right

1817
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,960
because there is a detrimental effect

1818
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,559
um but so like how do you sustain

1819
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,880
this sort of you know uh temporal

1820
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,640
non-locality inside this pro-finite

1821
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,359
condition

1822
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:22,880
maybe robert and i are under this with

1823
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,960
this sort of in levels of awareness

1824
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,240
if you're able to achieve sort of

1825
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,400
simulta simultaneous states of

1826
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,400
awareness then perhaps you could

1827
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,559
probably get out of the idea of thought

1828
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:34,559
is the truth of a proposition

1829
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,559
and then maybe you could try to probably

1830
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:37,839
figure out what that is again i'm not

1831
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:39,040
convinced that we're

1832
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,920
doing anything new um like what a new

1833
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:42,400
thought

1834
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,880
is i'm not really sure what that is um

1835
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,319
or if you can actually like you say

1836
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:47,520
scale free

1837
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,599
right so scale free would be able to for

1838
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,119
us to make this in awareness

1839
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:53,599
sort of phenomena and um so i agree with

1840
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:54,720
robert i'm not sure if there's a

1841
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:55,680
contention there between the

1842
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,359
phenomenology of what is thought and

1843
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:58,000
then

1844
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,920
the sort of perception of like what

1845
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,200
thought is again

1846
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,839
really tricky to see you know but real

1847
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:06,000
thought is getting new connections

1848
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,359
you know and then it's like okay what

1849
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,119
new connections in my same interface

1850
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:10,960
like not really sure how that is

1851
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,480
so i'm glad active imprints allows for

1852
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,799
like new but i'm not sure if it's like

1853
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:16,480
radically new i'm not sure if any of us

1854
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,760
would be able to recognize something

1855
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,559
radically new

1856
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,079
you know um okay i'll stop there nice

1857
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,720
thank you more is different blue and

1858
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,359
then robert then adam

1859
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,359
so just so i was like gonna piggyback

1860
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:31,119
off of your point and get into that so

1861
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,440
and and then i have a question so really

1862
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,200
my background is neuroscience and so

1863
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,640
when you look at like the brain the

1864
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,720
fundamental unit of a thought

1865
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,000
like has to come from the action

1866
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,280
potential right like the sodium and

1867
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,319
potassium and

1868
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:44,160
whatever that is happening but like not

1869
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,240
one action potential makes a thought

1870
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,280
so so like you were talking about

1871
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,920
um how do you measure emergence and you

1872
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,839
know there's like the critical

1873
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:56,400
criticality hypothesis right so like a

1874
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,200
certain number

1875
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,839
of action potentials could lead to a

1876
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,960
thought perhaps

1877
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,119
but but how do you quantify emergency

1878
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,240
without a counter

1879
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,839
object right and so you said you kept

1880
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:07,039
saying this and so i'm going to maybe

1881
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:08,000
ask you to clarify

1882
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,920
or push on this a little bit because

1883
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,440
account objects like when i think of a

1884
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,119
counter i think about a counter in terms

1885
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:14,480
of computer programming

1886
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,599
for i you know from 0 to 50 count count

1887
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:18,319
count count

1888
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:20,319
so is it like counting the number of

1889
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,240
action potentials or the number of ants

1890
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,160
leaving pheromone traces or the number

1891
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,599
of pheromones dropped right so

1892
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,280
so when you think about a counter object

1893
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,720
is that what you mean by a counter

1894
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,480
object or is there some

1895
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,640
fundamental thing that i'm missing i

1896
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,000
don't think i ever said the word counter

1897
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,760
object so can you tell me where i said

1898
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:36,400
that

1899
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,640
yeah it's so talki it was when you were

1900
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,160
quantifying emergence

1901
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,200
and i took some notes so you have

1902
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:43,839
built-in

1903
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:45,680
emergence is built into the system

1904
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,920
versus having a counter

1905
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,760
so maybe not counter objects but you

1906
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,200
said oh yeah it wasn't

1907
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,400
yeah it wasn't um not an index right

1908
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,720
so i'm not i'm not of the why does i

1909
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,640
have to start at one you know so

1910
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,799
i don't think real numbers exist so that

1911
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:01,839
you're that's it's a bunch of

1912
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,440
equivalence classes

1913
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,599
so just pretty much well 50 of these

1914
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,039
things happened i don't really know what

1915
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:07,760
that means

1916
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,160
right but i agree with you that how do

1917
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,839
you actually quantify emergence because

1918
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:13,280
right if you have too much

1919
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,960
hypersynchronous activity you have a

1920
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,039
seizure and a seizure is not a thought

1921
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,160
right everyone

1922
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,920
so it seems to be that there is and

1923
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,119
that's what chris fields and i and

1924
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:22,559
everyone are after is like what is this

1925
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:23,839
stop mechanism

1926
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:26,240
the stop mechanism that you can have you

1927
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,079
need a clustering happening in the

1928
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:29,280
neurons right to

1929
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,520
actually have bot thought doesn't seem

1930
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,960
to come out of your elbow

1931
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,880
but if the if the nervous system is

1932
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,119
non-local like i believe it is

1933
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,640
um which is why i'm an advocate for the

1934
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,920
active inference of the you know

1935
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,359
embodied cognition

1936
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:43,520
if the neural system is non-local and

1937
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,280
nobody's proved that it's not

1938
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,680
um then how do you actually say

1939
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,680
when the amount of clustering gives you

1940
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,280
like look at all this our synapses are

1941
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,200
bright and perfect and leaves and

1942
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,880
everything is like beautiful in here

1943
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,280
right um and effortlessly

1944
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,880
how does it come how does thought come

1945
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,319
so effortless

1946
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:05,039
right sometimes and then but if you have

1947
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:05,680
too much

1948
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,160
firing then you don't get it and it's

1949
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:08,799
not like the

1950
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:10,880
you know there's a an actual rest in the

1951
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,640
action potential like um blue what's the

1952
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,559
order of neuron firing

1953
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,799
what are you smaller than nanometers at

1954
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,240
that point between firing

1955
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,799
it has to be right it's not plank scale

1956
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:22,319
it's not like 10 to the negative 42 but

1957
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:23,039
it's small

1958
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:25,760
right and so with that kind of time

1959
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,119
happening i'm just

1960
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,880
i'm perplexed you have so many layers of

1961
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,280
time happening neuronal firing time like

1962
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,920
stem cell firing time you know so um

1963
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,839
when i said counter i don't think i

1964
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:37,200
wasn't referring to um like

1965
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,559
um um an actual yeah when i

1966
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,480
yeah well i i think i was saying counter

1967
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,680
as in most people just

1968
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,160
take time to be some kind of geiger

1969
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:46,720
counter

1970
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,280
and there's no emergence like at all you

1971
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,640
know hope i answered that and didn't

1972
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,920
make it worse

1973
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,599
yeah so i couldn't tell i couldn't

1974
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,440
figure out if you're like trying to talk

1975
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,359
about like a counter factual

1976
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:59,200
like the opposite of emergence like

1977
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,640
what's the opposite of emergency or if

1978
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,319
you're talking about a counter like

1979
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:04,160
you know when you sum things up so

1980
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,520
that's what it would be

1981
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,559
yeah great

1982
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,160
um robert and adam you want to go to the

1983
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,520
next one or do you want to continue on

1984
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,079
the thought

1985
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:17,039
up to you well i i just had a very quick

1986
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,079
uh clarification

1987
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:19,920
of my question actually adam can reply

1988
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,359
immediately after that's good

1989
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:22,799
because adam said something like what do

1990
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:25,039
we want the theory of thought

1991
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:27,359
to be or what do we want it for which

1992
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:28,720
kind of thought are we

1993
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,440
are we talking when i was asking my

1994
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,799
question about the nature of thought i

1995
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,319
was

1996
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:36,720
mainly thinking about conscious thought

1997
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,119
um i mean there's this tradition that

1998
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:40,880
this which says something like oh the

1999
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:42,960
mind is whatever the brain does and then

2000
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,400
you talk about

2001
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,520
i don't know um potentials about firing

2002
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:47,920
about

2003
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,720
calcium and i i don't know what and and

2004
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,160
and if you then say okay well that's a

2005
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,839
very abstract thing and you call that

2006
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:54,559
thought

2007
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,039
um i think that's fine it's fine and one

2008
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,839
but it doesn't really

2009
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:01,280
um give you a good answer to what you

2010
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,720
mean with conscious thought

2011
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,960
and the standard way how psychologists

2012
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,480
normally answer that question is to say

2013
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,000
okay well there is this unconscious

2014
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,119
processing happening

2015
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,640
and then something magically happens and

2016
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,839
that turns into conscious thought

2017
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:16,640
i wasn't quite clear whether predictive

2018
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,680
processing or

2019
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,680
or active inference or whatever frame

2020
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:20,880
you want to

2021
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,680
take really answers that question or

2022
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:24,240
whether the

2023
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,760
whether it says oh it's actually not a

2024
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,599
good question and

2025
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,880
kind of dissolves this question and well

2026
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,880
that's a bit more specific about my

2027
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,039
question

2028
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,880
adam go for it

2029
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,480
try to tie a few things together um so

2030
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,559
yeah so what we want from thought and

2031
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,240
what our sensibilities might be

2032
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,480
and that they'll what boundaries we

2033
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,520
establish for where

2034
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,520
we find it and don't that'll be what

2035
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,440
relative to what what do we want

2036
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,559
but to try to like build up um so

2037
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,400
i think there is a sense in what you

2038
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,079
could say like it's like

2039
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:05,599
a rock is a mind or

2040
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:08,559
is thought even though it's of extremely

2041
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:09,839
dumb variety

2042
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:12,640
it's action uh because we can point to

2043
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:13,039
it

2044
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:17,279
it's a kind of density um and that

2045
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,238
it's you can think of it as uh you know

2046
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:21,600
it's just gonna probably

2047
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,679
unlike like a crystal which can grow it

2048
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,198
was just sort of like it can do one

2049
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:26,719
thing which is steadily degrade over

2050
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:27,279
time

2051
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,120
on some kind of entropic gradient but to

2052
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,319
the extent it doesn't

2053
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:31,359
that's that's all that's the

2054
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,279
intelligence it's got but then we get to

2055
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:34,799
systems that can like

2056
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,960
actually um through sophisticated

2057
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,000
dynamics

2058
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,679
uh start to do things like uh

2059
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:42,960
suss out different things that can

2060
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,960
happen and do a kind of a

2061
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,279
more flexible policy selection and they

2062
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:48,880
might be potentially

2063
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,960
in in order to do this they might have

2064
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,640
to be critically organized

2065
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,238
and that that's the only thing that

2066
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:56,880
could allow for generalized evolution or

2067
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,799
generalized bayesian model selection

2068
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:01,120
that you actually have to be

2069
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,319
poised at this like inter regime in

2070
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:05,679
order to have the right properties in

2071
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:06,000
order

2072
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,439
to have um both uh the variation where

2073
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:11,359
you can suss out the possibilities

2074
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:14,799
but also the the stability uh um

2075
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:16,960
you're not pouring over into chaos or

2076
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,839
disorder

2077
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:19,520
uh that you can actually build structure

2078
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,279
upon structure so it seems like that's

2079
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,238
going to be

2080
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:25,679
critical um in terms of

2081
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:27,040
like if we're talking about something

2082
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,960
like and it's like

2083
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:29,839
so we're talking about something like

2084
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:32,719
you know a life form maybe that's like

2085
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:35,120
some people say like that's kind of like

2086
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,000
like

2087
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,560
this sort of more sophisticated

2088
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,759
mentality

2089
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:43,839
that um with um you know optionality

2090
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:45,839
maybe that's like the hallmark of life

2091
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:47,120
maybe this sort of

2092
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,279
hierarchical nested modeling if some of

2093
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:50,560
these

2094
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:53,040
inner loop processes are capable of

2095
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,560
bifurcating in different ways and giving

2096
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,440
you a kind of

2097
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,320
like intelligent optionality uh maybe

2098
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,040
you know

2099
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,040
that's a kind of thumb but let's keep

2100
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,239
working up um so

2101
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,480
if we're talking about something uh like

2102
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,679
the brain

2103
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,960
i would think of like a

2104
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,120
a hierarchy of uh

2105
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:16,560
nested coupling processes evolving on

2106
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,920
different time scales and

2107
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,719
uh in the community they'll tend to call

2108
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:22,159
these things a non-equilibrium study

2109
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:23,199
state densities

2110
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:24,880
i call them self-organizing harmonic

2111
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,640
modes and it's a way i interpret

2112
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,960
neural synchrony um to the degree that

2113
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,239
you get it it's

2114
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:33,760
facilitating communication through

2115
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,080
coherence uh making sure that

2116
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,320
um within these systems not just like

2117
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,480
tuning an excitation inhibition balance

2118
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,080
to

2119
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,840
and then it works but that to actually

2120
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,199
within this maelstrom

2121
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,760
to get um coherent dynamics coherent

2122
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,440
inference uh

2123
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,760
you would you you need the neurons need

2124
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:52,560
to team up

2125
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,800
so you need synchrony you need synchrony

2126
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:55,920
for um

2127
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,600
i guess what they would call a marginal

2128
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,120
message passing so it'd be like

2129
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,800
marginalization like a joint belief and

2130
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,719
then you packet your beliefs and these

2131
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,400
like coalitions

2132
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,920
are doing like like these units it's

2133
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,520
quantitization of sense making

2134
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,760
of prediction error and prediction and

2135
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,040
so there would be like this nested

2136
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,000
hierarchy

2137
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,440
and so if you're talking about something

2138
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,840
like uh let's say like gamma

2139
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,679
frequency that might be like a very

2140
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:22,400
small local unit of like synchrony and

2141
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,360
sense making and

2142
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,520
maybe that's like a a quantization of

2143
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,560
like prediction error that will be

2144
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,840
passed upwards

2145
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,080
um so that's like an observation uh

2146
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,760
within the scope of this gamma packet

2147
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:32,080
though

2148
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,440
maybe that's like a prediction for like

2149
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,360
whatever is inside it but

2150
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,560
you keep going up so then maybe that's

2151
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,640
something like beta and then

2152
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,040
you know so gamma like 40 times a second

2153
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,880
and then beta would be something like uh

2154
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,760
you know

2155
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,719
maybe high and low or use the terms like

2156
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,239
somewhere between 13 to 30 times a

2157
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:48,640
second

2158
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,840
and maybe you're starting to get like uh

2159
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,280
uh it depends where you're at but you

2160
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,360
these higher order attractors

2161
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,440
and these higher order predictions like

2162
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,560
like uh like a

2163
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,320
composition like something like a hand

2164
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,080
reaching something like that

2165
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,600
but like where's consciousness gonna

2166
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,600
come into this and why

2167
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,320
uh it seems if you can take these

2168
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:10,960
different

2169
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,320
um recognition these these

2170
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:15,760
recognition of different patterns and

2171
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,000
you can stitch them together

2172
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,800
such that you have uh within the

2173
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,159
organizing principle of

2174
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:23,360
i would suggest an egocentric

2175
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,120
perspective of a particular point of

2176
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,080
view

2177
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,840
and you can arrange them in some kind of

2178
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,239
space what kind of coherence how much

2179
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:31,360
that's a good question

2180
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,440
some kind of time some kind of cause of

2181
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,480
relation

2182
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,679
well now this inference

2183
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:39,120
you might start to say well now you

2184
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,280
might be inferring a world

2185
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,360
specifically a structured world model

2186
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,960
with spatial temporal and causal

2187
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,400
properties where things can unfold and

2188
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,760
you can have something like

2189
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,880
a stream of experience if this

2190
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,719
synchronization manifold is basically

2191
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:54,560
giving you a joint belief

2192
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,960
over your sensorium and so it seems like

2193
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:57,760
alpha

2194
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,280
is the frequency where you can get a big

2195
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,800
enough of a

2196
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,960
agreement of a negotiated agreement

2197
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:11,440
making that you could bring together all

2198
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,120
the different embodied causes

2199
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,719
pegged by an egocentric reference frame

2200
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:16,960
in terms of anatomy and like

2201
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,640
what would be a scope and something that

2202
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,159
i might say that's implicit is

2203
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,320
there's this inverse relationship there

2204
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,520
seems between

2205
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,199
the frequency at which you can get um

2206
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:29,440
oscillations or harmonics and the scope

2207
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,719
of what can be synchronized so

2208
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:32,719
you can get like a little thing to agree

2209
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:35,040
really quickly but to get a big thing

2210
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,280
it's going to necessarily take more time

2211
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,760
and so more things can come into the mix

2212
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,360
and consciousness i'm wondering if that

2213
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,719
is basically

2214
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:46,560
at a scope where you're doing these

2215
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,840
joint estimates

2216
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,800
of system world states that let you both

2217
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:51,920
inform

2218
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,480
and be informed by evolving action

2219
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,920
perception cycles

2220
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,159
but actually the the functional closure

2221
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:01,839
that you achieve for this estimation

2222
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,719
and if you're having these things

2223
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,719
brought together in a way that gives you

2224
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:20,320
a point of view of some kind

2225
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,080
well i might say okay now it's something

2226
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,840
like conscious thought

2227
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,159
this stream of experience doing

2228
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:27,440
different things

2229
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:30,239
um where but the thinking part of it we

2230
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:31,199
might want to

2231
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:34,400
save that or not for something like

2232
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,159
uh imaginative planning or some sort of

2233
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,840
like counter like like

2234
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,360
you're you're thinking of something

2235
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,880
other than what is and that's actually

2236
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,159
what's happening at this intermediate

2237
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:42,880
level

2238
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,960
where you're conscious but you're

2239
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:47,120
sussing out different possibilities

2240
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,120
as you're trying to situate something in

2241
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,320
some sort of

2242
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,040
coherent spatial temporal unfolding that

2243
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,560
you can make sense of

2244
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,560
um and so the idea would be like

2245
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,880
everything that we can think of

2246
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,600
we're necessarily temporalizing and

2247
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,800
spatializing

2248
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,199
just so we can grok it like rocket i

2249
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:06,800
mean literally so we can

2250
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,960
bring it into some sort of relation with

2251
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,000
this intermediate level

2252
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,600
embodied simulation otherwise we can't

2253
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,280
think of anything

2254
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,800
but i'd say there could be a kind of

2255
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,040
unconscious thought also

2256
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,400
this actually might lead to something

2257
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,400
like a counter i think you get one

2258
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,440
counter

2259
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,679
in that this bundling there's a certain

2260
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:24,800
time set which you can get

2261
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,600
a big enough of a coalition there's a

2262
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,520
time frame for achieving that

2263
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,040
in some ways that's that's a kind of

2264
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,719
counter that's a kind of like

2265
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,640
discretization and you might think of

2266
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,159
this in terms and like uh

2267
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:38,239
and active inference is like kind of

2268
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:39,760
discrete updating of the generative

2269
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:40,560
model

2270
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,840
um the but it seems like you can get

2271
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,360
something like

2272
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,840
unconscious thought potentially uh via

2273
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,120
the hippocampal system to kind of

2274
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,760
loop around the clive wearing again um

2275
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,120
and that

2276
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,480
one way i would think of thought as as

2277
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,239
generalized or navigation through

2278
01:15:58,239 --> 01:15:59,920
generalized space

2279
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,640
hitting a particular not arbitrary

2280
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,400
target

2281
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,400
being able to find your way there and so

2282
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,239
i've been working with these uh

2283
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,800
roboticists who are um building these

2284
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:11,760
slam systems they're

2285
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,760
i mean the simultaneous localization and

2286
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,520
mapping and so

2287
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,880
uh what these robots are doing they're

2288
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,640
trying to figure out where am i

2289
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,960
in this environment what is the sense of

2290
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,719
this environment and they're doing this

2291
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:24,800
actively in terms of they're they're

2292
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,760
moving around

2293
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,440
you know uh scouting out what's

2294
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,360
happening and there's this like mutually

2295
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,719
concerning influence of what is this

2296
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:31,600
world i'm in

2297
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,360
and where am i and what is this world

2298
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:36,159
and where am i and figuring this out but

2299
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:40,080
this uh core system uh

2300
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,360
would seem to have uh within it

2301
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,400
uh these place fields these like

2302
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,520
locations that could be

2303
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,600
in physical space like the tree is there

2304
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,120
i'm here

2305
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,600
my you know my kitchen's down there but

2306
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,040
it could also be within a conceptual

2307
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,080
space

2308
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,320
and so um they're sometimes modeled as

2309
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,679
like bump attractors

2310
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:03,120
where like you get these like local

2311
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,360
recurrences within this like

2312
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,640
centrally located thing and

2313
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,239
basically this chaining of these bump

2314
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:11,920
attractors would

2315
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,719
then chain together broader dynamics for

2316
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,159
the rest of the brain

2317
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,400
and so in theory this could operate um

2318
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,679
in a way where you're

2319
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,679
not aware of it it's like coordinating

2320
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:23,679
sense making and a kind of i wouldn't

2321
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:25,840
say it's a propositional but in like a

2322
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,480
an orderly way there's like a topology

2323
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,199
to it

2324
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:31,199
and you went from here to here to here

2325
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:32,960
to here so in theory

2326
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,920
um that could bypass consciousness i

2327
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,679
don't know if it can or not

2328
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:41,360
but this in terms of this nested graphs

2329
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,719
of graphs of graphs

2330
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,560
there could also be a kind of holography

2331
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:45,920
there potentially

2332
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,040
in terms of um

2333
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:54,239
well not wholeheartedly um non-locality

2334
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:56,159
let me say not holography non-locality

2335
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:57,360
there

2336
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:01,280
um in terms of when you

2337
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,239
coarse grain uh at some level of course

2338
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:05,440
screening

2339
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,320
uh locality falls away i'm not sure

2340
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,360
about that

2341
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,120
but uh yeah so there's some thoughts on

2342
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,000
thought but one more thing though

2343
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,560
so ultimately i think this is going to

2344
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,080
be crucial

2345
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,360
uh understanding the the principles

2346
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,960
underlying this system not the system in

2347
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,159
a narrow sense

2348
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:27,360
but of this graphs of graphs of graphs

2349
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,159
this where these inner loop processes

2350
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:32,080
have these different capabilities

2351
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:35,360
um it will be the secret to uh advanced

2352
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,320
intelligence

2353
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,159
understand like what do we want from

2354
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:40,560
thought and cognition and i also suspect

2355
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,320
it will be the answer to schroedinger's

2356
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,480
question and that

2357
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:48,320
what would make um i think life

2358
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,280
clever and more than a whirlpool like

2359
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,040
you can so dissipative systems they can

2360
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:53,840
be extremely

2361
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,880
impressive extremely life-like but this

2362
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,840
sort of

2363
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,560
inner loop process that can give you

2364
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,800
this sort of optionality

2365
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,199
that this potentially a critically

2366
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,880
organized inner loop process

2367
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,120
that can bind together overall dynamics

2368
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,960
and get the overall system

2369
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,280
because of this bifurcating potential

2370
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,040
this sort of optionality

2371
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,520
um that's going to be important now what

2372
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,560
if then

2373
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,600
this inner loop system is also a kind of

2374
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,400
counter

2375
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,320
or a kind of like thing that stitches

2376
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,840
itself together where

2377
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,719
basically like genetic inheritance like

2378
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:30,560
it gives you

2379
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,840
over over time the ability to basically

2380
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,280
um get better priors into it better um

2381
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,159
it lets you

2382
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,480
lets you transfer learn it lets you what

2383
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,280
happens here

2384
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,480
and influence the next thing can

2385
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,480
influence the next thing and so this

2386
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,600
could be a way of what we

2387
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,080
you could think of um uh jablonka i

2388
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:48,719
think i'm

2389
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,159
ruining the name but like this unlimited

2390
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:52,159
associative learning as like a hallmark

2391
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:53,280
of consciousness

2392
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,120
this kind of like transition something

2393
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,440
like that though this unlimited

2394
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,800
learning open-ended learning

2395
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,920
as phylogeny as basically an inner loop

2396
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:04,480
process

2397
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,159
capable of coordinating the overall

2398
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:07,760
system which has

2399
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,679
um some by some sort of like pointer

2400
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,600
relation some sort of semantic pointers

2401
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:16,719
semantics which itself is um

2402
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,600
allows for a kind of heredity a kind of

2403
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,120
a kind of inheritance

2404
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,520
of whatever happened and so i think we

2405
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:24,880
bring in those two things together an

2406
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:25,440
inner

2407
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,239
loop process capable of some kind of

2408
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:30,320
counter factual processing

2409
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,600
and uh link that to inheritance

2410
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:38,000
now we'll have what we need to have um

2411
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:42,880
either life or a potentially conscious

2412
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,199
system

2413
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:48,239
thank you adam i flip to the next

2414
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:51,280
slide on diamonds and

2415
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:54,320
holographs where does this come into

2416
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,080
play it's not something that you'd find

2417
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,600
in the active inference literature

2418
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,440
today but maybe it will be found there

2419
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,638
tomorrow why

2420
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:07,679
calling on our diamond experts

2421
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:10,480
yeah yeah are we bypassing the dichronic

2422
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,440
synchronic

2423
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,000
either yep wherever you want to go on

2424
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:14,560
this slide

2425
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,679
yes okay okay yeah so um

2426
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:20,159
you know so again if we're if you know

2427
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:21,760
like robert is saying okay

2428
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,840
is the mind what the brain does like

2429
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,400
what is this what do we want from font

2430
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,880
when you're when we're generating um you

2431
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:29,520
know in the

2432
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,920
like pro adversarial kind of or in a you

2433
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,679
know generative adversarial network you

2434
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:36,080
have this generator talking to you know

2435
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:39,440
um you know the you know

2436
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,840
like itself saying no no no this is a

2437
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,360
cat this is not a cat and it's sort of

2438
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,360
this ai is talking to itself

2439
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,199
um what what is that in us when we're

2440
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,120
sort of talking to ourself

2441
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,120
so again you have someone like me in the

2442
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,280
category theory side saying okay

2443
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,719
i do think there is some kind of strong

2444
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:56,000
duality between the agent and its

2445
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,040
environment

2446
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:00,639
so if you if if minds

2447
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:03,840
are modeled in this diamond way right

2448
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,080
then what you're actually doing is just

2449
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,840
sort of engaging with your reflections

2450
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,120
right how do you actually engage with

2451
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,480
your reflections do your reflections

2452
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,679
have your reflections so

2453
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:12,880
kind of based on what adam are saying

2454
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,040
it's like what's the role of priors

2455
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,840
in holography what does it actually mean

2456
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,520
to sort of have um

2457
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,280
that was my original question when an

2458
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,520
agent is figuring out how to jump over a

2459
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,199
wall it's never seen before

2460
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:28,239
um how is it doing that what if

2461
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:29,199
affordances

2462
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:30,880
are just a set of parameters that are

2463
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,239
built into the thing

2464
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,199
right so let's try to do this and uh if

2465
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:36,960
you could do this parameter free

2466
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,800
what would that model actually look like

2467
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,719
so for someone like me i am fascinated

2468
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:42,239
how when i speak to you the speech

2469
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:43,040
doesn't last

2470
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,600
doesn't last doesn't last doesn't last

2471
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,840
but somehow you remember what i say

2472
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,440
remember what i say you must probably

2473
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,880
construct a hologram

2474
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,840
holographic copy of of me and what i'm

2475
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:54,800
saying

2476
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,639
so that you store that somehow so

2477
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,080
someone like me with almost like a total

2478
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:58,800
recall

2479
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,719
can remember stuff like this i know i

2480
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:02,000
can talk to people and i have seven

2481
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,679
different versions of time going on

2482
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:06,719
you know um how do you align like all of

2483
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:08,480
those seven and you're just focusing on

2484
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,120
like on what's happening now so um you

2485
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:11,520
aren't

2486
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,080
really so you have a crazy feedback

2487
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,440
processing going on

2488
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,199
um and none of this is happening in real

2489
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:18,320
time right because there's neural

2490
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,600
transmitters happening so this is

2491
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:20,000
already

2492
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,880
the past all of this uh whatever that

2493
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,480
means when we say the past and so i'm

2494
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:25,440
just wondering what the

2495
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,000
you know when you have a very strict set

2496
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,760
of priors governing how your agent

2497
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,800
behaves

2498
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,320
where do those come into play and how do

2499
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,320
those work if the very way that the

2500
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:34,800
agent

2501
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,199
operates is through holography so again

2502
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:38,560
holography is like you have a

2503
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,080
you know some kind of dimensional

2504
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,320
relation going on that perhaps you know

2505
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,880
we have a 2d retina for a 3d creature

2506
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,800
2d retina is taking an information and

2507
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,040
compressing it and then

2508
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,560
reconstructing it in a higher way so um

2509
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,400
that's just for that i have this model

2510
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,840
of you know instead of just having the

2511
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,280
normal holographic principle which

2512
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,760
relates anti-disinterest

2513
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,400
theory um i'm trying to get it in sort

2514
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,320
of a diamond way where you actually use

2515
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,040
the um

2516
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,960
italic homology of diamonds which are

2517
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,040
these funkers or computers

2518
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:13,280
and uh build up a holography from

2519
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:15,040
an image functor of sheaves so it's

2520
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,880
purely mathematical let's just build up

2521
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,560
a holographic space

2522
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,440
from you know image functors which is

2523
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,000
really

2524
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
uh relevant to active inference because

2525
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,440
you're acting you're acting you're

2526
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,719
acting or acting there's no other

2527
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:28,080
definition than a functor than

2528
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,480
some kind of relation so building up

2529
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:31,440
holography

2530
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:34,639
from relations uh and the conformal

2531
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,480
aspect which is the metric free

2532
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,880
sort of gravity free space would be in

2533
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,360
the pro finite condition of the diamonds

2534
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,440
so you have a six function formalism

2535
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,000
which is replacing anti-sitter space

2536
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,159
you have a pro-finite condition which is

2537
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:50,080
replacing the gravity free

2538
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:53,760
so that seems to me like a a very um

2539
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,320
interesting way to figure out how an

2540
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,000
agent is navigating

2541
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,960
if you know there are reflections so you

2542
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,480
know the math part aside

2543
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,800
just what is you know the active

2544
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,080
inference experts here

2545
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,320
think about engaging with your

2546
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,920
reflections that it's never really

2547
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,199
anything new

2548
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:12,639
you're just sort of walking around in

2549
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:15,440
your echo space

2550
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,440
thanks for the comment there adam and

2551
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,879
then anyone else with a raised hand

2552
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,560
so this might not

2553
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,840
doc but let's try um

2554
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,480
in terms of like the nature of like how

2555
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:32,960
would i

2556
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,639
remember shanna or and

2557
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:39,280
how can i know anyone or anything um i'm

2558
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,199
wondering if it always has to be

2559
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:43,120
through some kind of um generalized

2560
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,719
mirroring with

2561
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:47,040
your own embodied experience and

2562
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,400
ultimately it's got to be cashed out

2563
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:49,120
that way

2564
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:52,239
and that this the na the particular

2565
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:54,719
nature of like the the holography in

2566
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:56,159
terms of the ability to like

2567
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:58,719
reconstitute and you know reducing the

2568
01:25:58,719 --> 01:25:59,840
dimensions and then

2569
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:03,600
expanding them again um would be

2570
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,800
by virtue of um you

2571
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,080
having this system which would just uh

2572
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:14,080
through a variety of reasons be able to

2573
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,159
generate intelligent coupling with the

2574
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:18,400
world of a sensory motor variety

2575
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:22,400
but also run this same process in a

2576
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,560
in an offline mode so that you can

2577
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,520
imagine you know

2578
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:29,120
body simulation and that if

2579
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,480
you then um so this the inactive

2580
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:33,520
inference this

2581
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,360
uh the sensory motor processes

2582
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,840
are understood as these self-realizing

2583
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:40,880
predictions

2584
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,239
where you'll set these equilibrium

2585
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,239
points and then this hierarchy

2586
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:46,400
will just sort of reconfigure and unfold

2587
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:49,040
and as it's jostling around

2588
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,199
and passing these implicit predictions

2589
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:52,159
and predictions around

2590
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:55,199
it just dynamically or just it'll

2591
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:57,120
by by hamilton's principal police action

2592
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,480
as like

2593
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,040
waterfront hill it'll find this minimal

2594
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:01,920
state

2595
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,159
of minimal prediction error that it's

2596
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:06,000
ultimately cached on reflex arcs in the

2597
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:06,719
world

2598
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:09,280
but for thought would be um the

2599
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,560
virtualization of that so you're

2600
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,080
imagining this pattern of reaching out

2601
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,120
so you have this

2602
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,880
um construction system in this virtual

2603
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,400
reality system

2604
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:19,840
and then if there's a reliable patterns

2605
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:22,159
of coherent state transitions that i am

2606
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,639
likely to do in different circumstances

2607
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:25,840
well now i'm starting to get like an

2608
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,080
agent model of myself well it's a real

2609
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,040
of a kind and you're sharing it if

2610
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,800
there's a reliable

2611
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,560
set of policies that will happen in

2612
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,400
different circumstances it's like okay

2613
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,719
well it's self-reflective though it

2614
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:39,760
seems we're gonna have to um

2615
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,280
objectify the cell somehow and i'm

2616
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,840
thinking this likely comes

2617
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,400
through mirroring actually through

2618
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,760
relationships between parents and

2619
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:48,400
children

2620
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,760
at first and that you're um

2621
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:52,880
and where the parents seem to be

2622
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,880
actually soliciting some people say the

2623
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,480
mirroring is nate i actually don't think

2624
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:56,880
it is

2625
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,800
it seems like parents uh helped to

2626
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,159
solicit it

2627
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:03,520
um but the they mirror with you so that

2628
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,560
you learn to mirror

2629
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:05,679
and so that creates the learning

2630
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:08,480
curriculum but through this um

2631
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,760
these games played between caretaker and

2632
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:12,560
child

2633
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:15,280
uh you learn to get this mapping between

2634
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,320
what's out there

2635
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,120
and what's here somewhere along the way

2636
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:19,840
you'll

2637
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:23,360
learn to basically associate

2638
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,600
um what other people are doing in any

2639
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,199
ways even if you're not like you'll

2640
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:28,880
learn just to mirror with them they're

2641
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,159
over there and then you see that and you

2642
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:34,000
draw this analogy to your own

2643
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,920
embodiment your own you put yourself in

2644
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,159
the same pose the same situation

2645
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:41,840
uh and then this now gives you a basis

2646
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,760
for a kind of objectified selfhood

2647
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,080
it's still always from like this uh

2648
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,600
egocentric perspective but

2649
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,679
now you're able to like get this other

2650
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:51,360
person and i'm thinking that that's like

2651
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,040
this kind of interface for like

2652
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:56,000
my shanna model would have to be like

2653
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:56,400
the

2654
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,719
the docking point would be something

2655
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:00,239
like this uh

2656
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:03,120
this third person objectified selfhood

2657
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,480
which then would let you

2658
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:07,600
cash it out or unpack it

2659
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,760
in an embodied coherent body simulation

2660
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,920
something like that

2661
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:15,679
one thought about like again setup

2662
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:20,480
and discriminators it seems like that uh

2663
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,880
that might be again crucial for

2664
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:28,000
uh both hard problems and uh

2665
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,880
stranger questions i think um there's

2666
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,360
this

2667
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:34,480
one uh thinker he's this uh

2668
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,480
academic psychiatrist a rucker did you

2669
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,199
plan on having him on daniel or

2670
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:41,760
he wrote this one he's fantastic

2671
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,199
actually i think that'll be a good idea

2672
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:46,239
so but it's this idea of like so

2673
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:51,120
a system uh basically

2674
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,880
um he calls it like uh allostatic

2675
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,719
overload and a collapse model

2676
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:56,719
where basically through these systems we

2677
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:58,560
have these functional bottlenecks

2678
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,800
these bottlenecks will tend to kind of

2679
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:01,920
that are

2680
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:04,000
helping to establish the synchronization

2681
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,440
manifold over a system that the

2682
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,639
coordination

2683
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:09,040
that these heavily trafficked and

2684
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,239
contingent

2685
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:12,639
areas will tend to fail first when you

2686
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:14,480
stress the system too much

2687
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,719
and so uh and this would give you like

2688
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:18,960
for instance a kind of flexible

2689
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,360
hierarchy or either you're doing things

2690
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,120
maybe on like unconsciously but just

2691
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,400
like fast feedback loops of the

2692
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,000
environment you're not getting fancy

2693
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,639
you know quick in the dead or you're

2694
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:29,520
letting yourself build

2695
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,360
models upon models reflection upon

2696
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,440
reflection but that these more rare five

2697
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,400
things

2698
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,400
they'll fail first and so you got this

2699
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,600
like

2700
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,560
you can move up and down in

2701
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:41,360
sophistication but um i'm wondering

2702
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:41,840
whether

2703
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,400
in terms of uh and so this would apply

2704
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,600
not just to

2705
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,120
all intelligent all interesting

2706
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,600
intelligence systems is the claim

2707
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,120
but while you have this like natural

2708
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:52,800
kind of adjustment of your

2709
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,760
sophistication

2710
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,679
i'm wondering if it could be good to

2711
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:57,199
have something

2712
01:30:57,199 --> 01:31:00,239
that preemptively anticipates this so

2713
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:01,199
you're not just

2714
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:04,000
having reactive regime collapses where

2715
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:04,880
it's actually

2716
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,480
you can actually like you know maybe not

2717
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,120
yeah i could switch to an unconscious

2718
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,199
berserker mode right now maybe i don't

2719
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,800
want to be in that position

2720
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,080
and so if i can get something that's

2721
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,239
like giving me a read on

2722
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:18,880
my degree of like stress of allostatic

2723
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,400
load of the degree of like

2724
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:23,440
how how close am i to the edge um that

2725
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:24,719
could be a good thing and so for

2726
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:26,560
the brain this would appear to be

2727
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,360
largely the interior cingulate would be

2728
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:30,560
probably the main

2729
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,880
uh free energy or prediction error

2730
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,679
integrator

2731
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:36,960
it's uh centrally located it um

2732
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,480
has like in every sense it's like boom

2733
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,800
got the most connectivity and it's just

2734
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,400
perfectly suited to say like

2735
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,600
how well are you doing in

2736
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,520
self-evidencing i'm wondering like

2737
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:48,000
within

2738
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,080
cells if you have a similar kind of

2739
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,600
gan-like discriminator

2740
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,679
um some sort of like inner metabolic

2741
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:55,920
cycle that like accumulates i know like

2742
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:58,080
maybe like mitochondria accumulating

2743
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,280
like radicals

2744
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,120
or like some sort of like gene

2745
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:02,880
expression loop i don't know but

2746
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:03,679
something like this

2747
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:05,920
that's highly central that like when it

2748
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,360
starts to go

2749
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,600
this would then influence your policy

2750
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,639
selection this would then

2751
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:12,960
influence your orchestration i don't

2752
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,560
know what that would look like in a cell

2753
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,679
but for the brain this appears to be um

2754
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:19,520
there's does appear to be some fairly

2755
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,880
centralized structures

2756
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,840
literally that allow for that kind of

2757
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,120
gan-like function

2758
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,600
and that is key to any to basically

2759
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,120
intelligent agency

2760
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:30,800
um and and is also key for things

2761
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,800
potentially like um uh

2762
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,800
uh i don't know if i believe this

2763
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,800
actually so sam gershman has argued this

2764
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:37,360
is like

2765
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,120
um reality monitoring like a higher

2766
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,480
order thought sense

2767
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,719
um that i think something like that

2768
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:44,159
could work but but the idea is that you

2769
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:45,199
know how do i distinguish if i just

2770
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:46,960
imagine something or if i actually

2771
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,080
experienced it

2772
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,440
and that there is some sort of like dan

2773
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,880
like discriminator he treats the whole

2774
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,320
frontal lobes like this

2775
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:56,239
um uh that that's something else but

2776
01:32:56,239 --> 01:32:58,000
it seems like this though gan framework

2777
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,480
though this idea of discriminators

2778
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,679
is extremely flexible extremely powerful

2779
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:06,159
and will apply across a broad range of

2780
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:07,120
systems

2781
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:10,239
i think is actually really essential so

2782
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:13,840
yeah thanks adam

2783
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,520
to bring it back to act infant the

2784
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,760
diamond holograph

2785
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,719
i kind of drew two diamond shapes on my

2786
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:21,679
page

2787
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:24,880
one was person a and person b and their

2788
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,719
shared informational niche

2789
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,560
they're both looking at a whiteboard and

2790
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:29,920
so there's two people

2791
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,480
communicating to the shared screen and

2792
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:33,760
unpacking and that was something we

2793
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,679
talked about with chris fields

2794
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:38,400
and then to relate it to this diacronic

2795
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,280
through time and

2796
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,600
synchronic at the same time i kind of

2797
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,120
thought about like a bow tie

2798
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,199
or two diamonds where in the current

2799
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:46,480
moment is the agent

2800
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,880
now and then there's the agent in the

2801
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:49,679
future

2802
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:52,400
at a inferred trajectory point and then

2803
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:53,520
also in the past

2804
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,920
so we're sort of like retrodicting we're

2805
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,840
now casting and we're also predicting

2806
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:58,960
the future

2807
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,920
and maybe the pathway through the past

2808
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:04,320
present future it's like a narrative

2809
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,320
that helps the organism make sense of

2810
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,960
where it is at that time

2811
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:12,080
um any other points on diamonds or i

2812
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,760
think we can kind of go to the

2813
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,360
future and give okay awesome our closing

2814
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,360
thoughts and awesome you know anyone

2815
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,280
who's watching live can add a thought or

2816
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,560
we can

2817
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,639
go around here as well what is the

2818
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:27,440
future of active inference or a future

2819
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:29,040
or a direction

2820
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,760
where do we see this field in the future

2821
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:32,800
10 years from now or

2822
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,560
some other time point out will we

2823
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,719
be adapting active inference to

2824
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:40,239
high-level unsupervised

2825
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:44,000
learning will we merge

2826
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,040
with strong artificial intelligence and

2827
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:47,840
where do we see

2828
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,679
embodied cognition scaling two are

2829
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:51,470
applying to

2830
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:54,609
[Music]

2831
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:01,040
blue and then robert and then anyone

2832
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,280
else

2833
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,880
why don't you go ahead yeah yeah well

2834
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:10,320
sure thanks um so just my personal

2835
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,080
opinion it would be very interesting to

2836
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:12,960
see

2837
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:17,119
and to what extent active inference

2838
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:21,679
would or could move from i think now a

2839
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:22,880
lot of discussions are kind of

2840
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,239
mechanistic

2841
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:26,639
i mean complicated mechanisms which are

2842
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:28,719
happening in the brain or in a cell or

2843
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:31,840
wherever i would be very interested

2844
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,600
whether that

2845
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,679
where the active inference could be a

2846
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:38,239
way of

2847
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:39,920
precisely speaking about norms

2848
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,280
normativity

2849
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,960
i think someone mentioned at the very

2850
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:45,040
beginning about

2851
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,960
said something about normativity what i

2852
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,480
mean with that is the

2853
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:52,000
the distinction between infer inferring

2854
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,119
what is the case

2855
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:55,760
or focusing on what is the case what

2856
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,840
physical stuff is going on

2857
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:00,719
and what should go on in philosophy

2858
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:02,239
there is this famous distinction that

2859
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:04,239
one could not be derived from the other

2860
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:07,360
it goes back to david hume the odd from

2861
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:10,320
is it's a problem and i was wondering

2862
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:13,280
whether active inference could be

2863
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:15,600
could be an interesting middleway here

2864
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,239
and the second related thought is

2865
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:21,920
um which has to do with with ai and

2866
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,320
reinforcement learning we mentioned that

2867
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:27,119
in the very beginning

2868
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:31,199
that symptom seems to me to be a good

2869
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:32,880
i mean one could be very critical and

2870
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:35,280
could say well

2871
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,280
in some sense active inference that's

2872
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,280
very nice and interesting and one could

2873
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:41,199
do nice biology with it

2874
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:44,159
um but it's not so obvious what what the

2875
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:45,760
benefit would be

2876
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:50,800
over compared to reinforcement paradigms

2877
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:54,000
and um if one would be able to

2878
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,080
say something reasonable to this

2879
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,119
normativity

2880
01:36:57,119 --> 01:37:00,080
question then i think that's very that

2881
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,600
would be a very big

2882
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,159
um big plus point for active inference

2883
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:05,280
but that's why i hope

2884
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:08,239
that i kind of see in the future and

2885
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,000
work which goes more into that direction

2886
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,520
as well

2887
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:15,040
thank you robert blue

2888
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:16,880
so robert just to kind of respond to

2889
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,800
that i don't know if you've seen the um

2890
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,360
scaling active inference paper that we

2891
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:22,480
looked at

2892
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:26,320
um it's it's been a while um but it did

2893
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,000
yeah number eight uh who is the first

2894
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
author i forget all the chance

2895
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,280
oh alex jones of course so um

2896
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,280
but he definitely compared active

2897
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,199
inference and a computational paradigm

2898
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:37,920
to

2899
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,760
uh reinforcement learning so i don't

2900
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,119
know if you've seen that work

2901
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:44,080
um and you know in different testing

2902
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,000
different paradigms the hopper and the

2903
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,480
the car and the hills and it was a nice

2904
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:49,040
picture

2905
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:52,239
anyway um so where i would really like

2906
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:54,239
to see active inference in ten years

2907
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:57,119
uh i mean we talked about how active

2908
01:37:57,119 --> 01:37:57,840
inference is

2909
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:00,960
scale-free a scale-free model um

2910
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,560
so theoretically it should also be

2911
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,159
multi-scale

2912
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:06,320
i think that there's a little bit we

2913
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,719
have a little bit of work to do

2914
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:11,280
to get it to be multiscale so and i

2915
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,239
think that that work

2916
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:14,960
definitely centers around emergence when

2917
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:16,000
does the next

2918
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,400
scale emerge when does the collection of

2919
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:19,840
cells become a tissue

2920
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:21,199
when does the collection of tissues

2921
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:23,440
become an organ etc

2922
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,119
so i would really like to see active

2923
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:28,159
inference incorporate a bi-directional

2924
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:30,400
information flow that was talked about

2925
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,400
in krakow's paper the information theory

2926
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,600
of individuality

2927
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,280
i would like to see that merge with

2928
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:36,880
active inference and

2929
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:40,000
give us a way to talk about

2930
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,040
how the cells in my toe

2931
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,119
constitute me in the society that i live

2932
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:47,759
in right so

2933
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:51,600
nice shawna then adam

2934
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,080
yeah blue that's great i totally agree

2935
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,520
and support you there

2936
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:58,239
um i am you know obviously a heavy

2937
01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:00,320
advocate of mirror phenomena

2938
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,719
so while there may not be mirror neurons

2939
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:04,080
i mean which i hope there are there is a

2940
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:05,600
mirror

2941
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,199
so i'm an advocate not just for

2942
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:09,520
reinforcement but for imitative learning

2943
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,560
so what i would like to see um

2944
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:15,360
active inference move towards is a new

2945
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:16,560
mathematic like a

2946
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,080
you know adding to the mathematical

2947
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:19,920
framework just some new notions so

2948
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,520
in that the other math stream i talked

2949
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,119
about condensed sets what are p

2950
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:26,400
which are peter tulsa and dulce like

2951
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:28,639
idea of shapes over points so if we

2952
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:29,920
could actually get time

2953
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,480
to be modeled as singular which i think

2954
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,320
sounds catastrophic but it might be more

2955
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,920
apropos to what's happening here instead

2956
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:36,239
of

2957
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:38,400
assuming it's continuous or a fluid that

2958
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,239
you move through whatever that is

2959
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:41,679
so if you can reframe things and

2960
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:43,920
condense sets this would actually

2961
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,239
help us incorporate this mirror

2962
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:47,840
phenomena so

2963
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,840
um you know adam and i really think the

2964
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,600
gan network is going to be really nice

2965
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,440
so i have this idea of constructing this

2966
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,320
pro-generative adversarial network and

2967
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,159
and having a perceptron that's an actual

2968
01:39:58,159 --> 01:39:58,400
v

2969
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:01,280
stack so the stack is just a higher

2970
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,520
notion of the diamond

2971
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:06,400
so um whereas you take you know you glue

2972
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,000
together certain pectoid spaces and you

2973
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,280
get a diamond you can also

2974
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:12,000
gather diamonds and get this v stack so

2975
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,400
i'm

2976
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,239
i'm interested in this phenomenon but if

2977
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:15,760
we can actually take a general

2978
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:17,360
adversarial network and make a pro

2979
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:18,560
version of it

2980
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,880
so then this would become like a certain

2981
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,080
pro object in

2982
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,080
the category of all possible generative

2983
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,600
adversarial networks

2984
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,920
so the goal here is to categorify

2985
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,199
embodiment

2986
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:32,239
for ai um which i think is

2987
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:33,679
very strong so then you can model the

2988
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:35,760
perceptron as this v-stack

2989
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,880
perceptron so that the output

2990
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:40,960
is hopefully some kind of condensed set

2991
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:41,920
it's not just a

2992
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:44,159
function anymore it's going to be either

2993
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:45,840
like a sheaf of things

2994
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,280
or it's going to be a whole categories

2995
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,360
of something so this

2996
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:52,400
this pro formalism would also be a model

2997
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:52,719
of

2998
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:55,520
um embodied meta learning so i'm an

2999
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,360
advocate through this mirror form of

3000
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,360
formalism to get meta learning going

3001
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,040
which is going to reframe the frame

3002
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:01,679
problem

3003
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:04,719
in terms of condensed sets or category

3004
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:07,040
so i think the frame problem is huge and

3005
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,880
together categorify it would actually be

3006
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:09,760
like really nice

3007
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,080
so if you can actually model inactive

3008
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:14,400
robots as advanced ai

3009
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:17,440
in this kind of pro finite formalism and

3010
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,600
you could model mirror neurons as these

3011
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:22,239
imitative you know this play imitation

3012
01:41:22,239 --> 01:41:23,040
emulation

3013
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:26,320
gans and a sort of mirror game theory

3014
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,880
for inactive neurons this is what i

3015
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,639
think active inference formalism can

3016
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:31,920
actually do because you're you could

3017
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,440
actually construct a correspondence

3018
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:34,320
between

3019
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:37,440
embodied cognition in this pro in like

3020
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:39,520
my profinite formalism

3021
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,880
and computability and sort of pro

3022
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:43,360
version

3023
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,840
of the synchronic and diacronic

3024
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,520
emergence but have that already

3025
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:50,880
built in to the pro gan so if

3026
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:53,040
like diacronic and synchronic emergence

3027
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:55,920
could be built in as affordances

3028
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:57,679
i think that's that's really nice

3029
01:41:57,679 --> 01:41:59,600
because i think i think active inference

3030
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,920
needs to have something like there's

3031
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,760
something about the synchronic emergence

3032
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,040
about it being

3033
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:07,600
sort of higher level phenomena being you

3034
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:08,639
know um

3035
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:11,280
you know supervening you know on like

3036
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:11,920
these

3037
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:14,000
you know subvenian neural structures to

3038
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,679
get this vertical emergence but then you

3039
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:17,040
also have this sort of

3040
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,880
horizontal emergence where it's like

3041
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,480
wait you know um

3042
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:22,159
the novel property that emerged over

3043
01:42:22,159 --> 01:42:23,920
time like

3044
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:26,080
existed prior to emergent so i think

3045
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,440
emergence is going to be really

3046
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,920
beautiful and so i think if we can

3047
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:30,880
incorporate

3048
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:35,040
the gam approaching some kind of concept

3049
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,119
in a higher like scaling up when we say

3050
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:38,880
scale three let's also not be afraid to

3051
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:39,600
scale

3052
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,360
things like the perceptron and

3053
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,800
affordances and

3054
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:46,080
inactive robotics thanks

3055
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:47,920
when you're talking about the generative

3056
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:50,080
adversarial neural network i wondered if

3057
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:52,080
there was like a collaborative one

3058
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:54,239
just two networks that were teaching

3059
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:56,080
each other helpful examples and then

3060
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:56,960
when you pull back

3061
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,960
a level even if it's framed in an

3062
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,800
adversarial context between

3063
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,440
two models it's actually being done in a

3064
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:04,400
collaborative

3065
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,080
sense so that kind of is almost that

3066
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:09,920
multi-scale emergence right there

3067
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,119
let's talk about the category of the gam

3068
01:43:13,119 --> 01:43:14,800
it's like let's have gans talking to

3069
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:15,440
each other

3070
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:20,480
that's what i want awesome daniel adam

3071
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:22,320
well with respect to what you were just

3072
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,000
saying daniella i think that's actually

3073
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:24,400
a

3074
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,639
potentially a really good model of play

3075
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:27,600
in terms of this like

3076
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:30,000
ultimately benevolent adversarial

3077
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,360
attempted adversarially attacking

3078
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,480
yourself

3079
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:35,600
um but

3080
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:38,719
yeah in terms of future directions uh

3081
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:40,960
you know many things i'm not thinking of

3082
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,639
but the things that would

3083
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:47,280
particularly interest me would be um

3084
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:50,400
getting actually meta learning that

3085
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,320
would be really quite key and different

3086
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,760
forms of metal learning

3087
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,760
the ability to build up the

3088
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:56,960
sophistication

3089
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:00,239
and to have across episodes in context

3090
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:01,920
actually making sure that what's

3091
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:04,560
inferred and learned there

3092
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:08,320
will update and so uh it seems to me

3093
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,760
that

3094
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:13,040
to help with that uh maybe

3095
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,800
more crosstalk with machine learning

3096
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,239
that could be useful

3097
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:20,400
and more crosstalk with um uh

3098
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,400
people like shanna who can give us like

3099
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,239
the precision of of knowing

3100
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:27,679
you know uh which mappings are legit

3101
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:29,199
and what and what are our mappings

3102
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:30,960
actually doing um

3103
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,800
so for instance like i have notions that

3104
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,239
for instance you could think of the

3105
01:44:34,239 --> 01:44:36,400
brain as a whole as a kind of like vegan

3106
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,400
of sorts where it's like you have the

3107
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,920
very variational

3108
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,520
um auto encoder doing this

3109
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:42,960
dimensionality reduction getting into

3110
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,080
this latent space

3111
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:46,400
this latent space has a kind of graph

3112
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,080
structure like a graph neural network

3113
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:48,960
that has like

3114
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,880
geometric deep learning happening within

3115
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:52,719
it and then on top of this like

3116
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:54,239
the hippocampal system would give you

3117
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:56,560
like a kind of a higher order semantics

3118
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:57,840
on top of that

3119
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:00,960
but is that legit um and

3120
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,679
what's the relation and from there like

3121
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:05,280
there's gonna be particular

3122
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,199
operations happening some of which would

3123
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:08,639
correspond potentially to things like

3124
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:09,679
experience

3125
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:12,960
so is your experience a kind of discreet

3126
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,920
updating of like snapshots or is it

3127
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:17,760
actually a continuous flow

3128
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:20,400
um what are the like is it like for

3129
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:22,080
instance within like the association

3130
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:23,600
cortex like the latent space is just

3131
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:24,159
like

3132
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:26,320
fast message passing there or is it like

3133
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:29,520
the enslavement of the whole hierarchy

3134
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:30,960
so the question is like what

3135
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,639
computational objects

3136
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:34,800
are we dealing with it seems like we're

3137
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,480
going to need crosstalk with

3138
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:38,080
um people who have expertise and things

3139
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:39,520
like category theory and machine

3140
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:41,280
learning to actually understand those

3141
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:42,880
well and i think if we bring those

3142
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,199
together a lot of the debates might end

3143
01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:46,719
up being resolved like we can have for

3144
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:47,440
instance

3145
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:50,400
both instrumentalism and realism we can

3146
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:50,800
then

3147
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:52,560
at certain points start to have enough

3148
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:53,840
constraints so we can

3149
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:57,199
work our way um towards uh

3150
01:45:57,199 --> 01:45:59,679
things like uh applying sophisticated

3151
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:01,280
inference to yourself

3152
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,679
in ways that are like uh i don't want to

3153
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:05,280
criticize active inference

3154
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,440
but it does seem like sometimes a

3155
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,960
failure mode is the power of the

3156
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:09,840
framework

3157
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,600
can result in kind the same failures

3158
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,440
good old-fashioned cognitive science

3159
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:15,199
of like don't bother me with plumbing

3160
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:16,560
functionalism

3161
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:18,880
and ideally if we can go across the more

3162
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,480
perspectives we can

3163
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,400
bring to bear on something going across

3164
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:25,520
implementational algorithmic

3165
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:27,840
and computational and cross-reference

3166
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:28,560
them and

3167
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,040
bring in phenomenology too that would be

3168
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,239
really helpful and so

3169
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:33,920
sometimes it seems like we're a little

3170
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:36,639
bit anemic on the implementation

3171
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:39,040
uh we're squinting a bit um more than we

3172
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:40,239
might realize and

3173
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:43,520
so how do we beef up the algorithms uh

3174
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:46,719
so ultimately though for me uh the end

3175
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:47,600
game

3176
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,080
uh is i think i want to bring active

3177
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:51,040
inference to

3178
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:52,320
explain consciousness i think it's a

3179
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,239
major transition in evolution

3180
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:56,239
it's the elephant in the room it is the

3181
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:58,239
room by and large it's not the only

3182
01:46:58,239 --> 01:46:59,679
thing going on but you know

3183
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:01,520
we should not underestimate its power no

3184
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:02,800
matter how much it's fashionable to

3185
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:03,760
denigrate it

3186
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:06,560
um things like the nature of selfhood as

3187
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,080
constructed process

3188
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:10,639
and getting metacognition out of that

3189
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:12,480
and not just reducing metacognition

3190
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,880
to a kind of hyperparameter but actually

3191
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,159
as a process

3192
01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:18,320
with particular epistemics that are

3193
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,840
realized in particular ways

3194
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:23,280
constructively and

3195
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,920
of that kind and then ultimately uh what

3196
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,760
i would like

3197
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:30,000
so i i think active inference will be

3198
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,199
capable

3199
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:33,520
of making major inroads into answering

3200
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:34,880
schroeder's question more than we've

3201
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:36,159
done in the past

3202
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:38,560
i think we might even have a definitive

3203
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:39,679
answer

3204
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:41,840
and maybe in the not too distant future

3205
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:44,080
i think we might have a definitive

3206
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:44,800
answer

3207
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:48,239
potentially or not to the hard problem

3208
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:51,119
and ultimately i want um free will to be

3209
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:52,400
a part of it

3210
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,239
i want and by free will i know there's a

3211
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:55,600
lot of ways that that's

3212
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:58,880
uh word is used but actually use it i

3213
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,480
like refer back to the language

3214
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,800
we want the the degrees of freedom and

3215
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,159
the directed drive

3216
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:06,000
we want this optionality this

3217
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,360
empowerment of our options being open

3218
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:08,480
but we want those options

3219
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:10,719
to be able to steer in particular ways

3220
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:11,920
and

3221
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:14,159
this like free will is like what

3222
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:15,520
meaningful power is

3223
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:18,560
what uh it's what enables meaning

3224
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,280
this um it's what enables open-ended

3225
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:22,320
evolution

3226
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:24,560
of a particular directed kind where

3227
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:25,840
we're actually getting

3228
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:28,480
teleology we're actually having you know

3229
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:29,600
the things we care about

3230
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:30,960
and the things that actually move the

3231
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:33,440
world and uh

3232
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,840
you know that let let us let us get to

3233
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:36,480
the moon

3234
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,719
you know bombs that leveled cities all

3235
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:39,679
these things

3236
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:42,880
uh that the future will depend on uh

3237
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,000
free will is going to be part of that

3238
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
story precisely operationalizing what we

3239
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,679
mean you could just say agency

3240
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:49,280
that's fine but that's we're going to

3241
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,360
need and so something like

3242
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:54,159
uh and and potentially again framework

3243
01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:55,600
would be part of that

3244
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:57,760
how well am i doing precisely narrowing

3245
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:01,520
down the micro mechanics of agency

3246
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:04,639
thanks that's mike thanks adam

3247
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:07,760
i would love to see and expect

3248
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:10,719
and will enact policy to improve

3249
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:13,119
communication and education

3250
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:14,800
you're right there's so much more to be

3251
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:17,679
done it's worthwhile to

3252
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:19,599
criticize or to see where it could

3253
01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:20,800
improve because those are the

3254
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:21,920
affordances

3255
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:24,000
for a contribution so it would be

3256
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,080
awesome to see

3257
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:28,560
everything that people just mentioned

3258
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,800
arise as well as to include a lot of

3259
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:31,599
voices in the

3260
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:34,400
conversation that maybe know about

3261
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:36,239
active inference today but don't feel

3262
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:36,560
like

3263
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,800
they're in a position to contribute even

3264
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:40,639
beginners especially contribute through

3265
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:42,719
their questions and for those who have

3266
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:43,840
disciplinary

3267
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:45,920
expertise or who want to be a new kind

3268
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:46,960
of generalist

3269
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:49,280
for this new way of doing science i hope

3270
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:50,159
they'll find a home

3271
01:49:50,159 --> 01:49:54,000
in active inference as well so

3272
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,760
fun times the math stream's always a

3273
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:58,400
wild ride

3274
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:02,480
um we really appreciate it

3275
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:05,760
it's an awesome convo i hope that people

3276
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:06,639
will

3277
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:09,040
stay in touch if you're watching in

3278
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:11,119
replay leave a comment and the lab will

3279
01:50:11,119 --> 01:50:12,159
still be there

3280
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:14,239
and for all of you here just thanks so

3281
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:16,560
much for participating and

3282
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,639
each of you would be awesome to give a

3283
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:20,560
solo or have a conversation to

3284
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,639
explore some of these ideas so it's

3285
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:25,840
great times everyone

3286
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:30,159
bye okay everyone bye
