1
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:20,887
All right.

2
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:21,521
All right.

3
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,722
Welcome, everybody.

4
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:25,525
And thanks for joining today.

5
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:30,230
It is June 9th, 2021
and we're here in Acton Flat,

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,466
North Stream, number 3.1 with Dobson,

7
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,603
Saffron Knight, Ratner and Friedman.

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,139
Today is going to be a fun discussion.

9
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,642
We hope that you're also able to,
if you're watching live,

10
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:46,179
ask us some questions because certainly
we don't have much planned

11
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,448
and would appreciate
from that feedback with you.

12
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,385
We're just going to jump right into it.

13
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,988
And by way of introduction and welcome,

14
00:00:55,922 --> 00:01:00,126
ask what is active influence
and how we got here.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,264
We're going to go around
and give just some initial conditions,

16
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,866
initial thoughts on these questions.

17
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:11,037
From wherever we're coming from as we
sort of converge on this discussion.

18
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,074
And then we'll just be
writing down thoughts

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,710
and ready to jump in
and continue the discussion.

20
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:22,816
So who would like to give a first pass
on either or both of these questions?

21
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,290
If I could try.

22
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,391
Thank you, Adam.

23
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,292
Go for it.

24
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,264
So for me,

25
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:42,702
active inference is a normative

26
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:45,939
process theory for how?

27
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,808
A principle of what it takes to exist.

28
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:53,279
The free energy principle or what
it takes to persist can be realized

29
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,483
and it's
what are the things you have to do

30
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:01,421
if you're going to have,
I want to say to outsource your entropy

31
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:05,625
or avoid getting all mixed up in the meat
grinder existence or whatever.

32
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,028
What kind of intelligence,
what kind of modeling

33
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,932
will you need to exhibit to do this to

34
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,603
And so, in a way, it's

35
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,772
for me, the answer to the question
of what is mind

36
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,244
and potentially
with certain versions of it, what is life

37
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,081
and what other versions
of it, what is consciousness

38
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,852
and maybe even what is free will.

39
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,721
Nice big questions.

40
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:38,124
And how did you get here?

41
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,026
I have no idea.

42
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,997
It all started with an existential crisis
when I was young.

43
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,200
That went on for a very long time.

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,770
But then I would say I found my way to

45
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,841
the architect, Karl Feresten

46
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:01,814
when I was basically through Jeff
Hawkins book on intelligence.

47
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:04,350
I learned about predictive coding,
and that was my honor

48
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:08,054
to Carl's work and the rest is history.

49
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,323
Awesome.

50
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,193
So we heard some big general ideas.

51
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,562
What is mind? What is life?

52
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:16,696
Who else would like to go?

53
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,399
Or I'll give a thought.

54
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,970
For. Blue one and go for it.

55
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:25,638
Sure.

56
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:30,810
I came to active inference
through my interest in scaling.

57
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:36,316
So how do you scale processes
like at like from very small,

58
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:40,386
like subatomic
to cellular to organismal to societal.

59
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:44,591
So that that was kind of how
I got hooked into the active inference

60
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,292
framework.

61
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,661
And and for me, it's a framework

62
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,165
that pretty

63
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,168
gives a pretty good representation

64
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,805
of how we tend to represent

65
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,507
and think about the world we predict.

66
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,944
We have feedback from like we predict
something will happen.

67
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,714
You know,
if I turn the thermometer on the,

68
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,949
if I turn the temperature up
that the heat will go on.

69
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,018
So we predict that we take the action.

70
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,287
And if the heat doesn't go
on, we have a surprise.

71
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:18,825
And so, you know, we then we go, well,
what what made our model go wrong?

72
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,526
Right. Like, maybe my heater is broken.

73
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,863
So it's kind of minimizing the surprise
and uncertainty

74
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,399
in our interactions in the world.

75
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,036
Awesome. All right.

76
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,138
Well, either
the two of you you'd like to go or.

77
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,410
Shoshanna, do you want go today?

78
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:37,810
Go ahead.

79
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,244
What are you.

80
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,913
Go ahead. OK, so I'm.

81
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,550
I'm perhaps in some sense outside of
because I'm not the

82
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,621
I'm not doing research with
active interests, but I'm a philosopher.

83
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:52,425
My background is in philosophy,
and I think active in

84
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,295
is a very interesting thing,
first of all.

85
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:56,162
First, of course,

86
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:59,165
I like to speak general questions
that Adam raised at the beginning.

87
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,900
What is mind, what is life,
what is consciousness?

88
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,137
And it's very close
to what I normally think about.

89
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,972
I'm a philosopher.

90
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,908
I'm a bit skeptical
whether one could actually answer this

91
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:11,678
big question in a very

92
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,479
succinct. But.

93
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,881
That's a different story.

94
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,484
I think Active in Friends
is very interesting from a philosophical

95
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,953
historical perspective
as well, because it kind of

96
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,525
embodies a tension

97
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,762
which ran through philosophy
or through the history of thinking

98
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:33,933
and which more or less started
a very famous philosopher,

99
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:36,903
a man who can't make the distinction
between

100
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,605
an object.

101
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,542
Well, he called it the world in itself,
like an outside world.

102
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,178
And the way
you helped me to confirm this,

103
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,481
and now we can go to waste from here
one more.

104
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:52,652
One could stay in the pantheon
and paradigm

105
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,789
where the question is
how do we actually perceive or are able

106
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:00,960
to make representations of the outside
world of who's going to the different

107
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,030
direction and say, Oh,
it's really about acting in this world.

108
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,166
And Active in Friends is a kind of

109
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,770
an interesting
twist mixed between these two ideas.

110
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,375
And my experience with it,
that some thinkers in the Active

111
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:20,680
in Friends camp,
they tend to align closer

112
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:25,351
with the new Kantian tradition
and the other line of thinkers.

113
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:27,754
They tend to

114
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,858
align more closely to this perception
action way of thinking.

115
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,327
So I'm very interested in this tension
maybe

116
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,330
to think about how it could be resolved.

117
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,634
And so I'm curious
and how did I get there?

118
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:46,439
Like well, I worked a lot with Shana

119
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,808
here and Shana basically and

120
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,812
got me, so yeah.

121
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:53,746
So Shana.

122
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,282
Thank you, Robert.

123
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,218
Shana, go for it. Yes.

124
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,722
So right, what with active inference.

125
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:06,092
So I too, I'm
probably more outside than Robert is.

126
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,061
I'm the math person here,
so I've just sort of off in the woods

127
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:12,532
trying to think about like that
how to scale all of these theories.

128
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,402
So you have this formalism
and activism and, you know,

129
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:20,540
inference based on sort of discriminating
between system in its environment.

130
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,344
And I think that's predicated upon a kind
of a very serious boundary argument.

131
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,013
So I'm really interested in boundaries.

132
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:27,980
I'm interested in also

133
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,751
how boundaries are predicated
upon also a possible holographic theorem

134
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,921
so when we say no agent

135
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:38,925
is interacting with this environment,
how does that actually work

136
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,195
in a categorical way?

137
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,263
So we haven't been using it
as a probability way,

138
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,300
but I'm sort of interested in
how do you do that categorically and

139
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,736
can you mathematicians that even more
and sort of infinity categorical by that

140
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,274
and perhaps like the definition
between inside and outside is

141
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,077
I think, a very, very beautiful one.

142
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:02,014
And so how can we actually say that

143
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,651
what is represented in
the outside is the inside

144
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,287
inferred?

145
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,389
Like what are the mathematics of that?

146
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,124
Also, this seems to be happening

147
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:15,328
in a certain version
of a similar simultaneous ness.

148
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,531
So when I understand the mathematics
and science and also this sort of

149
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,300
synchronic
and diachronic emergence of phenomena.

150
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,636
So I think that what's happening
also in the

151
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:27,473
I think the active inference
formalism is dynamical enough

152
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,644
to allow for these sort
of mathematical ideas to come in.

153
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,213
And if you can mathematicians
that then perhaps you're going to

154
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,781
answer these questions
that Adam was asking

155
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,283
what is consciousness, what is mind?

156
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,818
And those are those are the heavyweights.

157
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,887
And I think that's why
you have the heavyweights of this panel

158
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:45,258
as opposed to just like for the question,
how did you get here?

159
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,959
I'm trying to figure that out myself.

160
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,629
So I didn't know that
then it's like existentially or whatever.

161
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,597
Somehow I just kind of came on line.

162
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:55,501
If you want to know how I got like
in this interface, I don't know.

163
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:56,536
And then

164
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:01,073
but my
very good colleague Jill gave a talk

165
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,776
and I sort of attended and I see.

166
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,611
So he was asked a question.

167
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,512
I sort of answered it.

168
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,881
And then community like welcome me.

169
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,349
So that that's how I got here.

170
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,450
But I don't know how I got here.

171
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,387
Amazing. Awesome. Thank you.

172
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,224
And yep, excuse
any strange noises in my background.

173
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,928
What is active inference?

174
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,531
I really like just a bunch of pieces
that people brought up.

175
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:29,201
Robert, you brought up that there's
this action elements,

176
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:34,273
this pragmatic turn, looking at action
and perception in the world.

177
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,709
And then right there,
the second word is inference,

178
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:40,713
and that's not transcendental
or like a Kantian type approach.

179
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,650
So when I look at active inference,
I see action and inference

180
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,487
sounds a little first level,
but those are the two pieces

181
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:52,058
that are coming together,
which is traditions of action

182
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,027
in the world
and traditions of inference in the world.

183
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,764
Now, as compared with reinforcement
learning

184
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:02,368
or other approaches to thinking
about agency and action in the world

185
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,707
or other economic metaphors, active
inference diverges in a few key ways.

186
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,844
It focuses on the reduction
of uncertainty rather

187
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:15,481
than the maximization,
for example, reward or value alone.

188
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:19,685
So uncertainty reduction is a key
component of active inference

189
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,055
and also what Adam brought up,
which is the resistance to dissipation

190
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:28,894
and the characteristics of living systems
to be actively resisting by making

191
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:33,599
increasingly adequate generative models
of their niche resisting dissipation.

192
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,069
And then also I see
active inference as a bridge

193
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:41,040
to disciplines and communities
such as systems engineering

194
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,310
or ecological psychology or embodiment.

195
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,513
And so all these different areas
that relate in one way

196
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:51,450
to action and inference or to philosophy.

197
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:55,021
There's so many roads
that come together, active inference,

198
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,858
and that's a little bit
about how I think I got here as well.

199
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,828
I remember hearing about it
for the first time from Yellow

200
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,164
Bruno Burke,
who came on an earlier stream,

201
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,901
and it was a picture of,
I think, a Dutch person

202
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:12,338
holding a cup of coffee and listening
to music and biking with one hand

203
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:16,142
and asking about this question of skill
and of action in the world

204
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:20,680
and just raising this provocative notion
that current models

205
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,383
that we had for action
planning weren't doing their job.

206
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,519
They weren't able to explain
that person on a bicycle

207
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,522
so since then, I've
just been learning by doing

208
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,424
so cool

209
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,460
for this first question,
and I'm sure we can return back to it

210
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,264
and ask more questions
about active inference as we head on.

211
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,333
And of course, anybody who's watching
live is more than welcome

212
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,936
to ask us a question which all relay on.

213
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,972
Let's go to

214
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,442
some of our questions
that we've thought about before.

215
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,478
And this slide asks,

216
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,947
What is the role of space

217
00:11:55,514 --> 00:12:00,419
in active inference or in other areas
that people aren't familiar with working,

218
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,522
and what is the role of time?

219
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,392
And then we have that non locality
for both space

220
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,563
and time
because maybe we're curious about what

221
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,965
non locality looks like
in space and time.

222
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:18,671
So anyone is welcome to raise their hand
or give a first thought.

223
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,541
Can I give a first thought
since that was?

224
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,008
Yeah, yeah.

225
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,378
So in the probabilistic setting
and the statistical mechanics,

226
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,881
it's the mathematics
that fuels active inference.

227
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:32,284
Right before you have me trying
to come in and categorize everything

228
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,055
just for the active inference
kind of experts in the crowd,

229
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:36,956
I was going to ask you

230
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,559
the role of space.

231
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,761
Like what is it?

232
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:46,465
So are you, you know, modeling
all of this on some kind of Euclidean

233
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:52,238
sort of manifolds, or are we looking
at something a little more interesting?

234
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,441
So where I come from, I'm sort of
if you really believe

235
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,711
there's only now, then
what does that actually translate to?

236
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,847
So we're going to take these sort
of powerful philosophies of like,

237
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,684
you know, if there really is no future
in the only or in future

238
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,486
some kind of potential
that you only actualize.

239
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:11,323
Now, can you translate that for me
into what your space looks like?

240
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,727
So quantum mechanics is working over
sort of non hour comedians this

241
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,463
where you have a very severe cutoff.

242
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,565
You don't have these infinitesimals
and things.

243
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:24,937
So what like what does the space
actually look like for someone like me

244
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,408
who really believes that this sort of
and this interface and this greatest

245
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,245
that every other nanosecond
it does not exist, whatever that means.

246
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,381
So this whole thing is
a grand interpretation.

247
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,150
I just wanted to know
what you all thought about

248
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,586
in this inference model.

249
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,756
If space is actually jagged and singular
or if you're assuming

250
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:47,726
that it's
some sort of interpolated continuity

251
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,562
nice question.

252
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,530
Adam, you have a thought there.

253
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,936
On a few the

254
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:00,873
so most of

255
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:05,644
my thinking has been in focusing on goal
oriented behavior

256
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,881
consciousness agency, pursuing goals.

257
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,151
And this is the general, the

258
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,053
that's what I'm going for.

259
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:17,756
And that's like all questions end up
getting filtered through that for me.

260
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,360
But and

261
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,198
so, for instance,
and I could see space and time

262
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,369
in different senses
showing up in different ways.

263
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,439
So I'm just

264
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:35,474
now theory of consciousness.

265
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,843
I recently proposed

266
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:41,146
I was suggesting that we can think of it
in terms of world modeling,

267
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:45,918
but for this role modeling to actually
be capable of bringing forth the world

268
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:50,789
or being experienced for it has to have
certain coherence properties.

269
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:56,395
And so I was thinking of concentric
categories as not just preconditions

270
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:01,567
for judgment space time
cause maybe some sort of unifying

271
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,503
minimal selfhood,

272
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,207
but these are also preconditions

273
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:11,844
for any kind of sense making whatsoever
and for the appearance of the world.

274
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,380
People could object to that.

275
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,217
But then the question
about what exactly do you mean by space,

276
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:22,021
time and clause and self, how much
and what kinds in which circumstances?

277
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:28,294
And so for me, space, I tend to think of
it more in terms of locality

278
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,631
or there's like relative degrees
of proximity among things.

279
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,266
And then

280
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,135
there is

281
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:40,773
as for time,
it would be things changing within space

282
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,176
in a kind of proportional sense,
like there's other senses of time.

283
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,613
Like you could have some sort
of like clock like processes

284
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,250
that are like either in parallel and
coming to agreement or like centralize

285
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:56,522
and another sense of certain bottlenecks
that force a kind of temporal ordering

286
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:58,123
or just

287
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,560
thinking about like things
changing the things at different rates.

288
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,563
There's, I think, problematic circularity
in what I said.

289
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,199
But in terms of the senses of space,

290
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:12,838
well,

291
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,541
I'll stop there,
but I could keep going later. Now.

292
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:21,447
To just a few,
I guess, basic thoughts on space.

293
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,749
I thought about embodied agents

294
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:28,387
and how an agent has a location
in a spatial model.

295
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,690
So like the Active in France paper
that we had

296
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,526
where different ants
were on a different location in space.

297
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,931
Now there's a difference
between the space

298
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,833
that the actual physical thing is in

299
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,570
and in the model, which kind of relates
to this Kantian distinction.

300
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:49,041
Perhaps but even when we have a
disembodied agent, there's a state space.

301
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:53,512
So I don't know what is the relationship
between a mathematical state space and

302
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,182
whatever
you were mentioning there previously?

303
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,350
And then over time,

304
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,221
it just made me think about the
distinction between Cronos and Kairos,

305
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:07,192
where Cronos being like sort of a metric
or a measured time,

306
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,162
like a model of time or something
that's regularized,

307
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,298
and then Kairos being timeliness

308
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,402
and action happens kind of in both.

309
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:21,907
Action takes clock time to carry out,
but also action has its own timescale

310
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,610
and actions have their own
sort of story arc

311
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:28,180
yeah.

312
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,350
Yeah, go for it.

313
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,019
And then anyone else who raise your hand.

314
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,156
So space is something that I've thought

315
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:41,727
about a lot relative
to like my previous work.

316
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,663
And I think about it
a lot also in terms of boundaries, right?

317
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:49,968
So where does one thing
stop and another thing start?

318
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,971
And, you know, like even

319
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:56,909
something so simple as like
how do I define like my fingernail?

320
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,512
Like where is the boundary between
like your fingernail and your cuticle?

321
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,614
And anybody
who's like really dug in there, like

322
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,617
there's some parts of your cuticle
that you're like, is this am

323
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,052
I supposed to cut this or what?

324
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,389
Like, like, so there's,
there's not a clear distinction

325
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:15,794
or, or line that can be drawn around
what is my right?

326
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,396
And so trying to find this

327
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:21,166
this distinct boundary
also in terms of inclusion in a group

328
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:26,572
and I listened to your last math stream
Chana and Daniel.

329
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,775
And I was
I was really kind of thinking about this.

330
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,946
And I've been thinking about cancer
a lot in terms of inclusion in a group

331
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,281
as you guys were talking about that.

332
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,551
And it's like I also think about it
as like a school shooter,

333
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,520
like a cancer cell goes rogue.

334
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,223
Like they're somehow
not included in the group

335
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,058
they're not
part of the collective anymore.

336
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,261
And then they take on their own
like self-interested agenda.

337
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,529
And I also think about that,

338
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:54,199
like in terms of a school shooter
or someone that commits mass violence

339
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,603
and you know,
like when you have this kind of it's

340
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,171
someone that's not included in a group.

341
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:03,842
It's someone that even it's
not included in like like a rebel group.

342
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,445
Like the al Qaeda or something.
They're rejected from that group also.

343
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:10,415
So when they can't find inclusion,
they become like this rogue agent.

344
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:14,486
And so so then if I think about spaces
as in where do you draw that line?

345
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,690
I have a hard time finding that space
and something I like to push on

346
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,092
and then time.

347
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,661
I don't really work with time too much.

348
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:26,765
Like actually per se other than like
I have to deal with like this linear time

349
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:27,566
that we're trapped in.

350
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:31,470
But I do think about expansion
and compression of time relative to age.

351
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,673
So like as a young person, like time

352
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,911
seems to be so expanded,
like 5 minutes is forever.

353
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,147
And as you get older in life, like a year
just flies by, right?

354
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,217
So, so like as time expanded

355
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,854
as a young person and then compressed
as you seem to age through life.

356
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,491
Thank you, Blue Robert, then Chuck

357
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,060
Yeah.

358
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,965
I think there's a more of a question
and something really interesting to say,

359
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,166
but it's a question for you.

360
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:05,037
Maybe you can give me a good answer
because here on this slide, there's

361
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,340
the second word which is in parentheses
which is non locality.

362
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,810
And I
and my guess is that Chana put it there

363
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,049
and my question would be
whether there is anything

364
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,952
that remotely resembles some notion of

365
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,989
at negative influence

366
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,891
to make that more concrete.

367
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:30,862
My impression
when I, when I read articles by people

368
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:35,234
who are active in friends or work
in that area was that they usually

369
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:40,272
work against the very classical notion
of space and time as a background.

370
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,475
So you mentioned the ends
that move in physical space,

371
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,345
and that's usually assumed
to be a classical wall.

372
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:50,415
Or if you're
I don't know if you think about the cell

373
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,552
and you imply implied concepts to a cell,

374
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,388
then you say, OK,
the molecules, it's a classical thing.

375
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,458
So there is no notion of non
locality there.

376
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,093
I guess I don't know

377
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:03,495
and my question

378
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:07,733
would
be how, whether and how an influence

379
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,901
would accommodate
some notion of complicated

380
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,673
nice question.

381
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,708
We can definitely wonder
and come back to that.

382
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,144
Seana and then Adam.

383
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,179
Yeah, thanks. Yeah.

384
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,683
So just to get to that time part
because I hadn't talked about that,

385
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,952
so thanks for watching the last stream.

386
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:31,523
I'm really fascinated by time and I
don't think my time really works linear.

387
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,491
It's really hard to say.

388
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:36,962
Like, whereas yesterday
you could do this sort of like cone

389
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,999
sort of formulation
and if you want to general relativity,

390
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,168
then you can say,
oh yeah, yesterday is in the light

391
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:47,506
cone of whatever,
you know, so but like what is it?

392
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,240
And where is that?

393
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,510
So when I ask about the role of time,
the thing that I'm sort of,

394
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:52,577
that I proposed in that

395
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,882
theory diamond paper that I have
about like

396
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:00,319
the applications of all this stuff
that this higher category stuff

397
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:04,089
is to think that maybe
time is more like a protein.

398
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,225
So in math, you have this pro object
which is glued together from a bunch

399
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,529
of like morph isms
and other collections of it.

400
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:15,901
So it seems that it signs this thing
that is also emergent.

401
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:20,038
I'm the advocate that it's not fixed
right I'm also an advocate that

402
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,607
I don't really know how you measure time
without constructing it.

403
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,509
So I'm not sure that we're actually

404
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,379
constructing a notion of now
or does it actually exist.

405
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,515
So an active inference and sure
constructing every,

406
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,185
every second of whatever,
every unit of time,

407
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,722
you know, how, how can you actually

408
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,092
measure the inference without

409
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,761
constructing a parallel notion of time
in the same thing?

410
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:47,099
So we're not I'm sorry, but coherence
and know if you need a coherence property

411
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,936
for temporality
to actually give you a singular now

412
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,738
or something,
what does that actually look like?

413
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:53,472
So Robert's right.

414
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,640
That was me
that put the noun locality in there

415
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,844
because we have like a rough idea of non
locality of space.

416
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,680
You can have a two point
perspective of space, something like,

417
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:07,586
you know, my in my state where I'm
not like an entangled pair of photons,

418
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:12,357
I can clearly say, oh, Silver
Lake is over there and I'm in my condo.

419
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,659
On the other side,
there's a sort of separated distance,

420
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:18,363
but going to a pair of entangled photons,
there is no separated distance.

421
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,632
And so you have a two point
perspective of space.

422
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,335
So it's in the mastering that I did
last time.

423
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,270
In it, we were trying to figure out,

424
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,706
is there actually a two point
perspective of time?

425
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,378
Can you actually be a macro system
and say that this is purely non-local

426
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:33,845
so real.

427
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,615
I really like Robert's question saying,
where is the non locality?

428
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:40,419
I'm trying to build that
into the very mathematics of the thing of

429
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,722
of trying to categorize this awesome
formalism.

430
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:47,659
But yeah, so just time
I think is it's very strange

431
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,861
and I think it's something
that we should all probably try

432
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:53,265
to try to tackle instead of signaling
that it's always there

433
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,200
it's just some background phenomena.

434
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,403
But if time is emergent
and space is emergent also,

435
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,573
then it sounds like active inference
is the right dynamical formalism

436
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:02,340
that could actually

437
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,043
kind of
help that too, because maybe the agent

438
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:09,481
is also making time
at the same time that it's making

439
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:11,917
a. World

440
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,786
like yeah.

441
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,423
We've seen active inference models
where each time step of the model,

442
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,393
the agent does like a rollout
through the future

443
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,462
that's called
sophisticated active inference.

444
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:27,299
And then also it's a great point
about the multiple reference points.

445
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:31,603
We have two eyes at different spatial
locations, and that's how we infer depth,

446
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,339
which isn't just a feature of the world
because it's something

447
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:38,043
that we have to infer and therefore it's
susceptible to optical illusions.

448
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,012
And then the question
What time do we have a monocle?

449
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,282
We only have one reference point on time
because then we're going

450
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:47,419
to be
just totally unable to calculate depth

451
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,423
or if we can calculate or experience
temporal depth,

452
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,960
does that entail that we're having
multiple reference points in time?

453
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,662
So Adam and then anyone else.

454
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:01,833
So let's

455
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,803
try to bring a few threads together

456
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,406
so some of the movements.

457
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,842
So what I'm really liking

458
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:15,247
about Blue and Shower, we're just saying
is a sort of relational realism

459
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,351
so instead of saying like, what is time,
what is space, period?

460
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,320
Well, what is it relative to what?

461
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:23,822
And then

462
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,424
what is the and when I say coherence,

463
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,528
coherence relative to what?

464
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,163
And so

465
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,933
and I kind of backtrack some

466
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,238
in the content issue of like

467
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:45,277
is it that or just interacting
and or is it that we're modeling?

468
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,347
And the modeling is
just kind of a pretense that's useful

469
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,050
for describing this like sea of forces.

470
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,287
And that goes beyond description.

471
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,389
I think we can have both

472
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:01,593
and so what I tend to do
is view interesting systems

473
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,296
in terms of an act of inference.

474
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:08,133
Also like neater nested markup blankets
and you have nested

475
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,002
kind of nested hierarchy of dynamics.

476
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,572
And so you can think of, for instance,

477
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:18,310
a set of coupling processes
as some sort of chaining together

478
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,346
of disparate of systems
that manages to stitch

479
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:24,215
itself, hold itself together
through the way it's chained.

480
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:29,120
And this could couple with the world
in a way that doesn't require necessarily

481
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,591
there might be like an implicit
representation to it

482
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,594
if you want to use the word in that way
of like a correspondence

483
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,796
between the dynamics and like

484
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,766
what is evolving of

485
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,403
or you could
or that's like but it's not necessarily

486
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,441
it may not be inference in the sense
of like the model,

487
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:53,011
like whether you want to say
that this modeling process is real

488
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:56,014
or a way of doing things,
that's it's a matter of perspective.

489
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:01,319
But then as you add layers of complexity,
then you can get things like

490
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:03,521
inter loop

491
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:07,459
processes that could refer to this

492
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:11,529
set of kind of action relations
and bringing things together.

493
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,666
And then you could even
maybe have on top of those or

494
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,637
within those another process
which points to those.

495
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,941
So graphs pointing at graphs
when it graphs and so like channels

496
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,610
like category theoretic perspective
would be very relevant here.

497
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,547
But and so at some levels

498
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,617
you might talk of things
like representations

499
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:37,088
in a Cartesian sense, like in good old
fashioned of sites, we may have those

500
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,791
and we have an activist
intelligent coupling

501
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:43,261
where it's just implicit representation
and maybe we shouldn't even use that word

502
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,497
or maybe we should use that word.

503
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,500
I'm not going to say,
but we can have it all.

504
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,402
And so the

505
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,739
way that the thing like space and time,

506
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,810
some of these national systems,
I think there could be in a way a kind of

507
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:04,282
non locality and that they would be
evolving independently.

508
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:05,850
They're evolving on their own timescale.

509
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,986
So like a nested deep
hierarchy of dynamics,

510
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,790
there's a sense which they're all kind of
brought together by virtue of

511
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,660
like sharing this mark
all blanket that they ultimately agree.

512
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,629
So I guess I don't know if that would be,

513
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,598
but there's, there's potentially ways
in which they can diverge also.

514
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:26,071
And so it seems like you could have maybe
periods of not locality and locality

515
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,673
and actually
this kind of going in and out

516
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:32,043
and probably butchering
and abusing the terminology, I apologize,

517
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,713
but there's going in
and it might even be necessary

518
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:38,283
like necessary for a kind of dual phase
evolution for the systems

519
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,720
to couple for them
to like trade off their free energy

520
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,023
for them to do what they do
as a sort of like iterative

521
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,693
inferring their own existence
and doing what they need to do process.

522
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,763
But so within this

523
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,900
view, it seems
like time can show up in multiple ways.

524
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:56,901
It's like the

525
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:01,272
the the time of just

526
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:06,044
the world as this evolving graph
as a generative process in that way,

527
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:11,116
in terms of if there's a kind of within
if we if we narrow it in

528
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,353
to particular system where there is like
some things were before

529
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:19,357
and some things we're after in terms
of this sea of causal influences.

530
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:23,228
But then you might get another kind of
time of this psychological time of

531
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,964
spatial easing time of

532
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:31,035
and then navigating through specialized
time and same things for space.

533
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,904
And then it comes in again

534
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,206
one more thing

535
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:38,977
I guess I would say
is the issue of space and time.

536
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,613
I think it's going to be

537
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,016
two things about that. So

538
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,319
one idea and playing with
is actually that our consciousness

539
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,223
is actually the spatial kind of it
in terms of visual spatial.

540
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,325
This it's actually always 2D

541
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:58,930
and that to the extent that we have
something like a 3D awareness of space,

542
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,501
it's coherent state
transitions of these 2D projections

543
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,771
and there might be a relevance
to holography there.

544
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:09,607
That's one thing to say.

545
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,510
But one more thing would be

546
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,780
and then you have maybe like a 3D type
space in terms of body space.

547
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,948
So you have like a visual

548
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,751
spatial Cartesian space
and then like space relative to the body,

549
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:23,488
maybe like a kind of quasi
polar coordinate space and in between

550
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,625
the two of them,
you can get a kind of like 3D spacing

551
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,863
coming out of that surf or 40 space
because there's dynamics for it.

552
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:33,932
But the one more thing about

553
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,569
subsuming space and time

554
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:42,207
to action relative to
what is I think this will be crucial

555
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:45,076
for boundaries in terms of what counts
as a living system or not.

556
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,213
And what would count
as a conscious system

557
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,848
or not of what counts,

558
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,617
what are the physical and computational
substrates of consciousness?

559
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,954
What kind of closure is achieved
on what scales

560
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:58,223
that issue?

561
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:58,990
I think

562
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,760
so what I would like to have happen

563
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,663
is either some sort of

564
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,732
definitive handling of this,
some sort of like category

565
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:11,970
theoretic definitive handling
that would basically nail it hard.

566
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,404
Problem solved.

567
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:17,041
Schrödinger's
question answered, unambiguous or

568
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:20,945
I want to prove that this is impossible
and then I can rest how

569
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:24,115
thanks.

570
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:24,949
Adam.

571
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:28,219
Maybe Robert was alluding to this
with the skepticism, but for me,

572
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,456
whether something is answered
or not, it's a psychological story.

573
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,091
That we're telling.

574
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,760
And you can be convinced about something
that whether it's proven

575
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,030
to be impossible or proven to be ruled
in, that would be a story.

576
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:42,467
And then also nice
about the projective geometry.

577
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:45,570
We talked about the projective
geometry paper

578
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:49,507
some time ago about how we can look
at something like the corner of a room.

579
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,075
And even though the angles are going in

580
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,712
weird directions,
we kind of infer it to be rectilinear.

581
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,815
So that's pretty cool. Any

582
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,118
thoughts here?

583
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,453
Quickly on the projection geometry?

584
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:06,291
Actually,
I really love David Ross work on that

585
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,527
because it's like putting it's
a discussion of consciousness.

586
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:13,798
It like puts a person
or puts an observer in subjectivity

587
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,134
and interests
like right at the center of it

588
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:21,339
one thing I'm wondering about is

589
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:25,677
what is like
the realization of this sort of

590
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:30,048
projective geometric perspective engine
that he's thinking

591
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:33,251
we have for spatial awareness?

592
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:36,220
It seems like

593
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,691
there could be like a sense that just

594
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,593
that this is something the brain can do.

595
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:43,594
Like there's some proposals

596
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,930
for something like this,
like engine has capsule networks

597
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,967
no matter how like their thousand brains

598
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,704
that like there is a kind of

599
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,006
reference for independent modeling
happening

600
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,875
happening in a distributed way
as part of the architecture.

601
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:01,879
They're just like somehow through it
it works as this graphics engine

602
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,983
I actually think it might be a more

603
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,686
and inactive type thing in this

604
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,890
where actually the reason
you get this projective

605
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,561
geometric perspective capacity

606
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:21,632
is because of this coupling between body
space and visual space.

607
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,302
Linked by different kinds
of performance relations.

608
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:29,240
And that this is actually part of what's
letting you do these state transitions

609
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:33,044
and do this kind of projective
geometric modeling rather than

610
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:36,314
it being baked in and the distributed way
like some sort of graphics engine.

611
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:40,952
But this is another way in which like,
for instance, embodiment and interest

612
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:45,923
and value kind of other things
get subsumed to that. Like

613
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,161
thanks and anyone can raise their hand.

614
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,930
Just want on
that is action requires time.

615
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,100
Action is almost defined as a sequence.

616
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:01,472
And then we have the policy variables,
the PI, that's our kind of active fly pie

617
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:05,543
because policy is at the level
above a certain action of state.

618
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:08,913
But action and policies
they do take time.

619
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:09,781
So there's something

620
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:13,184
a time like built into our models
because what we're talking about

621
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,586
and the inferring the state transitions,
just like you described,

622
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,990
all those are temporal
and then the non locality,

623
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:24,829
it's kind of like when and drawing
on first and older work

624
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:28,433
with dynamic causal modeling
and statistical parametric mapping,

625
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,769
you have an image of the brain
that's changing through time

626
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,640
and then you can make one type
of connected graph

627
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,376
with pieces of the brain
that are anatomically connected.

628
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,679
And so when people think about space,
usually that's what they're thinking

629
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,748
about things that are touching.

630
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:47,351
But then also you could have effective
or functional connectivity

631
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:51,522
so you can have regions
that are local in cores,

632
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:56,260
but that local link in
the causal network could be

633
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:57,995
due to some

634
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:00,598
upstream factor that's influencing them
both.

635
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:04,368
So causal proximity
or functional proximity

636
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:09,140
may or may not be the same as something's
that's touching.

637
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,409
So you're.

638
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:15,079
Not sure where there where that puts us,
but cool stuff.

639
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,448
Is it.

640
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,650
Daniel,
can you say a little bit more about like

641
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,653
with regards
to what you just laid out with

642
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:28,392
action requires requiring time
and the minimization of surprise.

643
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:33,131
So is there something
and you're an active inference formalism.

644
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,567
When we say minimization of surprise,
is there an agent

645
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:40,338
that is creating scenarios like dinosaur,

646
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,740
there's no dinosaur
and somebody that can be a dinosaur?

647
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,576
I don't not want dinosaurs,
so I'm going to act in such a way

648
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,045
as to preclude
the very possibility of dinosaur.

649
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:51,182
Right? So we say minimization.

650
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,919
Where where is that coming from?

651
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:59,157
So is that again, or is that
is there a profound creativity

652
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:03,094
that is the basis of the system
that is launching these probabilities?

653
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:03,261
Right.

654
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:07,832
Because Bayesian probabilities doesn't
it seems kind of dull, right?

655
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,434
It never says that there's
this highly creative being

656
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:13,704
that is imagining these scenarios
that he wants to preclude.

657
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,807
So can you all tell me, like,
where's that coming form or has the agent

658
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:20,378
seen a dinosaur in in L.A.

659
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:23,714
Walking down the street and they go,
I don't want to see that again, therefore

660
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:26,717
preclude therefore action like the action

661
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,421
of minimizing surprise requires time.

662
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,223
But it's a it's an imaginary time.

663
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,859
It's sort of like
I don't want that to happen again.

664
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,193
Therefore, I'm

665
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,529
going to act in such a way as to preclude
the very existence of dinosaur.

666
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,665
Does any of that makes sense?

667
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:43,568
Well, as for dinosaurs, we know that
they're in the land before time.

668
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,604
So that is, you know,
it's been a while now.

669
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,941
It's something scary minimizing surprise,
you know. Yes.

670
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:55,680
As for the minimizing the expected
free energy or minimizing the surprises,

671
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,817
one of the sort of tricks of active
inference is to condition

672
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:03,120
that upon a policy,
if you look at the topology

673
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,525
of the graphical model,
policies are getting

674
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,462
plugged into the state, transitions
between here in the states.

675
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,565
And then what's being minimized
is the surprise

676
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,802
of the sensory outcomes
that are emitted by the hidden states.

677
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:20,972
So at the first pass,
without getting into this like

678
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:27,211
meta Bayesian creative energy
the agent has a set of policies

679
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,579
that it can carry out.

680
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,481
Those are the affordances

681
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,918
and then conditioning
on each of these policy options.

682
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,954
If they're discrete, like I could turn
left or turn right and then I'm going

683
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:39,991
to do a conditional expectation
on turning left.

684
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:43,027
That's my policy
or conditional expectation on turning

685
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,762
right on my policy.

686
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,798
Which one of those is going to be

687
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:51,369
my prediction of how that policy changes
the state transition matrix?

688
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,838
What is going to result

689
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,074
in less surprising sensory outcomes?

690
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,311
That is for a sort of fixed

691
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:03,080
set of policy options
that can be conditioned on

692
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:07,551
but it's a great question about
how do we go

693
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,520
from the known into the unknown?

694
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,822
How does the agent learn a new affordance

695
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:14,992
or maybe even generate
a new affordance internally?

696
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,029
So there's probably
a lot to be said on that.

697
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,298
But one way that active inference

698
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:25,603
speaks to it
is that when we focus on action

699
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,440
hand-in-hand with inference,
we can think like,

700
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,210
how could the agent ever navigate
a new kind of physical obstacle

701
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,781
like there's some kind of a wall
that you've never climbed before,

702
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,551
but what has to be inferred
isn't like what's on the other

703
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,988
side of the wall or to the nth degree,
the details of the wall.

704
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:47,291
It's enough
to have a model of bodily action

705
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,227
and a preference for being higher up

706
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:54,665
and potentially the affordances
that the agent does control.

707
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:58,202
It does know about those things,
like the movement of the joints

708
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:02,406
that will help it deal with the unknown,
because it's not just approaching

709
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:05,843
uncertainty
as something that has to be eradicated

710
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,813
by determining exactly
what's out there in the world.

711
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,416
Uncertainty
is something that's actively negotiated

712
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:17,488
with through usage of the affordances
that the agent already has

713
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:19,657
right.

714
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,159
And when you
say that or the affordances constructed

715
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,796
or the conditions of the system,
are they properties of the system?

716
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,533
Like what is the space of affordances
and is there

717
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,303
like a topology
on the on the affordances?

718
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,574
Because I'm still like if we categories
like any of this, there's a,

719
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,076
you know, if you work in space,
is there anything like this like,

720
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,246
you know,
or in that in the reflective subcategory,

721
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,582
which I was talking about,
these objects have reflections.

722
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,684
And I'm still not thoroughly convinced

723
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:50,054
that there is no duality
between a system and its environment.

724
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:51,288
Right.

725
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,791
So if they're working together,
perhaps these are like, you know,

726
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,293
duly in a sort of mathematical sense.

727
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:01,499
So if if that's the case,
then I just want to know, or affordances

728
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:05,102
like a property of the system
constructed or conditions

729
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:10,141
how like do they change radically?

730
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,342
Is it dynamic?

731
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,779
All nice questions.

732
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:19,316
The instrumentalist take so active
inference is a statistical model

733
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,418
that we made

734
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:24,054
and it doesn't make metaphysical claims
about what systems really can do.

735
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,856
It's a modeling approach.

736
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:29,727
In that case, affordances or whatever
the investigator puts into the model

737
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:32,062
as affordances. Right.

738
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:35,933
Then the question about what
the system's affordances truly are

739
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,502
that's a great question.

740
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,605
It comes back to how do systems

741
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,675
apparently negotiate
completely new affordances

742
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,778
where was flying a plane?

743
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,281
Where does that come into play?

744
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:54,318
Well, is that part of our extended niche,
part of our constructed nation?

745
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:58,222
So we can think about that in terms of
just the same eyesight that we had before

746
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:01,325
and the same finger movements
that we had access to before.

747
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,495
But now it's being deployed
in a different niche.

748
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:08,132
So the extended cognitive outcome
is just radically different.

749
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,402
So in the case of tooling and language

750
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:14,171
as a tool and and usage of instruments

751
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,775
potentially one could argue
that it's still the bodily affordances

752
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:21,812
that are being used, but higher
order contingencies are being learned

753
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,883
by the system
to be able to play piano or fly a plane.

754
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:30,788
So the affordance of turning the plane
left can be still seen as moving

755
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,823
your hand to the left on a joystick

756
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,727
conditioned on an agent who understands
that their preference is to move that way

757
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,531
and now has this sort of mapping
between what they do with their hand

758
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,766
on the joystick and where the plane goes

759
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:48,339
but what kinds of new bodily affordances
can we have?

760
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,040
That's right.

761
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,709
And they think they're making different
forms.

762
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,077
That's what's cool.

763
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:53,911
Blue.

764
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:57,414
Then anyone else with a raised head.

765
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:02,353
So I was thinking about this affordances
in relation to time

766
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,589
and also like in relation
to the last mass stream.

767
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:10,294
When you guys were talking about how like
when does memory start to form?

768
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:10,594
Right.

769
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:14,632
And so as you're looking
at your reflections in the diamond,

770
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,767
like there's
you're looking at your reflections

771
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,537
and then there comes a space
maybe where you can reach your reflection

772
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,338
and remember
if that was exactly how it was worded,

773
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:24,742
but that's like when maybe memory serves
to crystallize something like that.

774
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:29,113
Maybe, maybe I want to step in
and correct me now, OK?

775
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:30,347
That's right.

776
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:33,784
So then you know a thing about like

777
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:37,121
when you have young kids
and they perceive time, right?

778
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:40,090
I talked about expansion and compression
about time a little bit earlier.

779
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,993
So when a kid perceives time,
a small child,

780
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:46,997
everything is like yesterday or tomorrow
right?

781
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,400
Like there's
no like concept of next week,

782
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:51,101
but then we know what a week is.

783
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:55,472
So like you have these new affordances
that come with learning, right?

784
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:58,042
Otherwise, it's just before or next,
right?

785
00:42:58,442 --> 00:42:59,777
It's interesting.

786
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:03,881
And so when do these affordances like
does that correspond to maybe the ability

787
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:07,084
to, to reach your own reflection
in the diamond's wheel?

788
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:09,954
And I flipped it
here to what our thoughts.

789
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:16,460
So maybe if anyone has a thought on that,
what our thoughts are. Yep.

790
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,695
Adam and then anyone else.

791
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,999
But actually before I go on, if Shannon

792
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:25,703
wants to speak to a glue just so that
actually I would like to hear that yeah.

793
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:26,670
Go for it.

794
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,771
But then I have thoughts.

795
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,407
Yep, yep. Yeah, yeah.

796
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:31,308
OK, feel free.

797
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:34,044
Well, I think it's sort of integrated
yet, you know, the diamonds are

798
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,547
very difficult objects, right?

799
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:40,618
That I was thinking
that could be the perfect model

800
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:44,555
and could perfect a more perfect model
of what's going on.

801
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:46,824
With memory, right?

802
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:51,428
So you have these cases that I always
talk about, you know, beautiful people,

803
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:55,199
like wearing a three second memory
from a retrograde amnesia.

804
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,470
So you have to ask
some of my client, like,

805
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,740
is he experiencing a complete

806
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:06,744
temporal, non-local allergy
every 2 seconds?

807
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,511
The child.

808
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:10,547
Right, child mine,
which I have a lot of, right?

809
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:15,386
Like for a child, what are the conditions
for object persistence right.

810
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:19,556
In their own very state, you know, like
with the diamond or things like that.

811
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:20,190
I think you can

812
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,594
model what it means to have

813
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:28,532
Shannon when I'm six and Shannon
when I'm 85 or something.

814
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:29,767
Why is it the same?

815
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,302
Shannon
and I don't think it is like at all.

816
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:36,340
So when you say something like,
like memory

817
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,709
and what are you actually looking at? So

818
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,179
I again, if I think there is this

819
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,248
duality between like this system
and its environment,

820
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:49,019
how can you actually visualize that in
this in this sort of diamond mentality?

821
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:52,690
And so the thing about the diamond,
right, is that if perhaps memory

822
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,693
is some kind of impurity
and you'll never actually get to it.

823
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:59,129
So if it if memory is like
a mineralogical impurity,

824
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,665
then you never actually get the impurity.

825
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:03,600
You just get the reflections
of the whole thing.

826
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,004
And so to sort of take what Blue said
and just tighten it just a little bit,

827
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:10,140
that might be more of
what's actually going on.

828
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:14,845
But perhaps the mineralogical impurity
is that if maybe if you only have it now

829
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:19,083
and then, if you're not able to access
all the other reflections

830
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:19,983
that are on the diamond,

831
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:23,420
you may not have a future
and you may not have an extended time

832
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:26,690
but there's also something to say
that has that diminished,

833
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:29,893
like your vibrant experience?

834
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,596
Somebody like me who's like,
you can really drop in,

835
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:36,400
can drop in very dilution,
like I am a degree of heat,

836
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,570
I am a degree of white,
I am a unit of sand.

837
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:43,841
His formalism is super powerful
because it's giving

838
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:48,612
becoming an action to these
individualities, these societies, right,

839
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:50,414
that somebody else would say
have that kind

840
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,549
of unit of consciousness or something.

841
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:56,854
So I think what I'm trying to do, combine
this notion of becoming that

842
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,790
individual, super individualistic, like,
you know,

843
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:03,560
I am a spoon of coconut,
like a spoonful of coconut.

844
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:04,094
That's it

845
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:07,998
with this notion of this diamond being.

846
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,200
And they're not just reflections, right?

847
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,935
They're like pro finite reflections.

848
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:15,105
So they are totally disconnected.

849
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:18,475
So that's sort of a mess that I'm sort of
I think

850
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:21,512
is like underlying
the beginnings of memory.

851
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:24,081
Maybe it's just this kind of pure mess.

852
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:29,052
And as you age or whatever age is sort of
involved in these proton coverings.

853
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,555
And so in the covering space,

854
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:33,390
you know, if you're working

855
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,226
through proprioception and things
like that, there's a lot of work

856
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:40,531
in neurology saying that your brain
probably processes more technologically.

857
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:44,368
If you're a child and you only have like
a now and a bunch of points,

858
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,603
you don't really have a lot of cover
in spaces, right?

859
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:47,805
Yeah.

860
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,374
So I think working with diamonds,
which we'll get to in a little bit.

861
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,876
So I think there's something
definitely at play with.

862
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,212
You're staring at your memories, right?

863
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,281
You're walking around in your past
like all the time.

864
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:00,784
So I don't ever think
you can actually get to the true memory.

865
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:03,086
And if unless you reach
like the infant state again.

866
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:05,789
Thanks, Adam.

867
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,391
Then Robert.

868
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:10,294
How so?

869
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:14,198
That to revisit the Affordance issue.

870
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,934
So if I'm

871
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,803
understanding things,

872
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:23,540
there could be in a way
you could say, like in any given moment,

873
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:28,245
there's like a view from the outside,
like what were the

874
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:32,716
what was the scope, the possibility
of the actual interactions for the system

875
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:36,153
given its configuration.

876
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,989
But because of much construction,
that's also a moving target.

877
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:43,360
So then there could be another set
of like perception of these affordances

878
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:47,898
by the system where that perception
itself changes the affordances structure.

879
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:51,668
And this can be of different varieties
so like the system in a kind of

880
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:56,773
dynamically self configuration
and the like

881
00:47:58,141 --> 00:47:58,742
jostling around

882
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:02,112
and it was doing like implicit inference,
just figuring out, sussing out

883
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:05,282
what the important structure is
and then this kind of implicit perception

884
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:09,753
that there could be another level
of like explicit affordance

885
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,090
the perception
and each of these influencing

886
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:16,426
the other and maybe operating differently
and at cross-purposes.

887
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:20,330
With respect to

888
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:22,332
that.

889
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:25,435
I mean that paraphrasing what
try and paraphrase that

890
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:28,672
and I able to assign

891
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,975
this seems like a connected

892
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:35,712
this a lot of things will connect to this

893
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,047
from memory

894
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:42,386
and I've been thinking of

895
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,790
getting back to consciousness

896
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,825
and different forms of it.

897
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,696
Like what do we mean

898
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:55,432
when we're accessing something like

899
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,701
and what does it take
to remember things in different ways

900
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:01,204
and how does our different kinds
of awareness of what happened

901
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,975
relate to our ability
to remember these things?

902
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:08,312
And so you can have a kind of memory

903
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,381
it's just a sort of like baked in.

904
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,184
What would they
this a hysteresis, a kind of like, yeah,

905
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:15,285
you're pushing the thing.

906
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,955
And then through its
dynamics or through its it's

907
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:21,858
its material
properties, it's kind of holds the shape

908
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:24,161
and you got a memory
there of the indentation like a desire.

909
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:27,597
But in terms of this,
like holding on to memory like a,

910
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,967
like a Clive Waring type memory and

911
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:35,739
time does seem key for contextualization

912
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:39,209
now like Blue is saying
about the way time changes with age,

913
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:42,813
it seems like that kind of time
and the way we construct it,

914
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,383
one of the things he would say
like we specialize it

915
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:50,454
and we specialize it relative
to like probably relative to,

916
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:54,825
you know, us as an agents
pursuing goals in the world with this,

917
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:57,661
the inference
of different important structures

918
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,164
but OK well what are the different ways
though that you can relate

919
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:05,335
to this spatial assignment,
to this maybe objectified you

920
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:07,637
and then different ways of doing this?

921
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:09,639
What are the different kinds
of self-reference involved

922
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:13,043
that's an issue maybe into to later.

923
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:15,912
But one of the things
I'm wondering in terms of memory

924
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:20,450
and this might relate to like

925
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,253
impurities in the crystals
is that the ability

926
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:26,423
of things to get entangled
to point to themselves in different ways.

927
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:28,458
So like within this like three second
window,

928
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:32,062
there's maybe a sequence
of frames of sense making,

929
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,232
but there's a broader frame of sense
making of a causal unfolding.

930
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:39,002
There has a certain stability over
which it can hold itself together.

931
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:42,572
But part of what would let this

932
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:45,609
specious present this inherent

933
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:48,111
depth to to the now

934
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:51,348
might be this kind of self-reference
this where,

935
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:55,218
you know, earlier frames of experience
have predictive information

936
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:55,952
about what follows,

937
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:59,689
but then what follows as information
and points to what was in the past

938
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:02,726
the kind of you know, perspective
in predicting the future

939
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,862
and posting the fast pass
as part of this process

940
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,066
of unfolding sense making.

941
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,700
And it seems like

942
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:13,537
the degree to which you could do this
and the ways in which you do this,

943
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:18,742
that would be the degree to which things
might likely be likely to stick around.

944
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:23,447
I thing would be might likely
to be made salient to the fine hooks

945
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,584
in this process where everything's
competing with everything to keep going.

946
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,620
That's the ability of something
to get entangled with itself in different

947
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,291
ways, would provide different degrees
of sticking power

948
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:39,029
and that this would involve

949
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:41,064
things like just, you know,

950
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:45,735
multi modality like, like,
like a heterogeneous code, like maybe my,

951
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:49,840
my direct, you know, first person shooter
or point of view

952
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:54,544
is pointing to like linguistic
or linguistic code or some sort of iconic

953
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:58,982
symbolization or some sort of other
like intercept of intuitive code.

954
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:01,251
But like these
all cross cross-referencing each other

955
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:03,720
like one way
of like hooking things together.

956
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:07,657
But you can also hook things together
in terms of like an explicit

957
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:08,992
causal sequence

958
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:12,662
where it's just this to this to this
that the ball check, the shoe, the boot,

959
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:14,865
kick the ball, the ball and down the ramp

960
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:16,032
the mouse got the cheese

961
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:19,336
like the whole Rube Goldberg thing
that that could be part of a two button,

962
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:22,405
but actually more
so if it's coherence and maybe a gigantic

963
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:26,042
if it's related to basically,

964
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:28,778
then we're going to have to get
personhood into this in the nature of it

965
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:31,515
relative to

966
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:34,017
the causal streams that you have
the most familiarity with and that

967
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,754
fit into most of this, meaning

968
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:40,090
making hierarchy that has a visceral,

969
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:44,561
visceral grounding, a symbolic grounding.

970
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:49,366
The more of these you can come together
probably the better it'll it'll persist

971
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:53,270
and the more that impurity will

972
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,806
give the sparkle.

973
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,143
So thanks, Adam.

974
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:03,680
Robert, then we'll probably move
to the next slide.

975
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,784
Yeah,
this slide was the thought that was.

976
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:10,120
I wanted to say something
about the parts. Yeah.

977
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,823
If you still have something else,
then you don't. OK,

978
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:19,763
so first, of course, I would be curious
how active in sense people would come to

979
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:23,099
you and what they would say,
what the thought is or what it means

980
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:27,470
and just philosophically, I think that's
a very interesting question.

981
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:29,873
And there are certain kind of

982
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,142
traditional ways
how we think about thinking

983
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:37,681
and it seems to me that active inference
is challenging some of those

984
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:40,951
very traditional assumptions,
but I'm not quite sure how exactly.

985
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:44,120
So the first assumption

986
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:46,189
that's the obvious way

987
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,692
that it's kind of obvious
how active inference challenges that.

988
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:52,162
But the first assumption is
and the thinking is something which

989
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,066
is like a counterpart

990
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,668
to what's happening
physically in the physical world.

991
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:01,304
And there's thinking
which is I'm kind of opposed to it

992
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:04,374
and I think an active inference

993
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:08,111
that's that day to day
shock to me is kind of erased.

994
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:11,414
That's kind of obvious on this

995
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,950
second question, is

996
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:16,319
there was a long

997
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,956
and there's a long tradition
in thinking about thinking

998
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:23,326
which has to do or which
which says that thinking is something

999
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:29,332
which is rule based or law
like loss of thought or in a more modern

1000
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:32,102
in the more modern thing, one would say,

1001
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:36,273
oh, it's about information processing
or probabilistic reasoning or whatever.

1002
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:42,212
And but that seems to me to kind of clash
or at least would defend them

1003
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:46,783
in a logical way, always this
phenomenology of thinking in some sense.

1004
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:51,254
So thinking seems to be something
direct and mediated.

1005
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:56,226
And you talked about it now,
which is this particular example of that.

1006
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:59,229
And I wasn't quite sure
how that hangs together

1007
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:02,899
with the whole active inference

1008
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:05,368
theory,
basically with the mathematics of it.

1009
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:06,269
I mean,

1010
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:11,141
I would naively assume
you talk about inferences processes,

1011
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:15,278
which are happening
defined over some bounded system.

1012
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,315
And so that seems to lend itself
more to this

1013
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:21,017
information processing view of thinking

1014
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:25,021
but that seems to be somehow
opposed to the phenomenology of thinking.

1015
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:28,458
And I was wondering how you kind of
bring these things together

1016
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,962
great questions.

1017
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:35,765
One thought might be that the way
that we've seen

1018
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:39,669
things like anxiety
or affective states be addressed in

1019
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,572
inference is with a parameter
reflecting that.

1020
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:46,910
And so it's almost like there's
the core active inference model,

1021
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:51,481
the one that, you know, data comes into
and then there's this interpretive layer.

1022
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:56,519
And so I might say at this point
that the active inference

1023
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:00,390
framework doesn't make strong claims
as to the, you know,

1024
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,660
what is a packet called thought
or what is the nature of thoughts?

1025
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,630
Because as a skill free framework,
first off, there's the whole instrumental

1026
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,431
ism realism.

1027
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,000
So it could be a totally defensible
stance.

1028
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:13,403
Active
inference says nothing about thought,

1029
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:18,475
or maybe somebody wants to unpack it
in a way where they think it does

1030
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:22,412
but at the first pass,
the things that we've seen models

1031
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:26,282
of active inference
about that people experience as thought,

1032
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,952
like anxiety or excitement
or something like that.

1033
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:33,123
Those are parameters
that are named in a mathematical model,

1034
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:36,659
and they don't seem to make strong claims
on the nature of thought.

1035
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,561
Adam, what do you think about that?

1036
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,867
And so in terms of like I guess

1037
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:48,605
the good folk
and how they relate to thought and

1038
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:54,177
this notion of it being in a way
separable from action and distinguished

1039
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:59,349
from this in the world are just doing
and just acting up

1040
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:04,387
that seems like like a good place
to to work with.

1041
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:08,291
And so if we're talking about that,
it seems like it would relate

1042
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:11,828
to different species
of sophisticated inference

1043
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:16,833
where you would be doing these kinds
of counterfactual rollouts of what

1044
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:20,703
it would be to pursue different policies
or patterns of action selection.

1045
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:23,840
And for me, it would be

1046
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:26,976
to the extent that it's conscious,
it would have to be

1047
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:31,548
grounded out
as some sort of embodied simulation.

1048
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:35,585
I want to build everything out of action
perception cycles and everything

1049
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:37,854
out of sensory
motor things that I can. Ultimately,

1050
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:40,023
that's going to be the grounding,
that will be the experience

1051
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:41,658
that suffers.

1052
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:45,628
Say the thought would only be determined
by what you simulated in your rollout,

1053
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:46,029
for instance.

1054
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:49,732
Like you could have a lot of I'm
just the spreading

1055
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:53,870
semantic association
of just like a kind of priming effect.

1056
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:56,039
And then words come to mind that
that's part of it.

1057
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:59,476
And that's not necessarily like something
you're controlling in terms of pursuing

1058
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:03,546
a policy that's just happening
or some sort of association

1059
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,549
with interception
with just like a kind of resonance

1060
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:09,953
your body that might play into it
parameterize this process.

1061
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:12,288
But the thinking, it seems like
it would be

1062
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:16,025
a mode of sophisticated inference
of generating this

1063
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:19,162
counterfactual possibilities
and using them for things like

1064
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:22,799
different kinds of causal reasoning,

1065
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,068
different ways of

1066
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:27,403
situating what you think

1067
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:31,341
is happening or could happen sometimes.

1068
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:34,577
And that's
how I would relate to thought to think.

1069
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:38,481
And I don't know if the like, what
do we want from thought, we want more.

1070
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:42,118
And so that might help. A great question.

1071
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:43,820
And do we want to experience

1072
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,190
the phenomenology of human thought,
which is an uncultured phenomena,

1073
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:51,861
or are we trying to talk about trees
and all kinds of other things?

1074
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,229
So everyone awesome.

1075
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:55,632
Thanks for the raised hand
flu shot to Robert.

1076
00:58:58,735 --> 00:58:59,769
I think Shannon was first.

1077
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,337
So the factory. Yep.

1078
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:01,971
Go for it.

1079
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:02,739
Oh, okay. Awesome.

1080
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,974
Yeah, just a couple of things.

1081
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:08,311
You know, just Daniel was saying
when we say thought, right?

1082
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:13,283
So I'm, I'm, you know, you know,
so I don't think Spot

1083
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:17,554
is like recognition of a truth
and a proposition I'm of the mindset that

1084
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:20,223
I think Kierkegaard said like

1085
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:23,526
all thought as a self repeating
false Socrates which yeah.

1086
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:26,896
It's like, so I'm not of the sense
that thought as logic

1087
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,531
or anything like that
because there's first

1088
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:30,867
orderlogic second order logic
and it's just, you know, you think.

1089
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:33,736
Like. What is pro finite thought?

1090
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,538
So I really think we need to actually
when we say

1091
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:38,041
what our thoughts we need to say, like,
what do we mean by thought?

1092
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:38,541
Right.

1093
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,911
So Robert and I have this model
of like in awareness.

1094
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:44,414
So it could be that
the level of your awareness

1095
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,284
you know, dictates
the levels of time you have

1096
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:50,987
and then also what these thoughts are.

1097
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:54,157
So, you know, some things like,
Oh, Rock has not thought that perhaps

1098
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:57,093
the units of thought of the Rock
are just lower

1099
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,429
than our units of perception,
something like that.

1100
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:04,267
So I think it's very strong to say
that things do not have thought right

1101
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,635
so to aspect what I thought

1102
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:08,871
is it's interesting also to say
what is not a thought, you know,

1103
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:12,241
so, you know,
I have these kind of interesting ideas,

1104
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:15,878
like if you can model the brain as this
I would tell she's an imperfect

1105
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:17,914
I would say,
is that just what this diamond does?

1106
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:21,784
Then if you can actually model neurons,
as you know, these points in the

1107
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:26,055
diamonds, these mathematical impurities
that are actually more prisms of schemes.

1108
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:28,558
And you would say that, OK,
sort of it's more chasms,

1109
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:31,294
but we know
thoughts are a little more messy

1110
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:35,098
than just satisfying strict associativity
and up to conditions.

1111
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:36,232
So the math can only give you

1112
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:39,802
a model of the thing because perhaps
it's not strictly associative.

1113
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:43,673
So I mean, we all know that you do have
a sodium potassium channel

1114
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:46,509
kind of neurotransmitter
cluster network happening.

1115
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,711
You always want it to be springtime
in your head.

1116
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:50,813
You would not want like a winter

1117
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,583
in your head where all the synapses
and the trees die and things

1118
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:56,185
but nobody can tell you how the trees
in your head sort of photosynthesize.

1119
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:57,320
So I know I try.

1120
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,087
I gave that first thought.

1121
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:00,189
Someone asked, well,
what are actually thoughts?

1122
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:03,393
So again, if these neurons are these
geometric points and I still think

1123
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:06,729
the brain is some sort
of non-local hologram sort of thing,

1124
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:10,600
that its ability to rewire is profound
and also don't want to get injured.

1125
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,535
Right.
Because there is a detrimental effect

1126
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:14,404
but so

1127
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:17,707
like how do you sustain this sort of,
you know,

1128
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:21,077
temporal non locality
inside this for a finite condition?

1129
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,747
Maybe Robert and I are under this
with this sort of in levels of awareness.

1130
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:25,982
If you're able to achieve

1131
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:28,985
sort of simultaneous,
simultaneous states of awareness,

1132
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:30,353
then perhaps you could

1133
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:34,157
probably get out of the idea of thought
as the truth of the proposition.

1134
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:37,326
And then maybe you can
probably figure out what that is.

1135
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:39,962
Again, I'm not convinced
that we're doing anything new

1136
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:42,699
like what a new thought is.

1137
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,001
I'm not really sure what that is

1138
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:47,804
or if you can actually, like you
say, scale free, right?

1139
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:48,304
So scale

1140
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:52,075
free would be able to for us to make this
an awareness sort of phenomenon.

1141
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:53,943
And so I agree with Robert.

1142
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:56,446
I'm not sure if there is a contention
there between the phenomenology

1143
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:59,882
of what is thought
and then the sort of perception of what

1144
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:02,251
thought is again, really tricky to say.

1145
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:05,922
Well, but real problems
getting new connections,

1146
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,124
you know, and then it's like, OK,
what new connections?

1147
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:10,326
And my same interface,
like not really sure how that is

1148
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:13,296
so I'm glad active inference
allows for like new,

1149
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,531
but I'm not sure
if it's like radically new.

1150
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:18,434
I'm not sure if any of us would be able
to recognize something radically new,

1151
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:21,704
you know? OK, I'll stop it. Nice.

1152
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:22,939
Thank you.

1153
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:25,908
More different blue
and then Robert for that matter.

1154
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:30,780
So just so I was going to piggyback
off of your point and get into that.

1155
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,682
So and then I have a question.

1156
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:34,851
So really my background is neuroscience.

1157
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:38,354
And so when you look at like the brain,
the fundamental unit of a thought

1158
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:40,456
like has to come from the action
potential.

1159
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:43,593
Right, Nassim
and whatever that it's happening.

1160
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,828
But like not one action
potential makes a thought.

1161
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:50,900
So so like you were talking about
how do you measure emergence?

1162
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:54,737
And, you know,
there's like the criticality criticality

1163
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:57,206
hypothesis, right?
So like a certain number

1164
01:02:57,206 --> 01:03:00,643
of of action potentials
could lead to a thought perhaps.

1165
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:04,747
But but how do you quantify emergence
without a counter objects?

1166
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:06,249
Right.
And so you said you kept saying this.

1167
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:08,084
And so I'm going to maybe
ask you to clarify

1168
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:10,753
or push on this a little bit
because a counter object,

1169
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:12,688
like when I think of a counter,
I think about a counter

1170
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:16,859
in terms of computer programing for
AI from zero to 50.

1171
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:19,629
Count, count, count, count,
so is it like counting

1172
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:21,097
the number of action potentials

1173
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:25,067
or the number of ants leaving pheromones
traces or the number of pheromones drop?

1174
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:25,234
Right.

1175
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:28,171
So so when you think about a counter
object, is that what you mean?

1176
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:31,874
By a counter object, or is there
some fundamental thing that I'm missing?

1177
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:34,410
I don't think I ever said
the word counter object.

1178
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,612
So can you tell me where I said
that? Yeah.

1179
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:41,384
So it was when you were quantifying
emergence and I took some notes.

1180
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:45,655
So you have built in
emergence is built into the system

1181
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:49,992
versus having a counter so maybe not
counter objects that you said.

1182
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:51,127
Oh yeah. It wasn't.

1183
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:54,330
Yeah, it wasn't not an index. Right.

1184
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:58,234
So I'm not, I'm not of the
why does I have to start at one you know,

1185
01:03:58,301 --> 01:04:01,571
so I don't think real numbers exist
so that that's it's

1186
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:03,406
a bunch of equivalence classes.

1187
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:04,774
So just putting like

1188
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:08,077
50 of these things happened, I don't
really know what that means right.

1189
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:11,848
But I agree with you that how do you
actually quantify emergence because.

1190
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:15,484
Right, if you have too much hyper
synchronous activity, you have a seizure

1191
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:17,053
and a seizure is not a thought.

1192
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:17,286
Right.

1193
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:20,790
Everyone so it seems to me that there is
and that's what Chris Fields

1194
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:23,593
and I and everyone are after is like,
what is the stop mechanism?

1195
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,062
The stop mechanism that you can have?

1196
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:28,898
You need a clustering happening
in the neurons, right?

1197
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:32,735
To actually have that thought
doesn't seem to come out of your elbow.

1198
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:33,769
But if the

1199
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:37,773
if the nervous system is non-local,
like I believe it is which is why

1200
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:41,110
I'm an advocate for the active inference
of the embodied cognition.

1201
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:45,047
If the neural system is non-local
and nobody's proved that it's not,

1202
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:48,751
and then how do you actually say

1203
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:51,854
when the amount of clustering gives you
something like,

1204
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:53,623
look at all of us,
our synopses are bright

1205
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:57,193
and perfect leaves and everything
is like beautiful in here, right?

1206
01:04:57,693 --> 01:04:59,328
And effortlessly.

1207
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:00,129
How does it come?

1208
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:00,863
How does that come?

1209
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:03,499
So effortless, right? Sometimes.

1210
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:07,904
And then but if you have too much firing
then you don't get it.

1211
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:08,804
And it's not like the

1212
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:12,241
you know, there's an actual rest
in the action potential like blue.

1213
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:14,577
What's the order of neuron firing?

1214
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:15,444
What are you

1215
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:19,148
smaller than nanometers at that point
between firing has to be right.

1216
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:20,850
It's not Planck scale.

1217
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:23,452
It's not like ten to the -42,
but it's small, right?

1218
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:27,823
And so with that kind of time, happening,
I'm just I'm perplexed.

1219
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:29,191
You have so many layers of time

1220
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:32,862
happening, neuronal firing time
like the stem cell firing time, you know.

1221
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:36,699
So when I said counter,
I don't think I wasn't referring to

1222
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,902
an actual.

1223
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:40,169
Yeah.

1224
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:44,340
When I yeah, I think I was saying counter
is when most people just take time

1225
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:49,045
to do some kind of Geiger counter
and there's no emergence like at all.

1226
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:51,180
You know, I hope I answer that
didn't make it worse.

1227
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:52,214
Yeah.

1228
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:53,182
So I couldn't

1229
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:57,119
I couldn't figure out if you'd like
to talk about like a counterfactual,

1230
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:00,423
like the opposite of emergence,
like what's the opposite of emergent.

1231
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:03,759
So if you're talking about a counter,
like, you know, when you something's up.

1232
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,528
So that's it would be a assumption.

1233
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:06,028
Yeah.

1234
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:08,731
Great.

1235
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:12,568
Robert and Adam,
you want to go to the next one

1236
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:15,104
or do you want to continue on
the thought up to you?

1237
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:18,808
Well, I just had a very quick
clarification of my question.

1238
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,743
Actually,
Adam can reply immediately after.

1239
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:22,578
That's good
because Adam said something like,

1240
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:25,781
What do we want
the theory of thought to be?

1241
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:28,484
Or What do you want it for?
Which kind of thought are we?

1242
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:29,452
Are we talking?

1243
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:32,989
Or When I was asking my question
about the nature of thought, I was

1244
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:35,224
mainly thinking

1245
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:39,362
about conscious thoughts
I mean, there's this tradition that is

1246
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:42,631
which says something like
All the mind is whatever the brain does.

1247
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:46,702
And then you talk about,
I don't know, potential clues

1248
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:49,772
about firing, about calcium
and I don't know what.

1249
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:53,242
And if you then say, OK, well,
that's a very abstract thing

1250
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:55,711
and you called it fault,
I think that's fine.

1251
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:56,712
That's fine.

1252
01:06:56,712 --> 01:06:59,849
And one is that it doesn't really

1253
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,485
give you a good answer
to what you mean with conscious thought

1254
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:05,621
and the standard way,
how psychologists normally answer

1255
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:08,958
that question is to say, OK, well, there
is this unconscious processing happening

1256
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:12,061
and then something magically happens
and that turns into conscious thought.

1257
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:17,366
And I wasn't quite clear
whether predictive processing

1258
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:22,671
or active inference or whatever frame
you want to take really answers

1259
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:26,642
that question or whether what it says,
oh, it's actually not a good question

1260
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,779
kind of dissolves this question.

1261
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:33,282
And well, that's a bit more specific
about my question.

1262
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,788
Adam, go for it.

1263
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,392
Try to tie a few things together.

1264
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:48,030
So, yeah, so what we want from thought
and what our sensibilities might be

1265
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:52,334
that is what boundaries we established
for where we find and don't.

1266
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:54,837
It'll be relative to what,
what do we want

1267
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:58,007
but to try to build up

1268
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:00,009
so I think there is a sense

1269
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:02,711
in which you could say like,
so like a rock

1270
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:06,782
is a mind or is thought,

1271
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:10,653
even though it's an extremely dumb
variety, it's action

1272
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:14,223
because we can point to it,
it's a kind of density

1273
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:18,928
and that it's you can think of it as

1274
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:23,365
a, you know, it's just going to probably
unlike like Crystal, which can grow.

1275
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:25,468
It was just
sort of like it can do one thing

1276
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:27,336
which is steadily degrade over time.

1277
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:28,971
And some kind of an trophic gradient.

1278
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,372
But to the extent it doesn't,

1279
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:32,808
that's, that's all that's
the intelligence it's got.

1280
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:37,613
But then we get to systems that can like
actually through sophisticated dynamics,

1281
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:41,650
start to do things like

1282
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:44,019
suss out different things that can happen
and do a kind of

1283
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:49,258
more flexible policy selection
and they might be potentially in it.

1284
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:52,261
In order to do this, they might have to
be critically organized.

1285
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:55,164
And that that's the only thing
that could allow for

1286
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:58,901
generalized evolution
or generalized Bayesian model selection

1287
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:03,739
that you actually have to be points
at this like inter regime

1288
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:09,378
in order to have the right properties,
in order to have both the the variation

1289
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:13,682
where you can suss out the possibilities,
but also the the stability

1290
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,486
point over into chaos or disorder

1291
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,256
that you can actually build structure
upon structure.

1292
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:22,725
So it seems like
that's going to be critical

1293
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,594
in terms of

1294
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:28,564
like if you're talking about something
like ants,

1295
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:30,833
like we're coming out of the like,
you know, a life form,

1296
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,303
maybe that's like some people say like
that's kind of like,

1297
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:37,773
like this sort of more sophisticated

1298
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:41,343
mentality that with,

1299
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:42,711
you know,

1300
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:45,814
optionality,
maybe that's like the hallmark of life,

1301
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:48,584
maybe this sort of hierarchical
nested modeling.

1302
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:53,656
If some of these intergroup processes
are capable of bifurcating

1303
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:56,992
in different ways and giving you
a kind of like intelligent optionality,

1304
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:01,530
maybe, you know, that's a kind
of thought, but let's keep working up.

1305
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:04,934
So if we're talking about something
like the brain

1306
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:08,404
I would think of like a

1307
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:12,841
a hierarchy of

1308
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:13,943
nested

1309
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:17,479
coupling processes
evolving on different time scales.

1310
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:21,183
And in the community,
they'll tend to call these things

1311
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,252
a non equilibrium static densities.

1312
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:25,654
I call them self-organizing
harmonic modes.

1313
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:28,591
And it's a way I interpret

1314
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:29,959
neural synchrony.

1315
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:33,662
And to the degree that you get it, it's
facilitating communication

1316
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:37,466
through coherence,
making sure that within these systems,

1317
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:40,836
not just like tuning in excitation
inhibition, balance to

1318
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:44,940
then it works, but that to actually
within this maelstrom

1319
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:48,244
to get coherent dynamics,
coherent inference,

1320
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:52,281
you would
you need the neurons need to team up.

1321
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:53,582
So you need synchrony.

1322
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:58,354
You need synchrony for I guess what
they would call marginal message passing.

1323
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,723
So it'd be like marginalization,
like a joint belief.

1324
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:02,391
And then you packet your beliefs.

1325
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:05,728
And these like coalitions are doing

1326
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:08,731
like, like these units, this quantization

1327
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:11,133
of sense making of prediction
error and prediction.

1328
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:14,169
And so there would be like this
nested hierarchy.

1329
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:16,905
And so if we're talking about
something like

1330
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:20,976
let's say like gamma frequency,
that might be like a very small local

1331
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:24,446
unit of like Synchrony in a sense
making a maybe that's like a

1332
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:27,349
a quantization of like prediction error
that will be passed upwards.

1333
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,052
So that's like an observation

1334
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:33,222
within the scope of this gamma packet
though maybe that's like a prediction

1335
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:36,025
for like whatever's inside it,
but you keep going up.

1336
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:39,728
So then maybe you have
something like Beta and then Gamma like

1337
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:43,232
40 times a second and then theta would be
something like, you know,

1338
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:47,102
maybe high and low is a terms
like somewhere

1339
01:11:47,102 --> 01:11:50,372
between 13 the three times a second
and maybe you're starting to get like

1340
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:54,276
a depends

1341
01:11:54,276 --> 01:11:56,679
where you're
at, but these higher order attractors

1342
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,015
and these higher order predictions
like, like a like

1343
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:03,419
a composition, like something like a hand
reaching, something like that,

1344
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:06,955
but like where's consciousness
going to come into this and why

1345
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:10,225
it seems if you can take these

1346
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:12,361
different recognition,

1347
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:15,631
these, this,
these recognition of different patterns

1348
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,834
and you can stitch them together
such that you have

1349
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:24,106
within the organizing principle of
I would suggest an egocentric perspective

1350
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:28,344
of a particular point of view and you can
arrange them in some kind of space.

1351
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,346
What kind of coherence, how much?

1352
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,347
That's a good question.

1353
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,916
Some kind of time,
some kind of cause of relation.

1354
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:36,785
Well, now this inference,

1355
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,956
you might sort of say, well,
now you might be inferring a world

1356
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:44,493
specifically a structured world model
with spatial temporal

1357
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:46,428
and causal properties
where things can unfold.

1358
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:48,997
You can have something
like a stream of experience.

1359
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:52,167
If this synchronization manifold

1360
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:55,504
is basically giving you a joint belief
over your consortium.

1361
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:59,675
And so it seems like alpha is a frequency
where you can get a big enough

1362
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:03,045
of an agreement,
of a negotiated agreement

1363
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:06,448
on a set up and a and a harmonic and on a

1364
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:09,651
collective sense making

1365
01:13:09,651 --> 01:13:12,955
that you could bring together
all of the different body causes

1366
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:16,625
head by egocentric preference
from terms of anatomy and like

1367
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:19,094
what would be a sculpture and something.

1368
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:21,730
So that's implicit
is there's this inverse relationship

1369
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:25,267
there seems between the frequency
at which you can get

1370
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:30,406
oscillations or harmonics and the scope
of what can be synchronized.

1371
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:33,342
So you can get like a little thing
to agree really quickly,

1372
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:36,879
but to get a big thing, it's
going to necessarily take more time.

1373
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:40,082
And so more
things can come into the mix and

1374
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:42,518
consciousness.

1375
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:45,487
I'm wondering
if that is basically at a scope.

1376
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:49,324
We're doing these joint
estimates of system world states

1377
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:52,861
that let you both inform and be informed

1378
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:55,531
by evolving action perception cycles.

1379
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:59,735
But actually the functional codes
that you achieve for this estimation

1380
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:04,239
process is out of proportion
of the events in the world

1381
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:06,241
that are relevant to your affordances.

1382
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:08,610
That actually would be part
of your policy selection,

1383
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:12,815
and that if you can get this kind
of alignment of temporal dynamics

1384
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:17,653
and if you're having these things
brought together in a way

1385
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:20,456
that gives you
a point of view of some kind,

1386
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:23,492
well, I might say OK, now it's
something like conscious thought,

1387
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:26,929
this stream of experience
doing different things

1388
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,032
where the thinking part of it

1389
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:33,669
we might want to save that
or not for something like

1390
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:38,240
imagine of planning or some sort of
like kind of like, like you're,

1391
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,142
you're thinking of something
other than what is

1392
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,578
and that's actually what's happening
at this intermediate level

1393
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:46,849
where you are conscious, but you're
sussing out different possibilities

1394
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:51,153
as you're trying to situate something
in some sort of coherent

1395
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,889
spatial temporal
unfolding that you can make sense of.

1396
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,493
And so the idea would be like everything

1397
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:00,929
that we can think of,
we're necessarily temporal

1398
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:05,234
izing and specializing
just so we can bracket like rocket.

1399
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:05,767
I mean, literally

1400
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:10,072
so we can bring it into some sort
of relation with this intermediate level

1401
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:11,073
embodied simulation.

1402
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:13,242
Otherwise we can't think of anything.

1403
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:15,878
But I'd say there could be
a kind of unconscious thought.

1404
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:19,114
Also, this actually might relate
to something like a counter

1405
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:22,951
I think you can one counter in that this
this bundling

1406
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:26,221
is that there's certain times at which
you can get a big enough of a coalition.

1407
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:29,591
Like there's a time frame
for achieving that

1408
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:31,660
in some ways
that's that's a kind of culture,

1409
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:34,830
that's a kind of like discretization
and you might think of this

1410
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:36,198
and something like that

1411
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:39,301
and then act of inference
from just kind of discrete updating of

1412
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:40,068
the generative model.

1413
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:44,439
The but
it seems like you can get something like

1414
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:48,710
unconscious thought potentially via
the hippocampal system

1415
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:51,780
to kind of loop around the cloud
wearing a gun

1416
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:55,884
in that one way, I would think of thought

1417
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:59,321
as as generalized or navigation
through generalized space

1418
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:03,091
hitting a particular
not arbitrary target,

1419
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:05,761
being able to find your way there.

1420
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:10,599
And so I've been working with
these are roboticists who are building

1421
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:14,202
these slam systems in the simultaneous
localization and mapping.

1422
01:16:14,703 --> 01:16:18,206
And so what these robots are doing,
they're trying to figure out where am I

1423
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:21,510
in this environment,
what is the sense of this environment?

1424
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:25,581
And they're doing this actively
in terms of they're moving around

1425
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,451
scouting out what's happening,
and there's this like mutually

1426
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:31,620
constraining inference
of what is this world then

1427
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:35,357
and where am I and what is this world
and where am I and figuring this out.

1428
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,926
But this core system

1429
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:42,931
that would seem to have within it

1430
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:49,738
these these place fields,
these like locations that could be in

1431
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:54,176
physical space, like the trees there
I'm here by my kitchen.

1432
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:57,512
Zeller But it could also be
within a conceptual space.

1433
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,483
And so there's sometimes model
this like bumper tractors

1434
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:02,551
where like you get these

1435
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:06,688
like local recurrences within this
like essentially located thing

1436
01:17:07,522 --> 01:17:10,926
and basically this chaining
of these bumper tractors

1437
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:15,731
would then chain together broader
dynamics for the rest of the brain.

1438
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:20,469
And so in theory, this could operate
in a way where you're not aware of it.

1439
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:24,840
It's like coordinating sense making
and a kind of I sensory propositional

1440
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,877
but in like an orderly way
there's like a topology to it.

1441
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:31,680
And you went from here to here
to here to here.

1442
01:17:31,947 --> 01:17:32,781
So in theory

1443
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:35,851
that could bypass consciousness.

1444
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:37,653
I don't know if it can or not,

1445
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:42,357
but this becomes like this
nested graphs of graphs, graphs.

1446
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:45,360
There could also be
a kind of holography there potentially

1447
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:47,763
in terms of

1448
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:53,502
well, not whole RV,

1449
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,438
not locality,
not holography, not locality there

1450
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:01,209
in terms of when you

1451
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:03,245
course screen

1452
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:03,879
at some level.

1453
01:18:03,879 --> 01:18:08,750
Of course, creating a locality falls
where I'm not sure about that.

1454
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:11,353
But yeah, so
those are some thoughts, some thought.

1455
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:13,855
But one more thing, though.

1456
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:16,658
So ultimately,
I think this is going to be

1457
01:18:16,658 --> 01:18:19,828
crucial are

1458
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:22,330
understanding the principles
underlying this system,

1459
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:27,169
not the system in a narrow sense,
but of this graphs of graphs, of graphs.

1460
01:18:27,169 --> 01:18:31,473
There's this where these interlude
processes have different capabilities.

1461
01:18:32,674 --> 01:18:36,078
It will be the secrets
to advanced intelligence.

1462
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,814
And just like what do we want
from thought and cognition?

1463
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:42,718
And I also suspect
it will be the answer to your question

1464
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:47,556
and that what would make, I think life

1465
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:52,861
clutter and more than a whirlpool
like you can so dissipate of systems,

1466
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:55,230
they can be extremely impressive,
extremely lifelike,

1467
01:18:55,964 --> 01:18:58,867
but this sort of inter loop process

1468
01:18:58,867 --> 01:19:02,037
that can give you the sort of optionality

1469
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:06,808
that this could potentially
a critically organized interview process

1470
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:10,512
that can bind together overall dynamics
and get the overall system

1471
01:19:11,012 --> 01:19:14,583
because of this bifurcating
potential, this sort of optionality

1472
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:16,952
that's going to be important.

1473
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:22,190
Now, what if then this interlude system
is also a kind of counter

1474
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:25,127
or a kind of like thing
that stitches itself together

1475
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:29,631
where basically like genetic inheritance,
like it gives you

1476
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:33,568
over it over time,
the ability to basically

1477
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:38,073
get better priors into it, better
it lets you

1478
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:39,975
as you transfer, learn and let's

1479
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:43,378
see what happens here and influence
the next thing, influence the next thing.

1480
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:46,248
And so this could be way
of what you could think of.

1481
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:49,284
I'm Chewbacca. I think I'm ruining that.

1482
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,520
I believe this unlimited associate
of learning

1483
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,489
as like a hallmark of consciousness,
this kind of like transition

1484
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:59,461
something like that, though this on
limited learning, open ended learning

1485
01:20:00,762 --> 01:20:04,466
as phylogeny,
as basically an internal process

1486
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,635
capable
of coordinating the overall system,

1487
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:10,071
which has some supply,
some sort of like pointer relation,

1488
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:14,042
some sort of semantic pointers,
semantics, which itself is

1489
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:18,780
allows for kind of heredity,

1490
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:22,083
a kind of kind of inheritance
of whatever happened.

1491
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:25,220
And so I think we bring
in those two things together and enter

1492
01:20:25,453 --> 01:20:28,890
the process
capable of some kind of counterfactual

1493
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:31,927
processing and

1494
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:34,863
link that to inheritance
now we'll have what we need

1495
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:36,364
to have

1496
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:41,970
either life or

1497
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:44,606
a potentially conscious system.

1498
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:46,741
Thank you, Adam.

1499
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:49,744
I flip to the next slide on

1500
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:53,281
diamonds and holograph.

1501
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:54,616
Where does this come into play?

1502
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:56,151
It's not something that you'd find

1503
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:58,620
in the active inference literature today,
but maybe

1504
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:00,755
it will be found there tomorrow. Why

1505
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:07,195
calling on our diamond experts

1506
01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:08,697
yeah. Yeah.

1507
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:12,167
Are we bypassing the diachronic
synchronic thing either? Yep.

1508
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,402
We're wherever you want to go on this
life.

1509
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:17,572
Yes. OK. Yeah. So

1510
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:20,141
you know, so again,
if we're if, you know,

1511
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:23,612
like Robert is saying,
ok, is the mind what the brain does?

1512
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:24,613
Like, what is this?

1513
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:28,083
What do we want from want
when you're when we're generating,

1514
01:21:28,817 --> 01:21:31,353
you know, in, like, pro
adversarial kind of,

1515
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,357
you know, generative adversarial network,
you have this generator talking to

1516
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:42,130
the like itself saying, no, no, no, no,
this is a cat.

1517
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:42,864
This is not a cat.

1518
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:45,667
And it's sort of
this is talking to itself.

1519
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:48,770
What is that in us
when we're sort of talking to ourselves?

1520
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:53,041
So again, you have someone like me
in the category theory side saying, OK,

1521
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:53,808
I do think

1522
01:21:53,808 --> 01:21:56,511
there is some kind of strong duality
between the agent and the environment.

1523
01:21:56,978 --> 01:22:03,418
So if you if if minds are modeled
in this diamond way, right.

1524
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:06,788
Then what you're actually doing
is just sort of engaging

1525
01:22:06,788 --> 01:22:08,123
with your reflections, right?

1526
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:09,858
How do you actually engage
with your reflections,

1527
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:11,293
your reflections of your reflection?

1528
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:15,063
So kind of based on what Adam was saying,
it's like, what's the role of priors

1529
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:19,634
and holograph what does it actually mean
to sort of have that?

1530
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:20,835
That was my original question.

1531
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:24,873
When an agent is figuring out how to jump
over a wall, it's never seen before

1532
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,142
how is it doing that?

1533
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:28,243
What if

1534
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:32,514
affordances or just the set of parameters
that are built into the thing, right?

1535
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:35,150
So let's try to do this then

1536
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:38,053
if you could do this parameter free now,
what would that model actually

1537
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:38,820
look like?

1538
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,823
So for someone like me,
I am fascinated how when I speak to you,

1539
01:22:41,823 --> 01:22:45,360
the speech doesn't last, doesn't
last, doesn't last, doesn't last.

1540
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:47,929
But somehow you remember what I say.

1541
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:48,830
You remember what I say.

1542
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:52,834
You must probably construct
a hologram holographic copy of of me

1543
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:54,836
and what I'm saying

1544
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:57,272
so that new store that somehow
so someone like me

1545
01:22:57,272 --> 01:23:00,075
with almost like a total
recall can remember stuff like this.

1546
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:01,476
I know I can talk to people

1547
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:04,079
and I have seven different versions
of time going on, you know,

1548
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,781
how do you allied like all of

1549
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:09,617
those seven you're just focusing on
like on what's happening now.

1550
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:14,656
So you aren't really
so you have a crazy feedback processing

1551
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:17,659
going on and none of this is happening
in real time, right?

1552
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:19,260
Because there's neural
transmitters happening.

1553
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:23,198
So this is already the past all of this,
whatever that means.

1554
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:25,266
When we say the past
and so I'm just wondering with that,

1555
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:30,271
when you have a very strict set of priors
governing how your agent behaves,

1556
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:32,941
where do those come into play
and how do those work?

1557
01:23:33,308 --> 01:23:36,644
If the very way that the agent operates
is through holographic,

1558
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,880
second holographic,
it's like you have a, you know,

1559
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,682
some kind of dimensional relation

1560
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:44,619
going on that perhaps now
we have a 2D retina for a 3D creature,

1561
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:47,822
2D retinas, taking an information
and compressing it and then

1562
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,259
reconstructing it in a higher way.

1563
01:23:51,259 --> 01:23:53,595
So that's just for that.

1564
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:55,597
I have this model of,
you know, instead of just

1565
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:58,400
having the normal holographic principle
which relates into the center

1566
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:03,972
field theory, I'm trying to get it in
sort of a diamond way where you actually

1567
01:24:03,972 --> 01:24:08,576
use the analogy of diamonds,
which do these functions or computers

1568
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:14,716
and build up a holographic
from an image Functor achieves.

1569
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:15,984
So it's purely mathematical.

1570
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:20,789
Let's just build up a holographic space
from image factors,

1571
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:23,491
which is really relevant
to an act of inference.

1572
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:26,127
You're acting,
you're acting, you're acting or acting.

1573
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:28,997
There's no other definition than
a functor then some kind of relation.

1574
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:32,400
So building up holography from relations

1575
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:36,504
and the conformal aspect,
which is the metric free

1576
01:24:36,504 --> 01:24:40,608
sort of gravity free space, would be
in the finite condition of the diamonds.

1577
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:45,613
So you have a six functor formalism
which is replacing anti the sitter space.

1578
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:49,517
You have a finite condition
which is replacing the gravity three.

1579
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:52,654
So that seems to me like a very

1580
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,256
interesting way

1581
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:59,627
to figure out how an agent is navigating
if you know there are reflections.

1582
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:05,733
So the math part aside, just
what is the active inference experts?

1583
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:07,569
Yeah. Think about

1584
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:10,772
engaging with your reflections
that it's never really anything new.

1585
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:13,608
You're just sort of walking around
in your echo space.

1586
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:19,347
Thanks for the comment there, Adam.

1587
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:22,350
And then anyone else for the recent.

1588
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:27,489
So this might not doc, let's try

1589
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,260
in terms of like the nature of like

1590
01:25:32,393 --> 01:25:35,597
how would I remember Shana or, and

1591
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:39,267
how can I know anyone or anything

1592
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:42,103
I'm wondering
if it always has to be through some kind

1593
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:46,908
of generalized mirroring
with your own embodied experience.

1594
01:25:46,908 --> 01:25:49,177
And ultimately
it's got to be cash out that way.

1595
01:25:49,177 --> 01:25:53,715
And this the,
the particular nature of like the,

1596
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:57,152
the hologram in terms of like the ability
to like reconstitute

1597
01:25:57,152 --> 01:26:00,955
and reducing the dimensions
and then expanding them again

1598
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:04,826
would be by virtue of

1599
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:08,329
you having this system which would just

1600
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:12,534
get through a variety of reasons,
be able to

1601
01:26:14,102 --> 01:26:17,272
generate intelligent
coupling with the world of a sensory

1602
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:21,509
motor variety,
but also run this same process

1603
01:26:21,876 --> 01:26:26,481
in an offline mode
so that you can imagine body simulation

1604
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,784
and that if you then

1605
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:33,254
so this the inactive inference, this

1606
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:37,392
the sensory motor processes

1607
01:26:37,392 --> 01:26:40,728
are understood
as these self realizing predictions

1608
01:26:40,995 --> 01:26:44,599
where you'll set these equilibrium points
and then this hierarchy will just

1609
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:46,434
sort of reconfigure and unfold.

1610
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:50,171
And as it's jostling around and passing

1611
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:54,442
this implicit prediction prediction
regard it just dynamically or just it'll

1612
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:57,812
but by Hamilton's
principle, this action as as like

1613
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:03,184
water flowing downhill, it'll find this
minimal state of minimal prediction error

1614
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:06,354
that ultimately cache on reflex
arcs in the world

1615
01:27:06,754 --> 01:27:10,358
but for thought to be
the virtualization of that.

1616
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:12,093
So you're imagining part of reaching out.

1617
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:15,697
So you have this construct and system
in this virtual reality system.

1618
01:27:16,364 --> 01:27:21,836
And then if there's a reliable patterns
of coherent state transitions

1619
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:25,273
that I'm likely to do
in different circumstances, well, now I'm

1620
01:27:25,273 --> 01:27:28,910
starting to get like an agent model
of myself, of the roots of a kind.

1621
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:33,982
And you're showing it
if there's a reliable set of policies

1622
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:36,484
that will happen
in different circumstances, like, OK,

1623
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:39,387
well it's self-reflective,
then it seems you're going to

1624
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:40,922
objectify the self somehow.

1625
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:44,826
And I'm thinking
this likely comes through mirroring

1626
01:27:45,193 --> 01:27:48,997
actually through relationships
between parents and children at first

1627
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:53,868
and that you're and where the parents
seem to be actually solicited in.

1628
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:55,870
Some people say
the mirroring is the name.

1629
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:59,374
I actually don't think it seems like
the parents help to solicit it,

1630
01:28:00,908 --> 01:28:03,244
but they mirror with you.

1631
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:04,612
So that you learn to mirror.

1632
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:06,014
And so that creates the learning
for them.

1633
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:08,349
But through this,

1634
01:28:08,549 --> 01:28:11,152
these games play between

1635
01:28:11,152 --> 01:28:13,021
caretaker and child

1636
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:17,091
you learn to get this mapping between
what's out there and what's here.

1637
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:20,128
Somewhere along the way, you'll learn

1638
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:23,531
to basically associate

1639
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,367
what other people are doing in any way.

1640
01:28:26,367 --> 01:28:29,470
Even like you learn just to mirror
with them, they're over there.

1641
01:28:29,904 --> 01:28:35,176
And then you see that and you trust
analogy to your own embodiment, your own.

1642
01:28:35,176 --> 01:28:37,512
You put yourself in the same pose,
the same situation,

1643
01:28:39,647 --> 01:28:43,217
and then this now gives you a basis
for a kind of objectified self.

1644
01:28:43,217 --> 01:28:47,322
But it's still always
from like this egocentric perspective.

1645
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,957
But now you're able to like
get this other person.

1646
01:28:49,957 --> 01:28:50,825
And I'm thinking that

1647
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:54,028
that's like this kind of interface
for like my Shannon model

1648
01:28:54,395 --> 01:28:59,233
would have to be like the, the, the docking point would be something like this,

1649
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:01,969
this third person

1650
01:29:01,969 --> 01:29:05,340
objectified selfhood,
which then would let you cash it out

1651
01:29:05,606 --> 01:29:10,411
or unpack it and embody cohere in a body
simulation, something like that.

1652
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:14,482
So one thought about

1653
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:16,617
like again set up and discriminators

1654
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:19,053
it seems like that

1655
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:24,392
that might be again crucial for

1656
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:28,429
both hard problems and a challenge.

1657
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:29,130
Your questions.

1658
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:30,031
I think

1659
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:32,900
there's this one

1660
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,603
thinker is this academic psychiatrist.

1661
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:40,208
Rucker did you plan on him having him on
Daniel or on you wrote this one paper.

1662
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:43,144
He's fantastic, actually.
I think it'll be a good idea.

1663
01:29:43,144 --> 01:29:47,181
So but it's this idea of like so a system

1664
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:50,051
basically

1665
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:54,389
he calls it like allostatic overload
in a collapse model

1666
01:29:54,756 --> 01:29:58,226
where basically through these systems
that have these functional bottlenecks,

1667
01:29:58,593 --> 01:30:01,295
these bottlenecks will tend to kind of
that are

1668
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:05,233
helping to establish the synchronization
manacle fill or a system

1669
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:08,302
that the coordination that these heavily

1670
01:30:08,302 --> 01:30:12,039
trafficked and contingent areas
will tend to fail.

1671
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:14,542
First, we stress the system too much.

1672
01:30:14,542 --> 01:30:15,676
And so

1673
01:30:15,777 --> 01:30:18,413
and this will give you like,
for instance, a kind of flexible

1674
01:30:18,846 --> 01:30:21,649
hierarchy
or other you're doing things maybe

1675
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:24,786
unconsciously, but just like fast
feedback loops of the environment,

1676
01:30:24,786 --> 01:30:26,954
you're not getting fancy,
you know, cooking the dead

1677
01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:31,926
or you're letting yourself build models
upon models, reflection upon reflection,

1678
01:30:32,293 --> 01:30:35,263
but that these more rarified things,
they'll fail first.

1679
01:30:35,763 --> 01:30:39,267
And so you got this like you can move up
and down in sophistication

1680
01:30:39,801 --> 01:30:42,437
but I'm wondering whether in terms of

1681
01:30:43,638 --> 01:30:46,340
and so this
would apply not just to all intelligent,

1682
01:30:46,474 --> 01:30:48,843
all interesting intelligent
systems is the claim

1683
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:53,514
but while you have this natural kind
of adjustment of your sophistication,

1684
01:30:53,848 --> 01:30:56,751
I'm wondering if it could be good
to have something

1685
01:30:57,185 --> 01:30:59,821
that preemptively anticipate this.

1686
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:03,791
So you're not just having reactive
regime collapses here.

1687
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:06,394
It's actually you can actually like,
you know, maybe not.

1688
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:10,331
Yeah, I could switch to an unconscious
berserker mode right now.

1689
01:31:10,698 --> 01:31:12,900
Maybe
I don't want to be in that position.

1690
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:17,305
And so if I can get something that's like
giving me a read on my degree of like

1691
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:22,276
stress of allostatic load of degree
of like how, how close my to the edge,

1692
01:31:23,377 --> 01:31:24,011
that can be a good thing.

1693
01:31:24,011 --> 01:31:27,281
And so for the brain,
this would appear to be largely

1694
01:31:27,682 --> 01:31:30,218
the interior cingulate
would be probably the main

1695
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:33,688
free energy or prediction area
integrator.

1696
01:31:33,688 --> 01:31:35,823
It's centrally located.

1697
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:39,694
It has like in every sense
it's like boom,

1698
01:31:40,561 --> 01:31:43,698
got the most connectivity
and it's just perfectly suited

1699
01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:46,400
to say like how
well are you doing in self evidencing?

1700
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:49,036
I'm wondering like within cells

1701
01:31:49,036 --> 01:31:51,272
if you have a similar kind of gan
like discriminator,

1702
01:31:52,006 --> 01:31:55,443
some sort of like inner metabolic cycle,
it like accumulates

1703
01:31:55,443 --> 01:31:59,080
and maybe like mitochondria
accumulating like radicals

1704
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:02,383
or like some sort of like gene expression
loop,

1705
01:32:02,383 --> 01:32:05,586
I don't know, but something like this
that's highly central that like

1706
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:08,689
when it starts to go,
this would then influence

1707
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:12,426
your policy selection, this would
then influence your orchestration.

1708
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,662
I don't know what
that would look like in a cell,

1709
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:16,564
but for the brain this appears to be

1710
01:32:17,732 --> 01:32:20,701
there's does appear
to be some fairly centralized structures

1711
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:24,805
literally that allow
for that kind of game like function.

1712
01:32:25,172 --> 01:32:28,676
And that is key to any
to basically intelligence agency

1713
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:31,479
and is also key for things
potentially like

1714
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:33,381
that.

1715
01:32:33,748 --> 01:32:35,283
I don't know if I believe this actually.

1716
01:32:35,283 --> 01:32:38,586
So Sam Gershman is argued
this is like reality monitoring

1717
01:32:38,586 --> 01:32:43,090
like a higher order thoughts sense
that I think something like that to work.

1718
01:32:43,291 --> 01:32:44,959
But the idea is that, you know,
how do I just think

1719
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:47,762
if I just imagine something
or if I actually experienced it

1720
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:49,630
and that there is some sort of
like gambling

1721
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:51,933
discriminator to treat the whole
frontal lobes like this

1722
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:55,937
and that that that's something else.

1723
01:32:55,937 --> 01:32:57,972
But it seems like this
though, can framework.

1724
01:32:57,972 --> 01:33:03,077
So this idea of discriminators
is extremely flexible, extremely powerful

1725
01:33:03,644 --> 01:33:06,681
and will apply across
a broad range of systems.

1726
01:33:07,114 --> 01:33:09,216
I think is actually really essential.

1727
01:33:09,216 --> 01:33:10,585
So yeah.

1728
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:13,487
Thanks, Adam.

1729
01:33:13,854 --> 01:33:17,191
To bring it back to act
and for the diamond polygraph

1730
01:33:17,792 --> 01:33:21,128
I kind of drew two
diamond shapes on my page.

1731
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:23,965
One was Person A and Person B

1732
01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:28,369
and their shared information on which
they're both looking at a whiteboard.

1733
01:33:28,369 --> 01:33:33,040
And so there's two people communicating
to the shared screen and unpacking.

1734
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,209
And that was something we talked about
with Chris Fields.

1735
01:33:35,643 --> 01:33:40,014
And then to relate it to this diachronic
through time and synchronic

1736
01:33:40,014 --> 01:33:44,652
at the same time, I kind of thought about
like a bow tie or two diamonds where

1737
01:33:44,652 --> 01:33:49,423
in the current moment is the agents now
and then there's the agent in the future

1738
01:33:49,657 --> 01:33:53,327
and a inferred trajectory point
and then also in the past.

1739
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:55,796
So we're sort of like retro acting.

1740
01:33:55,796 --> 01:33:58,399
We're now casting
and we're also predicting the future

1741
01:33:58,933 --> 01:34:02,703
and maybe the pathway through the past,
present future.

1742
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:06,641
It's like a narrative that helps
the organism make sense of where it

1743
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:07,541
is at that time.

1744
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:11,979
But any other points on diamonds or

1745
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:15,149
I think we can kind of go to the future
and give us

1746
01:34:16,384 --> 01:34:19,987
our closing thoughts and ask
you know, anyone who's watching

1747
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:23,591
live can add a thought
or we can go around here as well.

1748
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:28,496
What is the future of active inference
or a future or a direction

1749
01:34:29,063 --> 01:34:33,567
where do we see this fuels in the future,
ten years from now or some other time?

1750
01:34:33,567 --> 01:34:34,769
Point out,

1751
01:34:35,202 --> 01:34:38,205
will we be adapting active inference

1752
01:34:38,372 --> 01:34:40,675
to high level unsupervised learning?

1753
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,944
Will we emerge

1754
01:34:43,944 --> 01:34:45,980
with strong artificial intelligence?

1755
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:48,949
And where do we see embodied cognition

1756
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:51,585
scaling to our ability to

1757
01:34:58,292 --> 01:34:59,026
blue?

1758
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:01,295
And then Robert and then anyone else.

1759
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:04,832
Robert, why don't you go ahead?

1760
01:35:04,832 --> 01:35:06,333
Yeah. Yeah.

1761
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:09,036
Well, sure thinks so.

1762
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:12,506
Just my personal opinion,
it would be very interesting to see.

1763
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:15,342
And to what extent active in Friends

1764
01:35:18,212 --> 01:35:20,481
would or could move from.

1765
01:35:21,182 --> 01:35:23,584
I think now a lot of discussions
are kind of mechanistic.

1766
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:27,054
I mean complicated mechanisms
which are happening

1767
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:29,323
in the brain or in a cell or wherever.

1768
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:33,661
I would be very interested whether that

1769
01:35:33,661 --> 01:35:36,630
with active inference could be a way of

1770
01:35:38,232 --> 01:35:39,967
precisely speaking about norms.

1771
01:35:39,967 --> 01:35:43,871
Normativity, I think someone mentioned
at the very beginning about it

1772
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:47,508
said something about Normativity
what I mean with that

1773
01:35:47,508 --> 01:35:52,913
is that the distinction between
infer, inferring what is the case

1774
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:57,284
or focusing on what is the case,
what physical stuff is going on,

1775
01:35:57,818 --> 01:36:00,721
and what should go on in philosophy.

1776
01:36:00,721 --> 01:36:03,657
This is famous distinction
that one could not be derived from.

1777
01:36:03,657 --> 01:36:08,763
Data goes back to David Hume
the author from is It's a Problem.

1778
01:36:09,296 --> 01:36:12,099
And I was wondering
whether active inference could be

1779
01:36:13,334 --> 01:36:15,603
could be an interesting middle way here.

1780
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:17,805
And the second related thought is

1781
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:22,943
which has to do with
AI and reinforcement learning.

1782
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:27,047
We mentioned that in the very beginning.

1783
01:36:27,181 --> 01:36:30,384
The symptom seems to me to be good.

1784
01:36:31,252 --> 01:36:33,721
I mean, one could be very critical
and could say, well,

1785
01:36:35,256 --> 01:36:38,025
in some sense active inference,
that's very nice

1786
01:36:38,025 --> 01:36:40,694
and interesting
and one could do nice biology with it,

1787
01:36:41,896 --> 01:36:44,732
but it's not so obvious
what what the benefit

1788
01:36:44,732 --> 01:36:49,170
would be compared
to reinforcement paradigms.

1789
01:36:50,704 --> 01:36:54,341
And if one would be able to say

1790
01:36:54,341 --> 01:36:57,711
something reasonable
to this Normativity question,

1791
01:36:58,345 --> 01:37:01,081
then I think that's very
that would be a very big,

1792
01:37:02,016 --> 01:37:04,251
big plus point for friends.

1793
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:07,488
But that's why I hope
that I kind of see in the future

1794
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:10,324
book,
which goes more to the direction as well.

1795
01:37:11,592 --> 01:37:11,892
Thank you.

1796
01:37:11,892 --> 01:37:14,295
Robert Blue

1797
01:37:15,196 --> 01:37:17,031
so Robert,
just to kind of respond to that,

1798
01:37:17,031 --> 01:37:22,036
I don't know if you've seen the scaling
active inference paper that we looked at.

1799
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:25,105
It's it's been a while but

1800
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:28,309
yeah,
I remember who was the first author.

1801
01:37:28,309 --> 01:37:30,010
I forgot Alex. Chance.

1802
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:32,146
Oh, Alex. Yes, of course.

1803
01:37:32,146 --> 01:37:35,749
So but he definitely compared active
in France

1804
01:37:35,749 --> 01:37:39,186
and a computational paradigm
to reinforcement learning.

1805
01:37:39,486 --> 01:37:42,857
So I don't know if you've seen that work
and you know,

1806
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:46,727
in different testing different paradigms
the happened and the car

1807
01:37:46,727 --> 01:37:49,396
and the hills
and it was a nice picture anyway.

1808
01:37:50,664 --> 01:37:54,168
So where I would really like
to see active in inference in ten years,

1809
01:37:55,169 --> 01:37:58,672
I mean we talked about
how active inference is scale free

1810
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:00,841
a scale free model

1811
01:38:00,941 --> 01:38:03,444
so theoretically
it should also be multi scale.

1812
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:06,247
I think that there's a little bit

1813
01:38:06,447 --> 01:38:10,484
of a little bit of work to do
to get it to be multi scale.

1814
01:38:10,818 --> 01:38:14,388
So and I think that that work
definitely centers around emergence.

1815
01:38:14,688 --> 01:38:17,291
When does the next scale emerge?

1816
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:19,627
When does a collection of cells
become a tissue

1817
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:21,228
when does a collection of tissues.
