1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,259
hello and welcome

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,740
it's July 17 2023. we're here in active

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,799
inference math stream number 5.1 with

4
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,320
Chris Bodner on topological deep

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,980
learning graphs complexes and sheaves so

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,080
thank you for joining Chris looking

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,880
forward to your presentation and

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,859
discussion

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,320
yeah thanks thanks all for uh having me

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,960
so yeah as I was just saying

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,140
um this is um my my PhD pieces which

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,940
I've finished a couple of months ago

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,100
it's also kind of a public online so you

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,500
know if you want to go into the details

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,000
just kind of look this up on the

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,100
internet and uh you should be able to

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,559
find it easily uh obviously there's lots

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,899
of stuff in there so I kind of try to

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,140
give an overview uh today and maybe also

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,879
go in a little bit more detail in

21
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,500
certain aspects

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,059
um since there's you know not a lot of

23
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,460
time to go through everything

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,120
um

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,520
so yeah now I'm on my Microsoft research

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,260
so this is some basically all work that

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,420
I did in the past then when I was at the

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,220
University of Cambridge

29
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,439
um all right so let's let's get uh

30
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,659
started

31
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,420
um right so let's let's start very

32
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,740
easily

33
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,600
um now I'm actually not sure exactly

34
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,979
what's kind of the background of the

35
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,460
people who are watching uh but uh in

36
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,979
machine learning there's uh there's all

37
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,900
these kind of subfield that emerged a

38
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,520
few years ago which is called geometric

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,020
deep learning

40
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,680
um

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,780
which is essentially looking at how to

42
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,520
apply this kind of deep learning neural

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,340
network architectures on data living on

44
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,780
all sorts of

45
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,220
um

46
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,259
you know kind of structures or

47
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,500
geometries or or spaces if you want

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,420
um and this has a lot of applications

49
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,040
especially in the Life Sciences and

50
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,500
there's kind of been a lot of instances

51
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,960
of this in kind of you know very famous

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,880
Publications and all which you see here

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,100
but you know just to give some examples

54
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,140
for instance if you if you have proteins

55
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,299
or molecules or things like that they

56
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,759
usually represent it as graphs

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,560
um and you kind of have some data living

58
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,940
on these graphs like kind of the

59
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,979
properties of certain atoms and and so

60
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:11,940
on

61
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,400
um so so these kind of things

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,340
um and so far this kind of

63
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,120
um

64
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,220
species or this kind of problems

65
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,500
learning problems if you want they have

66
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,020
been approached mostly kind of with a

67
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,940
geometrical mindset as the kind of name

68
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,040
of the of the subfield

69
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,140
um also mentions

70
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,580
um but

71
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,040
um something that you know I would argue

72
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,379
is that geometry is not everything that

73
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,140
you need and there's kind of other

74
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,000
non-geometrical aspects when you are in

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,560
such a setting

76
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,099
um

77
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,040
and this is kind of quite obvious once

78
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,379
you realize that the spaces that kind of

79
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,300
show up in in the field and in many

80
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,700
applications uh they are very

81
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,980
heterogeneous so as I mentioned for

82
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,480
instance you could have graphs that you

83
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,739
know could represent anything in this

84
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,260
case it's the caffeine molecule that you

85
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,140
see here on the left and you want to you

86
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,580
know have some models that predict

87
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,319
certain properties of this molecule and

88
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,120
so on uh but for instance you can have

89
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,420
grits and we see grids all the time and

90
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,920
data living on grades and I'm referring

91
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,959
to images videos they are all kind of

92
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,720
you know pixels living on a grid

93
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,040
um and then you can have more

94
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,720
sophisticated things you could have some

95
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,080
meshes for instance uh they're all over

96
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,640
in computer graphics and then you could

97
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,220
have some sort of manifold so for

98
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,379
instance if you're doing maybe weather

99
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,200
modeling or something you you know we

100
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,739
live on a sphere topologically speaking

101
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,140
um so you might want to model your data

102
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,200
as living on a fear and and so on

103
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,000
um

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,580
but nonetheless uh even if these places

105
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,920
are kind of

106
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,120
geometrically kind of heterogeneous and

107
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,220
some of them not don't even have a

108
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,780
geometrical structure in kind of a

109
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,000
strict mathematical sense they all have

110
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,620
What's called the topological structure

111
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,239
which is kind of like kind of a weaker

112
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,239
kind of structure uh but it's it's kind

113
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,799
of more General

114
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,200
um and I'm going to talk a bit uh in a

115
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,120
few seconds about what that means but in

116
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,560
general you do kind of mathematical

117
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,480
physics you kind of have a ladder of

118
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,360
structures where kind of uh you know you

119
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,459
kind of keep building on top and the

120
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,959
more structure you have the more

121
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,940
sophisticated things you can do and so

122
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,680
on and you know at the basis of this

123
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,540
diagram just have sets it's just kind of

124
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,400
a collection of elements with no kind of

125
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,680
extra structure uh and then you kind of

126
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,460
keep going up in this uh leather and you

127
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,040
you add stop stop on top of sets and so

128
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,000
on

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,919
um and as I was saying kind of most of

130
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,660
the work is kind of focused on maybe the

131
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,000
top levels of this hierarchy but it's

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,759
kind of topological level it's a kind of

133
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,259
uh you know the weakest kind of level

134
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,080
you can add on top of that has kind of

135
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,780
been neglected to a large extent

136
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,460
um and part of what I've been doing in

137
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,940
my PhD thesis was essentially looking at

138
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,560
this kind of learning problems on these

139
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,300
kind of spaces from a more topological

140
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,759
perspective and you know kind of Fight

141
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,699
The Filling uh these blanks

142
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:07,860
um so this is kind of the overview and

143
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,620
now okay so if we are to adopt this

144
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,900
topological perspective what would that

145
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,699
actually mean or how would that look

146
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:15,780
like

147
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,280
um I guess it could look in different

148
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,500
ways but in what I've done in my faces

149
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,340
it looks kind of like this so we have

150
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,500
horizontally we kind of have a space

151
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,060
um that could be anything it's just kind

152
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,220
of an abstract space you know could be a

153
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,759
grid or things like we've seen uh in the

154
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,800
previous example and kind of vertically

155
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,020
attached to the regions of the space we

156
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,220
have data

157
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,600
um so data is kind of this vertical

158
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,180
component and you kind of see these uh

159
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,820
Flags kind of being you know kind of

160
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,919
anchored in these regions so that kind

161
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,199
of signifies you have some data that's

162
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,600
kind of associated with that region

163
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,160
um so that's kind of the high level

164
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,720
perspective

165
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,039
um and I'm going to make that a bit more

166
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,440
concrete a bit later

167
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,419
um and there's kind of two essential

168
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,220
things about this picture

169
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,840
uh first thing is locality so the data

170
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,380
is uh attached to some regions of this

171
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,320
space this topological space

172
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,539
um and and in that sense it's local so

173
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:16,979
it's kind of associated with the region

174
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:18,840
and maybe to give a concrete example if

175
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,600
you kind of have a temperature sensor

176
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,819
somewhere in space right you could think

177
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,639
of whatever that sensor is measuring is

178
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,960
kind of a property of kind of the

179
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,600
immediate surrounding of of you know

180
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,100
around that sensor so it's kind of

181
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,740
describing some property of of a region

182
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,120
in space

183
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,620
um so so that'll be kind of a good

184
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,940
example

185
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,520
um and another kind of Axiom uh that

186
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,580
that uh we're starting with is that

187
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,220
um the space has structure

188
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,259
um so the space has kind of it's kind of

189
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,360
made up of various regions and these

190
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,060
regions intersect in various ways

191
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,780
um

192
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,780
so the and and that implicitly also

193
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,400
makes our data structure because the

194
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,620
data is attached to these regions so so

195
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,539
there is kind of some some structure in

196
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,220
in the data

197
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,380
um all right so that's kind of the

198
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,060
picture and actually many of these

199
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,280
things relate to category Theory I'm not

200
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,860
gonna go in depth into this because it's

201
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,600
kind of sophisticated and I'm not an

202
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,060
expert myself in category Theory

203
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,400
um but kind of the the high level here

204
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,400
is that category theory is kind of a

205
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,699
nice way to uh translate between

206
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,340
different structure in mathematics and

207
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,720
kind of you know discuss about

208
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,880
properties of certain kinds of objects

209
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,380
and translate that to some different

210
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,479
kinds of objects and find all these kind

211
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,520
of relations and connections and a

212
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,259
concrete example is for instance if you

213
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,199
want to study some manifolds on surfaces

214
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,780
you could associate some groups to these

215
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,900
surfaces and then any sorts of relations

216
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,580
between this kind of surfaces also

217
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,139
translating some relations about these

218
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,580
groups or some other algebraic

219
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,560
structures so you could study these

220
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,300
manifolds by doing algebra instead of

221
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,400
doing you know geometry or topology or

222
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,840
something else

223
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,360
um so also in this case this kind of

224
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,740
manifests in the fact that we kind of

225
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,599
translate these

226
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,940
um from spaces to data so kind of

227
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,280
because we associate the regions in in a

228
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,440
space certain kinds of data this is kind

229
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,419
of how these translation manifests in in

230
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:16,740
what I've just described in the previous

231
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,419
picture so you could think of this as

232
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,400
some sort of translation or mapping from

233
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,000
from spaces and regions in that space to

234
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,460
kind of data attached to that space

235
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,860
um but yeah I'm not going to go in a lot

236
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,599
of detail into this but it's just kind

237
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,219
of to you know to keep in the back of

238
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:33,179
your mind

239
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,159
um that there's there's this stuff

240
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,200
lurking in the background

241
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,260
um all right so this is I I promise this

242
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,880
is the early math definition I'm giving

243
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,580
in this talk and then and then I'll stop

244
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,380
um but just because I'm mentioned in

245
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,959
topological space spaces quite often I

246
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,640
just wanted to kind of

247
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,339
um give this axiomatic definition

248
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,080
um which might sound sophisticated but I

249
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,519
have a picture at the end and hopefully

250
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,899
it'll be clear

251
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,200
um so yeah so what is it um so it's just

252
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,120
a set as I was saying we start with set

253
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,160
and we put stuff on top right so you

254
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,260
start with a set and then you also have

255
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,440
a collection of subsets of this set

256
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,360
um called the open sets that need to

257
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,920
satisfy a certain axioms so you could

258
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,360
think of these open settings kind of

259
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,279
regions of the space very informally

260
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,720
speaking

261
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,200
um so something that uh kind of has to

262
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,779
be satisfied is that well the empty set

263
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,880
and the set itself

264
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,880
um need to be open set so in in some

265
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,440
sense you could think of this as saying

266
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,959
the set itself is a region of that space

267
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,300
uh very informally

268
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,940
um which you know it's a kind of uh say

269
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,360
obvious and then there's some some

270
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,820
kind of constraints about intersecting

271
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,060
and taking units of this region so uh if

272
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,040
we take the intersection of two regions

273
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,540
we should get another one of these

274
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,920
regions

275
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,779
um and if we take a union of these

276
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,519
regions we should take we should get

277
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,200
another region

278
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,899
um and uh there is some constraints

279
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,760
again like okay how big this

280
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,680
intersection should be there should be

281
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,180
finite intersections but you could have

282
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,860
infinite unions but that's a

283
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,080
technicality and we can just skip

284
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,019
anyways but to see a picture so on the

285
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,500
left you just see the set X itself and

286
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,440
here I put like a potential neighborhood

287
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,180
structure kind of like open set

288
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,000
structure on this space so we have an

289
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,760
open set here another open set V by this

290
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,440
Axiom the intersections would also be an

291
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,480
open set so yes it is intersection in

292
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,399
the middle being another opposite and

293
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,080
then the set itself is another open set

294
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,580
so it's just kind of a splitting stuff

295
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,560
into regions kind of

296
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,959
um you could think of it like that

297
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,360
um all right so so this is this is a top

298
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,640
logical space

299
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,940
um and now let's add data right so we

300
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,519
we mentioned that we have data and then

301
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,320
we put we sorry we have a space and then

302
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,600
we add data on top uh so so far we've

303
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,339
seen how a topological space looks like

304
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,079
now let's add this kind of vertical

305
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,540
stuff these flags that you saw before we

306
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,399
we just put some data on top of these

307
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,720
regions

308
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,820
um and if we put data on all the regions

309
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,519
of the space on all the open sets

310
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,820
um we get these uh

311
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,100
structures that in categories here like

312
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,380
in algebraic topology also geometry they

313
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,240
are called pre-shapes

314
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,459
um which which sounds very fancy but all

315
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,100
it's just kind of a definition of uh

316
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,899
what I was already describing is

317
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,060
actually you have some data for each

318
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,459
region these these F of so for instance

319
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:34,200
for uh bridge and U you have this F of U

320
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,940
which is kind of the data attached to

321
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,279
region you so you can think of f of U

322
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,339
some some set with with describing the

323
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,220
data that lives there in that region

324
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,019
um but there's also an extra thing you

325
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,360
you have some some sort of maps going

326
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,140
between these kind of uh pieces of data

327
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,000
um and these are called restriction maps

328
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,800
and and why is that it's kind of they

329
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,459
provide you a way to uh kind of zoom in

330
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,440
if you want right like you have you have

331
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,620
the data attached to the whole set X and

332
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,180
then you could think okay how do I take

333
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,459
this data how do I go from this data to

334
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,760
data on a smaller region on on X so it's

335
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,760
kind of a way to zoom in on that data in

336
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,700
uh essentially and I'm going to show

337
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,700
some some example in a second so these

338
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,660
are called

339
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,980
um preaches and just to see an example

340
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,959
our space here is kind of one of the

341
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,279
simplest kind of space you could think

342
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,560
of just 1D or horizontal line right this

343
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,060
is the real line

344
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,740
um and then you have some regions which

345
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,680
are just given by open intervals uh on

346
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,360
on these uh

347
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,240
uh yeah on the Via line and then some

348
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,220
pieces of data could be functions like

349
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,740
continuous functions on on those regions

350
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,279
so here is like some sample data on on

351
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,139
this first interval here's another

352
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,360
function on the second interval here's

353
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,279
some data on this third interval and

354
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,899
actually in this case it happens that

355
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,279
all these

356
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,740
um functions agree on the overlap so

357
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,480
where these regions overlap they take

358
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,700
the same values and we can actually glue

359
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,339
them together on a single uh in a single

360
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,399
function over the entire region right so

361
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,040
so this is just an example of

362
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,019
um of a pre-shift and it's called the

363
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,360
pre-shift of continuous functions

364
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,800
um so our data in this case is

365
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,019
continuous functions and the space is

366
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,519
just the real line

367
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,200
um and we put these functions on top to

368
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,339
realign

369
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,019
um and but it turns out because of this

370
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,600
kind of special property uh that we can

371
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,880
kind of glue data and we uniquely get

372
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,980
some other piece of data right we we can

373
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,480
take these three pieces it's just

374
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,579
exactly like a like a puzzle right we

375
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,079
put this thing through things together

376
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,240
and we get a fourth thing which is kind

377
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,519
of a single function uh where we just

378
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,040
overlapped these these functions right

379
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,060
um and

380
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,019
uh these uh appreciates that satisfy

381
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:53,579
this kind of properties where you can

382
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,500
kind of glue them to get a unique piece

383
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,200
of data they are called sheaves

384
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,320
um and uh basically the pre-shift of

385
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,139
continuous functions is actually a shift

386
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:07,019
um so this is kind of a way to formalize

387
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,779
data attached to these things

388
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,700
um it's gonna get less technical in a

389
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,959
second

390
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,959
um so just to give more examples so for

391
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,700
instance in this way we could describe

392
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,639
data on a sphere and let's say if this

393
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,200
data is just some Vector field on this

394
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,000
here so let's see if this is earth right

395
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,399
this could be some wind Vector field

396
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,139
right like if we do weather modeling or

397
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,240
something you just have a vector field

398
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,959
describing the wind on on the surface of

399
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,339
Earth right

400
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:36,959
um and you might want to do some machine

401
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,000
learning on top of this where this kind

402
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,680
of vector field has a sheath structure

403
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,019
and you could think of it as a chief

404
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,880
because you know if you have like some

405
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,220
Vector field on the red region a vector

406
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,199
field on the yellow region I can kind of

407
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,480
glued them together uniquely if they

408
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,000
overlap if they agree on the overlap and

409
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,620
we get the vector field on this bigger

410
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,620
region but something that's quite nice

411
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,320
is that even if we have a very very

412
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
different kind of space namely a graph

413
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,060
which is very different from a sphere in

414
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,699
in all points of view and we can still

415
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,680
apply the exact same kind of axioms and

416
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,660
terminology and and kind of definitions

417
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,660
and we can have a shift over a graph so

418
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,000
in this way we could have for instance

419
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,279
some features Associated to the nodes of

420
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,560
the ground some features associated with

421
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,199
the edges of the graph and there's

422
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,320
another node which has its own features

423
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,399
and this is actually the exact same

424
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,680
thing we have in graph machine learning

425
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,420
um so this is quite nice for this kind

426
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,399
of topological perspective allows us to

427
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,519
do is you know we we kind of have a

428
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,680
unified way of thinking if you want

429
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,199
about very kind of heterogeneous spaces

430
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,839
and we can model on all of them data

431
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,399
attached to them by using this kind of

432
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,100
shift terminology and other ways as well

433
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,459
but I'm not going to that in this talk

434
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,899
um all right so this is kind of an

435
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,240
overview of what I've been doing in my

436
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,040
thesis

437
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,399
um and just to kind of dive a bit deeper

438
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,079
into this

439
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,600
um I just yeah I wanted to go in uh into

440
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,720
one paper that we did at Europe's uh

441
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,720
last year yeah so this was last year

442
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,480
um on uh what's called shift diffusion

443
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,600
so essentially how can we use what I've

444
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,060
just described to do some useful stuff

445
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,000
when doing machine learning on graphs

446
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,860
um all right and this was a

447
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,720
collaboration with Francisco de Giovanni

448
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,820
but in Chamberlain uh Pietro Leo my

449
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,300
advisor and Michael bronstein

450
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,300
um okay so before I dive into this I

451
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,740
just want to give some background in

452
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,620
case people are not familiar with this

453
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,959
um so the kind of

454
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,180
favorite architecture of people doing

455
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,579
machine learning on graphs these days

456
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,560
are these things called graph neural

457
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,820
networks

458
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,800
um which are actually very simple kind

459
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,959
of models so

460
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,139
in this setting you you have some

461
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:00,899
features so each node in your graph will

462
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:04,339
have some features this is what is h

463
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:07,559
Vector here denote so it's

464
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,160
um the vector H associated with node a

465
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,179
at layer or time D whatever so you have

466
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:16,799
some features for each of these nodes

467
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,280
and what you're doing each of if you are

468
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,140
at a certain note you want to kind of

469
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,359
compute a new representation or a new

470
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,459
new features for for this now that the

471
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:27,900
next layer

472
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,559
um

473
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,740
so since you're learning representations

474
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,780
um and what the graphene networks are

475
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,360
doing this node will receive a message

476
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
from all the other

477
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,179
nodes that our neighbors with this node

478
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,000
um and this these uh message can also be

479
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,280
passed you know can use on neural

480
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,860
networks in there but essentially some

481
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,600
processing of these features of the

482
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,539
neighbors and these are aggregated into

483
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,900
this message so here in in green

484
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,880
um and then there is this is passed

485
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,039
through some update function

486
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,539
um that combines the message from the

487
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,340
neighbors with the old representation of

488
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,960
this node and it gives you a new

489
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,000
representation kind of the next layer

490
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,260
um and this happens for all the nodes

491
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,400
right so then you get some new

492
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,020
representations for this node and this

493
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,580
is one layer and then you kind of keep

494
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,440
repeating this for as many layers as you

495
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,280
like

496
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,660
um so this is kind of how you do deep

497
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,760
learning on on graphs

498
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,100
um it's kind of a very very simple uh

499
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,160
recipe and most models actually vary in

500
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,320
the way they kind of compute these

501
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,480
messages messages and in the way these

502
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,820
update function is designed uh but

503
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,980
that's kind of the parameter is the most

504
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,500
of these models use otherwise they all

505
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,720
kind of respect this framework and work

506
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,120
in this kind of particular way

507
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,179
um and to give you maybe an example for

508
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,280
why you would want to do this

509
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,080
uh you might want to do note

510
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,700
classification this is kind of a classic

511
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,860
problem in graph machine learning there

512
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,179
are others but I'm just going to talk

513
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:57,000
about this because it's easier

514
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,059
um so you have a graph and this graph

515
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,919
um has nodes that have different labels

516
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,900
here there's just two kinds of labels

517
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,600
these orange and and blue

518
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,620
um

519
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,860
and you you have some edges between uh

520
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,840
these nodes and what you want is you

521
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,580
want to do this kind of a message

522
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,980
passing that I was describing to compute

523
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,600
some representations for these nodes

524
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,760
where you can easily classify you can

525
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,980
easily classify the blue and the orange

526
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,140
notes

527
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,580
um now something that's quite

528
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,700
interesting is that for many kind of

529
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,679
graph neural networks

530
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,460
um

531
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,440
depending on the properties of these

532
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,580
graphs and how these kind of different

533
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,860
nodes are connected their performance

534
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,900
might vary quite a lot

535
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,580
um so in particular they're affected by

536
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,400
this property called heterophili

537
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,620
um so this kind of a measure of how much

538
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,140
uh opposites attractive you want right

539
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,860
so uh it has a very simple formula

540
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,179
um basically you take the number of

541
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,280
edges between orange and blue notes and

542
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,080
you divide by the total number of edges

543
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,240
right so so basically you kind of check

544
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,160
how many connections we have in this

545
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,020
graph between things that are quite you

546
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,460
know they are opposite to each other

547
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,799
versus you know connections that are

548
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:10,200
between similar kind of nodes

549
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,179
um so if you have this kind of a lot of

550
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,039
these kind of heterogeneous connections

551
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,740
then you have very high heteropoly

552
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,120
um and it turns out that many Graphics

553
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,620
are not exactly struggle in that setting

554
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,740
it's very hard to to classify things in

555
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,059
that setting

556
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,100
um and iteratively you could kind of

557
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,160
also you know figure out why because you

558
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,320
know you you could easily apply to some

559
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,559
kind of reasoning where you know oh this

560
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,840
note looks a lot like these other node

561
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,760
is connected to so they kind of must be

562
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,440
in you know in the same Community if you

563
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,299
want or in the same label but it's much

564
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,799
harder to do that when you know all

565
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,900
things are kind of different from

566
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,580
um from each other

567
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,679
um and and this community is kind of

568
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,840
don't form right even visually if you if

569
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,520
you see a graph and it has a nicely

570
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,320
clustered communities you know it's

571
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,059
quite easy to draw a line between those

572
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,100
and say oh this is uh communities

573
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,559
another Community but if things are very

574
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:02,640
mixed

575
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,440
um then it's quite challenging and it

576
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,820
turns out it's also challenging for

577
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,799
these models uh not just for kind of our

578
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,960
intuition when when you know we would

579
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,460
have to do this

580
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,460
um so this is kind of some problem where

581
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,380
um this perspective this topological

582
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,320
perspective I was mentioning uh will be

583
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,679
used to to you know do some useful stuff

584
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:23,460
um

585
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,780
okay so coming back to toshibs on graph

586
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,640
um and at this point I think you can

587
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,380
largely forget what I mentioned in your

588
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,360
introduction uh or if there's something

589
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,179
give misunderstood there uh you know we

590
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:39,120
kind of start from zero bit here so

591
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,400
um there's no problem so

592
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,140
on the left

593
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,880
um you just have a graph

594
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,740
um which is kind of the incident

595
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,780
structure of a graph I just don't hear

596
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,880
the simplest possible graph that has two

597
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,520
nodes V and U and then there's an edge

598
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,320
between them so this is just a graph

599
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,940
with one Edge then that's all that's

600
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,580
going on here and I've just represented

601
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,380
it by kind of in this kind of incidence

602
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,260
structure kind of way right node V is

603
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,960
incident to node e and node uh sorry

604
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,620
Edge e and node U is incident to h e so

605
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,659
this is just an incident structure and

606
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:14,640
what is kind of triangle symbol we're

607
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,799
showing is just these incidence

608
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,419
structure is just the way to symbolize

609
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,820
this incidence relation if you want

610
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,559
um okay so this is just a graph right

611
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,200
and a way we can kind of think of of

612
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,960
fields on graphs is just mapping these

613
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,640
graph structures so this is kind of this

614
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,100
categorical Theory translation we

615
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,100
translate this graph into something else

616
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,140
which looks you know very similar the

617
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,640
structure is kind of the same it's just

618
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,620
kind of the meaning of these uh things

619
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,340
change so for each node V we have

620
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,980
um here this will be a vector space so F

621
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,440
of e is a vector space for each node

622
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,419
here we have F of U which is another

623
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:54,720
Vector space uh for each Edge e we have

624
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,840
this Fe which is another Vector space

625
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,059
um so all nodes have their own Vector

626
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,760
spaces and the features Associated to

627
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,860
those nodes leaving those Vector spaces

628
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,900
so basically for each node we have a

629
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,940
vector space of features that that's all

630
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,580
that's going on so far and also these

631
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,440
arrows that these incident relations

632
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,740
also translate into something and they

633
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,539
translate into the obvious thing linear

634
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:20,760
Maps so if these are vector spaces then

635
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,559
these things should be linear Maps or

636
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,659
just some matrices essentially right so

637
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,880
for each Arrow you see here we have a

638
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,140
matrix

639
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,820
and

640
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,919
um

641
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,340
uh see yeah and something uh that I'll

642
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,860
I'll argue and show in a few slides is

643
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,500
that basically message passing

644
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,580
um

645
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,220
uh is very similar on graphs it's very

646
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,559
similar with group actions in in group

647
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,880
Theory

648
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,640
um so let me explain exactly why so we

649
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,340
kind of can think of the what we have on

650
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,799
the left the these arrows in from the

651
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,600
incidence relation they could think of

652
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,820
these errors as kind of uh some patterns

653
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,280
we can press so what do I mean by that

654
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,880
so if we have this node V on the left

655
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,059
right and this e now if we have some

656
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,360
features some feature living in fov

657
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,700
right we could just kind of press this

658
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,880
arrow button here and then if we

659
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,880
multiply this matrix by this feature we

660
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,980
will get an edge feature

661
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,840
um so it's kind of like

662
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,179
um if you go along this Arrow this

663
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,220
Matrix will multiply this feature and

664
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,559
this vertex feature and it will give you

665
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,299
an edge feature

666
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:34,860
um so if you think of these arrows as

667
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,360
kind of giving you some sort of actions

668
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,100
that you can play with to move features

669
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,799
from vertex to Edge and and Edge to

670
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,840
vertex so in this case it's kind of a

671
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,340
left action right so this is what I'm

672
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,100
saying I'm taking this R which is uh

673
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,159
this one here and I act on some features

674
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,280
of node V so this HOV that lives here

675
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,600
right

676
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,299
um and how I do that is I just take this

677
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,640
Matrix this Matrix associated with this

678
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,960
arrow and I multiply this Vector HOV so

679
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,020
just Matrix times Vector that's all and

680
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,940
then we get an edge feature so this is

681
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,919
just kind of a way to to move from here

682
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:12,539
to here so this already kind of looks a

683
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:13,860
bit like message passing right we're

684
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,780
kind of passing a message from this

685
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,000
vertex to this Edge

686
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,860
um but now we also need to pass a

687
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,559
message from this Edge to these other

688
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,140
vertex used so we kind of you know we

689
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,419
need to get from V to U

690
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,100
um so and we did that by passing through

691
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,220
e so by doing that we could do that by

692
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,840
kind of going in reverse so we could

693
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,059
have a right accent

694
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:39,059
um where instead of applying this Matrix

695
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,580
we applied adjoint Matrix so it doesn't

696
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,940
the transpose Matrix so in instead if we

697
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,760
want to go from here to here

698
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,500
um instead of applying this Matrix we

699
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,880
apply its transpose because we want to

700
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,440
go the other way around

701
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,659
um so this is this is a if we compose

702
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:56,340
these things then we can move features

703
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,460
from V to U so this is just the way

704
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,400
uh that kind of we can apply these

705
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,580
actions uh to to do message passing and

706
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,140
these are called shift actions or

707
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,500
pre-shift actions and uh I'm gonna now

708
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,299
say what's kind of the relation with

709
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:14,940
between this and what we have in group

710
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,980
uh Theory

711
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,500
um so one way to

712
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,380
represent the group is by kind of having

713
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,299
some sort of graph

714
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:27,480
um like here on on the left so

715
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,080
uh we kind of have some star object it

716
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,840
is just kind of a dummy thing there uh

717
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,580
but all the group structure is in these

718
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,620
arrows right so for each group element

719
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,200
so let's say this G is a 90 degree

720
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,480
rotation for instance that that's uh

721
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,919
let's say we do have a group of

722
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,600
rotations that just to have some

723
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,900
concrete example these uh

724
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,940
so these Arrow could correspond to a 90

725
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,400
degree rotation we have another arrow

726
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,559
that does the opposite minus kind of 90

727
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,360
degree rotation that's the inverse of

728
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,919
that transformation

729
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,360
um so this is kind of the structure of

730
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,520
this group and if we have we also do

731
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,260
this kind of similar kind of translation

732
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,419
as we've just seen

733
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,279
um so basic basically we Define a

734
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:11,159
pre-shift on this group uh we map this

735
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,380
star to a vector space so the star kind

736
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,900
of replace is the vertex uh we had

737
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,760
before now we just have a single vertex

738
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,820
uh and it's just these arrows we have um

739
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,919
so the star is not this Vector space

740
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:25,860
that you showed here in in blue right

741
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,240
um and now if we actually do group

742
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,919
actions which are kind of a very well

743
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:31,440
established Concept in group Theory

744
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,100
um

745
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,980
well for instance if you want to act on

746
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,260
this vertex oh sorry not vertex on this

747
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,779
vector v right here you have a vector in

748
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:42,600
this Vector space and you want to act on

749
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,419
it by this group transformation G so

750
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,220
essentially you want to press this Arrow

751
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,919
so you you apply some action on it

752
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,320
um then what you do is well because of

753
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,779
this translation this G has been mapped

754
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,299
to some Matrix which is the rotation

755
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,460
Matrix the corresponding rotation Matrix

756
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,659
and you apply this rotation Matrix on V

757
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:06,120
and you get like a 90 degree rotation

758
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,260
here

759
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,120
um so this is what what's going on this

760
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,799
kind of vertical Vector is showing the

761
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,419
rotated Vector

762
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:13,080
um

763
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,000
so this is completely analogous with

764
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,760
what we've seen on the previous slide

765
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,640
um is uh this is how kind of chiefs

766
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,400
connect these kind of actions so

767
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,440
essentially what you could think of as

768
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,720
message passing is same as group actions

769
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,640
in group Theory but you just replace

770
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,159
this group with a graph so it's kind of

771
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,860
analogous to that right so uh it's just

772
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,299
kind of a different kind of translations

773
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,940
where we replace the object on the left

774
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,580
uh now it looks like this is a graph

775
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,919
this is a group right so but kind of the

776
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,440
rest stays exactly the same so

777
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,360
um you could and this kind of gives us a

778
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,520
way to formalize in a way by looking in

779
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,559
this topological perspective to connect

780
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,600
all these kind of symmetries and things

781
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,039
like that that have been explored quite

782
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,360
a lot in machine learning through

783
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,700
message passing on graphs and to see one

784
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,580
way in which in which they are related

785
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,460
um okay so now in my circuit this was

786
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,440
all very sophistically and nice but you

787
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,600
know what what is this going anywhere

788
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,860
basically

789
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,360
um and I'm just going to show you kind

790
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,480
of a very forward example there there's

791
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,360
more about you know the time is limited

792
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,940
um and something we we showed is that

793
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,340
uh as I was saying in the beginning many

794
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,960
graphene networks kind of struggle in

795
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,240
these heterophilic graphs and what we've

796
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,620
shown is that

797
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,779
um no matter how heterophilic or kind of

798
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:33,600
weird your your graph is uh you can

799
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,899
always kind of find some shift structure

800
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:38,700
essentially kind of a message passing

801
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,820
neural network that

802
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,279
if you use sufficient layers it will be

803
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,559
able to disentangle the classes of the

804
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,440
of the nodes right so just to show you

805
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,539
in this picture what you have here on

806
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,580
the very far left

807
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,980
um the colors of the notes they they

808
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,980
show the clasp so we have three there's

809
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,559
three colors here so three classes right

810
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,179
um and this is kind of the graph in the

811
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:05,399
beginning and the position of the nodes

812
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,679
in this box denotes the features so

813
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,940
that's a way to kind of just to

814
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,980
visualize the features

815
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,340
um the the position the 2D position is

816
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,440
actually the 2D feature Vector of each

817
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,399
node

818
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,419
um and you can see in the beginning

819
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,159
everything is kind of super messy and

820
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,380
entangled right like if you want to

821
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,240
classify these notes it's kind of very

822
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,919
hard because the representations the

823
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,140
initial representations are are very

824
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,899
messy and kind of uh intertwined

825
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:33,120
um but as we stack more layers of a

826
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,679
particular kind of key for a message

827
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,419
passing model

828
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:39,360
um you see how progressively these

829
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,399
classes get you know kind of more decent

830
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:42,440
angle and more

831
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,720
at each new layer and so that kind of

832
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,460
this representations kind of collapse

833
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,860
and they form this kind of clusterings

834
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,419
right and then when you get with

835
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:53,340
something like at the end you can kind

836
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,200
of see these three communities very

837
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,659
clearly and it's extremely easy to

838
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,159
separate

839
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:02,100
um and kind of the essence behind this

840
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,039
results was we we showed for different

841
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,980
kinds of problems what sorts of Chief or

842
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,020
message passing models you need by using

843
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,200
the theory to solve kind of problems and

844
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,880
um this is quite important because it

845
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,419
kind of shows you some important bits

846
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,820
and pieces in the architecture that you

847
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,919
might want to to kind of change or or

848
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:25,020
use in order to solve certain kinds of

849
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,120
problems and we also had some sort of

850
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,640
impossibility results so if you use a

851
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,620
graphing a network of some kind you

852
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,120
can't solve this problem or you'll

853
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,640
struggle to solve this problem and we

854
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,740
also saw okay if you use some more

855
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,960
general ones then you might have a

856
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,580
chance

857
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,279
so this is kind of some the you know

858
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,440
high level view behind

859
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,600
um these theoretical stuff

860
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,779
um and what we're actually doing in

861
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,399
practice

862
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:55,440
um is to essentially learn these message

863
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,779
passing functions or to learn the sheet

864
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:00,779
or these matrices so in in practice like

865
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:02,159
when someone gives you a node

866
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,799
classification tasks is very hard to

867
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,220
know beforehand what what exactly is the

868
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,480
right

869
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,279
um the right C for the right message

870
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,760
passing model uh to sort that task

871
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,919
um and what we do is actually we learn

872
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:19,260
that from data so we learned these

873
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,539
matrices that do the message passing we

874
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,399
learn them from data

875
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,980
um by passing some using some neural

876
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,860
networks which are shown here in red

877
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,980
um and and then you learn how to kind of

878
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,299
transfer features between these Vector

879
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,640
spaces and kind of move them around so

880
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,200
this is just showing how these vectors

881
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,899
which are features of these nodes and

882
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:41,580
edges how they kind of moved around by

883
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,260
depends going through the Via this

884
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,520
matrices just some Matrix

885
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,140
multiplications

886
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,980
um

887
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,620
and okay so so that's kind of a high

888
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,779
level here behind this model and we

889
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:53,279
evaluated this on some kind of real

890
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,580
world uh heterophilic data sets

891
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,640
um uh where you you have to classify

892
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,960
nodes based on kind of various

893
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,240
communities or different kinds of labels

894
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,480
and these data sets going from

895
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,120
um right to left they are getting more

896
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,919
heterophilic so in some sense more

897
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,019
challenging for classic architectures

898
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:15,179
and our models which are kind of

899
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:17,580
inspired by all this stuff the dimension

900
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,159
they score quite highly in in these

901
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,600
benchmarks

902
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,940
um and at the same time they also

903
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,179
revealed some or Justified some various

904
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,399
choices that other models in this space

905
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:31,500
have done but maybe they were not so

906
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,820
well Justified or maybe they had

907
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,980
different kind of motivations we also

908
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,159
managed to kind of show why various

909
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,019
things they were already doing why they

910
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,580
made sense from from the point of view

911
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,299
of this kind of uh Theory

912
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:48,840
um all right well that's it's all um all

913
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,860
I had

914
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,500
um yeah thanks for for listening and

915
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,779
yeah happy to chat more about this and

916
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:56,880
also have lots of backup slides in case

917
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,580
you know uh depending on how far away

918
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,960
you can Venture offer with these

919
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,080
questions

920
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,740
oh well awesome work thank you for the

921
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,820
presentation

922
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,800
for people who are in the live chat they

923
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,379
can write some questions but there's

924
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,379
many things I think we could talk about

925
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:18,359
so I want to start with reading a quote

926
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:22,619
from an abstract of the paper by

927
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:25,320
uh vanderlar kudal and DeVries just to

928
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,520
kind of ground this in the active

929
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,800
inference context and and really justify

930
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,918
why the message passing approaches that

931
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,500
you are describing are helping in the

932
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,418
active inference modeling so the paper

933
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:38,159
it's two papers it's called realizing

934
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,679
synthetic active inference agents and

935
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,440
they wrote with a full message passing

936
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,480
account of synthetic active inference

937
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,659
agents it becomes possible to derive and

938
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:51,899
reuse message updates across models and

939
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:53,940
move closer to Industrial applications

940
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,540
of synthetic active inference framework

941
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,300
so how does knowing the message passing

942
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,040
structure

943
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,740
help reuse a model across different

944
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,540
settings or like facilitate the

945
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,020
legibility of the model

946
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,619
right um so first of all I'm not super

947
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:14,880
familiar with the kind of active

948
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,619
inference literature

949
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:17,640
um so

950
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,500
you know you'll have to help me there a

951
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,380
bit in in for for to Anchor maybe the

952
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,420
discussions a bit more into that

953
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,520
um but I think if I understand correctly

954
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,099
the the kind of question uh you're

955
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,079
you're getting at is basically how how

956
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,200
can kind of message passing help us

957
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,940
generalize you know in kind of various

958
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,920
kinds of settings or maybe you know from

959
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,260
one graph to another and and things like

960
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,820
that and

961
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,339
um these these isn't kind of active area

962
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:46,140
of of research how exactly this

963
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,060
generalization is happening

964
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,859
um but something you could notice where

965
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:51,660
is something that

966
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,060
um for instance was shown like these

967
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,320
models are quite good at for instance

968
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,200
plotting patterns or structures uh

969
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,520
depending on how exactly you implement

970
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,619
them but for instance uh you know let's

971
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,839
say you have a triangle in your graph or

972
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,880
you know that'll be kind of a simple

973
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,040
structure right you you have a triangle

974
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,140
or some other kind of kind of Gadgets in

975
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,640
your in your graph like particular

976
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,160
subgraphs right that might show up in in

977
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,859
different kinds of uh you know various

978
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,480
graphs the graphs themselves might look

979
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,119
completely different from each other but

980
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,240
these kind of patterns might kind of be

981
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,440
re-emerging in multiple like local

982
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,599
patterns like three emerging multiple

983
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,700
graphs and that could help your way to

984
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,200
kind of generalize right like you could

985
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,119
see for instance if you have clicks

986
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,220
they're super important and kind of when

987
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,380
you do social network modeling and

988
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,940
things like that because they kind of

989
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,560
show this kind of um you know close

990
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,180
group of friends right they all talk to

991
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,160
each other so they can form a click like

992
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,540
everyone's connected to each other right

993
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,520
and then you you might be able to use

994
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,320
that in general if another completely

995
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,599
different social context

996
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,280
um where you know the these agents are

997
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,960
again kind of communicating in a similar

998
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,880
manner or connected in a similar manner

999
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,520
even if the kind of overall pattern is

1000
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,960
quite different

1001
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,420
um and it goes Way Beyond just kind of

1002
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,520
structural similarities because there's

1003
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,500
also features in there so there's

1004
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,420
combinations of kind of structural

1005
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,760
patterns and features that you know give

1006
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,740
your even more complicated patterns

1007
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,140
right like you might have a triangle but

1008
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:19,140
then also two of the features in this

1009
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,420
triangle are you know look in a certain

1010
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,000
way and one that looks in another way so

1011
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,380
so that gives you even more kind of

1012
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,900
refinement then and uh you know even

1013
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,599
kind of richer pattern detection

1014
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,099
abilities

1015
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:35,040
um so so you have essentially this you

1016
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,140
know ability to kind of spot spot

1017
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,599
patterns at multiple scales as well so

1018
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,339
you could see this happening at in

1019
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:42,960
multiple skills you could have patterns

1020
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,480
of patterns right you could have uh

1021
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,220
Community entire communities connected

1022
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,560
in various patterns and so on

1023
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,480
um and again it's kind of also research

1024
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,099
question how do you capture these

1025
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:55,619
hierarchical patterns and so on

1026
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,119
um you know in general you have to do

1027
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,680
more message passing if you want to

1028
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,260
capture things that are further away

1029
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,820
from each other because otherwise they

1030
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,740
can't talk to each other right

1031
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,420
um so yeah I don't know if that that

1032
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,940
actually answered your question or if I

1033
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,380
was kind of going in the right direction

1034
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,460
there

1035
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,200
oh it's great it brings up a lot of

1036
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,700
different cool ideas like like this

1037
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,400
patterns all the way down but totally

1038
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,500
agree I I think we can now

1039
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,480
perhaps explore some more specific

1040
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,839
connections to active inference because

1041
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,220
hopefully the the

1042
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,140
um listenership or viewership of this

1043
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,760
it's kind of like a two-way street like

1044
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,980
some people may be coming from more of

1045
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,079
your background and then learning about

1046
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,820
active inference and generative models

1047
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,740
as a specific system of Interest the

1048
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,780
first time but also certainly for a lot

1049
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,400
of people in the active inference space

1050
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,520
like these methods coming from category

1051
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,380
Theory have only recently come up

1052
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,140
to I guess more prominence in Bayesian

1053
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,960
modeling at least where we are so it's

1054
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,040
kind of it's a cool connection making

1055
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,820
yeah um I think one of the biggest touch

1056
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,099
points off the bat was like you

1057
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:03,900
mentioned multiplying a matrix by a

1058
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,880
vector and interpreting that as an edge

1059
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,180
so just in the in the inference part of

1060
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,760
the generative model of about sensory

1061
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,920
observations we always talk about the

1062
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,839
thermometer observation and then the

1063
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,599
underlying hidden State temperature

1064
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:22,040
so that like exactly describes that case

1065
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,500
and that's why we can represent the

1066
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,180
active inference generative models the

1067
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,339
perceptual parts and the action Parts in

1068
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:31,920
terms of matrix multiplication it's why

1069
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,040
the Matlab code for generative models

1070
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,740
does look mostly like matrix

1071
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,260
multiplication and it can all be done

1072
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,060
explicitly that way so

1073
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,280
how does that feed like are there models

1074
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,260
that don't have this feature

1075
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,859
or what do we gain by having like all of

1076
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:56,040
our edges defined as

1077
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,099
um appreciative action with a matrix and

1078
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:00,420
a vector

1079
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,700
in this setting of agent generative

1080
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,339
models with perception and action

1081
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:08,460
like once yeah yeah any thoughts on that

1082
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,099
yeah I think

1083
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:13,200
essentially kind of the the graph

1084
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,960
structure is kind of telling you these

1085
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,260
things interacting in some way right so

1086
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,180
um there there's some communication

1087
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,359
between these vertices if you you know

1088
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:25,920
if we're kind of in a graph setting

1089
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,820
right

1090
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,800
um and then kind of what the Sheikh is

1091
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,320
giving you or or any message passive

1092
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,240
model essentially is is expressing a way

1093
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,280
that in which way that connection should

1094
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,099
manifest in the model or in what way

1095
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:42,720
that connection should be used to

1096
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,700
process information

1097
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,680
um so in this case I was mentioning okay

1098
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,160
we you have like linear Maps because you

1099
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,900
could go on the type if your type of

1100
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,460
data or vector spaces then this

1101
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,660
transformation will be some sort of

1102
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,160
linear Maps

1103
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,760
um

1104
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,520
but it doesn't necessarily have to be so

1105
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,200
for instance it could go to any

1106
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,000
nonlinear transformation right like if

1107
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,500
and this is what's happening in general

1108
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,060
in practice

1109
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,500
um you know if you if you have a

1110
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,240
neighbor the message coming from that

1111
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,119
neighbor could be modulated by any sort

1112
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:14,460
of transformation you you want so it

1113
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,020
could be linear it could be non-linear

1114
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,099
it could be

1115
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,420
something I don't know you you can

1116
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:23,640
specify it basically uh but essentially

1117
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,500
you could think of this as

1118
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,540
you have a structure level telling you

1119
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,180
who should communicate to whom

1120
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,380
um and then you kind of have some

1121
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,180
semantics that is kind of shift is

1122
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,480
adding on top uh saying how should these

1123
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,339
things communicate right like the first

1124
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:41,160
thing is uh who should communicate or

1125
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,380
what should communicate and and then the

1126
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,540
semantics we had on top essentially

1127
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,880
describe uh how should that

1128
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,839
communication uh manifest uh essentially

1129
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,119
very cool I think that Maps like exactly

1130
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,040
to how we talk about the sparsity of

1131
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,740
variables in degenerative model

1132
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:05,099
so here the topology of the nodes in the

1133
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:06,660
graph that we want to do message passing

1134
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,880
on are going to be describing like the

1135
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,220
agent and the environment or like the

1136
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,660
generative model that includes

1137
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,300
perception cognition and action it's a

1138
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,060
lot of people have proposed different

1139
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,579
sparsity architectures for integrated

1140
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,940
modeling of perception cognition action

1141
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,760
so one example would just be like kind

1142
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,800
of Around the Clock like action

1143
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,420
influences environment environment

1144
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,400
influences perception back to cognition

1145
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,240
you could add a self Loop

1146
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,960
blanket and different kinds of

1147
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,180
connectivities and that defines the

1148
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,300
sparsity topologically which is where

1149
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,240
you showed the stack and and you were on

1150
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,220
the second and the third levels I think

1151
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,300
of the stack and then like What flows

1152
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,900
it has to be described how it actually

1153
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,380
what that edge does so what what is that

1154
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:03,000
what is that that is also being provided

1155
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,220
yeah yeah exactly and it could even go

1156
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,140
to the extreme where you know does that

1157
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,060
edge actually do anything so for

1158
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,839
instance if you uh have a matrix that's

1159
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:14,700
just the zero Matrix for instance

1160
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,040
Associated to that edge you're just

1161
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,839
going to multiply by zero or an item

1162
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:21,300
that gives you zero and it's kind of

1163
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,980
essentially pruning that edge right like

1164
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,020
I can't get rid of it I don't want that

1165
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,119
communication to happen but there's kind

1166
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,099
of there's also kind of this possibility

1167
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:30,900
where these kind of semantics they

1168
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,200
override the structural level where you

1169
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,720
say okay I don't need to communicate you

1170
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,880
know with this other agent person or

1171
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,200
whatever it depends on what this

1172
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,300
vertices actually mean and in what

1173
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,880
context in what context you are and then

1174
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,220
there's also the case where you could do

1175
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,859
some sort of selective pruning where

1176
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:52,680
um these Matrix depending on

1177
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,960
um so in in kind of linear algebra The

1178
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,900
Matrix has a kernel so it's uh all the

1179
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,940
stuff that that Matrix sense to zero so

1180
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,220
what vectors are sent to zero right but

1181
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,780
not everything will be sent to zero

1182
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,540
unless you're the zero Matrix

1183
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,160
so depending on the features of the

1184
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,680
neighbors you could also just send some

1185
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,480
of the neighbors to zero right and that

1186
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,400
kind of removes those Neighbors From the

1187
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,680
equation they just kind of get you know

1188
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,780
you you yeah they're not they're not

1189
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,240
factored in anymore so you kind of have

1190
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,280
this you know it's a way to get the

1191
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,900
sparsity I guess that that they were

1192
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,119
also talking about uh

1193
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,880
where you know certain only maybe a

1194
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,880
small subset of the inputs or kind of uh

1195
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,599
yeah only a a subset of the features are

1196
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,040
actually kind of doing some meaningful

1197
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,319
stuff among the neighbors and everything

1198
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,260
else will be kind of zeroed up

1199
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,720
yeah that makes me think of the lasso

1200
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,480
regression which tries to set most

1201
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,700
variables of having an impact of zero so

1202
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,160
that a few hopefully important variables

1203
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,260
really pop out in the analysis but also

1204
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,339
there's there's newer techniques I guess

1205
00:44:58,339 --> 00:45:02,280
of attention modeling and maybe waiting

1206
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,500
that isn't just like okay set five of

1207
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,420
them to one and then the rest and then

1208
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,819
the rest of them to zero like more

1209
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:12,060
nuanced um so I think that sparsity with

1210
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,540
the expressivity is basically the The

1211
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,160
Best of Both Worlds because you do want

1212
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,720
to have a situation where there is an

1213
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,339
edge but the attention being paid to it

1214
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:23,460
is zero so functionally

1215
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,980
that doesn't have an update on the

1216
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,480
belief State even though the in

1217
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,400
principle The Edge exists

1218
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,380
and that's why we can model situations

1219
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,540
where like the

1220
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,520
agent believes they have impact in the

1221
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,020
world but actually just because the edge

1222
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,119
in principle exists doesn't mean that it

1223
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,760
has any given impact and so that allows

1224
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,980
like the articulation of these models

1225
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,220
where they factorize and keeps

1226
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,579
interpretable motifs in terms of just

1227
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:52,260
Little clusters

1228
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:56,579
of uh motifs here in our case describing

1229
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:59,339
the action perception and cognition

1230
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,800
types of systems of interest but people

1231
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,260
I believe already implicitly do this

1232
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,720
um like they will often add an adjective

1233
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,480
and refer to X kind of active inference

1234
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,220
so like deep active inference with a

1235
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,020
temporal Horizon sophisticated active

1236
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,119
inference with this kind of nesting

1237
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,700
and those are pointing to a given

1238
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,740
feature but of course those features

1239
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,460
as we're hoping should be composable

1240
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,980
and so

1241
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,140
this seems to be bringing

1242
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,780
tools that are even more General than

1243
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,119
just action perception modeling

1244
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,980
because they're at a lower level of

1245
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,599
abstraction than like any specific

1246
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:39,859
system of interest but where this work

1247
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:42,780
and kind of Timeless thinking around

1248
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,240
cybernetic systems

1249
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,119
come together through the active inverse

1250
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:51,300
generative model as a base graph

1251
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,400
it gets very exciting

1252
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,800
yeah yeah and maybe it's also something

1253
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,260
we're emphasizing here is that even if

1254
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,660
this kind of semantic level can can get

1255
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,359
rid of some edges right by doing this

1256
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,119
kind of pruning something it cannot get

1257
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:09,420
rid of is the computation so something

1258
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,599
that kind of that

1259
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,000
structural graph level forces you to do

1260
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,619
it kind of tells you what should you

1261
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:19,440
spend compute time on right because like

1262
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,579
if

1263
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:22,859
even if you're going to decide to prune

1264
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:24,540
an edge you still need to decide that

1265
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:27,119
which you know takes compute time so you

1266
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,800
still need to look at all your neighbors

1267
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,560
if you are not right and and decide what

1268
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,180
to prove in or maybe you're done print

1269
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,980
anything or whatever but you have to

1270
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,619
look at every Edge and one way to look

1271
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:40,140
at this is uh the kind of the graph

1272
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,420
structure defines your computational

1273
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:46,740
graph or kind of a computational yeah a

1274
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,540
series of computational steps you have

1275
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,280
to execute and then the kind of the

1276
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,020
shift structure or the message passing

1277
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,119
model actually specifies what those

1278
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:56,160
steps are and you know in one particular

1279
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,859
way they they look exactly

1280
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:01,500
um and so yeah that's one point and yeah

1281
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,880
you also mentioned attention and

1282
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,780
actually

1283
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,520
yeah I'm glad you did because this is

1284
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,980
actually quite related and in in certain

1285
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,780
ways more General than attention and

1286
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,359
actually maybe going back to this slide

1287
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:14,880
it might be a nice way to

1288
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,200
um to see this so here basically what

1289
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,060
happens in attention

1290
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,680
um instead of learning these matrices

1291
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,260
that we learned here uh in attention you

1292
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,240
learn attention coefficients here so

1293
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,280
just learn a scalar that's the attention

1294
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,980
coefficient how much attention should I

1295
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,680
pay to essentially well you know this

1296
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,140
overall Edge let's say which will be

1297
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,240
just a scalar what we do is kind of a

1298
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,619
bit more complicated because you just

1299
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:43,140
learn how do I transform these neighbors

1300
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,880
so it's kind of a whole Matrix rather

1301
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,280
than a single scalar

1302
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,020
uh but there's also some subtle

1303
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,599
differences but in in a in a follow-up

1304
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,579
work we did we also combined this with

1305
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:56,339
with attention and and went a bit more

1306
00:48:56,339 --> 00:48:57,839
General and

1307
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,359
um that that also worked uh quite well

1308
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:03,000
but the kind of underlying idea is is

1309
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,760
very similar you want to modulate the

1310
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,339
way it transform information based on

1311
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:10,500
the information itself right so we have

1312
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,660
this kind of one level of

1313
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,760
um recursivity if you want or kind of

1314
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,579
yeah that we're also alluding to in that

1315
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,260
you know it happens in active inference

1316
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,800
where okay you're you're so if I'm not V

1317
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,020
right my neighbor you it has some

1318
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,780
features and based on these features

1319
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:30,780
which are XU I'm gonna find out the

1320
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,819
Matrix that will be used to process X

1321
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:34,740
here right so it's kind of very

1322
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,540
recursive and it's what happens with

1323
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,640
attention right based on the features of

1324
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,160
node U I'm gonna compute an attention

1325
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,619
coefficient that I'm going to apply to

1326
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:45,540
this feature over here right I'm gonna

1327
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,760
decide based on this feature how much

1328
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,800
attention should I pay to it

1329
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,540
um and here we decide how should I

1330
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:54,660
process it more generally uh in a linear

1331
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,859
way

1332
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,859
um so you have this kind of loopiness

1333
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:02,598
structure embedded in there

1334
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,920
awesome all

1335
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,420
bring up a few more points because I

1336
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,440
think there's there's so many great

1337
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,200
pieces so Toby

1338
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,119
Sinclair Smythe who we recently

1339
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:14,160
discussed his dissertation in live

1340
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,960
stream 54.

1341
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,099
introduced a term or Lisa phrasing the

1342
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,560
compositional cognitive cartography and

1343
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,540
so thinking about the compositionality

1344
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,000
of cognitive systems

1345
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,380
and I think what you're describing here

1346
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:33,660
with this notion that the mappings are

1347
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,940
more General than

1348
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,880
the kind of attention mechanisms known

1349
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,619
famously today that those represent like

1350
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:43,680
a lower dimensional special case of one

1351
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,420
kind of architecture

1352
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,099
makes me think about how

1353
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:50,040
the Bayesian graph is kind of semantic

1354
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,720
in principle

1355
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,460
and can have all of these nice

1356
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,760
categorical formalisms around them but

1357
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,960
then

1358
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,180
and and you can even build the connector

1359
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,579
to empirical data with the pre-shief and

1360
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:05,339
the Sheaf which may be news to even many

1361
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:07,920
empirical researchers doing data

1362
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,619
analysis certainly was for me but the

1363
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:13,500
message passing provides a rigorous

1364
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,020
translation from whatever semantic model

1365
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,660
is proposed topologically

1366
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,859
to an implementation procedure that can

1367
00:51:22,859 --> 00:51:25,319
be planned for

1368
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:27,960
and executed in linear time or at least

1369
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,819
with definable characteristics so

1370
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:32,040
message passing plays a really important

1371
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,440
part in going from like the abstract

1372
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,140
what is possible to the implementations

1373
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,900
of any of these actual models and it

1374
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,359
does it in a really General way where is

1375
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:44,880
it accurate to say that we hope that

1376
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,339
implementation

1377
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:49,559
with message passing compatible

1378
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:52,740
generative models will kind of roll out

1379
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,420
better

1380
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,280
because we won't have some of the

1381
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,160
engineering challenges that less

1382
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,859
reusable

1383
00:52:00,859 --> 00:52:04,819
abstractions might carry

1384
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:08,040
it's it's hard to say I think there

1385
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,839
there's also certainly some limitations

1386
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,940
to this paradigm

1387
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,640
as well so just kind of doing this kind

1388
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,040
of message passing things you were

1389
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,960
mentioning one thing is that it kind of

1390
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,720
scales up uh quite easily like linearly

1391
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,359
with the size of the graph but that also

1392
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:26,760
come at the cost so there is certain

1393
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,040
results showing this has limit in

1394
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,720
expressivity

1395
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,200
um so if you actually want to to

1396
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,619
go beyond this for instance you have to

1397
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:39,540
instead of just looking at pairs of

1398
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,300
nodes you have to look at tuples and and

1399
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,880
this kind of high order uh groupings of

1400
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,260
nodes

1401
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,900
um in in order to kind of get higher

1402
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,700
exclusivity there's all sorts of

1403
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,680
techniques to do that

1404
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,540
um but yeah and there's always this kind

1405
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,220
of tension between

1406
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,020
being more expressive and being

1407
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,359
efficient that you know will always be

1408
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:03,540
there in any sort of algorithm or or

1409
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,859
method

1410
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:05,520
um

1411
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,640
so so it's kind of hard to say I mean

1412
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,380
it's definitely we can definitely say

1413
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,180
this is kind of not the ultimate

1414
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,160
solution let's say if you want to do

1415
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,839
things message passing in itself you

1416
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,280
know but you know maybe doing some sort

1417
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,579
of computations on on on graphs you know

1418
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:23,540
could could be

1419
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:27,240
yeah maybe also something that that's

1420
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,500
kind of

1421
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,660
maybe missing a bit in in kind of the

1422
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,420
graph email setting is you know the

1423
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,420
context where you know your your graph

1424
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,559
is uh

1425
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:40,319
your assume your graph is known

1426
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:44,880
um and you know you need to have some

1427
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,680
graph structure at least the sensible

1428
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,960
way to construct it right but for for

1429
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,240
many kind of more

1430
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,260
um

1431
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,619
I don't know like

1432
00:53:54,619 --> 00:53:57,960
more obviously I phrase that

1433
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,420
um I guess for Less clearly the fine

1434
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,220
things like okay if I'm an agent doing

1435
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,780
perception in the real world or

1436
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,339
something right like

1437
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:07,740
if if I'm trying to create a graph of

1438
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,319
the world you know like

1439
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,599
um what's what's an object what do I

1440
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:14,880
create what what do I create a note for

1441
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,740
right if I want to have like one note or

1442
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,000
object and there's some connections

1443
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,559
between objects and things like that

1444
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:21,839
just I know it's like some some wild

1445
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,280
example

1446
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,020
um the custom item if you actually want

1447
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,760
to do that but let's say you want right

1448
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,099
then there's also like all these kind of

1449
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,559
blurry things like what's an object and

1450
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,119
what's not an object what's kind of

1451
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,220
somewhere in between maybe you know do

1452
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,319
you is that a node is that so it's kind

1453
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:39,059
of like I'm trying to say that the graph

1454
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:40,740
structure is kind of very discreet right

1455
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,540
like it's kind of the node is either

1456
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,220
there is not there and Edge is there

1457
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,020
it's not there but then the world is

1458
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,300
kind of really fuzzy right so if if you

1459
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,540
use graphs as a as a model for your

1460
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:54,300
world then there probably has to be some

1461
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,400
decision to be made somewhere about

1462
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,819
these kind of fuzzy Concepts uh they

1463
00:54:59,819 --> 00:55:01,740
actually translate in a concrete graph

1464
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,119
entity like an object an edge or

1465
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:06,180
whatever or not uh based on you know

1466
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,240
some kind of inference procedure

1467
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,640
um and I don't know if we did that or

1468
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,859
not it's kind of humorous as kind of as

1469
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:16,140
intelligent agents uh but that's you

1470
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,540
know kind of some some interesting thing

1471
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,400
to think about maybe you could also well

1472
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,260
maybe one way to solve that there's also

1473
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,940
kind of stuff like soft edges and things

1474
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:25,920
like that and in some way you know if

1475
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,079
you have attention coefficients it's a

1476
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,180
bit like that you know like if an edge

1477
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,599
has a weight of 0.001 or something it's

1478
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,579
almost like not being there but you know

1479
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:38,880
it's still kind of there so it's uh you

1480
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,800
know it's a bit of a soft graph

1481
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,800
architecture uh but so I guess at the

1482
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,119
edge level you can implement this

1483
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,339
softness but I think it's a bit harder

1484
00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:49,859
at kind of the note level right like uh

1485
00:55:49,859 --> 00:55:52,079
how do you kind of model a node that's

1486
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,640
kind of there and not there

1487
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,079
um yeah

1488
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:57,540
there's just some random thoughts

1489
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,000
that's very interesting about the fuzzy

1490
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,920
object identification and kind of

1491
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,420
similarities and differences between

1492
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:07,380
nodes and edges even though in some ways

1493
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,020
they have some similarities too

1494
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,059
um or interoperabilities to

1495
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:15,119
one other point of contact was like

1496
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,960
an underlying hidden space

1497
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,359
that we understand topologically that

1498
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,300
projects a vector space at

1499
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,940
in from different places so that could

1500
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,420
be a vector of thermometer readings

1501
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,119
and we want to have a smooth path within

1502
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,920
the homeostatic

1503
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,680
range defined up to a boundary Point not

1504
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,720
saying that that's the structure of the

1505
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,640
world but a structure of a very

1506
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,599
heuristic and simple model might be to

1507
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,540
aim for continuity and have a defined

1508
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,859
hid in the state space that has

1509
00:56:49,859 --> 00:56:51,839
continuity underneath

1510
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:55,619
and is able to emit vectors so that kind

1511
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:58,140
of brings some of these classifier type

1512
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:01,079
discussions that you brought up and like

1513
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:03,359
the kind of fundamental impossibility of

1514
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,940
geometric classification because you you

1515
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,440
are going to end up with gray zones

1516
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,380
whereas even if it takes a bit wise

1517
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,339
description you can separate the network

1518
00:57:13,339 --> 00:57:15,900
so that gives an actual completeness

1519
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,160
measure

1520
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,380
and that allows

1521
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,480
measures like I mean amount of

1522
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,400
computational resources or in a more

1523
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,900
like statistically principled way like

1524
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,119
the Bayesian information Criterion so

1525
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,800
how many nodes should we have

1526
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,839
we should be on some

1527
00:57:30,839 --> 00:57:33,599
trade-off front in some modeling space I

1528
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:34,800
don't know what to tell you it's a map

1529
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,020
not the territory and that's because

1530
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,500
that's more justifiable and so uh even

1531
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,240
lifelike organisms might want to self

1532
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,800
evidence

1533
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:48,119
staying emitting from a living state

1534
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:50,359
and so that provides a really simple

1535
00:57:50,359 --> 00:57:54,660
graphical architecture to cybernetic

1536
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,819
systems and then active inference

1537
00:57:56,819 --> 00:57:59,160
explores a lot of different more

1538
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,079
specific motifs

1539
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:04,380
within that broader blanket persistence

1540
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,680
picture and the path of least action so

1541
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,500
that's what enables the physics in that

1542
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,440
space and why these methods which as far

1543
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,300
as I understand are often used in

1544
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,880
quantum mechanics

1545
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,240
or being able to come together with

1546
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,460
active inference this way

1547
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:27,000
yeah um some something that comes to

1548
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,559
mind when you mention this I think

1549
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,780
there's also like a

1550
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,599
Recent avenir research in this area

1551
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,180
where people and it's again kind of

1552
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,220
generated by the fact that you don't

1553
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,740
know the graph before beforehand many

1554
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,599
times and I think kind of the old school

1555
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:45,299
approach was well you you construct it

1556
00:58:45,299 --> 00:58:47,099
based on some rules right like you

1557
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:49,500
you're gonna say all these I don't know

1558
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,480
some things are similar I'm going to put

1559
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,400
an edge between them and you define

1560
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,140
similarly in whatever where you like and

1561
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,160
so on

1562
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,740
um and there was this kind of recent

1563
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,480
Trend where what you try to do is kind

1564
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,119
of latent graph inference or some people

1565
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,099
call it manifold learning if you think

1566
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:07,440
of the graph as some sort of manifold

1567
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,000
but this kind of very informally

1568
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,859
speaking

1569
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:12,780
and essentially what you would do is

1570
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:15,299
like you would map whatever you try to

1571
00:59:15,299 --> 00:59:17,700
learn the raw observations

1572
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,579
um into some latent space and that's

1573
00:59:20,579 --> 00:59:21,960
where you actually construct the graph

1574
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,520
you construct the graph in the latent

1575
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,160
space rather than kind of in in the you

1576
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,740
know raw space so that might be kind of

1577
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:32,400
a way to deal with fuzziness as well

1578
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,099
right like because then I guess you

1579
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:36,839
might lose some

1580
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:38,460
some of these kind of very concrete

1581
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,079
one-to-one mappings because you might

1582
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,000
learn some note in the latent space that

1583
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,440
maybe corresponds to three or four

1584
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,559
Concepts kind of uh mixed together in

1585
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,319
you know so there's all these kind of

1586
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:52,319
nice uh experiments with neurons in the

1587
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,540
networks kind of visualized and you know

1588
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:57,059
they learn maybe a kind of a mixture of

1589
00:59:57,059 --> 00:59:59,220
Concepts like like if you see what

1590
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,380
actually uh you know activates that

1591
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,420
neuron is actually you know maybe a few

1592
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,339
classes or different kinds of things

1593
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:07,559
it's not necessarily a single thing

1594
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:08,339
um

1595
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:10,020
so it could be something very similar

1596
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:13,020
here where you have some very entangled

1597
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,180
um representations that are kind of

1598
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,819
distilled in in this latent graph and

1599
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:20,579
then in a way at least in concert stay

1600
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:22,319
even if like kind of in the latent space

1601
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,299
that's still like kind of a very you

1602
01:00:24,299 --> 01:00:26,940
know clear combinatorial structure with

1603
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:30,299
respect to kind of your raw observations

1604
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:33,780
um that that structure kind of can still

1605
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,220
kind of encode the fuzziness of the

1606
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,200
world to some degree because you have

1607
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,180
this kind of mixture of Concepts that

1608
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:42,299
got distilled in the same node or things

1609
01:00:42,299 --> 01:00:44,040
like that or maybe some Concepts could

1610
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,380
be represented by multiple nodes uh

1611
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,240
depending on you know in what you see

1612
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,680
this Concepts there might be all sorts

1613
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,839
of variations or concept or points of

1614
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,579
view and so on so

1615
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:55,260
um I think you know kind of latent graph

1616
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:58,140
inference could be uh you know quite an

1617
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,760
interesting way maybe to address some of

1618
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,079
these

1619
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:02,940
um issues where we were discussing

1620
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:05,579
although I think uh it kind of died off

1621
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:08,280
a bit in in the recent year at least as

1622
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,440
far as I've seen there were a few you

1623
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,900
know slightly fewer papers um on the

1624
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,099
topic

1625
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:15,839
hmm

1626
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,920
well certainly the agents

1627
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:21,119
proposed latent structure of the world

1628
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:23,099
the causal structure of the world is

1629
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:25,740
just map not territory and so it enables

1630
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:28,079
maybe some of those core screenings

1631
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:29,339
um could you go to the slide where there

1632
01:01:29,339 --> 01:01:31,140
was a mapping between a smooth sphere

1633
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:34,520
and then a regular geometric shape

1634
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,319
uh yeah

1635
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:39,119
let's see

1636
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,540
in this one yeah just wanted to make one

1637
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:45,480
one point see if you had any um comments

1638
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,460
at the heart of some of the

1639
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:49,799
relationships that you're describing and

1640
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:51,960
where you pulled back to and kind in

1641
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,299
terms of generalization helps us

1642
01:01:54,299 --> 01:01:55,980
understand

1643
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,440
this relationship between the the sphere

1644
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,780
and the geometry

1645
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:03,240
and one place that that and the

1646
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,460
implications for data processing and all

1647
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:09,059
of the computational science areas is if

1648
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:12,420
you are preserving or learning or

1649
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:15,599
analyzing geometry but not topology or

1650
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,819
the other way around you might get these

1651
01:02:17,819 --> 01:02:20,099
different like data set aberrations like

1652
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:21,660
you might have the topology of the

1653
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,880
coffee cup but it looks like something

1654
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,140
totally different

1655
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,180
and so what we would really want to do

1656
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,220
would be understand the relationship

1657
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:32,220
between geometry and topology

1658
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,079
because if we could understand it in

1659
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,400
principle like you have it on the left

1660
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,760
side and then in practice with the data

1661
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,520
scheme on the right side or or insert

1662
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,400
your own left and right side there

1663
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,359
then we'd be able to do data

1664
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:50,760
analysis in a way that respected slash

1665
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,680
preserved

1666
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,799
both the topology and the geometry so

1667
01:02:55,799 --> 01:02:57,960
it's like two compatible perspectives

1668
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,000
that have their different like strengths

1669
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,720
and weaknesses and heuristics and so

1670
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,780
understanding that relationship between

1671
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:09,059
geometry and topology

1672
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:11,579
and the implicit

1673
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,799
um spaces that geometry requires and so

1674
01:03:13,799 --> 01:03:17,460
on that has tremendous

1675
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,780
use

1676
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:21,359
and it just in closing reminds me of

1677
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:24,420
Buckminster Fuller's synergetics which

1678
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,460
uses a close packing

1679
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:29,160
architecture and a tetrahedron Centric

1680
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,319
model of coordinates

1681
01:03:31,319 --> 01:03:34,380
to find more continuity between surface

1682
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:37,260
area and volume and between the smooth

1683
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,180
surfaces and the great circles on them

1684
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,099
and like the points of connectivity on

1685
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:43,319
shapes so I think it's an incredibly

1686
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:46,559
deep area it really has fundamental

1687
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:49,319
impact inactive inference helps us think

1688
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:51,720
about our models in this way kind of

1689
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,599
like the inflated balloon and with the

1690
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:58,440
fuzziness and the architecture

1691
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,900
and the finiteness

1692
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,760
it really brings a lot to active

1693
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,619
inference and so I appreciate you

1694
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:06,780
sharing the work with us today and

1695
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,079
continuing to work in this way

1696
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,240
thanks out

1697
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,400
any last thoughts

1698
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,900
yeah I think

1699
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,540
um yeah what what you mentioned I think

1700
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:20,640
it's been all over my thesis this kind

1701
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,040
of tension between between topology and

1702
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,099
and geometry and maybe what I want to

1703
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:27,900
emphasize is that you know I'm not

1704
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,400
saying kind of the the previous

1705
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,260
perspective of looking maybe more

1706
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:32,880
geometrically of things was wrong in any

1707
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,760
way and on the contrary actually there's

1708
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,559
lots of interesting places where these

1709
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:39,000
things intersective and in kind of this

1710
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Chief uh paper I briefly went there like

1711
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,440
if you actually read the paper there's

1712
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,359
uh there's a lot of beautiful

1713
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,099
intersections actually my my main

1714
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:50,040
collaborative Francesco he he's a

1715
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,380
differential geometer so

1716
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,240
um he actually had lots of kind of

1717
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,119
inputs from from that side and

1718
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,040
um indeed I think you know we should try

1719
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:01,559
to use all these kind of layers of

1720
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:04,140
structure uh you know in the best way

1721
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:07,319
possible for our methods

1722
01:05:07,319 --> 01:05:10,260
awesome all right thank you until next

1723
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:13,579
time thanks for having me
